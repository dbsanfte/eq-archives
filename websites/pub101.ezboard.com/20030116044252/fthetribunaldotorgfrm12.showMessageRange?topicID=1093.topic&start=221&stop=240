I doubt very many people even remember the time when Thistleburr was the most loved and revered person on the server.. She most definitely holds nowhere NEAR the station she used to hold in server lore and in the public eye.. 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
HA you must be out of your mind, what a crock of shit this is. For the best of the best, which some claimed it was a popularity contest, how many Rifkinds/Xaverias/ or even revolution members were up there, compared to the people who metioned Thistleburr, Mojak, Crush. You dont hold a candle to the lowest level twink in EV and you never will.<br>
<br>
Trying to pretend that EV makes people evil or turns them from their public perception is only your ignorance showing through. Its getting sad really.<br>
<br>
As for Thistleburr's post, she did not in fact start the post out saying how she is the nicest person ever much like your ugly whore of a wife.  She didnt string together all the nice things she has done, basically what your wife did was what Romy did, but instead of screenshots of people saying how good she is, she decided to say it herself, so sad she couldnt even get others to say it.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the loot comment, you are so full of shit, find me some quotes asshole, cause you are lying and basically blowing shit out of your confused ass as usual. The only reason loot appears to be an issue is because you see it as an issue and it colors your perception.<br>
<br>
As for your tier system, pretending now like your plan actually came to true is more bullshit. You sat back, unlike what you said, you were no where close to tier1, 2, or 3 and waited till people stopped doing those zones so that you can claim that your master plan in fact worked. <br>
<br>
Basically you claimed that you were gonna take the first bus and fuck anyone who stopped ya from getting on, that you were not afraid, but the truth is, you fucking waited for the last bus of the day to avoid any fucking competition. We have all passed you up, and of course you can get get 1 and 2, epics were two expansions ago. You played the waiting game, that takes no talent, no heart, no desire, just shows how fucking lazy you are and pussy your guild is. You were too afraid to try to compete.<br>
<br>
Oh and I am still waiting for your chumps to put something up that actually has some substance to it. <br>

that statement alone is very telling.. and shows better than anything I can say the importance that loot holds for you. It was your original argument. It was your best attempt at finding something to hurt me. Unfortunately only YOU and your EV buddies would be bothered by that statement. <br>

quoted for the part about my wife..  Can I consider this a surrender ? .. I thought you were a good flamer.. an intelligent flamer.. etc..  That is just name calling.. no different than a mother joke..  I suppose you have SOMETHING to backup the statement of ugly and/or whore ?  of course you dont.. Thats just schoolyard namecalling which signals your defeat .. I suppose I could reciprocate and insult your mother or sister.. god knows you dont have a wife or GF for me to insult..  But I think being your mother or sister is insult enough so I will leave them alone.  Perhaps you should stick with flaming Estevan and/or Xavre if namecalling is all you can come up with.<br>

I can assure you that the SAVANNAH college of art is not renowned in the contemporary art world..  In my current job I work with some of the most prominent designers and faux artists in the southeast.. I dont see Savannah college on any of their Bio's either..  Here's a little advice.. When proclaiming something is one of the top X in the world.. Dont pick one based in friggin Savannah Georgia.. Thats a small, rural, factory town on the coast.. Its not even believable.<br>

I guess I can see why you have resorted to schoolyard name calling.. you have nothing else to offer since the LOOT thing was not getting to me.. <br>
you should definitely stick with calling my wife names.. <br>

I equate Darkmask with the play yard bully from Grade school.  The one that runs around after that one particular girl pulling her hair and pinching her.  The one that he secretly liked.<br>
<br>
Its ok DM.  I wont tell anyone.  /wink<br>
<br>
As for your &quot;no one coming here to stand by me&quot; comment....<br>
<br>
Many people read this board, very few post.  The amount of positive responses that I have recieved in game since you and I started dancing is phenomenal.  Even from people in your own guild.  There is a flip side to that comment DM.  I may not have people coming here to take up for me, but I sure dont see anyone coming here to join you in your personal attacks against me.  Only those that already post here.  And the best you have gotten out of them where I am concerned is yet some more play yard bully mentality.  You know, the smaller bully types that stand behind you shaking their fist yelling &quot;Yeah!&quot;  and &quot;You told her!!&quot;  I'm so crushed.<br>

I completely agree that the the Thistleburr of old has dropped off the face of Norrath, and I remember more than one post from Thistleburr about her good deeds.  Everyone aggreed with them back then.  I doubt they would now.<br>

Darkmask, your reaching.  It's obvious that Xav hates E/V, so take a different tact than trying to flame her for something she never said.

That was the most boring post I have ever seen you  make on the flameboard..  you were out of material two posts ago... <br>
<br>
<br>
hehe.. Comic Book Art..   ahhh.. thats the problem.. I tought you were talking about REAL art.. <br>
<br>
Raffica recruited on the trib board..   there was a link supplied.. <br>
<br>
No less than 4 other people confirmed that EV was sending wizards tells.. not just Revo Wizards..  all lvl 60 wizards ..  go read the thread again..  Are you really denying this anyways.. Hell.. you should choose your battles more wisely..  Look at how many new people are in your guild..  More than one EV has already conceeded that you were on a recruiting frenzy. &quot; there was a problem, we fixed it &quot; .&quot; we went from    0.5% of the server to 1%&quot; ..  This really isn't something you can deny Darkmask.. you dont choose your  battles very well at all..  Instead of denying it.. you should be justifying it.. <br>
<br>
and of course.. more schoolyard namecalling..  If you are one of the best that the flame board has to offer .. Then i understand why there were so many.. The Flameboard is Dead.. posts a while back..  you suck..  <br>
<br>
<br>
I liked Talamay's flameboard much better.. people would emphaticly argue their POINTS there..  This is just a namecalling board..  pretty lame.. <br>

For the love of God, everyone on this thread needs to find something new to talk about, you've all been rehashing the same 3 things (loot, recruitment, and Rifkind) for 15 pages.  And Ladmo, we all know how funny DM can be, but chiming in with &quot;u r teh funny guy (being sentient hurts my head)&quot; really isn't necessary after every single post.<br>

I also have a mother,  sister,  and two nieces you have not yet called a whore or slut..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the bottom line here.. plain and simple is.. <br>
<br>
The phrase &quot; Oh yeah.. well your wife is a fat slut &quot; ...     Is what comes shortly after you have LOST an argument,  and have run out of things to say.. <br>
<br>
<br>
You gave it a nice try Darkmask.. you just didn't choose your battles very wisely..  You had lost before you even started.. <br>
