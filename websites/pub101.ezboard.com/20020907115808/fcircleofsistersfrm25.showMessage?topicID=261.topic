She laughs a little.  &quot;Well, I suppose that does make a bit of sense.  No wonder I get along so well with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
She pauses for a moment in her shuffling as she begins to think of something that many of the girls did not know.  Well, there was her lengthy formal name, as opposed to the nickname that she went almost exclusively by now. And those many years spent working the bar in Tassle's Tavern...<br>
<br>
A lazy smile crosses her lips as she reflects upon her foundling years in Freeport.  Suppose that would do, she thought.<br>
<br>
Blue eyes twinkling with a glint of mischief, she looked around the room.  &quot;Did you know how I came by the nickname Nullo?&quot;  Several shrugs spurred her onward.  <br>
<br>
Laughing, she says, &quot;I used to work as a barmaid in Northern Freeport.  I wasn't raised there as Llylewen was, but I've spent enough of my life there to consider it my home.  As for my name...&quot;  She pauses to flash a big grin.  &quot;It was all the drunken humans could manage of my given name when they shouted for their drinks.&quot; <br>
<br>
Shaking her head, she continued.  &quot;Oh no, they couldn't manage a simple, 'Please Nullinea, may I have some more?'  It was always, 'Oi! Null...oh, pash me anudder stoutorwhat!'&quot;<br>
<br>
She finishes her shuffling and begins to deal out a fresh hand of cards.  &quot;And so I was forever named.&quot;<br>

Of course she can hear the conversation that drift in and out of the room.  As a Feir'dal her hearing was sharp and precise, of course some folks were louder in speech than others, but it could not be helped.  After all they were not elf-born.<br>
<br>
She puts down her books and thinks really hard and then drifts over to where the other Sisters are.  She sits down at the table Nullo and Llylewen occupy and puts her elbows on the table and rests her chin on her hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you all know, that I have no family?  I did not know my mother, or my father.  In fact, I have no knowledge of my birth or childhood.  My memories are only of the Heartwood Master taking me in and beginning my training.  He did not know where I came from or who I was either, only that Tunare had come to him in a dream, letting him know of my arrival.<br>
<br>
Many years now, I have questioned &quot;who am I&quot; and have found no answers.  There have been none, yet I am not saddened.  I have found a family and a home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eviah smiles brightly, her odd past not reflecting at all in her, and she stands up and moves back across the room and continues her studying and listening.<br>

Well, it was still a home to her, though she had forsaken the city around it.<br>
<br>
She sat down and watched Llylewen and Nullo playing cards.  When Mirabor spoke up and started her game, she wondered what she could tell people that they didn't already know.  After Eviah's story, she thought it was time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I figure it's about time to tell you why I hate Bertoxxolous so much.  My mother was a cleric of Erollisi.  She fell in love with a man who happened to be one of Bertoxxolous' shadowknights.  The Plaguebringer didn't like that one of his chosen would fall in love, especially with a cleric of the goddess of love, so he stripped him of his powers.<br>
<br>
&quot;My mother and her lover parted ways soon after.  But the loss of his powers drove him mad.  He came to Freeport one night, and, after having dinner with my mother and Dooly, he took her for a walk.  He found a dark alley somewhere in East Freeport and raped her.<br>
<br>
&quot;My father's powers were restored shortly thereafter, and he fought for Bertox until the god took his powers again, causing his death.  At least that's what Dooly told me.<br>
<br>
&quot;My mother had me, then fell into a deep depression.  Dooly says I'm the only thing that brought a smile to her face.  One day, she went out to the Commonlands to heal the young adventurers there, but the Deathfist had recently made new encampments closer to Freeport, and my mother stumbled upon them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaranna chokes up a bit and closes her eyes, then she looks up, and her eyes seem to be on fire.  &quot;Suffice it to say, my mother died.  I place blame on Bertoxxolous for her death.  And I will make him pay for killing her.  That is why I train so hard.  As soon as passage to the Plane of Disease is opened, I'll be there--alone if I have to--to take vengeance for my mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaranna leans back in her chair and her eyes seem to return to normal.  &quot;So.  Who's next?&quot; <p><P>Jaranna<BR>

She had been stumbling around Freeport for hours not being able to find her way. And of course like most Freeport citizens, noone whom she asked for directions would help. So her journey through Freeport consisted of feeling signs to see if they read for the guild hall. Finally she found them, and stepped into the guild hall for the first time.<br>
<br>
Her first reaction to the hall was of blankness. With no trees around all she saw was darkness. But she could hear. And she heard womens voices discussing things of a rather personal nature. After a brief silence she felt like she could speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello dear sisters-to-be. My name is Jelineth as some of you may know. Quite a few of you may know that I am blind, that I have no parents either for I was created from the dust by Karana himself. You may also know that I am part Dryad, which allows me to talk to trees so i can find my way around like a sighted person. However you combine that with part human, and it  makes one completly blind with no way to reverse it. You may also know that I have had a former life, though I have no recollection of what it is.<br>
<br>
&quot;However, something you may not know of me. Because I am part Dryad, I must take form of a tree for one hour during the day. I usually do this when I feel my magical powers are weak. But I am guessing with all the smart women here, that was probably figured out.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do know noone knows this of me. I was sent not to protect the animals. I was not sent here to protect the trees, though I do because I feel it when a tree is cut down. I was sent here as a bet betwen gods. One did not think someone blind could be an adventurer. Karana took up that bet and hence I am here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jelineth bowed away from those present, for while she was talking, she got turned around. Under her breath though someone may have heard her say. &quot;Stupid City planners. What good is a city without trees?&quot;<br>

<br>
 As she stepped through the mystical portal and into the hallway, she shrugged away the twinge of guilt she felt for not using the front door, for she knew all too well that her father would have chastised her to no end for such “unladylike” behavior, as he would have called it.<br>
<br>
She shrugged and thought to herself, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Bah, I get lost too easily. I have to bind myself in the guildhall, lest I wander the streets of Freeport forever trying to find the place!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Smiling to herself, she deposited her backpacks overflowing with the silk she had collected that afternoon and bounded gleefully down the stairs. She waved to everyone in the room and sat down by the bar as Mirabor and the others began to share their stories. When Jelineth had finished, Kivrin poured herself another drink and began to speak.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone why I chose Millefleurs as my surname. You see, I do not know who my parents are either, or whether they are alive or dead. I was found in the woods shortly after my birth by a High Elf named Eldric who raised me as his own. <br>
<br>
&quot;He taught me that beauty can be found everywhere, not only in nature but in the very objects made by all the races of Norrath. His most prized possession was a tapestry which hung in his library, woven of the finest silk and depicting a maiden standing in between a lion and a unicorn. <br>
<br>
“The tapestry was colored the most brilliant red you can possibly imagine, and the background depicted every single flower in Norrath known to exist at the time it was made. My father told me that tapestries such as the one he owned were known as 'Millefleurs tapestries' because of the thousands of flowers interwoven into the design as a whole. We used to play a game where we would sit in front of it and try to guess the names of all the different flowers portrayed. <br>
<br>
“My father disappeared one day, and so, when the time came for me to choose my surname, I wanted a name that would honor his memory. He had no surname of his own. He was simply known as Eldric, just as Jaranna is just Jaranna. I named myself Millefleurs after that tapestry, and as a way of keeping my father’s memory alive. I also like to think it appropriately reflects the profession I have chosen in life.”<br>
<br>
Kivrin finished her drink. With a loud sigh she continued. “Of course, I am to be married soon, and my surname will change. I miss my father terribly, but I am about to enter a new phase of my life. As the wife of Jorrick, I will take his name to show my love and devotion to him.”<br>
<br>
She wiped away the tears that had formed during her speech, and smiled. “Please continue with your stories, I do so love hearing other people’s stories!”<br>
<br>
Edit: Oops, Eldric was a High Elf, not a Wood Elf! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

&quot;As many of you know, I was raised in the Temple of Marr in Freeport. It was, for me, my first home, and I did not find peace after leaving it until I found our Sisterhood.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have only told a few of you, however, that I was not born in Freeport. In fact, I was born in the desert of Ro. When I was a child, I was found wandering its northern edges by a patrol of the Freeport Militia. They saved me from death by thirst and starvation, and not knowing what to do for me, they brought me to the Temple of Marr.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is why I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the Militia, whom so many of my order hate. To me, my first memories of the Militia are those strong, heroic guards that took me in out of the desert, and brought me to my home.&quot; <p>Nysa, Priestess of Erolissi<br>

There's always th wee nieces an nephews ta spoil.&quot;<br>

Mira sighs and looks around.

   &quot;Ahm, most of you know that Borm is me father. But I don't know if any o ya know how that came ta be. See when I was a little halfling, well.. little-er than I am now, I was bein carried ta Erudin ta be educated by th' Erudite scholars. But me party was ambushed by th gnolls O blackburrow an I was th only survivor.  That's when Borm happened by an found me. He raised me in Halas with a lot O Cyndl's help!&quot;<br>
