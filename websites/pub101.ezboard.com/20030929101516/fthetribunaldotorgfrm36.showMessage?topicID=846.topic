 <br>
<br>
<br>
Huddled over a fleet of abandoned Iraqi drones, U.S. weapons experts in Baghdad came to one conclusion: Despite the Bush administration's public assertions, these unmanned aerial vehicles weren't designed to dispense biological or chemical weapons.<br>
<br>
The evidence gathered this summer matched the dissenting views of Air Force intelligence analysts who argued in a national intelligence assessment of Iraq before the war that the remotely piloted planes were unarmed reconnaissance drones.<br>
<br>
In building its case for war, senior Bush administration officials had said Iraq's drones were intended to deliver unconventional weapons. Secretary of State Colin Powell even raised the alarming prospect that the pilotless aircraft could sneak into the United States to carry out poisonous attacks on American cities.<br>
<br>
The administration based its view on a Central Intelligence Agency finding that Iraq had renewed development of sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles - UAVs - capable of such attacks. The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency also supported this conclusion.<br>
<br>
While the hunt for suspected weapons of mass destruction - and the means to deliver them - continues, intelligence and defense officials said the CIA and DIA stand by their prewar assertions about Iraqi drone capabilities, some of which Powell highlighted in his Feb. 5 presentation to the U.N. Security Council.<br>
<br>
But the Air Force, which controls most of the American military's UAV fleet, didn't agree with that assessment from the beginning. And analysts at the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency said the Air Force view was widely accepted within their ranks as well.<br>
<br>
Instead, these analysts believed the drones posed no threat to Iraq's neighbors or the United States, officials in Washington and scientists involved in the weapons hunt in Iraq told The Associated Press.<br>
<br>
The official Air Force intelligence dissent is noted in the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's weapons programs, parts of which were declassified last month as the Bush administration tried to defend its case for war.<br>
<br>
&quot;We didn't see there was a very large chance they (UAVs) would be used to attack the continental United States,&quot; Bob Boyd, director of the Air Force Intelligence Analysis Agency, said in an AP interview. &quot;We didn't see them as a big threat to the homeland.&quot;<br>
<br>
Boyd also said there was little evidence to associate Iraq's UAVs with the country's suspected biological weapons program. Facilities weren't in the same location and the programs didn't use the same people.<br>
<br>
Instead, the Air Force believed Iraq's UAV programs were for reconnaissance, as are most American UAVs. Intelligence on the drones suggested they were not large enough to carry much more than a camera and a video recorder, Boyd said.<br>
<br>
Postwar evidence uncovered in July in Iraq supports those assessments, according to two U.S. government scientists assigned to the weapons hunt.<br>
<br>
&quot;We just looked at the UAVs and said, 'There's nothing here. There's no room to put anything in here,&quot;' one of the scientists said.<br>
<br>
The wingspan on drones that Iraqis showed journalists in March measured 24.5 feet and the aircraft were built like large, white model airplanes.<br>
<br>
The U.S. scientists, weapons experts who spoke on condition of anonymity, reached their conclusions after studying the small aircraft and interviewing Iraqi missile experts, system designers and Gen. Ibrahim Hussein Ismail, the Iraqi head of the military facility where the UAVs were designed. None of the Iraqis questioned are in U.S. custody.<br>
<br>
While the weapons hunters can't be sure they've recovered all of Iraq's UAVs, the evidence amassed so far, coupled with the interviews, has led them to believe that none of the drones are designed for unconventional weapons. Iraqis involved in the program have insisted the drones were for reconnaissance and electronic jamming.<br>
<br>
Some UAVs were kept north of Baghdad. Weapons hunters found some drones in better shape than others with the most important finds located at a facility in the capital, the U.S. scientists said. Weapons hunters hauled them back to their base on the outskirts of the Baghdad International Airport where the parts were analyzed.<br>
<br>
The unproven U.S. assertion regarding Iraq's UAV programs is one among many.<br>
<br>
American weapons hunters, like their U.N. counterparts, haven't reported finding any chemical, biological weapons or nuclear weapons in Iraq so far.<br>
<br>
The lack of success in uncovering unconventional weapons, after warnings that Iraq posed an immediate danger, has led critics and some former government analysts to suggest the administration exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam.<br>
<br>
Boyd said the Air Force's dissent was handled fairly, and that his analysts did not feel pressured to alter their position. &quot;Our view was fully aired in the process,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
The Bush administration has made public some of what led it to believe the UAVs were for biological or chemical weapons attacks.<br>
<br>
Before the war, U.S. intelligence agencies learned that officials with Iraq's UAV program tried to buy commercially available route-planning software that was packaged with electronic maps of the United States, according to the declassified portion of the National Intelligence Estimate.<br>
<br>
This discovery was interpreted by some analysts as a sign Iraq was trying to plan UAV bombing runs over the United States. But Boyd said Air Force analysts were unconvinced because maps are frequently bundled with such software.<br>
<br>
At the United Nations in February, Powell told the world Iraq had test-flown a UAV well beyond a 93-mile limit allowed under U.N. rules. But both reconnaissance and offensive aircraft would need to travel long distances, Boyd said.<br>
<br>
Compared to other agencies, Boyd said the Air Force relied more on information from reconnaissance satellites and less on defectors, in accessing Iraq's UAVs.<br>
<br>
Saddam's regime had experimented with remotely controlled jet aircraft modified for biological and chemical attacks before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, but U.N. inspectors found no evidence that program had been successful.<br>
<br>
Boyd said attempts in the mid-1990s by Saddam's regime to convert an L-29 jet trainer into a dispersal system were abandoned. U.S. weapons hunters also studied jet trainers found in northern Iraq but found no evidence they had been converted into biological or chemical weapons carriers, they said. <br>

Besides, if you remember correctly, he did start destroying the al-Samoud IIs and what did that get him? Less weapons to use against an invading force.<br>
<br>
As to his motivation, I still believe he wanted his people (and his neighbors) to believe he had WMD to deter attack. Power perceived is power achieved and in that country in his position... to seem weak would have meant overthrow at best, death at worst.<br>

Not to mention the Arab idea of saving face. Their customs and beliefs really are far differnt from our own. You can't use an American mindset to make sense of things in the Middle East imo.

The burden was upon him to accomodate us, not vice versa.  Weapons inspectors might have gathered intel?  Maybe so - better than being deposed, no?  Pride?  Maybe so - but I'm not going to cry because a dictator's personality flaw lead to his downfall.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't use an American mindset to make sense of things in the Middle East&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe not to fully understand or predict an Arab and how they think, but cultural differences do not allow for flouting of treaties, regardless.  Cultural differences may have partially resulted in this war, indirectly, by meaning that Saddam didn't want to give in to inspections, and thought we were bluffing.  However, I see two different ultimate goals here:  One is to avoid war at all costs.  The other is to ensure the security and prosperity of the USA.  No doubt we all agree that each are worthy goals for the US and its leader to pursue.  No doubt we would each differ as to which should be the most important...<br>
<br>
Oh, and Saddam was in no danger from anyone from letting inspectors in.  He might have refused access to save face, but he didn't do it to retain power.  His grasp on power was just dandy, and with Iran facing the trouble it is (and has been), nobody was going to attack him, except us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1576<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/25/03 9:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> What I think is far more interesting than any of this is Scott Ritter's <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/opinion/25RITT.html?ex=1062388800&amp;en=a2499018ca4a6a30&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE">opinion piece</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> in yesterday's New York Times.<br>

No &quot;I told you so!&quot;s from the pedophile. His language and accusations that were strong and hostile in previous speeches and articles are not present. The word &quot;Bush&quot; is mentioned only twice, and on neither occasion is he critical of that particular subject. <br>
<br>
Instead of all that which would gain him further praise from war opponents, he uses his one chance of a post-war Iraq analysis in the New York Times to provide the flimsy case about metal containers that we 'ignored'. The possibilities of what happened to that archive are endless, yet this is apparently the most important thing he believed he could talk about in the New York Times. He sprinkles in things like he's &quot;heard&quot; that the inspection process is &quot;not being done very well&quot;. And his bottom line is that while the WMD case expected next month &quot;may have merit&quot;, without this magical archive he's &quot;not sure&quot; how convincing it will be to the American public.<br>
<br>
Just seems odd to me is all, considering all of what he has done and said in the more recent past, that he now chooses to be extremely careful of what he says. It's like he knows some of what to expect or something.<br>

I think it's safe to say that nobody is mourning Saddams absence. I do believe that the US did everything to make peace impossible though. The inspectors were in Iraq just before the war and were reporting Iraqi co-operation if you remember correctly. Al- Samouds were being destroyed, despite the fact they only went further than allowed when not carrying a payload.<br>
<br>
I honestly believe that no matter what Saddam did, we would have gone to war anyway. The decision was made before the mobilization ever began.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>His grasp on power was just dandy, and with Iran facing the trouble it is (and has been), nobody was going to attack him, except us. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This is where we disagree. His army was decimated after Desert Storm and never recovered. His power after that was maintained through assumptions and bluffs, not military power. Baghdad fell far easier than anyone expected or even dreamed. The fact that even the US expected a much harder fight shows just how much his recent rule was based on false beliefs imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1496<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/25/03 11:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another reason given for war shot down</span><hr size=1> Just because his army wasn't capable of standing up to the U.S. military doesn't mean it wasn't enough to keep the rest of the region off his back.
