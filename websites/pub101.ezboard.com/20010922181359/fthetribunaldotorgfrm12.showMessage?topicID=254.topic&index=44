The majority of people on /both/ sides of the issue are just mindless drones that do nothing but suck up the shit that thier leaders feed them and don't take a single, original moment of thier time to think things through.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I think that stem-cell research has a ton of potential. I'm just unwilling to go against my principles. If it can be done without approaching aborted fetuses, great.<br>

He's so fucking happy.<br>
<br>
Personally I think it's a wonderful thing.  For a life so much filled with PAIN and MISERY, to give this kid a chance at a day of happiness on such a grand scale is a great thing.<br>
<br>
I'd assume that he chose to play HIS druid in ST.  I know if I was in his shoes I'd wanna use my own character that I worked hard on, and not some souped up uber thing that had none of &quot;me&quot; in it.<br>
<br>
For those of ya who wanna cleanse the gene pool and or save money by not helping those with problems, that's fine to have your own opinions.  Didn't cost you time or money for this child to have his fun in ST, though, and it doesn't affect your life in any way shape or form.<br>
<br>
I've met many people with &quot;problems.&quot;  I can safely say, also, that a much higher percentage of people playing this game have ailments than their actual percentage in the population of the world.  There's a very good chance that friend you have in EQ may have something &quot;Wrong&quot; with them physically, mentally, or socially.  Take care in what you say unless you are prepared to say it straight in the face of your closest friend, or even your siblings, should they have or develop some of the problems you are so intolerant of.<br>
<br>
One of my friends has a brother with Down's Syndrome.  Kindest, gentlest person I have EVER met.  Not a bad word to say about anyone and nothing but love in his heart for everyone he comes across.   Wrong him and he'll steer clear of you, that's about it.  World would be a better place if more people had the heart that he has, instead of the twisted shit some of us pull on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
Forrest Gump, my favorite movie of all time.  Book smart he wasn't, but he knew right from wrong, at least from a moral standpoint: a trusting, gentle, and caring individual.<br>
<br>
Kill the fucking drug dealers, drunk drivers (yeah, I think there should be the death penalty for this you fucking wastes of skin), rapists, murderers, child molestors, spousal abusers, deadbeat dads and moms, etc etc. in this country before you start talking about gene pool cleansing.

...and I'd be happy if my dick was an inch longer and my bank balance had an extra digit before the decimal.  Neither is going to happen anytime soon, so let's deal with reality.<br>
<br>
I don't care what was wrong with this kid, to be honest.  What is really stunning is, as I said above, everquest being the object of his desires.  <br>
<br>
Have we degraded to the point where life really is no longer worth living outside of our regularly scheduled programs and events?  Are the snow capped mountains of the Dreadlands more awe-inspiring than those in Tibet?  Forgive the fight club moment, but are we really defined by our fucking khakis?<br>
<br>
You know what REALLY would have impressed me?  If Verant had just let the kid go ahead and rape ST without the photo op.  I'm sure they did it out of kindness, but I can also bet that the next project pitch will contain an anicdote about this (We make games so compelling it's people's dying wish to play it!).<br>
<br>
anyway, I'm rambling.. moving on<br>

<br>
&quot;I thought it was funny when you said &quot;rapists should get the fucking chair&quot; in the same breath of spouting the &quot;pro-life&quot; pledge of allegiance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry if I might have said something that pro-lifers have said, but I'm not some freak that's against the death penalty. Kill the rapists, but don't make the child pay for the crime.<br>
<br>
&quot;I also love when these pro-lifers spout their religious garbage at us and tell us how to lead our lives, all the while blissfully ignorant that their religion has killed more people than abortion ever will.&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree that religion really has no place in the issue. The pro-life movement made a HUGE mistake by tangling themself up with Christianity so badly that they are now hopelessly tied. We could spend all day making biased and innacurrate statements about each others' religions, and turn this very personal.<br>
<br>
By making pro-life and Christianity synonymous, they have crippled thier movement. Now it's all too easy for those people that either are not Christian or have something against Christians to side with the pro-choice movement on no basis of thier principles. Fight the Christians, in any way possible. On the other hand, having an army of religious zealots (read &quot;idiots&quot;) on your side isn't exactly winning. Morons that are perfectly happy throwing things at people, bombing clinics, &quot;spouting religious garbage&quot;, and over-all hurting the real issue.<br>
<br>
I'm not pro-life, though by being anti-abortion I guess most would label me such.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to suggest abstinence. That's a religious choice and not appropriate for everyone. I WILL bring up protection though. Anyone that has sex without a condom in today's world is really asking for a world of hurt, pregnancy being the least worry. Are condoms not available free at all clinics? If an abortion is nearby, then so is prevention. This also applies to married couples. If they don't want a child, then the responsible choice is to wear a condom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stem cell research, why the fuck not, if the abortion is going to be done anyway then why the FUCK NOT make something beneficial come of it. Beneficial I mean other than having two people not having their lives ruined by being forced to become unwilling parents.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is what &quot;opened the door&quot; and I admit that I could have made my statement without the venom. I was in a bad mood, and took it out on the &quot;issue&quot;.<br>
<br>
Why the fuck not? That's like saying &quot;The nazis made some huge advances in science with thier experiments in the camps. How about continuing thier work?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Feel free to fire up the Adoption clause. Thats really realistic i hear. After all it only requires a full term pregnancy, delivery, doctor bills, maternity leave from your job and then having to actually give up the child after now that it is FULLY alive and not a fetus.&quot;<br>
<br>
Adoption is not the right choice for everyone. I am more in favor if prevention, as I stated earlier in this post. Unfortunately, not everyone has the choice not to get pregnant. Rape is what turned the tide for pro-choicers in Roe vs Wade. Too bad &quot;Roe&quot; was lying about being raped. In reality, she was just another &quot;teen in trouble&quot;. For those that are willing to have the child, great.<br>
<br>
Don't suggest that a fetus is not a wholly alive human being. That's just ignorant.<br>
