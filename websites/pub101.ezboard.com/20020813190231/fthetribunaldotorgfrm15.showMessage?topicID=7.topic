The trick is to pair the stone with a companion that it trusts enough to tell it's secrets to. Like so..,&quot; the tier'dal said, eyes focused intently on the mold in front of him. A small lift at the edge loosened the newly mounted ring from the mold. He carefully carved away any excess edges of metal from the stone and tossed it to the aspiring young enchanter in front of him.<br><br>&quot;It worked!&quot; exclaimed the young lady in front of him. <br><br>&quot;Yes, and it's your magic that did it. The enchantment on the metal used to form the ring gives an outlet to the dormant qualities within the stone. Careful, though. It's not as easy as it looks. You must be careful with your choice of metals as well as your choice of location. The magic of the jewelry is not the flashy magic of a Wizard. It reacts with the natural power centers within oneself. You could carry an earring in your hand all day and never receive a benefit from it, but once placed in the ear, interesting results could be attained.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I… think I have it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Think so, eh?&quot; the older tier'dal said. <br><br>&quot;May I try?&quot; the younger tier'dal asked.<br><br>&quot;As long as you concentrate on Silver for now, Xal'ishta, otherwise you'll just destroy a lot of expensive components. Make sure you have the hang of the enchantment before you worry too much about the physical crafting of the jewelry.<br><br>&quot;Eshand…&quot; the young one started as she arranged the components of her own modest jewelry making kit in front of her.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot; he replied stretching out on the shingles and looking out over the city at the glowing designs and sinister beauty of the Commons.<br><br>&quot;Why must we meet on the rooftops to do this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why not? The view from here is breathtaking. It's quiet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, if you do not wish to answer my-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I answered your question,&quot; he said putting his hands behind his head and looking into the great darkness above him.<br><br>&quot;If you insist.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Xala… must we have this conversation every time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. It is my right to know as-&quot;<br><br>&quot;As Tatra din'Sol?&quot; he interrupted with a sneer.<br><br>&quot;I never said that!&quot; she hissed. He flinched as a small bar of silver bounced off the tiles next to his head. He leapt to his knees and grabbed both of her wrists, pinning her down on her back.<br><br>&quot;Then what did you mean?&quot; he said, his face close above hers, a drop of sweat falling from the tip of his indigo nose. He didn't release his grip on her wrists or move his body from on top of hers.<br><br>&quot;I was going to say that it is my right to know… as your lover,&quot; she said through gritted teeth.<br>He rolled off her and sat up, putting his head in his hands. She sat up, brushing out the front of her robe, an indignant look on her face. They sat in silence a bit while she toyed with some of the items from her spilt jewelry kit.<br><br>&quot;Xala, I'm sorry-&quot;<br><br>&quot;How dare you accuse me…&quot; she said not looking up.<br><br>&quot;I said I'm sorry,&quot; he said, the smell of her still pleasant on his clothes. <br><br>&quot;I agreed to never assert my authority over you. I never have, yet you persist in holding this over my head. I ask a simple question that you sidestep each time. You should be sorry.&quot; He stood and sat behind her with his hands in her hair. He pulled her hair back behind her shoulders and stroked the soft white hair. <br><br>&quot;You are so young, Xala…&quot; he said into her ear, his chin on her shoulder.<br><br>&quot;I'm not a child, Eshand, I passed the age of choice two years ago,&quot; she said, continuing to work on the small silver chain in front of her.<br><br>&quot;One day I'll tell you everything, I promise,&quot; he said kissing her neck.<br><br>&quot;What do you think?&quot; she asked holding the silver chain up for him to see. He reached around her to take the chain and have a look at it.<br><br>&quot;It's exquisite… very nice,&quot; he said, &quot;this will make a fine necklace for a pendant.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look closer at the metal,&quot; she said leaning her head back to see his face.<br><br>&quot;How did you do this!?&quot; he exclaimed holding the necklace closer, eyeballing every detail of it.<br><br>&quot;I've been practicing!&quot; she said smiling.<br><br>&quot;This is amazing… I've never known anyone to craft platinum this soon. You are gifted, Xala.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's just something I'm making for you,&quot; she said coyly.<br><br>&quot;Gifted or not, there is no way you are going to be able to join a stone with it, love. That takes many many years of practice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Leave that to me,&quot; she said, snatching the chain and putting it away. &quot;Sneak me to your room. I have a few hours before I have to be back,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Tell you what… make yourself invisible and follow me in a few minutes. There are a couple of things I must see to right away. After that I'm all yours,&quot; he said standing and offering her his hand.<br><br>&quot;I'll be outside of the Blind Fish… the secrets make me nervous, Eshand.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not for much longer… just trust me,&quot; he said as he took off and jumped to the next roof.  <p><center><IMG SRC="http://www.visveres.com/sigs/sig28.jpg"><BR><FONT color="#A83AF7">S</FONT><FONT color="#8964E9">w</FONT><FONT color="#816FE5">e e</FONT><FONT color="#7D74E3">t . </FONT><FONT color="#7979E1">L</FONT><FONT color="#7184DE">o</FONT><FONT color="#6D89DC">v</FONT><FONT color="#6A8FDA">e</FONT><FONT color="#6694D8">l y . </FONT><FONT color="#6299D6">D</FONT><FONT color="#5E9ED5">e</FONT><FONT color="#56A9D1">a</FONT><FONT color="#5AA4CC">t</FONT><FONT color="#5D9FC7">h . </FONT><FONT color="#619AC2">I'm . </FONT><FONT color="#6595BD">W</FONT><FONT color="#6890B8">a</FONT><FONT color="#6C8AB4">i t</FONT><FONT color="#7085AF">i</FONT><FONT color="#7380AA">n</FONT><FONT color="#777BA5">g . </FONT><FONT color="#7B76A0">F</FONT><FONT color="#7E719B">o</FONT><FONT color="#826C96">r . </FONT><FONT color="#866791">Y o</FONT><FONT color="#89628C">u r . </FONT><FONT color="#915783">B r</FONT><FONT color="#94527E">e</FONT><FONT color="#984D79">a</FONT><FONT color="#9C4874">t h</FONT><BR><HR WIDTH=20%><FONT color="#9F436F">C</FONT><FONT color="#A33E6A">o</FONT><FONT color="#99507B">m e . </FONT><FONT color="#965680">S</FONT><FONT color="#935C86">w</FONT><FONT color="#90628B">e e</FONT><FONT color="#8D6891">t . </FONT><FONT color="#896E97">D</FONT><FONT color="#86749C">e a</FONT><FONT color="#8081A7">t</FONT><FONT color="#7D87AD">h . </FONT><FONT color="#7A8DB2">O</FONT><FONT color="#7693B8">n</FONT><FONT color="#7399BE">e . </FONT><FONT color="#6DA5C9">L</FONT><FONT color="#6AABCE">a</FONT><FONT color="#66B1D4">s</FONT><FONT color="#63B7D9">t . </FONT><FONT color="#67BAE0">C</FONT><FONT color="#6FB8E1">a</FONT><FONT color="#76B5E2">r</FONT><FONT color="#7EB3E3">r</FONT><FONT color="#85B0E4">e</FONT><FONT color="#8DADE5">s</FONT><FONT color="#94ABE6">s</FONT><BR><A HREF="http://www.visveres.com/bowyn"><FONT SIZE=+3>N O T H I N G</FONT></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/01 12:47:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neriak</span><hr size=1> Part Two:<br><br>This is the part he hated the most. His cloak swirled around him as he stepped lightly down the stone path, surrounded by oddly swirling waters to either side of him. In this darkness the water looked like liquid night. He pulled his cloak tighter around him as he picked up his pace, boots clicking uncomfortably loud on the stone. There is no other way to the library, he must pass the Temple of Innoruuk. A cold dread filled his veins as the strange glowing lights reflected off the water around him. His breathing was short and ragged. Concentrate, he mumbled to himself, pressing forward towards the temple.<br><br>He skirted close to the temple, closer than he'd like, but the way the Third Gate is designed, it's the path or the water. He wasn't sure which he found more revolting, the temple or that black swirling water. He heard a muffled scream come from the temple and momentarily froze in panic. He definitely found the temple more repulsive. He pulled his cloak even tighter, unable to push out the chill he felt.<br><br>&quot;A visitor?&quot; a high breezy scraping voice spoke into his ear. He spun around, his dagger clutched in his hand, his stance firm, his face a mask of fright. A ghoul leaned closer towards him, burning green eyes peering at him. He stood up straight and put the knife away, willing himself to calm.<br><br>&quot;I'm visiting the library, ghoul,&quot; he said, steadying his voice. <br><br>&quot;The library…&quot; the ghoul whispered with a scraping sound, leaning back a bit, but still studying him intently.<br><br>&quot;Yes, the library. What are the dead doing outside the temple?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Outside the temple... &quot; the ghoul whispered. He could see the mindless beast was lost in it's own corrupt maggot infested thoughts, and the smell was making him ill. He turned to leave. The ghoul did not follow. His flesh was still creeping at being so close to a denizen of the temple. His heart began to slow as he relaxed his breathing.<br><br>As he approached the gate he lifted his hand to inspect it, then satisfied, lowered it to his side and continued towards the Dragoons. As he neared them they stepped closer together blocking the entrance.<br><br>&quot;Who passes?&quot; the first Dragoon asked traditionally.<br><br>&quot;A child of the Craft,&quot; Bowynn said bowing, hands clasped.<br><br>&quot;By what authority do you visit the Third Gate?&quot; the Dragoon asked. This wasn't a part of the ritual. Thinking a million miles per hour, he looked directly into the Dragoon's eyes.<br><br>&quot;By my own authority as a Master,&quot; Bowynn said touching the Dragoon's shoulder. The other Dragoon stepped closer in surprise as the Dragoon Bowynn addressed stood silent. &quot;You will let me pass,&quot; Bowynn said quietly to the Dragoon who nodded his head and moved to open the gate. The second Dragoon stepped up to protest, but Bowynn reached behind him and touched the hand clutching the sword, a small blue light passing between the two. The Dragoon stepped back to his position.<br><br>The Third gate is more than just a physical gate into the most sacred part of Neriak, it is a construct of powerful magic. The exact purpose of the magic was unknown to Bowynn, but it's icy chill never failed to fill him with dread. He held his hand up to inspect it again and lowered it to his side. The library was just through the gate to the north.<br><br>As he passed the darkened streets so unlike the streets of his home, he was struck by the underlying beauty. The sense of evil and hatred pervaded every inch of the place, but did nothing to diminish the delicate architecture or aesthetically pleasing décor. He found himself nearly lost in it as he approached the doors of the Library.<br><br>He moved through the doors as unassumingly as possible. He walked along the hallway tracing his fingers along the spines of the books. So much knowledge here that would never be shared with the world. So much wasted. He smiled at several titles he recognized and stood stunned in shock at a volume of Nitilim's Grimoire. He had spent a great deal of his life compiling the lost works to learn their secrets. He had already mastered a great deal of it. He leafed through the volume and was nearly overcome by the urge to tear pages out. He could feel the enchantment of the books. He would be taken in an instance if he were to attempt it. He longingly put the book away and moved towards his objective.<br><br>An old Tier'dal sat at a finely wrought wooden desk, a treasure in this underground city of stone. He appeared lost in the tome in front of him, but lifted his hand in a gesture for Bowynn to come forward.<br><br>&quot;Mizr N'Mar. It is an honor,&quot; Bowynn said bowing.<br><br>&quot;A High Elf in Neriak is a dangerous thing… I hope for your sake you leave with your soul intact,&quot; the old tier'dal whispered without looking up from his book.<br><br>&quot;You eyes see more than it would appear,&quot; Bowynn said moving his hand to his dagger, his left hand starting to glow slightly.<br><br>&quot;Young runt, had I any intention of harming you, you'd be destroyed in the blink of an eye,&quot; he whispered harshly slamming his hand on his desk. Several tier'dal at various bookshelves looked over momentarily as Bowynn studied his boots. He moved his hand from his dagger and the light faded from his hand.<br><br>&quot;That's better. Tell me why you are so foolish as to come here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am nearing the end of my Journeymanship. I will be a Master soon. I seek the Coin of Tash.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm afraid you have come to the wrong place, runt. I do not possess the Coin of Tash, though I am privy to some of it's secrets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have nine coins. Romar sent me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nine coins!&quot; he said, louder than he meant to. He looked about and regained his composure. Looking directly into Bowynn's eyes this time he said &quot;Nine coins, you say? Perhaps I have misjudged you. They were thought scattered to the winds. It seems Romar chose well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, they were. I have spent many years searching them out. Romar's book is so much tripe and riddles, nearly useless in locating them. But I have located all but the last one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have done well, runt,&quot; Mizr replied. &quot;I can help you find the last coin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where is it!&quot; Bowynn whispered excitedly.<br><br>&quot;I don't know. Patience will gain you the coin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don't know? How exactly are you going to help me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Patience, I said. I know who last possessed it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who might that be?&quot; <br><br>&quot;A young lord named Task'rn Molint.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can you direct me to him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. You can find him in the cemetery. He is dead,&quot; Mizr smiled a toothy smile.<br><br>&quot;Dead. That's great,&quot; Bowynn said sinking into a chair at the side of the desk.<br>&quot;Not giving up are you, runt?&quot; Mizr said, his face back in his book.<br><br>&quot;No. I just have to find who had it next.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was buried with him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This just keeps getting better and better,&quot; Bowynn muttered under his breath. &quot;I still don't understand why you are helping me. The Dragoons would have me flayed in the temple.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm not a Dragoon if you haven't noticed,&quot; Mizr whispered harshly.<br><br>&quot;You know what I mean, why are you helping me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because Romar is a friend, and because I wish to see the Coin of Tash for myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Bowynn asked.<br><br>&quot;There is a price for my help.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is always a price,&quot; Bowynn said leaning forward.<br><br>&quot;A good lesson for you to have learned, runt. Keep it with you always. My price is to study the coin when you bring the ten together as one. I will only keep it for a moment and then it is yours again. This is my price,&quot; Mizr said, closing the book.<br><br>&quot;Fair enough. I agree to this,&quot; Bowynn said leaning forward and touching Mizr's hand. He rose from the chair and gave a slight bow to Mizr who did not look up. Bowynn stood for a moment and when Mizr was once again engrossed in his book, he turned to walk away. <br><br>&quot;Runt,&quot; he said, not looking up.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The heart is the enchanter's greatest weakness. The mind your strongest ally. Mind my words.&quot;<br><br>Bowynn turned and walked from the Library into the chill air. He raised his hand to make sure the illusion was still strong. An old habit of his that had given his teachers fits. At least now he had a lead. He walked through the Gate and past the Temple lost in thought, never noticing the chill of the temple or the stare of it's guardians. Before he knew it, his feet led him to the Neriak Underground. He descended the steps into Neriak's nightlife and into the Blind Fish tavern. <br><br>The tavern was basically like any other tavern Bowynn had encountered in his travels, except for the huge window in one side of the underground tavern. Tier'dal sat around the establishment, some grandly dressed, others more simply. There was conversation, laughter, yelling, bustling, and the obligatory drunken singing. He made his way past the throng to the bar.<br><br>&quot;Barkeep. A bottle of wine, please,&quot; Bowynn asked of the bartender. He waved away the first bottle the bartender brought him and pointed to a much nicer vintage. The bartender gave him a look, and Bowynn nodded yes. The bartender shrugged and took the bottle down, carrying it over to Bowynn.<br><br>&quot;Two hundred and fifteen cullies,&quot; the barkeep said, his hand still on the bottle. Bowynn laid a small pouch of platinum coins on the counter and fished a few more out of his pocket. With a smile he pulled the bottle from the barkeep's hand. The bartender gave him a suspicious look and took the coins. <br><br>As Bowynn turned he couldn't help but appreciate the splendor of the huge window in the tavern. An underground lake occupied the area just outside the bar and the window was like a vast aquarium. The fish swam back and forth, horrid white-eyed fish from nightmares, but strangely intriguing. He noticed a small flash of reflected light from the bottom of the lake, just inside the window as the water erupted in a spray of red. A barracuda had his dinner. With a shudder Bowynn took the bottle of wine and left the tavern. <br><br> <p><center><IMG SRC="http://www.visveres.com/sigs/sig28.jpg"><BR><FONT color="#A83AF7">S</FONT><FONT
