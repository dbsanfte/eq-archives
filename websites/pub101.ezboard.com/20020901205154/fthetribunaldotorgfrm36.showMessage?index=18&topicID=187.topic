It just ups the ante and is a risk i would rather live without.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm, lets see:<br>
<br>
There are approximately two million defensive gun uses (DGU's) per year by law abiding citizens. That was one of the findings in a national survey conducted by Gary Kleck, a Florida State University criminologist in 1993. Prior to Dr. Kleck's survey, thirteen other surveys indicated a range of between 800,000 to 2.5 million DGU's annually. However these surveys each had their flaws which prompted Dr. Kleck to conduct his own study specifically tailored to estimate the number of DGU's annually. <br>
<br>
Subsequent to Kleck's study, the Department of Justice sponsored a survey in 1994 titled, the National Survey of Private Ownership of Firearms. Using a smaller sample size than Kleck's, this survey estimated 1.5 million DGU's annually.<br>
<br>
Similarly:<br>
<br>
Professors James D. Wright and Peter Rossi surveyed 2,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons across the United States. Wright and Rossi reported that 34% of the felons said they personally had been &quot;scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim&quot;; 69% said that they knew at least one other criminal who had also; 34% said that when thinking about committing a crime they either &quot;often&quot; or &quot;regularly&quot; worried that they &quot;[m]ight get shot at by the victim&quot;; and 57% agreed with the statement, &quot;Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How many deaths were from automatic weapons?&quot;<br>
<br>
An automatic weapon (machine gun) is defined as any weapon which will continue to fire as long as the trigger is depressed until ammunition is exhausted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since 1934, only one legally owned machine gun has ever been used in crime, and that was a murder committed by a law enforcement officer (as opposed to a civilian).&quot;<br>
<br>
How about just banning handguns--which are responsible for over 50 % of gun deaths?<br>
<br>
&quot;A National Institute of Justice survey of felons in state prisons found that 72% of felons who use handguns said they would switch to sawed-off shotguns if handguns became unavailable.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;US has a about 10x more deaths (all causes) due to fire arms than the UK&quot;<br>
<br>
If you include all causes of violent death, the numbers are:<br>
US 18.57<br>
England &amp; Wales 9.53<br>
(Because of gun laws in England and Wales, their 7.6 suicides are commited without guns, i.e. knives, hanging etc.)<br>
<br>
And Finally, for you reading pleasure, information about concealed carry laws:<br>
<br>
First, what are &quot;liberalized&quot; concealed carry laws? They are a set of requirements, when met by an applicant, require the issuance of a concealed carry permit, which allows a permit holder to carry a gun (concealed) in public places. These requirements may consist of a license fee, a safety training program or exam, fingerprinting, a &quot;clean&quot; record, no history of mental illness, etc. In other words it is not left to the discretion of local authorities to decide whether or not to issue a permit. Liberalized concealed carry laws are more often referred to as &quot;shall-issue concealed carry weapons&quot; laws. <br>
<br>
In 1987, when Florida enacted such legislation, critics warned that the &quot;Sunshine State&quot; would become the &quot;Gunshine State.&quot; Contrary to their predictions, homicide rates dropped faster than the national average. Further, through 1997, only one permit holder out of the over 350,000 permits issued, was convicted of homicide. (Source: Kleck, Gary Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, p 370. Walter de Gruyter, Inc., New York, 1997.) If the rest of the country behaved as Florida's permit holders did, the U.S. would have the lowest homicide rate in the world. <br>
<br>
David Kopel, Research Director at the Independence Institute comments on Florida's concealed carry experience: <br>
<br>
&quot;What we can say with some confidence is that allowing more people to carry guns does not cause an increase in crime. In Florida, where 315,000 permits have been issued, there are only five known instances of violent gun crime by a person with a permit. This makes a permit-holding Floridian the cream of the crop of law-abiding citizens, 840 times less likely to commit a violent firearm crime than a randomly selected Floridian without a permit.&quot; (&quot;More Permits Mean Less Crime...&quot; Los Angeles Times, Feb. 19, 1996, Monday, p. B-5) <br>
Thirty-two states have enacted &quot;shall-issue&quot; concealed carry laws (New Mexico being the most recent in April 2001), and one state, Vermont, does not require any permit of its residents.<br>
<br>

2 millions DGU yearly : that means that close to one percent of the population used a gun in a defensive manner at least once every year (including babies and seniors... rounding up US pop. at 240M). As a comparison, there is only about 1.9M total inmates in US prisons. *cough*<br>

From BBC news :<br>
<br>
8<==================================================<br>
<br>
 Home Office figures showed the murder rate in the US in 1998 was 6.3 per 100,000 people compared with 1.4 per 100,000 in England and Wales.<br>
<br>
The murder rate in London is 2.9 per 100,000 compared with 8.6 per 100,000 in New York and 49.15 per 100,000 in Washington DC.<br>
<br>
A report produced by the US Department of Justice in 1998 would appear to support the Home Office's claims.<br>
<br>
It shows the murder rate was 5.7 times higher in the US than England and Wales and the rape rate was about three times higher.<br>
<br>
The report also showed firearms were used in 68% of murders in the US compared with 7% in England and Wales, and in 41% of robberies in America against 5% in England and Wales.<br>
<br>
But the rates for assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft were all lower in America than in England and Wales.<br>

That's not true.  An automatic weapon is defined as a weapon that automatically &quot;chambers&quot; the next round from a magazine.  So a Berreta 9mm pistol, is an automatic pistol.<br>
<br>
What you described is what is called a &quot;fully&quot; automatic weapon.  This is when the weapon not only chambers the next round, but fires it as well, if the trigger is held down. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 1398<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/02 10:03:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gun Control and Crime, the English experience</span><hr size=1> no a selfloading rifle or pistol are the correct terms <br>

<br>
First, 2 million DGU does not equal 2 million people. They are &quot;uses&quot;. Someone could have had a DGU more than once. So, the first part of your statement is false. It could be true, but based on what Dumai said, it's not.<br>
<br>
Your comparison to the current prison population is also flawed.<br>
<br>
2 million covers the annual, not at any one point. Your 1.9 million figure is at any one point, or the current population. In reality, an estimated 5.5 million people per year are &quot;under some form of correctional supervision&quot;. The figures are from 96, I was too lazy to search for a more recent report.<br>
<br>
Since your statement was trying to say, and correct me if I am wrong, &quot;if 2 million people used guns in this purpose, it makes no sense that only 1.9 million people are in jail&quot;. In reality, that comparison is completely false and misleading. <br>

<br>
>First, 2 million DGU does not equal 2 million people. They are "uses". Someone could have had a DGU more than once. So, the first part of your statement is false. It could be true, but based on what Dumai said, it's not.<br>
<br>
Let me rephrase : this guy claims there have been 2 million DGUs in one year. What I am trying to concisely convey is that if your total population is 240 millions, close to one percent of the population has had to defend themself from a threat once this year with a gun on -average-.<br>
<br>
In other words : if you use your gun in repsonse to a criminal threat (mugging, whatever...), this would equal to a crime rate around 1000 per 100 000 (to translate into the kind of rates we were quoting before and not even accounting for cases where the victim did not have a gun to defend themself). Even assuming half of those DGUs where not in defense of violent criminal agression, you are still left with a ridiculously high number. Get it now ? <br>
<br>
Does it surprise you the guy retracted his claims as flawed and issued a new number ? Could it be because he was accounting for police enforcers when they draw their weapon while pulling a car for speed violation for instance ? Of course, we have no idea because the article quoting the study carefully leaves this out while leading you to believe that there are millions of brave citizens defending their lives with a gun yearly in our crime infested cities.<br>
<br>
>Your comparison to the current prison population is also flawed.<br>
<br>
It's not an argument, just a quantified idea of the percentage of the "hard" criminal population in the US. As you pointed out, a lot of people are "under correctional supervision", but you can also point out that the majority of those inmates are in for drug related crimes, not necessarily violent crime... It's about just as valid as the other study on the deterrent effect of firearms on inmates. Guess i'll have to go into that also later since a funny argument can be made about that too.  <br>
<br>
In the meantime I suggest you chew at those criminality figures from the BBC...<br>

Correlation does not equal causality.<br>

I would be very interested in a study which can prove whether this one factor, legalized presence of a particular weapon (firearms), makes a significant difference in how much people kill each other.<br>

Liberal rhetoric notwithstanding, until some such study comes out, I will continue to believe that factors such as personal irresponsibility, social and cultural pressures, etc. have a much greater deal to do with murder rates in particular places than whether or not someone has access to a particular (easily replaceable) tool.<br>

<br>
This is NOT TV anyone who owns a gun knows you cant hold it in one hand and shoot a target 5 times without aiming :P....Hitting anything with a weapon requires a good deal of training...Most people who own guns and know how to use them know they will probably only be used to deter the crime. Most people who own them and are trained will probably never shoot it to try and kill somone.<br>
<br>
Somone who knows about guns and who has one is alot less dangerous then somone who doesnt know about guns and gets his/her hands on one....The danger with guns lies in human ignorance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucaledhontelrana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/02 11:25:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gun Control and Crime, the English experience</span><hr size=1> *nod Kellianne*<br>
<br>
You may be correct, Shehbahn.  I don't know, I haven't looked up the numbers.<br>
<br>
But even if you are, there are so many other factors involved that it still would not convince me that, by giving up the right to legally own a gun, there would be a significant enough increase in freedom from crime to warrant it.<br>
<br>
Guns are a tool, nothing more.  Having an easily accessible tool might make an action easier, and the unavailability of a tool might make an action more difficult to the point where the perpetrator decides it's not worth the trouble.  But in either of these cases, the basic problem remains - the fact that the perpetrator, whether he performs the action or not, wants to kill someone else.  Removing a tool is a half-solution at best, that addresses none of the true underlying problems.  It is not worth it, to me, to remove the right to bear arms from law abiding, intelligent, responsible citizens in order to possibly prevent such a tool from falling into the hands of criminal, stupid, irresponsible people.  Better to deal with the people that commit crimes rather than what they commit them with.  Especially when that tool can be used to not only commit, but prevent crime.  The degree to which you agree with that last statement may vary, but nobody can rationally deny it completely. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

<br>
You can't seriously compare how a law or government policy will affect the populations of two seperate countries.  There are so many different factors that come to play, when you're looking at the impact that such things would have on a society.<br>
<br>
The comparing of such things is just plain ignorance.  Such people are essentially believing that people are people.  A person from England, thinks just like some person from France.  If the events in the last year, havn't woken us up to the fact that people can be very different, we'll forever be left ignorant.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way.  If we took all the criminals from the US prisons, inserted them into a prison in the UK, to carry out the rest of their term.  Do you believe that when they're released into the enlightened United Kingdom, that they'd fly the straight and narrow?<br>
<br>
We're dealing with a different situation in the States, than those in the UK, or any other country.  If we want to have a better understanding of how a law will affect our populace, we'll be looking to compare our different states to each other, rather than looking for comparisions from the outside.<br>
<br>
I certainly don't see any Garden of Eden out there, that's for sure. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=187.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=187.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=187.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=187.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=187.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=187.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
