I talk to people who believe the theories are true but all of them have a different understanding. Maybe that is what is intended for the theory of evolutionism to be, a mix of understanding and theories under one broad theory. <br>
<br>
I myself believe in Creationism, which is pretty understandable by reading the first few verses of the Bible. The main backbone of Creationism is faith. Without faith, a God with the power to create a universe and all that is in it in six days according to some old book (the Bible) would seem pretty ridiculous to me. By saying that, could I also imply that evolution is simply a theory of creation for the faithless?<br>
<br>
Correct me if I am wrong but, the theory of evolution began during the Age of Reasoning, which followed the First Great Awakening? Deism sprang up as a belief that there is some supreme power who made the world but left its creation to raise itself up. There was no direct spiritual interaction with the supreme power. From that grew the theory of evolution and the big bang story which deals with the complete absence of God.<br>
<br>
Basically, my question is this. Do evolutionists have faith in any type of supreme being or God? If not, then do evolutionists even have faith at all? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20548">Kijiro</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->RETIRED -4- LIFE</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

There is no such thing as &quot;evolutionism.&quot;  There is just Evolution.  Evolution is both fact and theory.  It is fact in that it does happen.  It is theory in that nobody is quite sure just exactly what the mechanisms for it are.<br>

No, and this a common approach to evolution by creationists, but it has one fatal flaw.  Evolution does not propose the creation of the universe or life.  Only the origin of species. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=efnita@thetribunaldotorg>Efnita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/03 4:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> According to your definition evolutionist believe in logic and as a result put their faith in scientific theories and facts.

You can probably ask 50 people in the same church specific questions and get 50 different answers. There's a few people that believe Man evolved and rose from the primordial axle grease with no intervention from any higher power, and then there's a few people that believe that Man was created from dust by God and woman from his rib. The majority, including me, fall somewhere in between. In trying to pigeonhole peoples beliefs, there is little black and white and a ton of grey. <br>
<br>
I believe there is a God and that he did something like hold a singularity in his hand and said let there be light - Kaboom, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. As far as how man actually got here, I believe God had a hand in it somehow but as far as the actual mechanics behind it I don't know and its not that important to me. I believe when I die my spirit will live on, but whether it goes to Heaven, achieves Nirvana, becomes one with the Tao, is reborn, or just floats around in space looking at the pretty stars I don't know either. I'm ok with not knowing also, because the Pope doesn't know anymore than I do. He has faith in a particular after-death scenario, just like I have faith in a very broad one, but he doesn't know.<br>

That is misleading.<br>
<br>
Adaptation has been proven to exist, that is creatures adapt over time to their environment.<br>
<br>
The theory of evolution, as most people think of it, is that single-celled organisms eventually turned into mutiple-celled organisms which turned into apes which turned into men.<br>
<br>
That theory is far from proven.  In fact, the scarcity of so called &quot;missing links&quot; in the fossil record raises many serious doubts, even amongst non-religous types.<br>
<br>
Adaptation, survival of the fittest, etc (everything except men coming from apes) are not incompatible within christianity.<br>

I always put evolution and the big bang together. Meaning the theory of evolution explains the creation of the universe. If that is wrong, what are people who believe in the big bang called?<br>
<br>
Another thing, if Adam and Eve both had navels, would it be enough to say that God created the universe? If they had navels it would show that God created them with a mark that showed they originated from a parent. What would stop God from creating rock or the soil with fossils aged billions of years old? By doing this God weeds out the faithless, afterall, the Bible says that those who follow God need faith like a child. Some may call it blind beliefs, but I view it as complete dedication and faith for God.<br>
<br>
I have been thinking of this a lot recently, just interested in some outside views from people who think differently than I do. Though science is definately not a bad thing, I think humans try to explain everything by using science. Many of us can not accept that some things are unexplainable which leads to new theories, which still only tries to put the unknown into some sense, but not a complete answer. Is the fear of the unknown too much for some individuals? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20548">Kijiro</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->RETIRED -4- LIFE</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
Let me try to explain it the best I can. I believe that Christianity and the Bible are correct simply because they <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">are</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> correct. I know, that may not be the best way of explaining it to someone who doesn't, or does, believe in the Bible (I do not know your take on it so I won't assume), but for me the Bible is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">the</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> absolute. Much like others see and hold a rock and believe to be a real object without a shadow of doubt, I believe that about the Bible. I have experienced a direct, real, relationship with God. I have felt the warmth and comfort of Him. I have a solid, absolute,  never leaving anchor to ground myself to. While others are searching for answers to their problems, I have and know the one thing which holds all the answers.<br>
<br>
Call me a fanatic, a Jesus freak, whatever, but I know Christianity is true because it is true. It is hard to understand I am sure. In no way am I calling you, or anyone else who does not believe in the Bible as an absolute, ignorant. I do respect your views, though we may not agree. For me it is like trying to describe the world to someone who has been blind their whole life. The blind man can not fully grasp my explanation unless they, themselves, are able to see it and experience it completely. If I had the opportunity to let you experience how I feel, and have felt, toward Christ then I truly believe it would completely revolutionize how you see things.<br>
<br>
I am sure that may be all hard to grasp for some, but for me, it is the most sincere and truthful way I can explain why the Bible is true. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20548">Kijiro</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->RETIRED -4- LIFE</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

But it's a logic loop - someone who &quot;just believes&quot; can counter *any* argument with &quot;that's the way god wants it&quot; and there's no possible counter-argument.<br>
<br>
That's why these discussions always end up as 10 page flames going in circles.<br>
<br>
That said, Dumai - what's the difference (and please, no quoting from dictionary.com - i'm wondering IN YOUR EYES) between adaptation and evolution?  If a species adapts significantly enough that it really is a new creature, didn't it just evolve?<br>
<br>
And as for the lack of &quot;missing links&quot;, they're out there.  There are fossil records for TONS of different long-extinct creatures which are chimps with some human-like features, all the way up through humans with chip-like features, and everything in between. <br>
<br>
Evolution doesn't happen in a nice, straight line, where you're slightly more evolved than your grandfather, or anything like that.  Rather, chimps (or whatever the common ancestor was) all over the planet slowly adapted to their enviornments in various ways.  This led to a whole bunch of unsuccessful &quot;intermediate&quot; steps, some of which went on to become genus homo and others which didn't.  Within genus homo there were a bunch of &quot;false starts&quot; as well, and the only CURRENT branch in existance for the last 30,000 years or so are the cro-magnons, which are basically you and I.  The last 100,000 years or so had all of the sapien branch running around out-competing their other proto-humans.<br>
<br>
Why did all the other branches die out, and yet why are chimps still around but the &quot;in-betweens&quot; are gone?  Easy.  Those &quot;in-betweens&quot; who were very chimp-like got beaten out for food/territory/whatever by the chimps.  Those who were very &quot;human-like&quot; like the Neanderthals got beaten out by... us.  But Humans and Chimps didn't compete at all - so there was no environmental pressure for us to wipe each other out.  But all those &quot;transition&quot; species kept getting wiped out by the next one up.<br>
<br>
Laugh all you want at sci-fi or rediculousness like X-men but that's basically how it works - an adaptation will come along giving those who get it a serious advantage.  They'll spread rapidly and eventually wipe out all the homo sapiens (in theory - man of course now can twist nature pretty badly) - unless they're sufficiently different that we don't compete.  IN which case, we'll co-exist on the planet - just like humans and apes today. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kij>Kij</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/03 7:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> Merton, I guess you are just the blind guy lol. I tried to be sincere enough that even you would be able to at least see my views but I guess some things just aren't meant to be. Yes I know, the explanation was weak for anyone who hasn't experienced what I have. Much like it's hard to realize the pain a mother feels during labor, you just have to experience it yourself. Obviously you haven't, so you believe it must be retarded.<br>
<br>
We already know that you define reality. Mertonism is the new, upcoming religion that will rule them all. You are the true god because you know all things. I am sorry for even attempting to make a truthful answer to a question that is near unanswerable for many people.<br>
<br>
And yes, I agree Hayzen. I know that there are other religions out there who can derive the same strong feelings and beliefs which I have towards Christianity. And though it may sound immature and foolish of me to say it, the only thing that I can counter that question with is that they are wrong. The feelings may be true and real. But coming from a Christian perspective it is possible that Satan has placed false religious beliefs and doctrines throughout the world for people to fall in to and never experience Christ.<br>
<br>
Jews believe that the Messiah has not yet come to Earth. In the Christian faith, that would be viewed as the doubting Thomas, they lack complete faith that Jesus was God's son. They are waiting to see and feel the Messiah, much like Thomas demanded to feel Jesus' scars after he was resurrected. Other than that I do not know much about the other faiths. I respect them all, and though it may sound selfish, and even hypocritical, I believe they are wrong. I guess I kind of sound like Merton by saying other religions are wrong when I myself have not experienced them. <br>
<br>
There is not a question in my mind whether or not the Bible is true. I believe it to be the absolute truth. To each their own I suppose. I guess I take back my comments to Merton. If you choose to belief that I am a retard, it's all you bro. We can both stand here all day saying we are both wrong. However, the least you can do is respect my views, much like I respect yours.<br>
<br>
Here is another thing I don't get though. Wouldn't it be wise to at least believe in some faith and be fully devoted to it instead of believing in nothing. If you believe there is no judgement once you die then there is no consequence in believing in a chosen faith, but if there is, wouldn't it be better to have some chance as opposed to none? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20548">Kijiro</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->RETIRED -4- LIFE</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

The christians invented the Devil (he's not even in the bible, folks...) as a scare tactic.  The church had so much sway over people that it basically was the dominant power over the western world from the downturn of the roman empire until the Industrial Revolution.<br>

I'm not religious in the least - but I admire some of the moral teachings and family values of the various religions.  And, in fact, they're generally pretty similar - that's because they're pretty fundamental to humanity, just put into words/rules for people.  But the &quot;fear of pleasing god&quot; subtext is what creates jihads and crusades, which this world most certainly can do without. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maxamaji>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 731<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/03 8:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> Kij your faith is nice and all, but why did you make the original post in the first place?

If you're questioning your faith and feeling things out then fine, but if not and you believe in it so strongly, what's the point in coming here and having a discussion about it? There is nothing for you to discuss, you already have faith that you have all the absolute answers. The only answer to that is that you want to try to point out flaws in other peoples beliefs which is annoying as hell, and I'm pretty freakin hard to annoy.<br>

I am pretty sure it says that Jesus went to Hell for 3 days and paid a visit to his old friend Lucifer. The Bible also makes refrences to the story of how the angel Lucifer believed that he was more powerful than god, took some other &quot;corrupt&quot; angels,  and was kicked out of the gates of Heaven. The Bible also mentions that in the final days, the Devil will be thrown into a pit of burning sulfur. There are numerous times in which Satan is mentioned in the Bible.<br>
<br>
And no, Christianity is not founded on &quot;faith out of fear&quot;. Though is may come off as such by people watching TV evangelists who preach hellfire and brimstone every chance they get. Christianty is based on faith that Christ paid the ultimate sacrifice so that we can be saved. Christianity, if anything, is founded on love.<br>
<br>
Yes, there are religious fanatics who do just what you mentioned Tuwene. Seeing people in the 21st century who continue to believe that all devout Christians, or devout followers of any faith, are those that only intend to use &quot;scare tactics&quot; is what really bothers me. Have there been those who have come to power of a certain religious group by using those scare tactics? Yes,  but those philosiphies go completely against the teachings of the Bible.<br>
<br>
When I asked my last question I guess it may have come off as a &quot;scare tactic&quot; to some but I just wanted to hear some answers to justify others beliefs. I made my original post to gain information on how others believe and percieve the ideas surronding the creation of the universe. Unfortunately it turned into people questioning my faith when I was only out to see the ways others thought. I think I have expressed my views enough personally with about as much evidence I can provide seeing how my beliefs are supported by faith alone. I wanted to hear the evidence and see just how well they could be supported. I did not make this to preach my religion to you all, I am simply wanting to see others point of view on the whole topic. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20548">Kijiro</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->RETIRED -4- LIFE</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
The Bible is the absolute truth?  Which Bible?  Catholic, Protestant, Coptic?  They all have significant differences from eachother, as in haveing entire books the others do not(not to mention the subtle differences in meaning that come from the different languages and dialects that the Bible has been translated into).  The Bible may or my not have been inspired by God.  I am not going to state my opinion on that but it has had man's hands involved since the beginning.  God didn't write it, flawed if God inspired men did.  You may argue that God would  have made sure it was perfect, but I believe that God chose to make us work for the truth, to use our faith to get at the absolute truth buried in an inspired but imperfect Bible.<br>
<br>
This was an explaination given to me by a Nun in 8th grade and I have yet to hear a better reconciliation of science with religion.  -- The Bible's truth (or any religous tract for that matter) is in the WHY not the HOW.  Looking to the bible to explain the how of life, distracts from the important part.  The why of life, THAT is the truth in the bible.  By that standard there is no conflict between science and the Bible. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
