Telymon and I have been friends since 2nd grade.  I never got on his account and took anything, anything that I got from him was GIVEN to me by him.  I'm gonna call him and have him post on here to get this all straight.  I'm dissapointed that you have nothing better to do than to blame me for your ex-guildie screwing you.  Don't put this on me just becuase he left the game and wanted his real life friend to be well off.  Get over it, I'm so sick of the tells telling me to delete or start over becuase my rep will be destroyed.  Goes to show how well you people treat others.  Thank you for those who actually believe me in that I stole NOTHING from ANYONE!<br>

Apparently you know him in real life and see him every day at school.<br>

How about you ask him tommorrow to post here under his own sig that he simply gave all the gear to you and that you are the innocent and aggrieved party.<br>
<br>
If that is in fact the case then I owe you an apology.  I would point out that you are suspected of stealing the gear because your story is so inconsistent.  If you had simply said that he gave it to you to sell in the first place much of this would be avoided.<br>

Nexxon, I just want to add, that even if he does check out your story, you are still a miserable piece of dog shit. Sure you won’t go on the list, that is reserved just for people who steal, scam, train, and do other things of the worst kind.<br>
<br>
But, you are a fucking classless liar, out for your own self rather than concerned over doing what is right. Yeah it was Telymon’s gear, but quit crying about everyone bitching at you. That is what happens when you sell off gear that should have gone back to the guild that he got it from.<br>
<br>
If you wanted a good rep, you would have returned the gear. But now, you will just be another joke of the server, another shitstain that everyone laughs about &amp; makes fun of the guild that you become a part of. Enjoy your plat though. <p><BR>

<br>
I remember him selling all the high end stuff... I wondered where he got it... he told me a good friend quit and gave it to him.  That answered that.<br>
<br>
Obviously I have no way of knowing whether this is true or not, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, because he is a friend... I wish Telymon would show up to verify one side or the other, but until then, I will say this:<br>
<br>
If the gear was given freely as Nexxon seems to indicate, there would be NO obligation to give it back to anyone.  If Telymon had wanted any of his items to go back to his guild, no doubt he would have taken care of that himself before he quit, or at least told Nexxon, &quot;Don't sell this&quot;.  If Nexxon is telling the truth that his RL friend wanted him have his gear when said friend left the game... there is absolutely nothing to flame Nexxon over.  In my personal experience, Nexxon has never been the greedy sort who would screw someone over like this.<br>
<br>
I don't expect everyone to grant Nexxon the same level of trust that I do, of course, but this whole issue is a &quot;he said, she said&quot; until one person - Telymon - speaks up.<br>
<br>
PS - seems odd to me that this is surfacing now, since the whole sordid affair took place quite a while ago... you'd think the Comps would have noticed something like this being sold off or something?<br>

And your last post was a sure fire way to destroy it. At least if you are gonna give him a chance to explain his case, wait till Tely posts before you crap all over the guy. I mean if he's guilty he's guilty but you aren't even giving him a fighting chance. <br>
<br>
Your last post was as good as putting him in the &quot;peices of monkey shit&quot; thread. And while I'm sure that your intention is just that, don't be a hypocrit and ask him to calm down, tell him he can restore his rep, and then proceed to publicly rip him a new one. <br>

I just said he could so he would go get Tely. But today, I just said fuck it &amp; decided to rip into this piece of shit ahead of schedule. Excellent use of thinking though. You are really coming along. I had no idea someone as dim as you would be able to spot such an obvious contradiction.<br>
<br>
If Tely does come &amp; explains that he gave the stuff to his friend rather than it being stolen, then he will not go on the list because he will not be a thief. But in my book, he will still be a shit stain. I have a feeling Tely doesn’t want to come because he knows it was a shitty thing to do to his former guild.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that some of you jackasses think this assmunch was somehow in the clear or justified in selling off that gear since Tely left him his character after he left. I still do not think that makes it right.<br>
<br>
If I had left my account with a friend when I quit &amp; he had gone to EC &amp; sold all my Donals &amp; BD gear &amp; the other trinkets that I received for being a part of EV, then you bet your ass my guild would have shit on me AND my friend.<br>
<br>
The guy knew it was wrong. Why else did he lie about even having it. I hate little shits like this who do things that they know is wrong just to help themselves out. And you bet your ass I am going to call him on it.  <p><BR>

With all respect Caledhon,  I do not agree with you.<br>
<br>
Look at it this way.  If your family owns a nice car and lets you drive it thats nice of your family.  But if you decide to leave the country and give the car to your best friend who the family has never heard of, then you can damn well expect the family to come knocking on your door.<br>
<br>
Telymon never owned the items he had on him - they were guild loot.  *If* he gave them away he was ripping off his own guild.  <br>
<br>
We are talking about over extremely high end gear here - some of which will never drop in game again now that the Sleeper has been released.<br>
<br>
By holding onto the gear when he knows it has been stolen from the guild, Nexxon is dealing in stolen property.  The only question is whether Nexxon stole it on his own or was simply so dim as not to realise that it didnt belong to Telymon either.<br>
<br>
In either event, Nexxon now knows that the property was stolen and is still refusing to give it back.  Thats where the real offence lies.<br>
<br>
Nexxon feel free to contact any Companions officer in game to return the items. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <table border=0><tr><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
