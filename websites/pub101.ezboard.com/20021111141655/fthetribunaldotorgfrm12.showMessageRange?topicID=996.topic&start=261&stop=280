There is no where to start and certainly wont be anywhere to finish. You want truths?? You want to know what really happened? You want to know the order of events that led up to us actually taking out a named. You want to know where we wiped out? WHY we wiped out?Then ask the Raid leader. ME!! Heres my email Imotep_26@hotmail.com. I led the raid. I was there from start to finish both days.<br>
Anyone who knows me on this server knows that I do not lie. I would like to think I have a pretty good reputation. I would like to think that I could be trusted to tell the truth. I can tell you what happened on those 2 days. What I cannot tell you is the actual dealings with those Guild leaders of the ToVN rotation. That wasn't my deal. But I can tell you 1 thing for sure if I loose DKP points If I never see another Piece of fucking LEWT as a member of Legendary again. We did not go into ToV with Plans to Kill any Named mobs. I wish to GOD I had my log on. Our soul Original Plan when we first made the decision to go to ToV North was for Flurry Drakes. It was my idea. We didn't know to me Knowledge anyway that any named were up. It isn't something we usually concern ourselves with because of Aaryonar. But it was said that hey Trans killed Aary last night what about going to North ToV. And I said in /gu That Yes that would be a good idea. Flurry drakes are tougher than most of the mobs in North and it would be great Practice for us. Now I wont lie and say that after we learned named were up that the thought didn't cross our minds. And I asked Conno about named and when we were going to get our Shot at Aary. And he told me in tells that we weren't going to get a shot that RNG was pissed because we took down Ikatiar one day when it was RNG's turn. (Now since when is Ikatiar part of the North Rotation I had no idea) So I shrugged and said ok. Now while this was going Sylie was having a few choice words with some Legos at the zone in. And the guys in good fun poked back and said yup we are going to North. We never ONCE said that we were going to take any named out. If you have logs SS to prove this Sylie then fine I will retract this statement. You assumed we were doing this. And at the time you were the only Trans in the zone maybe 1 other. But the word quickly spread to Trans and they started to gather in ToV about 5-10 I believed had showed up. When!! The incident that Changed our objective. IF Sylie was KoS then why the FUCK was he/she doing by the Picture Hall door?? I was watching that door cause I saw Sylie go in there when it opened. Then 10 seconds later here comes not 1 not 2 not even 3 but 5 Mobs from the Picture Hall up to an OPEN Door. I can GUARANTEE you that No legendary members were at the door. We were setting up CoH to North. Now being KoS myself I have Pulled Picture Hall to the zone in many times. And I can tell you this. The Picture Hall mobs do not WANDER thru the zone in on there way back to there spawns. The Door opened Sylie died and here comes 5 Picture Hall mobs all the way to the back left corner of the zone in. Accident you say?? I don't think so. Sylie was quite pissed about the fun being poked at him/her and decided that training us would slow us down enough for Trans to get there and CoH/Run up to the Fight spot. Then after the smoke had cleared we started rezzing. Then another member from Trans starts going off in ooc about Training us again. They were /reported /petitioned. So we get rezzed buffed start getting Coh ready. And the SECOND training incident occurs. Now this one puzzles me even more. Our CoH mage who is Not KoS Obviously runs up to the CoH spot. Says that there is about 10 Trans up here. And then Quickly says in group CHAT. Zoobly tells the group, OMG!! Then Zoobly is dead. I ask him what happened he says that They brought one of the Big Drakes up to the CoH spot (Eashens Guards) who are KoS to all. So what did Trans do here ? Train themselves to Kill our CoH mage who was bound at the WW zone?? GM's show up Trans is kicked from the zone there guild is warned for the 2nd time. (Never heard of a second warning before for guild training). And it is at this point we decide to take our North ToV expedition a bit further. This is the truth. This is what happened. If you want details of the actual events in North then fine ask me. I will tell you where we wiped why we wiped and where I fucked up. Because EVERY Single one of the wipes was my fault. BAD Pulling. ( First time there). Legendary NEVER wiped to hatchlings. We never wiped more than once to the Destroyer. And we certainly didn't wipe to that Pussy fuck Red dragon Keizan (Spelling) In fact that was only 2 deaths. 1 Rog 1 War. The wipe that finished us for the night once again MY FAULT. I didn't time repops. And wasn't specific enough to the other Monks about not getting close to the Fish and his guards. So in short The Fish plus guards plus 2 back spawns = Dead Raid. Never once did we have more than 55 ppl the first day and didn't pass 60 the 2nd day until we were at the Triplets. Which took less than 2 hours to clear to. After I made a bad Pull and aggroed a roamer Flurry drake with 1 already INC. And no notice. All the wipes were bad pulls. Monks fault Mostly Mine. Not the incompetence of the guild. <br>
I after having left the server for a brief stay am still on trial again with the guild.<br>
I was told not to post here. I will probably NOT pass trial now. But I will be all damned to hell if I sit here and let You fuckers in Trans who weren't EVEN there say what, when and how we wiped out and that they are incompetent to handle those Mobs. It was my fault. Will it happen again. Not a chance. I have been guilded with Conno for over 2 years now. I have know him since lvl 12. Never has he Ever lied to us about ANYTHING. He is the most straight forward person I have ever met. I honestly believe that the Officers, leaders of the Rotation guilds. Did not make a Viable effort to Give Lego that shot at Aary. We killed Yelinak WAY Before Trans or RNG did. We killed Yelinak for the first time over 2 months ago. I know I was there. And we have Killed Yelinak twice more since then.<br>
To sit there and think that We DIDN'T want to try and abide by a Rotation is ridiculous. Our intentions for North Tov have been clear for over 6 months now. But we were never given that chance to get into the rotation. I know that talks with E/V/comps Had been going on for a long time. Granted we weren't ready. But none the eless talks were going on. Once they dropped from the rotation and RNG/SI took it over to sit there and think that Legendary wouldn't be barking on the door every chance they could to abide by a system that would accommodate all is ridiculous. NEVER! has Legendary jumped another raid in progress. Never has legendary entered a Plane on a day they weren't scheduled. But the total lack of respect for a guild that has Killed More with less than RNG/Si and Trans was ludicrous. Tormax first killed By legendary over 9 months ago. Also First time Killed without pulling him to the zone in. Grieg. Only 2 other guild to my knowledge have Killed Grieg. And they are not in the North rotation anymore.  IV recently killed by legendary for the first time. Trans killed him yet? I honestly don't know. I am pretty sure RNG and SI have. So to say that Legendary does not have the skill to take down Aary or NtoV is ridiculous. This is all about fear IMO. They are afraid of what Legendary can do. Give us that shot at Aary. Don't dick around about it either. Wether I continue in legendary or not. I guarantee you this. You will not be able to keep them out. They are a Very well balanced grp of players both EST/GMT. Unless all 4 Guilds are going to perma camp ToV. I really don't see how you have a chance of Locking Legendary out. And if you do well that just leaves more up for us to kill. <br>
<br>
These are the facts. Based on my reputation on this server. I have MANY friends in RNG/Trans. I would hope that they know that I would never lie about this. In any case. It is going to be a long hard road for al of us if we don't try to get this mess sorted. I honestly believe it would behove all parties involved to work something out. As I said before I am still a trial member in Legendary because of my absence to legends for 3 weeks. So my actions here will probably get we in trouble. But at this point I don't really care. The truth needed to be told. Trans let there tempers get the best of them when they had nothing to worry about. And it cost everyone on this server a bunch of shit that no one wanted to deal with. Anyway, Imotep_26@hotmail.com if you want any more answers. <br>
<br>
I apologize to my guildmates in legendary for my actions here. But I was not going to sit by and Let our name and especially Connos name be dragged thru the mud. This might be the Flameboard. But when you directly attack the integrity of man Like Conno. And directly attack the capability of our guild without the facts, well I am going to stand up and say something.<br>
<br>
Small Disclaimer here: These are the evets to the best of my Knowledge and recalection. Obvioulsy I cannot speak for the guild as a whole. Nor can i speak for those members who have spoken outside the guild to others. You have a beef with what I said then fine tell me. But in any case No progress is being made here.  <p>Imotep Eaglespirit<BR>

I offered Legendary a shot at Aary. 2 FULL days, thats right, 48 hours. Same deal we were given, same as SI as well I believe when both our guilds first got into North. <br>
<br>
I *specifically* told Connovar if Legenday was interested in joining the NToV rotation that they would have this *GAURENTEED* shot at Roy after Trans had had thier pop. This would have made it tomorrow, since there is a patch, and Trans turn is up now. Thats right, RNG would have given you 2 days on our turn to attempt and possibly enter the rotation. He obviously has logs of our conversation, since those are the only 2 times I can ever remember talking to Connovar in my entire EQ career. Please, post the entire conversation...<br>
<br>
I'm not sure where you got the idea RNG wouldn't give you a shot, did I ever say that? *I* speak for RNG. In my absense, Boinshar can speak for me. If neither of us are on, our officers can come to a decision as well. If I disagree with thier decision and change it, I will inform any affected guilds/parties.  <p><table width="300" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#003366">

And cut the BS about &quot;Legendary does more with less than SI / Trans / RNG.&quot;   There's a reason that people have coined the term Zergendary.

WTF Are you talking about.  Are you slow or just a fucking dumbass.  HASNT SOMEONE ALREADY GONE OVERTHIS?!?!!?  Okay ill try tomake this short and easy to understand.  because **VINDI** can spawn **MULTIPLE TIMES** in the amount of time **STATUE** can spawn **ONCE**, **STATUE CAN SPAWN WHEN VINDI ISNT DUE FOR ANOTHER FEW HOURS** (eve before random spawn times exsisted AMAZINGLY ENOUGH).  If VERANTS goal was to have the guild that killed statue to always have to deal with vindi soon before, then they would have been on the same spawn timer.  If VERANTS goal was to have the guild who killed VINDI to auto get statue, then they would have AT LEAST been on the same spawn timer, but better yet, the death of VINDI would have TRIGGERED the spawn of STATUE (KINDA LIKE IDOL (previously statue) TRIGGERs AOW -- TO KILL AOW YOU MUST KILL IDOL IN OTHER WORDS).  THIS SPAWN TIMER STUFF CAN BE VERY CONFUSING I KNO, SO ITS OKAY IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW  - YOU WILL SOON!<br>

And what is wrong with this?  Nothing, seeing as how killing vindi does not mean you automaticly get first shot at statue (READ ABOVE PARAGRAPH 12 MORE TIMES IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND YET).  We would have pulled vindi if this was the case.<br>

Please read everything before you go posting shit or you look like an idiot.  <br>
<br>
Are the guilds posting here angry because Legendary killed in NToV when they aren't a part of the rotation?  NO!  Get this through your thick skulls!  People here are angry because Legendary cannot/will not kill Aaryonar.  For those of you that have never been in NToV it works differently from most raid zones.  You kill one of the toughest dragons first (Aaryonar) and then you get to kill some easier ones.  The guilds here are pissed because Legendary lacks the skill to kill Aaryonar, so they wait for another guild to kill it then they sneak in and kill easier dragons.  Notice nobody flamed AN when they didn't follow the rotation.  This is because AN proved they could kill Aaryonar.  They proved they belonged in NToV.  Legendary hasn't proved themselves, so they look like fucking newbs when they go in there after Aary is dead and kill easy stuff.  Lilwee has posted like five fucking times that he offered Legendary a shot at Aaryonar.  I talked to you ingame Imotep and you told me something like &quot;We were never given a shot at Aary so now we're just gonna let the zone go FFA.&quot;  That is bullshit and you know it.  Lilwee keeps posting that you were offered a shot at Arry and you turned him down.  Could it be because you know you can't kill Aaryonar?  <br>
<br>
Can guilds on the rotation keep Legendary out of NToV?  Of course not.  Legendary can go in anytime they want.  Will there be anything ever up for Legendary to kill?  Fuck no.  After this little stunt I guarentee the guilds following the rotation never EVER leave a single fucking named up.  Guilds following the rotation will go out of their way every week to make sure Legendary never kills a mob in NToV again.  Grats Legendary you guys really screwed yourselves, over 2 named.<br>

<br>
  Second i would like to adress the Trans is a buncha lot whores comments i been seeing.  So far i see 2 people from legendary that are not loot whores, Sayleth and Imotep.  Why? well, they posted here even under the threat of losing there DKP points, kudos.  Dont fucking call Trans loot whores when your guild leader threatens you with the removal of loot points if you post here, hmmmmm who is the loot whores again?<br>
<br>
  Not that it means anything, but yes we drop IV..no prob.  Grats on Tormax 9 months ago.  I would have to say the the last thing we are scared of is &quot;what legendary can do&quot; or whatever.  What I would love to see is Aary put on a 12-18 hour spawn timer and his only loot is a key to a door to NToV...that woulda taken care of this whole mess.  No key, no entry. Good bye gimp guilds go back to fear/hate. <p><p align="center"><a

That would be fine with us (albeit irritating) that if you could actually break into North by yourself without riding our coattails.  Nobody bitched about it when AN did it.

Shit, Aaryonar was up the entire day on Saturday.  You can crank out 40 people for a Doomshade raid that same day but you cant go kill Aaryonar?

The name of Legendary is synonymous with Zerg, even you know that.  Maybe you got your quantitatives mixed up.  I am sure you meant &quot;killed LESS with MORE!&quot;<br>
<br>
If you want to talk numbers, I'll just run through what the numbers were for some of our first kills.  First Aaryonar kill was with 39 people, first Dozekar kill was with 36, I believe.  First Yelinak kill was with 41, I think.  First Tormax kill was with 40.  You fucking gimps were losing 25 people on flurry drake with a 90 man raid and you come here and try to tell us that you do more with less when compared to RNG/SI or Trans?<br>
<br>
We killed 8 dragons in North in a 2 day span with basically around 40-45 people, while you couldnt get your 60+ man raid to even kill more than 2 dragons in 2 days.  Our 8 dragons were killed on first attempts with exception of Nevederia and Aaryonar to whom we wiped because of drake/hatchling repops.  Nevederia and Aaryonar both fell on the second attempts, unlike the all star heroes that you guys are when trying to kill fucking Dagarn for the 3rd time. <br>
<br>
You are delusional.<br>

You were given many opportunities to work out an arrangement to take a shot at Aary, nobody dicked you around and as a matter of fact no one wanted to keep you out because its better to have all 5 guilds on a rotation, than 4 guilds and a pack of cocksuckers who sit around waiting for Aary to die and then scurry in like rats and vultures.<br>
<br>
Oh and I would think that 4 guilds whose skill and track record is vastly superior to Legendary's and that they happen to be spread out over different time zones could make absolutely sure that everything single thing in N-ToV would be dead as soon as it popped, if it came down to that.<br>

I have always known you to be honest and forward regarding anything. But your post reeks of bullshit bro.<br>
<br>
Legos just keep repeating that you just went to practice flurry drakes and you thought NToV was clear. That's bullshit. I am (or used to be) in a chat channel with 2 legendary members every fucking day since the day chat channels came out. They knew we didn't clear. I've talked to other legendary members that knew that named were up when you went in. Don't try to act like that wasn't legendary's original plan.<br>
<br>
You say Connovar told you RNG was pissed. You trust Connovar, and I have no doubt in my mind that you're not lying about this point. But if that's the case, Connovar is lying to YOU. Slyie trained legendary. Its known. It wasn't intentional, and it would not have even made it to the zone in had someone (I don't know who opened it, it could've been a Transcended or Legendary or a Bog Brigade member) not opened the door. Should she have tried sneak/hiding past the picture hall drakes? Probably not. But you said it yourself, Legendary members told her they were going for named. CoH takes a relatively long time to get a raid force in place (sorry, none of our mages have QS3), especially without a bard with the mage for mana song (I'm kos, same with Challia, Xanthium wasn't online at the time), and so she probably decided she'd try to sneak/hide past the drakes, not knowning they saw through it.<br>
<br>
Should Treefoot have said what he said in ooc? no but he was probably pissed off that a guild who hasn't even killed aary was gimping Transcended's first real shot at NToV since killing Aary 2 months ago. I have no fucking clue what killed Zoobly, I don't know what happened with that, I never even heard about that. Before you tell Airez &quot;well you guys are obviously not kos to CoV&quot; Eashen's guards (as is everything else in NToV sans hatchlings) are KoS to all. You start out KoS to Guardians of Veeshan, and you only get worse.<br>
<br>
The ooc shit got us kicked out of ToV for the day. No excuses. That was our fault. Had it not, we would have most likely just headed into north as per Rynnia's suggestion and cleared the other side, or just jumped right past you gimp motherfuckers.<br>
<br>
You say you didn't wipe to destroyer more than once and didn't wipe to Kriez. well then you guys must have sucked ass against Flurries, because I know I saw legendary members pop up in Bazaar on sunday more than tiwce in Mass. Did you completely wipe out? Probably not, but you lost over a third to over a half of your raid force. I saw at least 1 green flurry take out 20ish of your members. Yeah green flurries are mean, but TWENTY? How bad do your tanks suck at controlling agro? They using FS longswords? You sure they trained a point in taunt?<br>
<br>
You say you never wiped to hatchlings. Then explain to me what was going on on Monday in ToV as I sat at zone in waiting for the ban to be lifted? I was playing around and eventually got bound sight to you in aary's hall. there were a big pile of corpses, with one cleric and a couple monks/necro there. clerics started rezzing, and KoS-CoV folks started dying, so the monks started dragging to the steps. Lot died (including the cleric) and you had to coh another in. You were nearly coffining.<br>
<br>
I admit you made good time clearing to the triplets, it was actually 'average' as opposed to your catapillar's crawl on Sunday. And don't give the excuse it was your first time in ToV. Trans cleared from Aary's hallway to Lady Nev in 8 hours, killing every dragon save vyemm along the way. We didn't wipeout once (according to legendary standards, a wipeout must be coffining, not just camping a cleric as we did on Nev try #1) with a little more than half of Legendary's members.<br>
<br>
Bullshit that Legendary has killed more with less than SI/RNG/Trans. Yeah, people (including myself) joke and flame RNG for having so many people on raids sometimes. But at least they get things done with their numbers. I know they can't very well turn people away. Legendary just endlessly throws themself at a mob until it rolls over and dies from exhaustion.<br>
<br>
Lego approached ME as to Transcended's tactics for killing aary, and one of Legendary's main warriors is roommates with a Transcended member. He saw us kill Aary. He asked me how we did it. And I told him, because its all basically the same tactics, and to be honest, if Legendary killed Roy, good for them, it wouldn't hurt my guild any except maybe to have to wait an extra week. So Legendary tried, using our tactics, with nearly twice as many people as Transcended had, and utterly failed.<br>
<br>
But of course, this was only after agreeing to not deal with roy and just go into North. Yes, Legendary has tried to do this before. It was E/V's turn, and Aary was spooning Vyemm. Legendary officers came to a decision to drop into roy's pit and head for feshlak, but as luck would have it, a GM repopped roy and thankfully saved E/V's dragons from getting Powerleveled.<br>

As for other mobs. Transcended killed Tormax 2nd try first attempt. It wasn't pretty, but it was with damn fewer than Lego had their first try with the same result. Trans has tried Grieg once to my knowledge, maybe twice. The attempt I was on started late, after pwning Vindi/Statue. Due to bad positioning by the MT Grieg kept disrupting the casters and we lost. We decided to call it as it was 2 am and people were getting tired. Transcended has killed IV twice, both times PRIOR to Legendary, yes, thank you. Our 2nd killing was with 9 deaths, again, with less people than Legendary.<br>
<br>
We didn't say you don't have the skill to take down NToV, you did. By wiping 5+ times in 17 or 18 hours combined, and only killing 2 of the 14 possible (well, 10 as Trans had killed 4)<br>
both days with MORE people than Transcended had on both of their days, you just showed the server how much you suck.<br>
<br>
Yes, we are afraid of what legendary can do. God knows if we'll be able to kill anything in North if Legendary keeps Powerleveling the shit out of the flurry drakes and named.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I think it's been said over 10 times now, Legendary DID have that shot for Roy, but your shit-for-brains guildleader Connovar threw it away by sending you into the void with your gimpage. Here's another thing slapnuts. ToV spawns once a week. SI/RNG/AN/Trans will be able to keep you out. And if Lego heads for a popped NToV one day, we won't have to worry. Cuz Aaryonar will still be standing in front, ready to make 70 Zergendary's run for their coffin money. <p><HR>

I think enough has been said by all the previous posters.  What I do know, though, is that I hold Lilwee's words in the highest possible regards.  I am not the only who feels this way. whether you are in RNG or just part of this server.  So, the excuse about never being offered a shot at Roy is complete bullshit.  I would love to see someone even come onto this board and try to directly refute Lilwee on that.  <br>
<br>
Also with all this training bullshit and Trans getting booted from North for a day.  I know from previous experiences that when you have two guilds prepping on the ramp before Roy that it almost always ends in a train.  Even when Si and EV disputed over Roy the first time Si went to attempt Roy, Eashen's guards somehow aggroed on us all.  I beleive its more plausible that it was an accident more then someone trying to intentionally train the North wing.  Yet another poorly mishandeled situation by a GM.  Hell, its easier to get shit resolved over guilds here then it ever will be by an employee of Verant. <p><p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87546"><B>Ombra Darkstrider</B></A><br> Assassin of Sol Invictus<p>

Well, they happened to be watching lego with them, along with another group of people who were watching with bind sight on lego members/ntov mobs.  This is how people knew when lego died to X mob...that and when hordes or lego would pop up in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
And im gonna go with most of the rest of your post being bullshit.<br>
<br>
I do know you didnt wipe to Lord Kre...i was watching from when you killed dagarn till when you guys had cleared the xroads.<br>
<br>
and all this talk about no one letting you into the rotation blah blah blah...you need to kill aary for that to happen.  And as posted multiple times in this thread, RNG was giving you the pop after ours to try it (which would have been tomorrow).  Its pretty stupid that you didnt wait those few days to get your own shot.  You would have been able to PROVE to everyone else that lego can kill aary, then ya would have had the resta the names and wouldnt be bugged about it.  You need to actually KILL aary before people believe you can...not just going around saying you have the strength to like that other guy who posted earlier.  The fact that in 2 days, lego only killed 2 of the easier named in ntov only makes people believe even more that lego is not ready for ntov.  <br>
<br>
Oh and im not sure why killing Tormax 9 months ago is a good thing.  If anything it shows how little lego has advanced in those 9 months.  If anything this shows we are not afraid at all about what legendary can do.  9 months ago trans was doing (wiping) in hot, and we didnt even kill vindi till Jan 5th, this year.  Now i dont know what SI/RNG was doing 9 months ago, but it wasnt ntov..but now those 3 guilds are killing ntov, yet lego is still on tormax as their best velious kill (Tormax &gt; Yelinak IMO, at most they are equal) after 9 months.  OH NO, MY LEGS ARE SHAKING GUYS..LEGSO GONNA BE ABLE TO KILL EMPEROR NEXT MONTH IF THEY CLEAR NORTH ONCE <p><center>
