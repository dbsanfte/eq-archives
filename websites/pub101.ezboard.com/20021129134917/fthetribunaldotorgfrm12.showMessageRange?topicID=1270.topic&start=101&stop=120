There are a few behavior patterns that bother me though, that are displayed by way too many gay people.<br>
<br>
First off, and prolly the biggest one, is when I'm walking around downtown (NYC), you get handed thousands of flyers.  I take them, because these people get paid per stack that they hand out.  Alot of the times, I'll glance at them, and if its something I need, I'll even stop.  Sometimes they're for nudie bars, and I'll look at the girls, then throw them out.  But every once in a while, you'll get handed a flyer from a gay tolerance committee having a big convention somewhere, or a gay art exhibit, and on the flyer is a picture of a man, bent over in front of another man, and you can see he's being penetrated.  Thats disgusting, but its allowed because no one wants to touch the whole gay art thing for the fear of the outlashing any politician would take from the entire gay community.  Now its true this man wouldn't hand this to a little kid, but do you know how many people throw those flyers on the ground?  Do you think they care who sees this?  No.  And what the hell is with gay men thinking they have to talk walk and act like a woman?  I don't care who you're screwing, but walking around with your hand bent at the wrist and fluttering your eyelashes etc.. is just a need for attention.  &quot;Look at me!  I'm gay!&quot;  And for ANYONE to say that gay men don't come onto straight men is absurd.  I've had gay guys tell me stuff like &quot;You never know till you try.&quot; and all this other bull crap.. there does come a point where you can't be polite about it.  Then they get offended when you finally resort to being nasty to get them away from you.  &quot;My girlfriend is here.&quot;  &quot;So?  She can join too!&quot;  &quot;I'm not into that sort of thing.&quot; &quot;You might like it!&quot; &quot;Get the hell away from me you flamer.. I'm freaking straight.&quot;  &quot;&lt;Insert rude comments from someone offended&gt;&quot;<br>
<br>
And as far as the whole lesbian thing goes.. its not any less wrong to someone who thinks being a fag is wrong.  The only difference is, its two women, both of which we'd prolly want to have sex with.  Having them both at once would make it that much better.<br>
<br>
And the day a guy can cum in another guy and make a baby, you'll prove to me that its natural.  Till then, its just a sexual fetish.  Nothing good can come of same sex partner sex.<br>
<br>
Oh and if I pissed you off, too bad.  Its called freedom of speech.  Enjoy. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
Political correctness has caused a backlash movement of anti-correctness.  Which unfortunately, all the &quot;cool kids&quot; have now adopted.  No longer can someone state they are offended by something for fear of being labeled politically correct.<br>
<br>
So, who has more rights to state their opinions?  The offender or the offended?  Neither really.  If you  have a right to spout drivel, then I better goddamn have a right to tell you to STFU!<br>
<br>
Where political correctness took a wrong turn was in legislating how people speak.  Does that apply here?  No.  One group of folks is just stating they don't like how a certain word is used.  Take it for what it's worth.  No one is asking moderators to ban or edit posts (then what would the point of the Flameboard be? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Personally, the use of the word 'gay' is reminiscent of a younger child trying to be cool with the big kids by using one of their words.  Perhaps it also used to identify you as being one of 'Us' (i.e. heterosexual) and not 'Them' (i.e. homosexual).  Very often commonality and social bonds are formed not by what someone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but what they are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  So, a person seeking acceptance by a particular group might have more luck by identifying them self as being 'not' something, rather than by identifying with what they actually are.<br>
<br>
However, this 'Us' vs. 'Them' mentality, has an isolating effect on society as a whole.  People need to realize that many issues are not black and white – particularly this one.  There are many people who are not 100% gay or straight.  I would even go so far as to say most people aren’t 100% one or the other.  If that is the case, then it becomes easy to see why there is such a backlash when addressing this topic.  Because many feel threatened by their own recessive sexual tendencies.<br>
<br>
Back to the point of this post – Stating you do not like the vernacular use of the word ‘gay’ is not political correctness.  You can value that person’s opinion and discontinue such use or, you can be an ass an ignore the plethora of other words which can be used to say the same thing in its place.  Now, if someone attempted pass a law banning certain usages of the word ‘gay’, that would most certainly be political correctness.<br>

<br>
I think there are only a few select communities that go out of their way to flaunt their 'gayness'. But by and by, I think many are intermingled into all of our communities and just want to be accepted. This includes rights such as adoption and marriage. Why are gay marriages outlawed? It's social contract between two people. The only reason it is outlawed is because of biblethumpers and the conservative right of America. <br>
<br>
Imagine not being able to marry the one you love because someone, somewhere thinks it's an abomination against God. (The same could be said of interracial marriages many years ago)<br>

It was a binding contract put on women by men to insure they wouldnt be allowed to sleep with anyone else, while men were allowed to sleep with multiple partners. Women were seen as property, as such, to actually take care of some women and marry them, fathers would often pay a dowry to the male, be it camel or gold. <br>
<br>
Marriage has always been about creating a family and creating offspring. It has been twisted but marriage was originally designed as a way to mark and keep women locked to their husbands to insure his offspring.<br>
<br>
Dont kid yourself and say its a social contract, its that now because we arent allowed to say its to create families because not everyone who gets married creates children. If people actually gave more respect to marriage, there wouldnt be so many fucked up kids of divorce and single parents.<br>
<br>
So its the downfall of marriage to blame for everything and lack of a strong male figure in young men's lives. Without that male figure they tend to associate with their mother and then run a hotel in which they stab people in the showers! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udarcrainfalling.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darcrain Falling</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/11/02 9:11:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This thread</span><hr size=1> For estevan and his bum disease, hope you get better one day.<br>

Title: Love Among the Sailors<br>
Album: Bright Red<br>
 <br>
There is a hot wind blowing<br>
it moves across the oceans and into every port.<br>
A plague. A black plague. There's danger everywhere<br>
And you've been sailing.<br>
<br>
And you're all alone on an island now tuning in.<br>
Did you think this was the way<br>
Your world would end?<br>
Hombres. Sailors. Comrades.<br>
<br>
There is no pure land now. No safe place.<br>
And we stand here on the pier<br>
Watching you drown.<br>
Love among the sailors.<br>
Love among the sailors.<br>
<br>
There is a hot wind blowing.<br>
Plague drifts across the oceans.<br>
And if this is the work of an angry god<br>
I want to look into his angry face.<br>
There is no pure land now. No safe place.<br>

This first post and topic of this thread is a wonderful example.  If you don't get it, maybe you aren't as fucking intelligent as you thought you were.  <br>

Your entitled to your opinion of course, but most people not being 100% straight or gay is a far fetched propagandizing type statement. Until you have some type of facts to back this up (which, I doubt you could produce), this is a false illogical premise based solely on your own observations, which are greatly biased and possibly self-fulfilling. <br>

This is the typical homosexual argument when faced with people that feel homosexuality is immoral and offensive. It's a cop-out poor excuse, that again, is neither backed by any factual data or reality. It is simply an opinion, and one that may be based upon YOUR own fears. Just becuase this is spoused over and over again by popular culture seeking to promote the acceptance of a homosexual lifestyle as &quot;normal&quot; doesn't make it true. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213"><center><img src="http://kelli-gathered.freeservers.com/images/kellisig2.gif" pu border=0></center></a><br><a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/bthegathered"><center><img src="http://kelli-gathered.freeservers.com/images/thegath1.gif" pu border=0></center></a>

And Wolvar, love the tshirt thing, but to me it seems the dragon is fucking another dragon, if ya look its claws seem to be on like rocks or something, but if yer twisted enough like me, ya see those are legs being bent at the knees and the dragon is thrusting the hell out of a another dragon, probably talking dirty to the dragon too, but the question is, is that dragon fucking another male dragon or a female one?

<br>
back in the 50's it would be an outrage for a girl to marry a black man, people even went so far as to quote the bible when argueing how white people were better than black people.  Now in 00's almost all of the racial prejudices are gone except for isolated cases.<br>
<br>
It will be the same way for homophobes soon, people who cling onto tired prejudices will be - and have always been - the scum of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a question for you haters, if you ever plan to have a child, what will you do if he or she is gay?  There is about a 1/10 chance that your little Johhny will like other boys in his school.  Are you going to beat him straight?  Are you going to disown him?  Think about that, even though I don't give a fuck what any of you think.<br>
