I truly believe many police who become cops do so to help people. I have a few friends who are policemen. They aren't my &quot;cop&quot; friends, they are just my friends who are policemen for a living. One way to avoid hassle is DON'T BREAK THE FUCKING LAW! Another way is to know your rights! I have a friend who has gotten out of every traffic violation he has gone to court for by knowing his rights. No, he is NOT a lawyer!

<br>
i was in bulgaria for just a week when i went out on a split(missionary jargon for working with different people) with one of my friends from the mtc(missionary training center) who had been there as long as i had. we had an appointment in a nasty part of sofia called druzhba(friendship, although ironic, cause it was the UNfriendliest place in the whole city). we had only been there a week, didnt really speak the language, and didnt have our discussions memorized yet. we sat down in the shade outside of the apartment building to brush up on the discussion, and to chitchat about how our first week had gone so far. after a few minutes, this cop walks by and asks what were doing. we try to say were waiting for an appointment, and just hanging out. he started to freak out, hands waving everywhere. a lady with a baby walked by and stopped. the cop asked her if we were annoying her. she slapped her baby( no shit, we did a double take too when we saw this), and said we were making her baby cry. the cop ran us off from there. we thought we were being sneaky when we doubled back around the building, and tried coming at it from the rear, no go, the cop was waiting for us there. this time it got really interesting, cause he really started to freak out, shouting, hand waving, and finally he pulled his gun on us, and told us to get lost. we got lost.<br>
<br>
fast forward 10 months, same area. fluent command of the language...  a car full of cops comes screaming towards us(were on a sidewalk), and im thinking that the cop driving the car wont come up on the sidewalk. wrong. my companion grabs me out of the way, and then the cops start to harrass us, asking for our papers,passports,drivers liscences, etc. they take off when another car full of cops drives by, says they have beer, and are going to watch a soccer match.<br>
<br>
fast forward a couple more months. police harrasment of missionaries comes to a head, when cops start to harrass U.S. embassy personnel who dress a lot like missionaries. during january/february, all police harrasment stops, and they all start treating us nice, when it is later confirmed through the embassy that the U.S. sectratary of state gave the president of bulgaria a call and said to back off the missionaries.<br>
<br>
fast forward a month or two.... i come home for lunch, when i get a phone call from the local precinct asking me to come on over for a little chit chat. it appears that one of our investigators misunderstood would you like to be baptized, for, if you dont get baptized, were going to burn your apartment up, kill your dog, and rape your invalid grandmother. the cops in this instance were trying not to laugh the whole time, cause they thought it was as ludicrous as we did.<br>
<br>
fast forward to summer of '95, still in bulgaria... my companion (who had just arrived in country, and didnt know his ass from a hole in the wall yet) and i run across an old lady who cant leave her apartment. she asks us to do her shopping for her, and get her medicene. her neighbors dont take too kindly to this, and call is made to the cops saying that a couple of mormon assasins are trying to kill an old lady by poisoning her food. (believe me, after having tasted her cooking, she wouldnt need any help from us to have killed her. that was some nasty shit). the cops come busting in the apartment, and arrest us for attempted murder. they drag us down to the station house for interragation. since i was the only one who spoke the language, it was decided that i would do the interview, and my companion would read the latest newsweek in the holding cell. 3 hours, 6 discussions, and 1 book of mormon later, we were released, laughs were shared, and handshakes exchanged.<br>
<br>
flash forward 2 years. im back in bulgaria, staying with a couple of friends. the cops dont like the fact that a couple of guys are staying with 2 girls with whom they are not married. in the middle of the night, there is a loud banging on the door, and we go through the whole process of passport indentification again. on the flip side, the next day when the girls mother hears about this, she calls her brother, who allegedly is the area mob boss, and that afternoon, we had the cops at the door again, apologizing for having disturbed us. <p>Vaseel Doomherald 51 minstrel<br>Wittles Woodfurfun 51 champion<br>

I once got pulled over for doing 65 in a 20.  Yeah...you read that right, I more than tripled the speed limit.  Luckily, it was 6am, I was wearing my ski patrol vest, and generally acted clueless.  Cop yelled at me for turning off my car, saying all my passengers (other ski patrollers...some in vests) were going to freeze to death.  Then he ran my license, came back, asked me if it was a fake ID a couple times, and went and ran it again.  After 20 or so minutes waiting for him, he came back to my car and said &quot;Now, the next time you come through here, you'd better be going slower&quot;......and let me go.<br>

I've had nothing but bad experiences with cops, but mostly because I had a few semi-offensive bumper stickers and the asshole cops would make up reasons to pull me over. Like, &quot;Your headlight is out&quot; when I got out and looked at my headlight it was fine, but he says it was out and gave me a ticket. So I fucked his daughter.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufilanfyretracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beam me up, Scotty!</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/3/01 8:01:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=36>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/pic01.jpg Width=192 height=280></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cops</span><hr size=1> WOW i honda can light em up?  arent they little 4 banger crap boxes.<br>

<br>
They just shoot you.<br>
<br>
Other than that they appear to think that authority is being unpleasant......<br>
<br>
I had a good experience, I used to work as a bouncer on the door of a pub.<br>
<br>
A guy was inside feeling up women (he was REALLY drunk) so I threw him out (actually I used his face to open the doors) i dont like people that feel up women without permission.<br>
<br>
Well anyway we get outside and he mumbles some stuff (what I should have done was go back inside and close the door) throws a messy punch, I hit him with my elbow... this is considered attacking with a weapon because it's really hard. dont believe me? Fold up your arm real tight and then knock on your elbow.<br>
<br>
well anyway I broke his nose and collar bone and he was unconcious for about a minute, this I am not proud of because it is really not hard to knock out a drunk person.<br>
<br>
Well I called the police and told them what happened (except I hit him with my fist), the guy wanted me charged so the cops said, sure but you get to spend the weekend in Jail.... he was dumbfounded. The guy said well the bouncer called us, you are really drunk and when it gets to court it will be thrown out. So you still want to charge him?<br>

Lawyers are not assholes.<br>

People are assholes. Plain and simple, no matter what they do for a living, some people are just self-involved pricks who have no sense of personal ethics or even a molecule of empathy for other human beings. Most cops I have met are nice people. Most lawyers I have met are nice people. It's just that when you meet a cop or a lawyer who is one of the assholes of the world, they have a lot more power to fuck you over than, say, the fry cook at McDonald's. <p>Einthe MacBuff<BR>Diamond Katana<BR>Shaman of the Tribunal<BR>"Irish Diplomacy: The ability to tell someone to go to Hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=144.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=144.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=144.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=144.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=144.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=144.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=144.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=144.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm33">Spell Traders<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm8">Cogito's Whacky Woondarland<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm2">Admin Stuff<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <table border=0><tr><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
