We were to roll on the robe, if it dropped, sure enough after about 1 hour or so it dropped, then he looted it, without rolling, and disband the group.  I sent him a tell, why did you do that man?, he responded, shut the hell up nOObie.  So i petitioned, and threatened to tell Revolution but he said he didnt care, cause only reason hes in the guild is to get his epic then he is going to leave.

Did u send her/him a /t for no apparent reason saying &quot;I got a guardian robe&quot; and she/he decided to waste time posting here hoping to make your life hard?<br>
<br>
Sounds more like he/she was in the group and saw the loot message maybe?<br>
<br>
Qanto quilty as charged in my eyes, he sounds like a gimp. Revo's not known to tolerate losers so it could be /bye parasite newb. BTW Revo people, has Qanto talked about getting his epic in /guild or anything. This could be another way of verifying the posters infomation :P <br>

Topic has been discussed, dealt with and investigated.  <br>

Thanks for the post though..<br>
<br>
BTW..<br>
<br>
Who's your cleric?<br>
Why do you prefer he remain anon in the first place?<br>
<br>
If someone has wronged you, by all means post away...but dont be a coward and rfuse to post your clerics name that was supposedly involved in the incident.<br>
<br>
Guardian Robe is lore/no drop correct?  Why did Quanto have one of these already when we tossed him his invite...why would he have been camping a second?<br>
<br>
Why was Quanto fighting in skyshrine once guilded under a Revolution tag when that goes haywire with our current faction and he's always been ally in ToV?<br>
