To expect anyone else to combat your problems is setting your expectations far to high, since even you are unwilling to face them yourself.<br>
<br>
I can tell you what you should or should not be offended by, just as much as you have a right to tell me how I should speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, if you really want to strive for peace and understanding, you must do your part, and can not ignore both ends of the spectrum.<br>
<br>
It is very obvious that you are wilfully being offended.  So be offended, I've long realized that there is nothing I can do to prevent people from being offended, it is only within their own power to prevent.<br>
<br>
So are you powerless to your ignorance, or are you just lazy to your responsibility or is it that you care nothing about peace and understanding?<br>

If you are offended by what I write from here on out, tough luck but if I am to progress in this discussion I have to stop beating around the bush.<br>
<br>
I will say here and now that you Wenin, as a white person living in America (or so I have to assume), can and never will understand what I am talking about.  I didn't coin the phrase Oriental. White people did.  I did not make up these images that I have explained before.  White people did.  The fact that you, along with those who agree with you, still see nothing wrong with the usage of this word and attributing it to any failing on my part shows a lack of understanding, sensitivity, and just common sense.  You claim that it's just a word etc.  To you it's just a word, to me it's an antiquated racial classification.  Despite this, you see nothing wrong with this and yet somehow see yourself as not racist.<br>
<br>
Let's take another word: Negro.  It's just a word right?  It's not full of the hatred that the word nigger seems to evoke in your minds.  But let's see you go up to a bunch of black people and say &quot;I want to call you Negros&quot;  and then try to explain to them it's just a word.  I predict it wouldn't fly very well.<br>
<br>
It's people similar to you that fail to try and understand those who aren't white, that maybe they are offended for real reasons yet you just chalk it up to just words, who are the people who really are racist but fall short of seeing it as it seems perfectly normal to you.<br>
<br>
Oh and yes, I find colored to be an offensive word too as it is a word created by white people to denote people who aren't white. Yet white is a color too now isn't it?  I am disappointed that people don't understand that this is a term made by white people to mean &quot;not us&quot; and how it can very well be offensive and racist.<br>
<br>
And I  know most of you have drawn conclusions but I will say that no, I bear no animosity towards white people. But I can laugh at them when they claim they aren't racist.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile,  all across the (western) world, I see news reports of people avoiding China Towns because they are afraid of SARS.  Yes, that makes a lot of sense.  And if you can't see smatterings of racism in here, I pity you.<br>
<br>
PS Tuwy - lol  Actually I think those shops excude the stereotype of the typical exotic dragon lady thing I mentioned earlier.  Also, since you are in the bay area, you can run an informal survey at stanford and berkeley and maybe you see what I mean to the reactions of the word Oriental.<br>

<br>
I blame the media for watering out and creating a indistinguishable mess of racism, discrimination and prejudice - these days they seem to be synonymous in the media. Racism means that people think they come from a better race than yourself, that their genes are better, that they're better than you because of genetic superiority - that your very birth meant something sub-standard saw light.<br>
<br>

<br>
What I fail to see is how &quot;oriental&quot; is any worse than &quot;asian&quot; if your beef with it is that it's a word which is used to someone classify [the generic] you as non-white.<br>
<br>
Semantics aside, however, I think any time you're in a minority group and the majority group says/does something to remind you that you're different, it has to make you uncomfortable even if the intent isn't there.  Whether its being a woman in male-dominated arena and being called &quot;honey&quot; all the time, or being non-WASP in America/Europe and being singled out by your ethnicity, or anything else, I suppose. <br>
<br>
I'll say again, however, that I believe the speaker's intent has to be factored in along with what they say when you're trying to decide how to feel about something that was said.  If you KNOW they didn't mean to single you out, or insult, a casual education is in order; if they keep it up, then go off the handle.<br>
<br>
As for us all being &quot;racist&quot;, I wouldn't say that; i'd be a bit more generic, however, and say that all people are discriminatory is some form or another.  As much as that's not something MOST people would be proud of (or even aware of, as it's mostly unintentional), I think it's partly the &quot;nature of the beast&quot;.  Don't forget that we're 98.X% chimp (or whatever) and while our brains took an evolutionary turn which opened HUGE doors for us about 200,000 years or so ago, we're still social animals which form small competitive groups.  The concept of &quot;not a member of my group/family/village/country/race/whatever&quot; is pretty well ingrained in us, and something that infants recognize before they can even speak.  We can only hope to be enlightened enough to avoid/suppress these natural tendancies wherever possible.<br>
<br>
None of that applies to the &quot;i'm afraid of a group of black guys walking down a dark street at night in a city&quot;; that is stereotyping and is based on personal and communal experience.  And it rarely has to do with the color of the skin; I'd be just as nervous seeing a pack of 17-22 year old white guys sauntering down a dark street late at night in a city if I were alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ladmovonwallace>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 2788<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/03 2:49:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm a racist</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->Ladmo,<br>

I post here, not on the flameboard, the reason being this forum is for discussion not inflammatory posts like the one you just posted to me which serves no point if you're actually discussing a subject. There's a difference about getting carried away once in a while and posting here in the way you do.<br>

Untill today I have never heard of this being an offensive term. Being Canadian I tend to think my American neigbours down below are usually very arogant in their wordly views and tend to live in a bubble this is from my experience dealign with 99 percent of americans i have met over the years from the industry that i work in. Today I had chinese noodle soup (the dried crap that cooks in 2 min) and it was oriental flavor, now I firmly believe that people choose to get ofended because they want to be offended, I have hear tons of crap working in bars over the years that really does not phase me in any way. I dont give a shit and caring over words is a futile waste of energy. If the noodles were marketed as Nip noodles Chink flavor I would find that unappealing for my taste buds just as much as I would steer clear of pop named Nigger Juice.<br>

 IN RL I do not go out of my way to offend anyone, thats not my goal in life, that doesnt mean I havent offended people. People post stats that black crime is prevalent in comunities such as compton and thats racist, but where are the white people? they moved most likely as I would not want to live in a crime infested area in the first place. Theres an excelent point in the movie Traffic, When  all the arrests made for crack cocain dealers are black majority of the time people get put into pre defined roles, if every white person goes upto a black person and says got any crack? know where I can get it? 1000 times being asked chances are he's gonna turn into a peddler if the shoe fits..well its something like that I cant remember it word for word but you get the idea. <br>
<br>
Everyone has some sort of prejudice in them from RL experiences and the sub consious mind, Maki no offence but theres 2 sides to every story and when you say you were detained in an airport sometimes its not your look but your attitude, if you believe strongly enough you will be stoped and searched, chances are you will be. If you really want to feel free in airports move upto Canada, we dont seem to give a shit about anything. <p>Sir Lumaden Rocks<br>

I'm a BlahBlah-American from the country of WhoGivesAShit. Well, no you're not. If you live in America you're an American, if you live in Great Britian you're British. The word in front of the hyphan might be your heritage, but if you can't get past it then you are a sad idiot living in the past, and you're setting yourself up to be offended. Ask yourself why you or your parents or grandparents were FROM and are not IN whatever hyphan word you claim. I'll tell you why, because where ever that FROM was it sucked. That's why you ARE where you are.<br>
<br>
So to be perfectly anti-PC, shut the fuck up already about where people are from and concentrate are who they are. My great grandmother thought her country sucked ass, so she moved here. I thank god every day she did.<br>
<br>
My best friend is an American who was smuggled into this country from some Calcutta shithole I can't even begin to imagine via three different countries. He spent 12 years earning his US citizenship. I asked him once if he considered himself Indian-American. He says, &quot;Dude, I'm an American, just like you&quot;. Fucking A right.<br>
<br>
Might want to take a good look at your Asian pride, African pride, white pride or whatever &quot;pride&quot; you think you get from your heritage. It's probably hiolding you back much more than it empowers you. That kind of pride sounds like a losing situation to me.

Legal and illegal aliens in this country are Americans. Why wouldn't they be? They made the choice to leave whatever shithole they used to call home for a chance to start fresh. That takes alot of courage.

That made absolutely no sense whatsoever.    Did you just try stringing a bunch of insults together and capping it off with &quot;I'm not going to cry, you are!&quot;?  Cause that is just pathetic.<br>
<br>
I'm not the one railing against my heritage yet simultaneously proclaiming myself to be an American.<br>
<br>
Now, according to you &quot;I suck as a person that I currently am&quot;.  Perhaps you can tell me what person I am, and how do I suck at it.  Wait, didn't you just say that no dork can tell you who you are?  This just gets sadder and sadder.  I can see that you are really struggling to formulate an insult, and I know its hard because frankly you can't pin anything on me except your tired &quot;anti-American communist&quot; label which has grown trite and wasn't accurate to begin with.  I am sure that your self-esteem is a fragile thing, so I will just stop here.<br>

It depends on who says the word &quot;Negro&quot; doesn't it?  If a black man goes up and says it to another black man, I would think its gonna fly.  Now WHO is the racist here?  Thats right, the NEGROES YOU SAID IT TO.  I think you need to get your racism straight and realize the bigotry you live in.<br>

NO NO NO its people similar to YOU that will NEVER allow a white person to try and make amends because you yourself are racist and will not ever give a break to a white person for somehow having to create a word that describes your race!  Whatever the case is, its your fault that you are offended.  Anything can be offensive to someone, and you do not have the right to *not* be offended.  You have no right to impose that restriction on another person's freedom of speech.<br>

Let me ask you a question...Are you somehow ashamed that you are not white?  Is it that you wish to be white and are racist against yourself?  If thats not the case then why are you disturbed to be called &quot;asian&quot; or &quot;oriental&quot; (a simple description of the race that you ARE)? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alajan>Alajan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sly Rake</span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/24/03 2:10:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm a racist</span><hr size=1> Words are such a strange thing.
