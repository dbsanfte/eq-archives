Illiterate people in the Middle East are left to believe these cartoons to be truthful.<br>

Radgen, I found you're right.

<br>
Shuruga... yeah, in the Middle Ages the Middle East was a center of culture and intellectual advancement.  Since then, it has gone nowhere... now the Middle East is characterized by tyranny, tribal feuding, and widespread political unrest.  Your point?<br>
<br>
Wenin's one liner was not racist, it was simply observing a simple fact - that many, many Muslims (I'll replace Arab with Muslim since it is the word I should have used) find it completely acceptable and even expected to use terroristic violence as a political tool.  When a group of people are overwhelmingly characterized by a tendency, practice it (with the full practical, if not publically verbal, support of their government), and preach it, identifying that tendency is merely being practical... not racist.<br>
<br>
/agree Wenin<br>
<br>
Sad thing is, even the educated, intelligent Muslims/Arabs/Middle Eastererns believe that stuff too... the man who committed the LA El Al shootings on July 4th had reportedly ranted constantly about how Israel was trying to destroy Egypt by sending them shiploads of whores infected with AIDS, and other such stories... their leaders lie almost pathologically (call it propoganda if you want, its still the same thing) in their fanatical frenzy to gain unswerving support against Israel and the United States.<br>
<br>
Men like this Imam are amazing beacons of hope in an otherwise extremely dismal political and intellectual landscape.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
&quot;Tolerance... no, a stronger word: ACCEPTANCE of others is the best way to overcome socio-economic and religio-cultural barriers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another quote from NR's website:<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no problem with American Muslims who demand that American tolerance and acceptance be extended to them. What I do have a problem with are those who wrap themselves up in the American language of tolerance and acceptance when, in their hearts, they are sworn opponents of the society that offers it.&quot; - Jonah Goldberg<br>
<br>
He is talking about disloyalty by Americans, but the principle is the same...  Israeli offers open acceptance, Palestinians say, &quot;Yes, we want that, we want acceptance and tolerance.&quot;  Then they take the Israeli work permits, talk about coexistence, and send suicide bombers over to blast Israelis into the afterlife.  Israel is happy to co-exist.  Palestinians are not.  They are the ones who refuse to tolerate and accept.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just took a poli sci class taught by a lawyer who pioneered the &quot;cultural defense&quot; in court, and can cite to you MANY cases where the defendant's sole crime was his/her race, religion, or economic background. In some cases, it is more important to be FAIR than CORRECT.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which University do you attend, if I may ask?  I would also love to hear about some of these cases... please restrict yourself to the last 30 years, thanks.<br>
<br>
As for your final statement, I beg to differ.  In matters of justice, being CORRECT is the very essence of being FAIR.  I am really, truly mystified by what you are trying to say here... it makes no sense to me.  Clarify if you like, I'd love to see some of this stuff...<br>
<br>
I find the &quot;cultural defense&quot; to be the most ridiculous kind of cop-out imaginable.  If the victim's sole crime is his or her race, why the hell is he or she on trial?  Last time I checked, you can't try someone because of their race, religion, or economic background... so there must be a crime involved, hmm?  If the crime was completely trumped up, you have a point.  Show me such a case, I would love to see it.  If the crime was real, the &quot;cultural defense&quot; is merely a tool of a chronically irresponsible criminal... <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

I live in Northern California, and arabs and muslims (these are two different things) number among the educated and enlightened, and are productive members of the community.  <br>
<br>
Also consider: many countries in the middle east (let's include Iran/Iraq for now) are considered third world countries.  The governments cannot afford to educate all of the poor.  If you want to teach them western ideals, maybe a western country (or some western countries) should fork up some cash, or teachers, or curricula, to help the process along.  Those with the means should help those who can't afford it, right?<br>
<br>
I concede that there is a generally anti-American sentiment in most Arab/Muslim countries.  However, I strongly believe that if an effort is made to inform them, some sort of medium ground can be reached.  90% of the people there are only surviving, and don't know what to believe.  If the problem, as you insist, is their education, why don't we educate them?  Why don't we also educate ourselves about people of different origin than ours?

<br>
While lack of education and poverty is definitely a problem over there, it is not the catalyst for terrorism.  I'll repeat - poverty, lack of education, and political instability DO NOT cause terrorism.  If that were the case, you would be seeing a lot of suicide bombers coming from sub-Saharan Africa, and quite a few other places.  Oh, and in case you weren't checking, we have been sending them money for food and education for a very long time now.  LOTS of money.  They take it, then turn around and demonize us even more.<br>
<br>
Wenin is absolutely correct.  They have money coming out the wazoo.  They just spend it all on the ruling elite and their pet projects - not education for the masses.  Part and parcely of the whole &quot;tyrannical, tribal, behind the times government&quot; kind of thing.<br>
<br>
Another quote from NR that addresses your point well, I think:<br>
<br>
&quot;In our current conflict, our enemies are all Muslims. I don't believe that our enemy is Islam, though. Islam came up in a primitive, tribal society that has never since enjoyed any real political progress. The Arabs are still primitive and tribal today; but their failure to create modern nation-states arises from their ancient habits of thought, behavior and social exchange, and from geographical constraints, not from anything in Islam. Indeed, those Arab countries — Iraq, Syria — that are established on secular principles are even more degraded and corrupt than the theocracies.&quot; <br>

Where in some countries, the ruling people, can barely afford that 7th palace, and they have to use silver door handles, instead of the more favored gold.  Or where they are just unable to build a proper place to execute their own people, so instead they use a soccar stadium built by foreign money.<br>
<br>
Yeah cry me a river about their poverty.  No you don't have a grip, and I didn't even say they need to be taught western ideals.  They just need to be taught to think on their own, unless you wish to claim that is only a western ideal.<br>
<br>
Also we're not talking about Muslims and Arabs that live in the US.  I'd bet that the great majority of Muslims and Arabs that have moved to live in the US, LOVE the US.  They are most likely people that have fled the horrible living conditions in the Middle East, or from the oppressive governments.  When I look at a Muslim or an Arab, I don't see a terrorist.  I see a person.  But when I look at a crowd of common people protesting in Palestine, burning US flags, dressing their kids up as living bombs, I see an ill informed group of people that are dangerous.<br>
