You popped a mob you couldn’t take; you didn’t even have enough people on line, and then claim a lonely bound cleric can run back in alone, naked to do CR?  Believe me, watching you run back in to drag corpses out (which would train RF on us) would be pretty entertaining to me).   Then when the dragon does fall which makes CR for you guys hella easier for you, you don’t let Qudos keep the heart which means you have another cleric to compete with ragefire the next time around.  Qudos was even willing to give up his pearl to pop the RF for you. <br>
<br>
Bottom line is, we all learned something today, cleric who turns in pearl first gets the RF, which now we know clears up alot of confusion. <br>

<br>
The happenings in this game may not be real, but they take <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> real time</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and I don't know about you but my time is worth something.<br>
<br>
Ganking a Ragefire spawn is just plain greedy.  If you spawn Ragefire it should be yours.  Yours to kill or yours to let despawn.  Doesn't matter if it's wasteful or not, you didn't do the work so <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you don't take the earnings</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Ragefire is stupid and the guilds should work together to figure out a system for him.  But, Makino is right, that will never work; the first time one of them sees they can get ahead by not abiding to an agreement they will break it.<br>
<br>
As for Verant's policy on Ragefire here is what I have been told by CS staff:<br>
<br>
1) Whoever spawns Ragefire owns him until they fail.  They were unclear on what &quot;fail&quot; meant.  Does that mean if the raid party dies even when they have to recoup and try again they lose rights to him?<br>
<br>
2) Fire Giants are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> singe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spawns and not a set.<br>
<br>
However just because these are the rules doesn't mean people have to be selfish.  It doesn't matter if this is a game, show some decency and respect towards each other.<br>

<br>
I was the first one up there I think and CoH'd Nerple up. We were doing SS with Iluna and then some other's joined the group I believe in sharing, but the group had a bit to much fun and we dyed a few times so I asked Nerple to resurrect, what she did without hesitating. I never announced RF spawned, as I have been told I should never have told RF was up in /g say, for that I am very sorry. Nerple asked for help I offered mine, but I did not feel that we had 1 team, basically a Necro 2 Clerics  and an SK Mage cant do RF there were not many more SI when EV spawned him I joined them, I might not agree with taking him but when he is spawned, I can not stay around and watch my loyalty is with EV at that moment if SI had enough people I would helped them, because Nerple has been kind to me for to many times to mention, I first met her ( I do not care who hi is in RL I only now her as Nerple who I like very much) in OT I always have been very found of her, I grouped up a few times with her lately and what happened that time made me very sad. <br>
<br>
Witch later resulted in a fight with a good friend of mine, just because I had a very sad day and mood.<br>
<br>
When you say capable force well EV did it with 8 people so I only can imagine knowing a few comps that they can do it to, as some mentioned Col and Nyrkl where there probably more Col has Epiq and can battle rez. <br>
<br>
For the amount of people online well every time I do /who all GUILD it seems there are to many playing anon. Since when I say hi I get answers but no one is on who, I know for one I haven’t seen Thinkness wearing his tag for hmm very long time but I see him every day, and there are allot more all those wizards clerics enchanters and druids are always seem to be anon, and add the winks....<br>
<br>
<br>
So I think they could of handled RF, Legendary has good people in it but some are just assholes and as every other guild has their own, never the less I know legendary dose not care for my opinion and I am ok with that, I do care about all opinions, if I do something wrong I would like to be proven wrong and or realize my self and when either of the 2 happens i apologise, I know Qudos is a good guy, I think it might be the you have to have it (how often did I not hear no we don’t need that rogue he has no RB yet)  and rest but as he said it was wrong to do it ,YES IT WAS. For some reason thou I cant imagine it was his idea to attack so who ever FUCKD UP should get what he/se deserves....<br>

<br>
Here is how everything happened, from the information I gathered. I'm going to put it in SI's perspective.<br>
<br>
SI thought :<br>
<br>
What do we know?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *We know Ragefire despawns after 30 minutes after handing in the pearl*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
What else do we know?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *We know that we cannot kill Ragefire*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Anything else?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *We know that it will take us longer than 30 minutes to 1) die, 2) regroup and rebuff, 3) wait for more people to log on 'hopefully'.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Conclusion :<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *If we hand in this pearl to spawn ragefire, we have lost everything.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
What are our options?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *Give the spawn to Legendary who has 25+ people here, ready and buffed.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Or<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *Risk it. Well, we could spawn Ragefire and die, hope more of our members log on within the following (for sake or argument) 15 minutes.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Or<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *We could ask Legendary for help.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Or<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *We could wait and see what happens.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
What happened?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We handed the item in, knowing we couldn't take him. Knowing we were going to die. Knowing that there was 1 chance in a million that 20 people would have logged on within the time it would have taken for Ragefire to despawn, for a second attempt. We lost.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Now what are our options?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We know that we still don't have enough people online for that second attempt. We know that we just lost Nerple her epic and she has to start again from the beginning. We know that Legendary just killed Ragefire. We know that we can petition them for Ks'ing our spawned mob that we know we would have lost.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Conclusion :<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *We risked everything by handing in the pearl when we knew we were going to die. But we got our Pearl back in the end because Legendary intervened.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
----<br>
I'm sorry to have to say this, but Nerple, or whoever was leading that Ragefire attempt did the wrong thing. They tried to kill something they knew they couldn't kill with the risk that they would have lost Nerple everything.<br>
<br>
Those people who were there from Legendary should have not intervened at all. Nerple would have lost everything, Qudos would have to camp it again, and Legendary would not have been flamed.<br>
<br>
Yeah I'm admitting Legendary did the wrong thing by intervening, and SI did the wrong thing by handing in the pearl to begin with. I'm not going to elicit an apology, because I wasn't there and I wasn't able to make any decisions on behalf of the guild. I was at work, and as Rynnia so rightly said people have other things to do and cannot be expected to be online all the time. Sit back and think about what just happened yesterday. Take into account all possibilities. All possibly outcomes. When you look at it, and be reasonable, both parties made stupid, silly mistakes. <br>
<br>
In my opinion Legendary should not have intervened and if I had been online to make the decision, I would have told them not to engage.<br>
<br>
Ps. Hopkins, You said in a previous post &quot;Aflaming, Legendary had every intention of taking Ragefire the 2nd time that Nerple camped Ragefire and he spawned. Those were there words of Goram.&quot; Those where not my words. My words were - &quot;This seems to be a race. Every top guild on the server are racing to get people here, and it looks like EV are winning&quot;, but I'll not deny that we were wanting to kill Ragefire, and we would have engaged about 5 minutes after EV had already done so. Qudos, as well as Nerple was sitting there from the previous day waiting for it. Whether Nerple 'passed' on Ragefire to Comps the previous spawn was completely irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Revolution : Keep to the topic. Digging up old shit only makes it start to stink more. But off topic I'm only going to say that those 'facts' as you like to call them about Legendary and that Fear fiasco are wrong. Gewel used to be a friend of mine. He was asking me about that Fear raid when we were half way through it. I told him Shissar was up, as was broken golem. I told him that we were killing it for Lime, but she wasn't online at the time. He was well aware that we only left to kill Gore until Lime came on. So saying that shissar spawned after we left, and that we had been gone for 4 hours is a complete lie. But we left, and we shouldn't have, but you still broke the rules of the scheduling board. If you want, take this up in another thread, but stop pulling straws where you can to bring down another guild in a topic it's not suited for.<br>

I have the Pearl, and have camped Ragefire a few times all ready with guildmates, hoping for that magic spawn.  I'm level 54 and can't cast the Rev spell, but with the Epic, I could <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The sad truth is, any Ragefire-capable guild or alliance can do the entire Cleric Epic (up to Ragefire) in one day.  The early encounters take one or two people, a couple groups for the Temple kill, then what?  You're looking at Ixblat, who you can spawn all day long with enough enough clerics present, and the King of Chardok, who spawns every couple hours.  If Verant wanted the quest to be truly Epic, they would have put the final battle in a nasty zone where only 5-6 guilds on our server can go.  They also wouldn't allow the item to proc until 56th level.<br>
<br>
Essentially, (you gotta love this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  the Cleric Epic Quest is the Gorge scene from Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail.  &quot;What is thy name?&quot; &quot;What is thy quest?&quot; &quot;What is thy favorite color?&quot; Then, having heard the answers of the guy ahead of you (the answers in this case being detailed instructions on eqcleric and other places walking you through the Epic), you come to Ragefire, blurt out the same color, realize it's not your favorite and correct yourself, and get cast into the gorge as the server crashes.<br>
<br>
I don't think that one or two people camped in Naggy's Lair constitute FCFS.  Every guild has a monk twink who can stay there 24/7. There's not much to be gained by having 20 monks from 20 guilds constantly camped in Naggy's Lair.  They are all going to argue they were first.  <br>
<br>
Verant won't commit to any single stance.  This time they told Qudos he should give up the heart; next time they may tell someone &quot;Congratulations.&quot; Any GM will admit, if pressured a bit, that all of these decisions are case-by-case.  Their own ethics go out the windows on epic spawns.  For example, if something like this had happened over an FBSS, SI would now have another FBSS.  The U.S. government sets the example for this; you find a $100 gold piece off the coast of Florida, good for you; you find billions in gold in that same spot, &quot;Hey, that's ours!&quot; <br>
<br>
Why is it whenever someone mentions a list or scheduling, everyone is quick to point out that SOMEONE won't follow it? You get 25 guilds who are willing to agree to something, and one person welshes, and you call the whole thing off.  People with more character would say, &quot;I don't care if so-and-so lie, cheat, and steal to get ahead; I'm not going to.&quot; Why enforce laws? Why have laws? SOMEONE is going to steal, murder, abuse ... let's all just do it and stop being governed by someone else.  <br>
<br>
Trouble is, the real world has something Verant didn't put in Everquest ... consequences.  EQ isn't policed by Verant (it barely even has rules TO police) but they don't allow the players to police it either (for example, pulling constant trains onto asses). We can come to message boards like this one and talk about right and wrong, but the wrong have just as great a voice as the right.  Schedules and lists give most people a fair shake, and a fair shake is something a few people don't want you to have.  <br>

For some reason you think, if I say we stay out of this we do the right think NO, the right thing to do is to HELP!<br>

I have lost all my respect for your leadership, I am sorry for Qudos<br>

I am very sad that Nerple considers to stop playing, I really hope you won’t stop.<br>

Nerple DONT STOP, you have the pearl once I get back from  work I will come and camp it with you, so you wont have to be lonely<br>

PS I hope there are others that feel same and wont to help Nerple stay in game and only way to keep Nerple is by showing our support, as some one said you only need 1 person to stand up and help to make you feel better.<br>

You already got rid of Lovi, yes she send me a tell she is retiring her cleric and started another char. I hope she is happy now, I hate seeing people go away, there are just to many leaving the game already. <br>

You said it was Nerple's mistake for turning in the pearl too early or without having enough people to take him, but i can gaurantee you would have done the same thing if you spent the time there like nerple did.  If you were not there, Nerple would not have felt rushed or nervous about what to do since she would have been able to calmly and patiently assembled her groups, buff and etc. <br>
<br>
There is nothing really wrong with this quest.  It is just the way people treat it that makes it look bad.  Look at the broken golem in fear.  Im sure if he was in lguk or something it would be the same way, but since hes in fear hes a little harder to get to.  RF is easy to get to since hes in solb.  If this camp was treated with respect by the clerics there would be nothing wrong.  It is like camping Stormfeather kinda. When i was after him, i would go over and check in the area that he spawned and if i saw someone camping him I would just leave. I didnt just sit there with him and hope for him to spawn so i could try to KS him.  If i was a cleric and went to check on ragefire and saw another cleric camping him, i would have just left also.<br>
<br>
Nerple felt rushed to spawn her mob since you guys were there. I bet she was afraid you would take what she has spent a lot of time trying to get done.  Who knows maybe it tensed the players up while fighting RF and effected their playing abilities because of the situation since basically it was like legendary was just watching them while fighting the mob which could make them feel nervous even though you werent actually watching. Hehe. <br>
<br>
Goram. You act like nerple intentionally spawned RF knowing they would lose.  No one would be that stupid or greedy. Well im sure there are some, but nerple isnt.  She wouldnt just spawn him knowing she would lose just so qudos wouldnt get his epic. That wouldnt make any sense.  Nerple felt like he could take RF and thats what she attempted.  Im sure if she had a little more time she would have gotten more help, but that wasn't an option since you guys were there which put pressure on. <br>
<br>
Laotzu im sure if my guild was as big as some others and had enough people on at all times, they would hve been there for nerple right on, but no one is going to make themselves stay on just so we have a certain amount of people online.  Nerple knew she also had friends online that could help her and those friends did come.  IF she was given a little more time, im sure she would have had more people come to her aid.  <br>
<br>
The thing is she felt rushed.  It would have been cool if you had went there and saw nerple was going to attempt RF and backed off for a while.  Like say maybe wait 10 minutes to be generous or maybe talk to nerple and settle the situation.  I would understand if you sat there for 20-30 minutes while nerple just sat there looking for more people to come, but by that time I am sure nerple would know she didnt have the people to do him and she would probably let you guys have it.  Its early and i dont know what im talking about. As usual no sleep for thinky.<br>

I'm telling it how it is. If Hopkins is right about ragefire despawning after 30 minutes, then you guys had failed. You would not have gotten there in time for regroup and fail again.<br>
<br>
What reputation are you talking about Vika? A killstealer?<br>
<br>
Vika - every guild on this server is a kill stealer. Whether it be from a frog in upper guk to a dragon, you still carry the same name. Whether it be 1 person from a guild, or 15 people from a guild. It's the guild that is called the Killstealer, not the individuals actually present. It's sad to say, but that is how it is. And about my leadership abilities - I'm afraid you have me mistaken for someone who actually cares what your opinion of my leadership abilities are. You talk too much.<br>
<br>
Thinkness - Perhaps I percieved myself a little wrong. I had the intention that SI could not have killed ragefire. the word 'owned' was brought up by quite a few people. Perhaps they made bad judgement, who knows. But for something so important to be rushed it was still handled extremely poorly from both parties involved. That's the point I am trying to get across. Do you blame the chicken or the egg? Do you blame the person who started it or the person who ended it?<br>
<br>
Nerple felt pressured. Fair enough, for the completion of one person's epic I'm sure a lot of people would be put under pressure, and for a competitive spawn - hell yes you would feel pressured. But for making that risk to have lost everything was a bad move. So was Legendary's intervention after all SI were dead. And all SI were dead apart from a person who was bound at the corner of the lair. So in retrospect : SI died and lost everything. Legendary intervened - SI gained, Legendary lost. But that's not the real point I'm trying to get across. The real point is that both parties, Legendary and SI did the wrong thing. SI rushed it and lost, Legendary took advantage of it and killed without helping. <br>
<br>
I'll say it again. Legendary should not have done a thing. We've been scorched by the actions of SI before, as have everyone else by some guild or another, and it's sad to say that this is the way the server is. Nobody helps anyone. Everyone hates eachother apart from the small alliances people seem to have. You won't get help from another guild for something as big as this when they are all competing for it.  <p><b>

The right thing to do would have been to help kill the spawn let nerple loot the heart and you would have looked good. Then you could have taken the spawn for Qudos. Which is what you had to do anyway.<br>
<br>
Dont give me this trash about what you should or should not have done. the RIGHT thing to do was to help....<br>
<br>
Dreamroamer was in WW doing the scout quest, his group couldnt handle the spawn so we helped him kill it. There was some brief arguement in guildchat as to what should happen but the consensus was that he should get it (even though he trained us and killed a bunch of people.)<br>
