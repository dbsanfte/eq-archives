The Chinese have stated very clearly that they are hostile to Taiwan, a nation friendly to the U.S.  Why shouldn't we send spy planes to keep an eye on what the Chinese are doing?  As long as we don't intrude on their territory there's no problem.  You could just as well say that the Chinese have a right to blast our spy satellites out of orbit because they can peek into China.  Yeah, the Chinese should just &quot;roll over&quot;, because there isn't a thing they can or should do about planes in international areas besides monitor them, as they were doing.  <br>
<br>
To suggest that it is the American EP3's fault (which was on autopilot) is laughable.  A big, lumbering prop plane, loaded down with sophisticated, expensive, secret electronic equipment makes a sudden move and rams itself into a top of the line fast, maneuverable jet fighter... suuuuure.  So it is abundantly clear that the Chinese pilot was at fault in that particular incident.  He endangered himself and the lives of Americans, in international airspace.  To have the Chinese hold our airmen hostage afterwards was just icing on the cake.  The Chinese should have been the ones to apologize.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Exactly, Kellianne.  Besides, take a look at Hitler's ideologies... they were all over the place.  Hard to label him right or left, better to just say &quot;evil mad dictator&quot; and leave it at that.  And not try to put any modern politicians in his camp, unless they truly deserve it (Hitler apologists, mass murderers, etc.) <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

What I said was WE don't put up with spy planes flying up and down our coasts in international waters, but you expect the Chinese to be all warm and fuzzy about us flying up and down thiers?       <br>
<br>
And if you don't think OUR reaction to such an incident off out shores would not be similar, you are very mistaken.   We would have kept a Chinese crew detained till the incident had been investigated.  Nevermind that we, quite illegally do not allow anything resembling a recon plane anywhere NEAR our shores, international airspace or not.  (Well not exactly true, we claim 200 miles out to be our territory, while international standards only recognizes 12 miles)  <br>
<br>
Of course the collision was the Chinese pilots fault, that was not doubted by anyone, not even the Chinese leaders.  And we did not &quot;apologize&quot; for the incident.  There were several collisions between US and Russian subs in international waters during the Cold War.  9 times out of 10 it was because the US sub was following too close.  Where was our apology for THOSE incidents?  <br>
<br>
In the end BOTH the plane and the crew were shortly sent home.   And Bush sure doesn't seem to be holding much of a grudge.  If anything his attitude toward China has softened.<br>
<br>
And of course mainland China is hostile to Taiwan.  Taiwan is hostile to mainland China.  Taiwan is the remant of the former national government that the communists overthrew.  It was only recently that Taiwan dropped the claim to be a national chinese government(until the early 70's, Taiwan sat in China's UN seat).  That conflict is a hold over from the Chinese civil war.  China considers it still to be an internal matter, so they DO see any US involvement as interferrence in thier affairs.  However we have an interest in a free, independant Taiwan, so like I said, this IS the most likely spark for a US/Chinese military conflict, but it is unlikely.  China and Taiwan have mutually exclusive goals for the future, but neither wants it to come to a fight that would be disaterous for both.  It would take a lot of bad luck and a lot of stupidety by one side or the other.  Not impossible, but they have avoided just such a result for 40 years.<br>

I am very happy to hear that you were in china with your degree rad to double check they could nukes us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Sarcasm aside.....China developed bombs in the 60's this was considered to be China's move forward in &quot;war&quot; technology, however...In 1968 Lin Biao the Chinese leader died...Most research into weapons technology was halted and in the following years the Chinese republic was reformed. An &quot;agriculture first&quot; standpoint was taken up. Their ICBM's were still on the back burner and still just huge piles of junk with war heads on them.<br>
<br>
Supposedly the U.S. by the 60's had ICBM's that could easily hit Russian cities. Yet we still had trouble launching one rocket into space and retrieving it. Infact even when we did get it down pat it still took months of planning and two huge teems of engineers to pull it off. What makes you think in the 60's we could have really struck a city? It was more realistic that our short range missiles in friendly counties closer to Russia would have done the dmg we would be looking for in a Nuclear war....Hence why Cuba war so important.<br>
<br>
Back to the Chinese....As Defense spending again increased in the 80's they began thier missile devlopment again, but as you said before due to lack of testing they really could not be sure if their missiles even worked. Most in the military knew they probably did not work...Simply because of how long the U.S. had spent perfecting our own missiles to be able to even hit a city. <br>
<br>
That was until they were sold U.S. missle guidance specs....Now they dont have a wild card they have a SURE thing. They dont have to be scared anymore because they know they can hit us. Now we have lost the advantage we have enjoyed for so long. We can no longer say we will definetly wipe you out but you probably cant hit us. Now they can....And with China as much as you say they are not our enemies that is something to fear. Thank you again Clinton...<br>

<br>
You have yet to show me ANYTHING that shows a sudden improvement in Chinses missiles.   They were capable of accurately hitting cites in the US since the 80's.  You keep saying that they couldn't, but everything I come accross says they could.  They are STILL only capable of accurately hitting cities.  There has been a gradual increase in their nuclear capabilities since the end of the cultural revolution.  It is doubful, what use a guidance system, designed for a over the pole flight, would be to a Chinese missle of a different design (wt., aerodynamics etc.) would be since they would be useing a trans-pacific flight path.  And it STILL does not help one iota without a good testing program.  If you REALLY want to find a good scapegoat for the advances in Chinese weapon programs, try all the US educated scientists and engineers that were/are involved in thier missile programs.  THAT is where the largest amount of &quot;technology transfer&quot; has occured.  And even now they have only 10-20 of these high end missiles.  (Which is why they don't like the idea of even a minor missile defense system.  It may not be capable of holding off a massive missile attack, but it could very well be quite capable of holding off what the Chinese can throw at us)<br>

Oh and you won't find a link for the submarine collisions.  The incidents are officially classified.  Niether side will admit that they happened, but both sides know they did.<br>
<br>
It was a result of the tactics used during by submarines during the Cold War.  That portion was as close to real war that the US and USSR ever came.  Our subs and thier subs acted under a war footing, doing everything but actually fireing torpedos's at eachother.<br>
<br>
The collisons occured when a one of our fast attack subs were tracking and following a Soviet missile boat.    The attack sub would try to remain undetected (and often did) because the Soviet missile sub would start trying to evade if it saw the US sub.  The biggest blind spot Soviet subs had was really close behind the sub.  This is where US subs would sit when tracking/following Soviet boomers.  The problem is, the US sub had to be really on its toes because if the Soviet sub did anything unexpected the Amercan Sub would be seen or as happened in a few case, a collision would occur.<br>
<br>
As far is known, no collision actually led to a sub sinking.  The reason niether country officially admits to it is the USSR didn't want to admit that US subs could get so close undetected, and the US was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> technically</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the wrong in most cases by purpously approaching another ship so closely without warning.  (international law really doesn't apply to the situation though) <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

And everything you write implies that it is mainly useless to the Chinese. No, you never actually *say* those words, but the tone of your posts definately implies that it was no big deal. Not that I know a whole lot about the matter, but common sense would dictate that the Chinese would not pay for something they did not need, or would not improve what they have already. I am not saying Sol is 100% right in his argument, but the tendency of your posts to be a Clinton apologist leads me to believe you are greatly diminishing the importance of what he did. In addtion, that sub thing makes your facts highly suspect. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

But it is one of those &quot;cannot confirm or deny&quot; things.  It has been admited to by both retired US and Russian sub crewman but no official conformation will come from either government.   They don't deny it either, they just refuse to comment.  These incidents have been known about since as far back as the publishing of the &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; in the early 80's. The plot was fiction(loosely based on an incident with a Soviet Destroyer), but the details on tactics, and descriptions of weapon systems was so accurate, Tom Clancy was interrogated by the Government about how he got his info.<br>
<br>
Did you read much about the Kursk?  it was a Russian sub that sunk last year I think.  Well the Russians at first theorized that the sinking was caused by a collision with a US sub.  They had reason to suspect this, after all it had happened before.  The news services mentioned these incidents when they reported on this.<br>
<br>
Now as to guidance system.  The Chinese may have THOUGHT it would be a great help.  Or they wanted it just to study.  It will help them, but the help will be incremental.  It is not going to overnight turn there missiles into modern wonders.   The net strategic effect is not very substantial.  But it is still something that should not have happened.  It just was no where near treason, or a huge set back to national security.<br>
<br>
I am not apologizeing for Clinton.  What I dislike about Clinton bashing, is the hypocricy and selective nature of it.  Nothing Clinton did is unique.  But all these people seem to think that he is evil incarnate.  They bash him, but don't point fingers at anyone else who did similar things.  He did some boneheaded maneuvers in office.  Allowing the guidance system sale under his watch was just one.  But he is hardly the only one guilty of such slip ups as President.  It makes what he did no less wrong but If your going to call them out, call them ALL out, not just one.  THAT is my point.   None of our modern Presidents has been outstanding, all have been mixed bags.  But the 3 best were Eisenhower, Reagan and Clinton(in that order).  All 3 made some serious mistakes, but in balance all three did a good job running the country.  All 3 left the country in better shape than they left it.<br>

That was my point exactly. Althought that article you cited Elche is hardly credible, imho. <br>
<br>
Rag -- I see your point, and tend to agree with it, at least on a purely philosophical level -- i.e. don't throw stones if you live in a glass house. Politics has become a breeding ground for immoral, corrupt individuals (which is sad). Heh, if you wanted to call every president out on every single thing he ever did wrong, you could spend the rest of your life posting on this board. I guess we just have to take the politician bashing one individual at a time, otherwise the arguments get convoluted and confusing. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

Stalin was a dictator who seized power through the failure of communism. Prior to that, Lenin and Trotsky were extreme left-wingers (Bolsheviks) trying to run a genuine workers' state, and Stalin was a fake who took advantage of their naivete to bump them off, seize emergency powers and build himself a huge military (sound familiar?). The Soviet Union from that time on was a sham -- a bunch of conservative militarists calling themselves communists.<br>
<br>
As for Mao, I'd bracket him in the &quot;let's kill our intellectuals&quot; group with Pol Pot. Craziness amid more failed communism.<br>
<br>
Communism is a well-intentioned, unworkable theory and doesn't fit with my environmental priorities. Socialists/communists seem quite happy to destroy the environment to benefit the workers, just like greedy capitalists destroy the environment for profit.<br>
<br>
The strange thing about this thread is that it started by noting that people with serious criminal records were running for office. The whole &quot;Clinton was bad too&quot; thing is a red herring and doesn't change the original point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www228.pair.com/judygale/Gsmile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 936<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/02 7:18:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jsonline.com/graphics/news/img/mar02/quest033002.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Democracy in Action</span><hr size=1> Clinton did NOT leave the country in better shape than it was in when he took office.

<br>
Course by your standard Reagan left the country in worse shape too.  He came into office right before a boom and left just as the country slipped into recession.  BUT like with Clinton.  The economy, was still in better shape after than it was before.<br>
