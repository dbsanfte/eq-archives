Don't get me wrong, I think we are responsible for allowing the looting, but I don't blame the troops for not having enough feet on the ground. Just imagine if we had gotten rid of the tanks like Rumsfeld has been pushing for... those tanks were a big part of why this war went so quickly... even though we only used 1/5th of what we should have. <p><br><br><br>

Ummm that isn't an AK-47.<br>
<br>
As for using them to go fishing, perhaps that's what those Iraqi troops were doing when it was reported a pilot went down in the Tigris.  They were just fishing!<br>
<br>
Merton, seeing as none of the Iraqis are out hunting down other Iraqis with a gun, yes it would be easier to put a shotgun wielding Iraqi at the museum than that meager force you suggested.  What you are failing to realize, is that when you commit troops to an area to secure, you are also having commit additional troops to cover the first group.<br>
<br>
I'll forgive you for your oversight since they don't teach such things in College.<br>
<br>
oh and an FYI, that article talks of a couple of Iraqis that didn't have guns, keeping looters away.  Since the museum was so important, the Iraqis in charge of it should have made sure it was secure.  They didn't.<br>
<br>
So while Loegan, the faithful liberal loves to pass the blame, I don't.  Though I am willing to concede that some of the responsibility for the looting falls upon the US government, but the majority of it falls upon the looters themselves, then there is still a nice portion (which is still greater than the US's) of responsibility that falls upon the curator, and THEN there is a small portion that falls on the OLD Iraqi Military.  Since it was such an important place, the military should have ensured one of their own units was stationed there.  They'd make it known that they would surrender the responsibility to the US military when they arrived.  In that way, the US military couldn't avoid the bulk of the responsibility.<br>
<br>
See how things would work so much easier if your enemy fought in a civilized manner? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

This is not food for thought, this is your opinion.

I think this is where every military personnel gives Merton a big F U.  Merton, if you are so worried about artifacts why don't you create your own little organization and protect it?  You do realize that MANY of the troops over there are living on as little as 4 hours of sleep every 3 days right?  You do realize that taking baths, resting, and eating are necessary for humans to remain healthy don't you?  You do realize that such things as these are not just being lazy but a part of human life don't you?  WTF is your problem?<br>

Since when does chaos make sense?  If you live in a world of chaos, you tend to act chaotic until a new established government is created.  Such actions as these occur in almost every single revolution around the world.  When you are poor and hungry you will do what you can to obtain some amount of money to eat and survive, even if &quot;it doesn't make sense&quot;.<br>

<br>
Oh yaaaaah, I'm sure every American soldier over there just wants to quadruple his income from the military by looting mud bricks, camels, and tents!  You do realize that crimes involving stealing occur less frequent if the person that is supposed to commit the crime is well-off and living happily in the first place?  Why would an American Soldier, who has what he needs (not that anything in Iraq that is obtainable and hidable is worth anything) steal?  You are an asshole for assuming a person would.  Now, if you were to say rape and murder and such things, it would be more believable.  However, stealing doesn't occur like those two crimes.  Stealing occurs more often due to necessity while crimes like rape and murder occur due to evil and hatred.<br>
<br>
So uh, Merton, what nationality are you anyways?  I'd like to know what kinda propoganda and crap your country presents to you.<br>
<br>
As for your picture of the fishing guy...you do realize that troops are given breaks to have free time to themselves right?  There is something wrong with that considering how hard they work over there? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

Amen to that Wenin. Not that I think our troops were looting, but they damn sure deserve alot more pay then we give them. Too bad Bush wouldn't give up his tax cut and put it into military pay instead. I would be 100% behind that, despite the deficit. <p><br><br><br>

What do you think millionaires do with all that money they get back from tax cuts?  Put it their mattress, or put it in their great valt where they do swan dives into rooms full of money ala Scrooge McDuck?<br>

As for the military pay being tax free, I may be wrong, but I think soldiers don't pay taxes on money recieved while in war.  Not sure.  But they do receive combat pay, which is a nice pay increase as I recall.  But then when I was making that piss poor cash, I was counting the 50 dollars a month increases as a nice pay raise. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

a) on a very nice house just outside San Francisco<br>

Don't get me wrong - I'm actually pretty financially conservative and would hoard money and live in a $4 million dollar house if I could - but that doesn't mean I'd be doing what's best for the economy, and so if the gov't is giving out handouts, they probably should be helping someone else buy a mop at Wal-mart before helping me afford my mansion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

Tax the rich, give to the poor.<br>

<br>
What I have a problem with is how people are taxed on money they never had.  A company gives its employees stock options, an employee never touches this stock.  At somepoint (don't know when this point needs to be for this to occur, but I know it happens) during the year the stock is worth several million dollars, then all of a sudden the stock market crashes and the stock becomes worthless.  Now this stock that the employee never used or leveraged in order to make money requires to have the taxes paid on it.  Now do they tax the amount that the stock is actually worth?  No, they tax it at the multi-million dollar amount.  Now why should the government benefit from that stock having been worth millions of dollars when the person that owned it never got any such use of the stock??<br>
<br>
I also have a problem with how the government somehow believes they are deserving of money from the death of a family member.  The money was taxed when that family member earned it, why should it be taxed again?  The government already got their cut when it originally went into the bank to begin with. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Keep in mind that this only affects the very wealthy (I think up to the first million dollars is tax free - Solovey?) so unless you are a millionaire you pay no inheritance taxes.  But the idea that the money was already taxed once is valid - I don't like this one.<br>
<br>
The rest isn't socialism, its macroeconomics.  Socialism would be &quot;spend the $500 billion on free housing/education/healthcare/etc for the poor&quot;... I'm saying just give the middle class (not the poor so much) the cash and let them spend it as they see fit.<br>
<br>
The point is that the middle class will spend almost every extra dime they get - the wealthy hit the point where they don't NEED to spend any extra, and just bank the rest or spend it on things with very little economic benefit.  The middle class, however, will boost retail, manufacturing, shipping, housing, travel industries, etc.  Not only will they buy more, they'll pay sales tax in doing so and give a bunch of it back.<br>
<br>
The net result is that the middle class pumps every dollar you give them back into the economy, and at the levels where it will make a VERY big difference in a down economy like ours - it'll create jobs and drive manufacturing, which will also churn our export engine.<br>
<br>
More money to the wealthy helps none of this.  That said, I want my big house... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Cal - even money spent on the defense industry creates some jobs and has SOME return to the macroeconomy - but far, far less than inputs into retail.

I wonder if anyone remembers that brief interview that was done with an American G.I a few days into the war.  The reporter asked him why he signed up and he said he wanted to fight in Iraq to get revenge for 9./11.

You keep ponting at the &quot;US&quot; obligation.  Yes there IS an obligation, but like ALL requirements of the Ruels of WAR, military requirements take precedent.   The city was NOT fully under control yet, significant, if scattered fire fights were still occuring.  The US(or any other country) is under NO obligation to put its troops at significant risk to protect these things.<br>
<br>
As to your insinuations about the cause of the looting, it is beyond insulting and ignorant.  For one thing, there is strong evidence that the Museam was not so much looted, as it was robbed.  Several things point to a professional operation (selective stealing, lock pick tools etc) for another your disbelief that Iraqi's would not happily loot thier own flies in the face of history.<br>
<br>
Looters are a problem everytime law and order break down.  Look at what happens after significant natural disasters happen.  Looting often becaome a problem, these are people looting thier own.  To say you think that the Iraqi's are any differnent is stupid.<br>

Actually no, not since the Civil War has there been a case of US troops involved in wholesale looting.  There have been individual cases of theft(there always are peacetime or wartime), but these are vigorously procecuted by the military.  <br>
