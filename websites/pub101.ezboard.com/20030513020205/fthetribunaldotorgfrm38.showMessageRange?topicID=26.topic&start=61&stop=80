<br>
The subject matter IS volatile.  It brings out strong emotions no matter how you look at it, and is better suited to the flameboard imo.<br>
<br>
If all I have to read here anymore is the typical &quot;fuck off and die you cocksucker&quot; lack of imagination BS that everyone else writes, guess I won't be coming back.<br>

Its a growing pain Ladida and i went through when we came here in the first place. I will be the first to say when somethign happens that i dont like, and the first to say i'm sorry if i misunderstand or something like that. <br>

Read the post Loegan made by following the link, and add to it if you want to. If you think its too much for you to handle, go somewhere else, like i said, its not that complicated. <p><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4"><tr><td>

<br>
I have to criticize your &quot;Treating us like a child&quot; point, in my opinion, it looks like you are the one acting like a child.<br>
<br>
Maturity is responsibility and respect for others, this isn't your house, it's the Mod's house - they invite you in, and when you are here you play by their rules.  I don't urinate on the floor at other people's homes, if I want to do it in my home I can.  But when you enter the domain of someone else, you obey their rules.<br>
<br>
What was incredibly fucking childish here is your melodramatic move for support and outcry by trying to make yourself a martyr - what you essentially said is &quot;Help I'm being repressed&quot; and then &quot;I'm taking my ball and going home.&quot;  But your responses to these posts have shown a lack of conviction to that origional cause, showing this entire thread to just be a big post for attention, to show others the suffering you think you have endured.  Whine some more, and be sure to call other people childish.<br>
<br>
I also find it funny that when Arleanna writes what Jas posted in laymen's terms, Jas is being deceitful.  Way to fucking go.<br>
<br>
Get over yourself.  If you don't like the forums here stop reading them and make your own, take your cronies with you too please.<br>
<br>
If you had truely wanted to start a constructive criticsm for the consistancy of the enforcement of the rules, you have undermined your entire point by the first post - being a whine about how you think you have been wronged.  Get over it.  Funny how you never complained about the selective enforcement before it affected you.<br>
<br>
Funny, I think in the past I've read you complaining about people posting their &quot;I'm leaving and never coming back&quot; posts.  For some reason, I had read your origional message which stated <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have used the flameboard as my main psoting forum since it was placed here. Since it is apparent that not all topics are welcome here now, I am going to move on. I won't waste time posting to other sections that get less traffic and I am not into mindless flames posted simply for the sake of flaming.<br>
<br>
I'll still be lurking to read the goings on of our server of course, but I just won't be a participant. Been a fun ride guys. Take care. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To be the same fucking thing you've whined about.  But then again, I'm not keen on reading comprehension.<br>
<br>
Nice to see that Ladmo is there to back you up, even though he said he was never coming back about 2 months ago, too.<br>
<br>
If you're going to post a whiny message about how you're leaving and your life is so tragic, at least have the fucking conviction to stick to your decision to leave.  There is no false hope greater than the hope of the disappearance of yet another idiot.<br>

People are gonna read WHERE they want to read. If you don't allow posts they are interested in they will get them somewhere else.<br>

WTF are you being so stubborn on this? Why kiss the ass of somebody who has hated the Flame Board from day one and who has done a ton of shit to discourage it's success? How many complaints have you had about me? Estevan is one... maybe his side kick. Other than that are people trying to get me off the FB? If they want me gone, let em say so and I'll leave. <p><br>

And yes, there are several rules to the forum other than just posting anon which I have talked about on many occations. Whether you agree with them or not is moot because you are not in charge and you are just as insignificant as everyone else.<br>
<br>
The flameboard is still entertainment &amp; a place to speak your mind. We are pretty damn fair about everything, are hardly abusive, and it isn't like we are going to get in trouble if we are. <br>
<br>
The fact that you are crying over something so fucking little as this and only because you are not getting your wittle way pisses me the fuck off. But please, continue to be demanding and a little bitch and act like we owe you something just cause we move things to different forums. <p><BR>

                                   is quite acceptable). Also, the moderators reserve the right to edit signatures, and should your signature mess up a thread causing<br>

<br>
                                   Edit: Okay, as of today I am adding a new rule: If you're not a regular poster you do not come here and advertise other message<br>
                                   boards. I am tired of this. New posters who do this will be banned and the threads will be deleted, no exceptions.<br>

Why make a forum where it is labeled as above, only to censor it?   Anarchy being the absence of any government or leadership... yet that is not what we are seing here.

In the end it comes down to a struggle of titanic proportions between a martyr and the evil mods over where to post stuff, the flame board, or the other specialized boards. Both sides screamed terrible battlecrys, loud enough to chill the souls of their enemies. Both sides knew that in this horrendous battle of wills, only one will emerge victorious, and to the victors will go the spoils... Wait? what spoils? <br>

It certainly wasn't flameboard material... unless people said things like &quot;wow, what a bunch of fat fucks!&quot;  But even then... it'd still be shit about real life, so where should it go?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong now... nothing wrong with being fat, it'd just be a descriptive observation, so perhaps not flame material, unless it was taken as such.<br>

<br>
 Anyhow, dont ya get the point? Maybe its cause I have a different perspective from being Talamays close game friend and watching the old board die and then watching this one rise. Both were due to fear. One died from fear of not being in control. This one is unquestionably structured from the fear of not being in control. I'll put it bluntly if its too complicated to understand. WE DO NOT WANT TO BE MOMMIED IN OUR ENTERTAINMENT PLEASURE. Is this not Tribunal.org? Implying it is our board as a whole, funtioning server? Then treat us neutrally and equally and cut the God complex bullshit. Just as I would treat you in person.<br>
