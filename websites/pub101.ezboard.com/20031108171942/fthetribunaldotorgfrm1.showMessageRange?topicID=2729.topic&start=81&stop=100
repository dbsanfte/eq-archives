It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but there are some people who actually spent their entire Beta experience in a Cantina, dancing or playing for people. I met one girl in late Beta 3 that was really far up the Image Designer profession. I asked why she was doing that and she actually replied that she was having fun. So fun is very subjective.<br>
<br>
I dabbled in almost everything in the game up until the end when I found what I wanted to do. And the greatest thing about it is that if I ever tire of doing that, I can change over into something else... without having to reroll the character.<br>
<br>
And as far as MMORPG advancement, I think SWG is better than most because of the way it was designed. There are few things that the devs can look at and go, &quot;We can't do that.&quot; Holocron even said that 95% of all the suggestions they get are doable given enough time, because the game itself is a great platform for future ideas. So keep your eyes on SWG for the next few years. I think in the long run, you'll be surprised. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blazexxhelbinder>BlazexxHelbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/29/03 9:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2729.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it just me or are mmorpgs not advancing?</span><hr size=1> Does SWG have a bigger PVP portion than EQ did, like something more than duels and arenas, like can people from opposing factions attack one another wherever if so what do you get for killing other people?<br>

Neutral, Covert, and Overt.<br>
<br>
Neutral people take no part in the Galactic Civil War (or GCW as PvP is generally called). They can't even trade with or heal Overt people, a design decision which prevents forms of griefing by the Neutrals, since they can't ever be attacked by other players.<br>
<br>
Coverts are basically Part-time PvPers. They choose when and where they want to take part in PvP action, though they never gain the ability to outright ambush members of the other faction. Coverts operate under a Temporary Enemy Flag rule (or TEF). Basically, anything that could be considered griefing by a Neutral gains a TEF for a Covert. Such as the aforementioned Healing or Trading. The TEF, which lasts for a predetermined amount of time (don't ask me how long, I didn't dabble in the GCW during Beta), allows you to be attacked by other enemy Overts while it is present. There are other rules governing Coverts, one of which allows you to defend a group member Overt of the same faction if they are attacked. There are others but needless to say it takes some getting used to. But, again, as a Covert, you choose when you want to participate in PvP.<br>
<br>
Overts are 24/7 PvP. You are attackable at any time by any other Overt members of the opposite facton. You can only be healed by other Overts of Coverts who don't mind getting a TEF. The upside to this is the perks. While Coverts have a limited range of faction perks to buy (using Faction points), the Overts have no limits. You can buy ranks, uniforms, and even entire Bases along with laser turrets, minefields and faction 'pets' which run the gamut from normal troopers/stormtroopers to Heavy Weapons specialist and AT-STs that will follow your commands. <br>
<br>
PvP in SWG has the potential to be extremely awesome, but that's entirely in the hands of the players. As time goes on, I foresee entire areas of the game being controlled by one faction or the other with constant battles being waged on various planets for control. <br>
<br>
Bounty Hunters, for the moment, are purely NPC hunters, though the hunt can be pretty fun because it can take you to any of the 10 planets available to you. There might be a system implemented for player hunting later on if they can figure out a way to prevent it from being abused to grief players.<br>
<br>
Hope that helped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blazexxhelbinder>BlazexxHelbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/29/03 10:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2729.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it just me or are mmorpgs not advancing?</span><hr size=1> Thanks, that helped me a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://&lt;center&gt;&lt;imc src=&quot;http://web.ecomplanet.com/P8712/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P8712CustomImage0043135.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grozzer>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Banned.</span><br>  Posts: 715<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/29/03 11:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2729.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it just me or are mmorpgs not advancing?</span><hr size=1> Some great posts there from Rifkind and Moontayle.<br>

It would be great if people could lose their class-based mentality.

Just reinforces my desire to play on Test Center, since you actually have to do a bit of work to get that installed, which is more than some people are willing to do. And if there are idiots on Test Center they won't find a warm welcome, being that we take our presence there seriously. <br>
<br>
I have my own opinions about half the people posting on the message boards. Most of them are not good. The SWG community lost a lot of good solid people once Beta ended, since marketing pushed the game out too soon for their taste. I happen to agree with them, but I would have bought the game on day 1 if I could have afforded it. As it is, I'll be jumping into the game on week 4.

Best thing to do is get 2 delivery missions from a terminal that have an end point near each other (look for rewards that are close in value) then get your shuttle ticket after you talk to the first 2 npc's to start the quest. The quest goes into your Datapad (ctl d), where you can read over it, check start and end points. Doing this yesterday I was able to rank up 1/4 of the faction I need to be a Rebel, and gained 2400 creds in 30 min. Destroy missions are best if done in groups of 2-3 (in beta you could really solo these pretty easy, but this was &quot;fixed&quot;. As for finding the npc's, there's this thing called &quot;way points&quot; the little arrows on your radar that point to the npc's who start and finish the quest (plus can be used for so much more). Hit Alt-v for the planetary map to see how far away they are. Oh, also, a reward of 400ish on a delivery mission is about 6000 clicks, so round about half the way across Corellia, one of the largest planets. All mission rewards are based on distance, so even if there was planet to planet missions (other than the Krayt dragon epic) you'd get a helluva lot more for them. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28202">Oath Hipacraticus<br>

Small spoiler here.  One of my missions started out in Cornet, Collean (spelling).  The guy is a imperial commander that first time I talked to him he gave a simple run to x, y, and z. Then briefly mention a jedi being reported near jaba.  When my faction got higher , he talked to me, he gave me a mission to go to Tatoonie, and check out jaba the hutt's place for J-E-D-I.    I have not completed it yet though. The officer is NW of town, near the river.  His first quest is one to tell that the rebels have broke the communication encryption, and you deliver the message to town.<br>

Also made about 12k in various missions, one I found from a hermit nestled in this one hill, nice guy.<br>
<br>
I finally found a player who could make swords and my damage went up 10x, also bought a bp.  Now I can kill 6 things before I rest when before I had to rest after every one.  I still pop a tent and rest after the mission anyway for fun, preferrably near a fishin hole.<br>
<br>
Gonna get some screensots together and post em on Other games, some really neat stuff I found.<br>
<br>
Apologies for asking/telling about swg so much here, but the boards are all a complete nightmare with the whiners etc, and anything you post ends up on page 10 in half a day.<br>
<br>
All in all, this game deserves a much better break than it's getting.  Once you get the EQ class thing out of your head and explore the game in general more, you can't help but be stunned by the sheer volume of content.  I mean I've touched the first tiers of 2 different professions, (Brawler/Scout), and am overwhelmed yet at the stuff I can do.  With a minor leak into Artisan I'll be busy for weeks as it opens up complimentary skills and abilities almost exponentially.<br>
<br>
In EQ I was a tank.  I wanted to be best tank I could so I had to work at tank only stuff.  Anthing I did on the side made me feel almost guilty because that was time I could have spent on making Enzo a better warrior, and every skill/aa/weapon/armor decision had me biting my nails in fear of gimping myself.<br>
<br>
In SWG it is impossible to gimp yourself,  and it's preferrable to thin yourself out because of the fun factor.  And you never really get thin!  It's a totally different mindset.  One upping the next guy becomes a moot point, I'll feel sorry for the guy that concentrates on one single skill tree because it is he who is gimping himself out of fun.  The uber in SWG is the jack of all trades. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1059<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/30/03 10:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2729.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it just me or are mmorpgs not advancing?</span><hr size=1> &gt;In beta it was released that BY FAR the hottest selling items were clothes, not weapons or armor. <br>
<br>
That's probably going to change when the economy stabilises. Weapons &amp; armor take a huge amount of skill before maturing whereas you make a lot of clothes already at domestic 4.<br>
<br>
I am now the one and only weaponsmith (novice) on my planet (a fairly unpopulated mudball somewhere far out). I have always HATED EQ tradeskills with a passion. I positively LOVE them in SWG and I am hoping they still push them a little further as there are millions of ideas that are very easy to implement.<br>
<br>
I would have made architect, like in beta, but there were already 2 other people working on the skill, so i opted for what my community was lacking a good weaponsmith. Now i know most of what there is to know about how to make the best guns and blades and I am having a blast wheeling and dealing with all the other crafters and selling my stuff (which i am working on branding). We are literally organising our production to build the planet from the ground. And it takes a lot of concerted effort because right now we have to kickstart the economy with very little currency in the system and huge money sinks (i just plunked 25k over the weekend in training and personal extractors maintenance is killing me...). <br>
<br>
It's a very very different experience from EQ. It's not finished, and IMHO it's not ready for primetime either, but so long as you're having fun... who cares ? Now if only they could release spaceships in the next 2 months...<br>

The issue with MMORPG's is that they're NEVER finished; and the SWG team's criteria for release-ready was met.  It was playable, fun, had all the parts in place they wanted for release, and was stable.<br>
<br>
Ok, so I guess stable was a stretch :P but it sounds like it's stabilized quite a bit.<br>
<br>
In-game vehicles are needed pretty badly; after that, player-made cities and the politician skill line.  I don't see the space expansion being ALL THAT important in the short-term; it'll be some needed &quot;fresh content&quot; once people begin to tire a bit of what's there now, but with a few new skill lines, they can also keep the game interesting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1060<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/30/03 2:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2729.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it just me or are mmorpgs not advancing?</span><hr size=1> Heh - try some of the engineering skill trees... you'll see how &quot;balanced&quot; the progression is.

I spent a lot of time surveying to locate the highest quality materials and i have a few &quot;secret&quot; (ie. not littered with harvesters yet) spots where you find the best metals. I havent completely figured out the whole system yet, but I suspect that every single stat listed on an item is very useful. Metals have conductivity, maleability and other statistics, and chosing the right metal for the right part is very important. Some of my experimental blasters have stats over twice as high as the default stuff, without me even adding power ups (which can lower the delay up to 25% or add 25% to the max damage etc). <br>
<br>
The other detail is that i am also a good pal with just about every other crafter around who send good business my way... there is a lot more to crafting than just power grinding in your little corner. You also have natural combinations : your friend architect will build you a large house with furniture + crafting stations and you move in with your medic &amp; entertainer pals : voila you have your own private clinic. Or you could combine an entertainer and a chef : here's a new restaurant or a bar. Eventually, you can start building cities from the ground up with banks, clinics, cloning stations, shops : the whole 9 yards. I am also expecting to see a lot more professions added, with all things spaceship related, and vehicle makers etc. There's about 25 skill trees at the moment, but there's no limitations to how many can be added, and I don't think it would be too difficult to add trees on top of existing ones to make things interesting again for the masters. Btw : anyone knows if the player generated contracts will eventually make it in ?<br>

Experimenting with a metal that has those in high values will create a kickass D18 pistol, depending on where you stack the experimentation points.
