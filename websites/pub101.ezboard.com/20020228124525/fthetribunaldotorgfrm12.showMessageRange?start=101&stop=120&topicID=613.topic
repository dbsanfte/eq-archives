Half of you make me sick to begin with and i could honestly care less what you think of me, i do respect Heath that is the only reason i even bothered to post here. The reason i didn't mention the other incident Daeja is because it was agreed upon at least by myself to not drag it through the mud and make it any worse just to go our seperate ways and never speak to any of the parties involved again those quotes i will leave for ya here.<br>

 I had one purpose. To catch someone in a lie. <br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because everyone told me something different. I never did catch that lie, but along the way something happened. I was set free. I no longer care who was telling the truth or who was lying, because I LIKE where I am right now.<br>
<br>
Somehow I am in the middle and outside of it at the same time.<br>
<br>
Just to set any question about myself straight, I am no longer romatically involved with Stephanie.. hell, I had a date last night and would have gotten laid if I had had a condom on me.<br>
<br>
I wish **** and Stephanie the best. I wish Tony and Sharon the best. But above all I wish you guys would leave each other the fuck alone. If you like where you are in your life right now, what does it matter what someone else has to say? This is retarded. <br>

The only reason I've said anything about the subject is because I would like to be able to play where I want, and with who I want and not be subject to assholes spreading rumors and causing people to be guild removed over their own petty squabbling. I have no problem letting bygones be bygones if I'm able to play and be happy and not have to constantly look over my damn shoulder for the 'disillusioned' 2. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

it's healthier in our living environment like this also, and yes, Sharon, try to fuck over this relationship too, but i love Adam and oh my dear god, i had the guts and courage to actually tell Heath, i wish you and Tony the best, it would be a whole hell of a lot better than going at each others throats, you have a game wedding to plan, as do i, and a rest of my life to live with someone i love and someone that returns that love to me. why you dwell on this i do not know, nor do i care, i want this ended, i want this to be the last time i have any fucking contact with you and Tony.Go your seperate ways and leave this alone. it's immature and stupid and petty.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Xanta... what can I say, there will always be a special place in my heart for your friendship. You sat through a kidney stone with me online to rezz me. The truth didn't slip through any cracks, unless it is the cracks in my soul. In doing so it taught me many things. Among those things it taught me to distance myself from the tiny things that try to ruin people's lives. <br>
<br>
You guys arguing this is doing more to hurt yourselves than it is doing to hurt each other. Trust me, I learned this also. Nothing any of you can say can really hurt me.. what *I* say, can hurt me though.<br>
<br>
I value you all, ****, Sharon, Stephanie, and yes even Tony regardless of the epic battles we waged across the length and breadth of EQ message boards. You're all special to me, and I'm way too detached right now to be bothered with petty bickering.<br>
<br>
See, my life suddenly changed.. and it's great. No smoking, no flaming people on msg boards, actually enjoying my job for once in a long while... not because of anyone, but because I quit letting this petty shit bother me.<br>
<br>
I wish to be friends with each one of you four. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There ya go Daeja since you obviously did not have access to that forum to read it, just a small reminder ask Heath for access so ya can read the rest of it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 A wise man once said, &quot;better to keep personal business in private emails.&quot; or something along those lines, i'd rather not drudge up an old post to get the exact quote. Just tired of the bullshit, everyone trying to hurt one another people not minding their own business, we're all adults here, and i do think it was stupid of you to come here and try to get more attention Heath, but it is just like you. You DID do the right thing by emailing me which i responded to, but you should have left it at that. <br>
<br>
Anyhow Heathy if it makes you feel any better i'll send ya my address in email and letcha send cops over here to check it out and i can scan the police report and throw that up here for everyone to gawk at, and i won't forget to make that call to Gateway after they're done. Or i could put my address here since you will probably post it up here anyway.<br>
I do also find your post amusing Ladida, after the many days and nights you sat and chatted with me on Aim, i never once lied to you, i was always nice and ffs even pleasant to you.<br>

<br>
I have nothing against you personally. You never did anything to *me*. You came to me for advice, but lied to me about facts. That's neither here nor there.<br>
<br>
I do think posting things from a private forum is a bit fucked up. I don't have any real need or want to read what is there, it doesn't affect me directly. I know I am involved indirectly with a thread there, and that is because I was tired of the lies. And, I do know who the "mystery man" is, but I am respecting YOUR desire to keep his name out of it. <br>
<br>
As far as second hand information is concerned - when it comes firsthand from someone that has experienced it, and that person is someone i love and trust completely, then that is all the validity I need. <br>
<br>
I hope that you find whatever it is that you are looking for, and that the number of victims you leave in your wake are few. <br>

Are you trying to make me feel guilty or something? I must be a two-faced jackass for being nice to you before this crap happened. I am glad I amused you. Believe me, I won’t hold back if this gets moved to the flameboard.<br>
<br>
You know why I am pissed? Because not only did you steal from a friend of mine, but you actually try &amp; come here &amp; lie your way out of it. People like you suck. You are the reason trust gets broken. You are the reason that genuinely nice people like Bowynn have to be cautious. You lack class and decency.<br>
<br>
Yeah we talked on AIM, and I was very friendly and glad to see Bowynn doing well. I remember getting a few AIMs when I was talking to you, just letting me know what a lying ho you were. I didn’t doubt their truthfulness, but I was willing to ignore them since it wasn’t like you could hurt me in any way &amp; Bowynn seemed not to mind either.<br>
<br>
I of course now feel disgusted for being nice to something as low as you &amp; I also feel like I let Bowynn down for not getting him to face the truth about you earlier. <p><BR>
