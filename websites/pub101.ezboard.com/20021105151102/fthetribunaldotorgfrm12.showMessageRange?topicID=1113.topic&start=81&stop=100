I won't pretend to know what the hell you all are talking about for the most part, but what I did get was that exercise, a healthy diet and some good clean air and water seems to prevent cancer. I don't really care about all that technical stuff but that seems like pretty damn good advice... oh wait, I think I've heard that before... NEXT! <p><br>

<br>
My problem with your logic regarding him being awarded 2 nobel prizes is pretty simple - If you look at the other Nobel winners during World War 2, you'll see something pretty interesting - Otto Hahn of Germany won it for Chemistry in 1944, at the height of the war.  So that pretty much shoots your &quot;He was Germany so he lost the award&quot; thing in the foot, aside from the fact that Warburg was notoriously anti-nazi and in fact FLED Germany and was not allowed to collect his supplies.  So why would they give the award to a German a year earlier (when propoganda portrayed Germans as the MOST evil) for technology that could be potentially used for weapons of mass destruction, and then give then take away an award from one who made &quot;such a great discovery&quot; in the field of Medicine?  It just doesn't make sense.  It doesn't add up.  Warburg never won a Nobel Prize for his theories, in fact, it wasn't until 30 years AFTER the prize was awarded that this theory first came to light.  And it was brought about by people trying to proclaim the use of Hydrogen Peroxide to cure Cancer, which was later found to be funded by a leading manufacturer of Hydrogen Peroxide.<br>

Actually, what's funny is that in 90 percent of situations, the first step we take is administration of 02.  Anyhow, as I started to analyze your sources, I noticed that the majority of your figures and problems were taken from studies before the year 2000 - and before the use of several medical dosage tracking programs that are used constantly and consistantly now.  I can direct you to some of the webpages where they claim that their products have saved millions, but I urge you to find more current studies - every article you list is either written before 1995 by medical professionals, or later, by LEGAL PROFESSIONALS.  I would argue that a Legal professional has a lot more motivation to lie about figures and skew the data than a medical provider.  In fact, the one that I'm mentioning - the Kent State piece that I read, doesn't address the fact that in most of the study, THE PATIENT reacted to the medication in a way that was NOT forseen, or abnormal for studying.  The way you have presented the information makes it seem as if medical professionals have no clue what they are doing, and just give the drugs.  That's simply not the case.<br>

As for this nobel prize thing, again apparently this is too much of a riddle for you.  Doesn't make sense, doesn't add up?  Probably because you don't know what the hell you're talking about.  Nice try on twisting the story with your 'logic' though.  The Nobel prize people didn't rescind the award moron...the Hitler regime itself wouldn't let Warbugh accept the award.  You're comparing a jew, who during the holocaust <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'was notoriously anti-nazi and in fact FLED germany'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as some kind of argument, against a guy who wasn't jewish and was in allied custody when he won his award?

That's alright, I've witnessed your reading comprehension level, or should I say lack thereof, so I can see why it's taking so long.  When you do get down to it and read it, you let me know.  By the way, what kind of argument is 'uh, those were written by legal professionals' ?  So unless you're a certified (pun intended) MD you're not allowed to count now?  What's next, 'I've never heard of the researcher in question, so unless it's someone I know or a guy who works in my building, I consider this obscure, vague and arguable' ?<br>

I gotta tell ya though, this one takes the cake: '<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> THE PATIENT reacted to the medication in a way that was NOT forseen...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'.

I don't think all or even most doctors are like that. I do believe there are many doctors who get kickbacks from pharm companies, but I don't think these doctors see the medicine as doing any harm, but rather they see it as an &quot;adequate&quot; treatment that may or may not address the problem most effectively. It's not doing harm, but it's not the best treatment either.<br>
<br>
I think the two biggest factors in the state of MDs here in America is:<br>
<br>
1. Training. They are traditional taught to see things through a very narrow view. Only recently have the effects of spirituality, meditation, and other complementing treatments been taken half way seriously.<br>
<br>
2. MDs in this country are treated like high priests. I am not sure why it is, but we look at and treat our doctors very differently than other countries do. People need to realize that medicine is a profession just like any other, in the respect that it's members are taught a craft and then they practice it. They do not know everything and they do not have magical gifts of prophecy or insights or healing. Hell, they don't even know how or why many of the medications they treat patients with work. They only know the conditions under which to use them and the results they might bring about. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that doctors should be exposed to the varied treatments and belief systems that have shown positive results, while in medical school ( and I mean more than just a paragraph or two that is breezed over). If medical science were more inclusive and open minded, rather than than an elite fraternity, I think we would see a vast improvement in our quality of care. <p><br>

There was an article I read (this was years ago, you want page number and author you look it up holdan) that says because of the wealth of information and studies that happen everyday in medicine, there's no way for doctors to keep up with everything.  So something like 97% of all new drug information that doctor's learn comes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> from the pharmaceutical rep who teaches them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Not exactly an unbiased, objective source there.  And that's why they bring all those calendars, pads, wall charts -- when a doctor goes to prescribe something he looks up at them on the wall and says 'hey, there's a new medicine they just came out with, I'd like you to try it.'  The pharmaceutical annual advertising budget for companies is sick.  <br>
<br>
Being more open minded to other treatments and to the actual inefficacy of the ones they use would be great..but who's gonna teach em?  The grants these companies provide buy the medical texts the students learn from, and their sales reps power the force of continuing education.  There is no rep out there with a $5 million budget touting the strengths of oxygen and keeping your blood pH alkaline...just no money in it.<br>
<br>
And that's what it all comes down to, isn't it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utoreyj01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>toreyj01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/27/02 5:32:56 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/da3bf501/bc/My+Photo+Album/is_ani_e0.gif?bcVvmU9AKuak95UR WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> It always puzzles me how people espousing being open minded seem more recalcitrant to accept simple axioms.  Like Dvin and his previous posts, but a few major corrections are in order, these are all FACTS by the way, written in stone.<br>
<br>
1. &quot;The heart is the most oxygenated organ and it does not get cancer&quot; - (paraphrase) - Have several patients with Atrial Myxomas who would tend to disagree with you.  The Brain and lungs are more oxygenated BTW and they both have a host of cancers.  But Leukemia does not fit this trend, White blood cells which they stem from do not carry hemoglobin.<br>
<br>
2. Oxygenation PREVENTS (see I got that prevent part, good eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Cancer. - Nope, not at all.  The most promising field in Cancer therapy right now deals with angiogenesis inhibition.  Basically what it means that a tumor needs oxygen to grow so it grows its own blood vessels and leaches off surrounding tissue.  By inhibiting this process (angiogenesis) we starve the tumor.  Very useful hopefully for highly vascular tumors like PROSTATE and Colon.  Prostates are highly vascular, btw, bloodiest procedure you can do, takes 4 units of blood to replace minimum.<br>
<br>
3. Alkalinity is not until 7.42 or above, but over 7.45 you run into all kinds of cramping and such (Metabolic Alkalosis), so you correct it by respiratory depression.  Your body regulates its PH quite nicely, but the best assesment of PH is of course the blood, better if arterial.<br>
<br>
4. Dietary considerations are certainly in order for prevention, nitrates have long been established as a carcinogenic element.  People who eat meat high in Nitrates (preservatives) usually in fish or smoked/preserved meat, show a high risk of stomach cancer (such as asians).  Taking Vit C or E decreases Nitrosamine levels when consumed simultaneously.<br>
<br>
5. Obesity is a risk factor as well, the only source of Estrogen for post-menopausal women endogenously (inside the body) is body fat.  More body fat equals more estrogen equals increased risk of endometrial cancer, etc.<br>
<br>
6. Selenium is a proven factor in colon cancer, the patients who exhibit colon cancer typically have lower levels.  Dietary fiber helps here as well.<br>
<br>
7. Antioxidants (Vit C and E) recently have shown no difference in outcome for a Physicians Health Study in a fifteen year review of patients.  The jury is not out, it came back with bad news.<br>
<br>
8. Folate shows tremendous promise in heart disease prevention though, as does a glass of red wine with an aspirin chaser.<br>
<br>
The field of preventative cardiology is certainly outside of the Flameboard but unproven theories just tire me.  Holden certainly nailed it on the head, nice job. <p><a

Ladmo you can desensitize yourself by consulting an allergist.  The benefits of aspirin far outweigh the small inconvenience of going through the desensitization.  Not only heart attacks, but stroke and colon cancer can be greatly helped with this medication.<br>
<br>
Glass of red wine, folate and aspirin, skip the garlic/vit c bs, get some exercise in and take a fiber pill (that powder is nasty) and you have probably added twenty years to your life. <p><a

Personally, I think the bare bones version of the Dr. Atkins low carb diet is one of the best things for you if you actually have cancer.  Cancer cells use glucose for energy.  The Atkins diet is practically a cure for type 2 diabetes and cancer (I say practically because if you go off the diet, you're right back where you started ... there's no true 'cure' from the diet ... but if it's a choice between steak &amp; salad, with a side of life, or pizza &amp; beer with the grim reaper picking up the tab, I'd take the steak &amp; salad). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usalveghostwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salve Ghostwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/27/02 4:34:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Too many people have the misguided belief that doctors are always acting in our best interests, simply because they are doctors.

This shows whose interests they are really concerned about ... their own.  Here are a few snippets from my own and friends/family experiences.<br>
<br>
I had a gall bladder attack and my doctor rushed me into surgery and strongly suggested that my appendix should come out too (since it would have to &quot;sooner or later&quot;). He didn't bother mentioning that he was unfamiliar with current surgical procedures, and I now have a 10 inch scar and the muscles never healed properly.  Holisitic medicine and more modern methods of surgery were never mentioned. You'd better be informed, because if you're not, your doctor isn't going to be your educator.<br>
<br>
A 23-year old friend of mine needed knee surgery.  He was obese and the doctors refused to do the surgery unless he lost a lot of weight.  They recommended a stomach stapling operation.  He got the operation, and over a period of days, slowly died from internal bleeding.<br>
<br>
As my friend died, the doctors present joked about how fat he was, and how so many more people were gonna live without him to eat their food.  This is known because a respiratory therapist filed a formal report against everyone else present.<br>
<br>
A friend of mine's grandmother has been killed so many times by her doctors that we've lost count.  The last time, after the doctor said, &quot;Oops we gave her the wrong medicine.&quot; they gave up on attempts to revive her and sent for the coroner.  Thankfully, she began breathing again on her own.  Prior to receiving medications she was living at home, in her 80's, and completely capable of fending for herself around the house.  Now's she's in a nursing home. <p><img src="http://home.gwi.net/~badboyzs/oolong.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1113.topic&start=161&stop=169>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1113.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1113.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1113.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1113.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
