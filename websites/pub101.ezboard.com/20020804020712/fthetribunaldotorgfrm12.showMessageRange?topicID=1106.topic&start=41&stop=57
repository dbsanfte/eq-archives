Ladmo doesn't really have a clue what it is he's talking about.  He's looking for a cheap way to take a shot at me, cause he's got no wit what so ever.  I've gotten used to finding out I &quot;did or said something&quot; that never actually happened.  Doesn't phase me much now.<br>
<br>
Personally I think he's just jealous.  After he found out what happened to me he cleaned enough toilets to buy a new computer and still has to settle for fingering his hound dog. <p><CENTER>

(I) Is there anything so bold

when your body is pierced

makes your fingers numb
is it easier to be honest

(II) she stroked the white mane

with her fingertips...
she lightly licked the red smears

it burned like it was supposed to.
she smiled sadly at the glazed eyes...

and hence, he knelt...
pain in arms
and pain in head
he bent his mind in circles
as the blood dript
in circles...
and set his life

(IV) it didn't take a lot
he thought
to fill it up...
and dipping finger
baptised one and all
making sure to save
the rest

Yeah.  But I think we all hope that.  It's also not something I think we need worry about much, El Palmo. <p><CENTER>
