She scrambled up the hill, nearly tripping over some cubs who were just learning to hunt, and bolted into the magnificent acrylia walled city. She dashed through the halls and by-ways, stopping occasionally to ask the guards if they had seen her mother. The guards, used to this behavior since Cyckett was tiny, finally directed her to the Hollowshade Gate. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was her mother, carefully grooming her spirit companion. As Cyckett ran up, Faeryl’s tufted ears twitched slightly. “Yes, Dar Kaura?” she asked, formally, turning her amber eyes on her cub.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother, it’s terrible!” she said, forgetting any sort of formality, “They kind I’m mad, but I know I’m not, and there is an awful thing among them”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Faeryl twitched her ears again. She had a way of doing so that always seemed to exaggerate the motion of the tufts, so that they quivered afterwards. “Who are they, Stalks-Moon-Crickets?” She now used Cryckett’s formal deed name, a rather unfortunate one conveyed on her by an old shamaness with a wry sense of humor. Her nickname, a shortening of it, might have been silly, but it did not carry the connotations of madness. Once again her Mother was accusing her of being insane.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The Tears, our brethren! There is a evil spirit among them, but they won’t listen to me!” She said, irritated by her mother’s reminder that the Tears were not the only ones who though her mad, but still agitated.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Faeryl was silent for a moment, perfectly still. Her warder turned its glowing yellow eyes to stare at Cryckett. Like all warders, it was an ancient spirit, tied to a given Vah Shir through many lives. Cryckett regarded it nervously. She had always wondered how her conservative, rather staid Mother could refer to this ancient being as ‘Fuzzy’ But then the Beastlords had their own powerful magics, tied intimately to their life long companions. Cryckett shifted uncomfortably under the beings knowing gaze.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh,” said Faeryl, finally. “That.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You know?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If we are talking about the same being, yes.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Caalix, the shadowknight?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes,” Faeryl said quietly, “I know. I sensed it when the Barbarian warrior was attacked by the demon wolf”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do they not see it?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They can not smell it, as you or I can. And what there is to be seen . . . “ she sighs, “They do not want to see it. The Norrathians are very cut off from their instincts, Cryckett. They rarely listen to the spirits, they are so deafened by the thundering of their ‘gods’”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Their gods ARE spirits, simply great and arrogant ones.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Convince them of that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To that Cryckett could only shrug. “What IS she?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know. She was Human once, when I first met her. I think her association with the Great Spirit of Disease has some how twisted her. Perhaps it has begun to possess her, to consume her soul from the inside out . . .I don’t know . . .that would be your field of expertise, Dar Kaura.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But I don’t know!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then ask one of your elders, I suppose, I don’t know child. There are many secrets in the Tears, and more than one person who isn’t what they seem to be.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are there other evil spirits?” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not that I have noticed, but there is one who is definitely not an Iksar who smells strangely reptilian . . . “<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Reptilian?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Or draconic”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A dragon? Among the Tears?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If you were a dragon, wouldn’t you want to know why they hunt you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why DO we hunt them?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Faeryl reached out and stroked the tear shaped patch of white fur on her own shoulder, and the matching one of Cryckett’s. “Because of these, as I have told you. Because the spirits have marked us to run with the Tears and join their quest. Why is up to the spirits.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This is supposed to be the tear of the Great Dragon herself,” responded Cryckett. “Why would she mark her enemies?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why do the spirits do anything? Why were any of us chosen? Why is the Human Caalix no longer human? These are all questions that are beyond me. You are a Dar Kaura, you figure them out. It is not my place to question what fate has given me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cryckett twitched her tail. She had a feeling that one level or another, her mother was dismissing her once again. “You should know something more! Be more curious!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am curious, but it is not my place to find out . .I lack the resources or the gifts. I am a warrior . .you are a seeker.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think something is going terribly wrong.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’d almost guarantee it.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I must find out what all of this means!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That would be your calling then . . . “<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My Calling . . “ Cryckett shifted uneasily. Like all of the Dar Kaura, the spirit callers, she had been tormented by visions and strange thoughts her entire life. Unlike the Beastlords, who gained their insight in comprehensible flashes, her insights poured in on her like a drenching rain, too vast and chaotic to focus on. “So what do I do?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What do you feel you must do? What do the spirits tell you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cryckett furrowed her brow. She knew her mother was repeating by rote the questions all Vah Shir were told to ask themselves, but they were good questions. She looked out at the moor, constantly torn by warfare, and down at the depthless golden eyes of her mother’s Warder. “Its not too late. Something can be done . .about . . many things . .before terrible mistakes are made”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Faeryl nodded slightly. “I will help if I can, cub”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cryckett doubted that. Her mother had abandoned her with the Dar Kaura when she was still small, unable to handle her tantrums and visions. Still, it was a nice sentiment. “If I think of anything, I will ask. Good hunting, Mother.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Good Hunting, Stalks-Moon-Crickets”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And they fell back into formalities as Cryckett walked away.<br>
