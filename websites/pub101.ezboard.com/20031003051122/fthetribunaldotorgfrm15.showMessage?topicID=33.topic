TheShadowKnight:Part 1 <br>
<br>
As a young boy, Zhim had always dreamed of becoming a noble paladin. His father was a great, noble knight of Brell Serilis. He had grown to praise Brell every night before he would go to bed. He loved playing games with his dad and his friends. He also loved tinkering with his mother, a powerful arch mage. They would make fire works and collapsible fishing poles. Occasionally she would show him how to make stalking probes but he never could get it right. <br>
<br>
Zhim loved his family very much, but one day he heard that his parents were to be sent off to Luclin for an exploration mission. When he asked if he could go they both said it would be too dangerous for a young child. Zhim became extremely furious with them. He had always wanted to go to the moon, but the closest he had ever gotten was the day his parents took him to the observatory. He had a lot of fun that day. <br>
<br>
When the day came that his parents had to leave hr became angry again. Zhim’s rage built up until he became too hard to control. After a while he would go to his favorite spot. Zhim’s favorite spot was a corner where he could sit and calm down. When his parents could find him that day they just left him a note. Then they left him. When he calmed down he read the note. With the note was a large package. When Zhim opened it, he found his father’s favorite weapon. It was called a Weighty Pole-arm. <br>
<br>
The magically enchanted weapon that his father had found in an expedition to slay the vile god named Cazic Thule, the god of fear. Though the expedition had failed, many good finds came from it. Many had said that it was one of the greatest treasures ever to enter Ak’Anon, home of the gnomes. Zhim was very grateful for this present. He trained with the weapon day after day. Almost never stopping to rest. Days became weeks, weeks into months, and months into season, seasons into years. He trained and trained. He soon became the master of the pole-arm. After each of his training sessions he would meditate on top of a steam geyser. He did this quite often, always growing in mental power. <br>
<br>
Zhim had become very skilled with his pole-arm. One day he was fighting in the steam front mountains and accidentally wandered too far from the city. A kobold scout attacked Zhim out of nowhere. With all his strength he tried to fend off the kobold, but it would constantly overpower him. Zhim couldn’t take a beating much longer. <br>
<br>
He was being mauled to within an inch of his life. He was barely hanging on when it happened. He felt a strange, almost evil power swelling inside his body. His body trembled, and his arm was shaking violently. The next thing he saw was a strange, dark purple aura around him and the kobold. Then he blacked out. <br>
<br>
When Zhim awoke, he was at his home, with a druid who had found him outside, half dead. The druid mended his wounds while he was unconscious. She cared for him while he was still wounded and recovering. She kept him company for quite a long time. He was badly wounded even the priests at the temple of the muse couldn’t heal him. They just said it would take time. <br>
<br>
After about three months he was up and moving. He still wasn’t his normal, energetic self, but he did as much as his body could take. During the time that he was healing, the druid told him where she had found him. Zhim had no memory of that day. The druid explained to him how she found him out in the middle of the mountains with a horribly mangled and almost completely destroyed kobold next to him. <br>
<br>
She also said it looked as if a great power ripped through the kobold’s body. Zhim had no idea how that would have happened. The only thing he remembered of that day was when the kobold first attacked. From there it was a blank. The two wondered what happened for many days, but they just took it as a blessing from the gods. <br>
<br>
That night, before Zhim fell asleep, he asked for her name. She refused to tell him, but she did say she could call her Midnight. He accepted that and then slowly dozed off. When he awoke the next morning he found himself alone. It was the first time he had been alone in weeks, maybe even months. He wasn’t totally sure because he had only just awoken from his unconscious state two weeks ago. <br>
<br>
That day he chose to put his leather armor on and take his weapon out to practice. He trained against some diseased rats and some of the spider hatchlings. He also killed some of kobold runts. After that he went back home for lunch in Ak’Anon. When he got back Midnight was making lunch. It smelled wonderful. From what Zhim could tell, it was rabbit stew and some foreign spice. <br>
<br>
Midnight greeted him with a hello and asked where he’d been. He told her what he was doing out in the mountains. He also added that he had to keep up with his weapon skill if he was to become a paladin. She gave a worried look, but said that lunch was ready. After lunch they didn’t really speak for the rest of the day. <br>
<br>
Every day after that, Zhim would go out and raise his skill with his pole-arm. Though he was skilled with his pole-arm, he loved the power of his mace. The mace was a very powerful weapon that he had found on the body of a dead kobold. As if it was put there for him to find. He knew it had magical powers, so he had the Eldritch Collective identify it for him. They told him it was called a mace of the shadowed soul. <br>
<br>
The Eldritch Collective wouldn’t tell him much about it and every time they saw him from then on, they would become somewhat uncomfortable. They also no longer treated him as an innocent child born from one of the most respected elder of the Eldritch Collective. They treated him as if he was a rabid animal. They would scowl at him when he passed and general spoke rudely to him. <br>
<br>
They started to spread the word of what they had figured out. They started a rumor that he was becoming of the age where his true powers would emerge. Also, they said that he was going to be a shadow knight. When the word had spread throughout Ak’Anon, it finally came around to Midnight. She didn’t believe it was true what was being said. <br>
<br>
When Midnight asked him if it was true, he became very defensive at the thought. Zhim was quite upset with what the people thought. He never even thought about becoming a shadow knight. He would tell them over and over that it wasn’t true and that he wanted to become a paladin, a noble fighter of Brell Serilis. <br>
<br>
Finally, to prove that he wasn’t going to become a shadow knight, he was forced to attempt the most powerful skill of a paladin. He had to use the lay hands ability. It was a powerful ability that only true paladins could perform. It could heal a great amount of ones wounds. <br>
<br>
Zhim became nervous because he had never use that skill before. Now that he had thought about it, he remembered that he had attempted I only once. That was when he was losing to the kobold, and then blacked out. He now knew, that he would indeed, fail again. Now though, he feared what they were all saying was true, that he would become and shadow knight. <br>
<br>
The town’s folk force him to come in front of everyone. They soon walked up an injured, a half dead prisoner. That was who Zhim was to use the Lay Hands ability on. They told him to begin, but right before he was about to try, he backed away and refused. He told them what might happen. <br>
<br>
He explained the day when he first tried. He told them what happened afterwards. The crowd showed no sympathy, save one person, Midnight. When she realized what was about to happen, she immediately ran up to him and began to chant in the language of the druids. <br>
<br>
All of the sudden a wind picked up. The winds sped through the city. A loud, almost ear piercing howl followed the wind. Moments later the wind stopped. Zhim and Midnight were gone. The city was completely silent. All that was heard were the waters near the town square. The silence ended with a loud gasp when they realized Zhim and Midnight had disappeared. <br>
<br>
The next thing Zhim new, he was in the middle of the steam front mountains. Midnight was with him. When he asked why she did that, she began to tell him all the things that he didn’t want to know. She began by telling him of the mace he loved so much. Midnight told him how only a shadow knight would wield the Mace of Shadowed Souls. Also of the only reason why he survived the kobold attack. How he had called on his power to form a massive negative energy attack, known as harm touch. <br>
<br>
Zhim was indeed becoming a shadow knight. Not gifted by Brell, but by Bertoxxulous, the plague bringer. He refused to believe it, but deep inside he knew it was true. He still did not accept his powers as a gift, but as a curse. <br>
<br>
Zhim began wondering where they would go. He knew what would happen if they went back to Ak’Anon. They would surely be killed on sight. So they decided it would be better to head towards Freeport, the city of men. That was one of the few places that the gnomes would be able to find him easily. <br>
Their journey would take a few days. <br>
<br>
They would have to pass through the realm of the dwarves, which had an alliance with the gnomes. This would pose a problem since the gnomes could easily spread the word that they were searching for a gnome and elf. Luckily though, Midnight could call on her powers and pray that Tunare, mother of the elves, would provide camouflage for them. <br>
<br>
The hardest part would be getting past the docks. Their camouflage could drop at any instant and they would be attacked. Midnight did know another way, but it would require a grand druid. The druid would be able to summon the winds to carry them away to the west commonlands. <br>
<br>
Sadly though, there were no druids passing that way. So Zhim and Midnight chose to take their passage by foot. The first leg of their journey would be getting through the steam front mountains, into lesser faydark, then to great faydark, and finally into the butcher block mountains. The journey would take many days. Luckily though, Midnight had the ability to bestow the spirit of the wolf into anyone she wishes. It was one of the most treasured druidic abilities. It would summon a wolf spirit and pit it into the target. <br>
<br>
Once the spirit was inside the target, it would increase their movement rate and endurance of long treks. This was they would be able to but off at least a day off from their journey to the docks of butcher block. Once Midnight called into her power, and bestowed the wolf spirit, they were off. <br>
<br>
Zhim had never journeyed so far from Ak’Anon and began to worry. Midnight did her best to comfort him. She didn’t think that it was just homesickness that worried him. She thought it also had something to do with him hating himself for becoming what he was. He too knew that his time was coming, for him to use his powers for good, or for evil. <br>
<br>
The next days the two had gotten out of Lesser Faydark and were almost to the Buctherblock Mountains. They had heard of new dangers coming to the mountains. Many bandits, orcs, and even green bloods had arrived as of late. The green bloods wear ogre shadow knights from Oggok. <br>
<br>
New fears began to swell inside Zhim. He was afraid not just for himself, but for Midnight as well. He knew she was powerful but he didn’t even begin to understand his won power, let alone hers. He was afraid of what might happen to her if she was caught with him. Zhim knew he was a danger to her. He had then decided that he would go off by himself the next night. He was going to let her be safe and not travel with him. For he knew what the guards would do to him if he was caught, and he didn’t want Midnight to see that. <br>
<br>
During the next days travel they were attacked by a band of goblins. The fight was a fierce one Zhim was badly injured after three goblins attacked him all at once. Luckily though Midnight was able to bring up roots from the earth to hold them in one place. She proceeded in healing Zhim. They were then really easy prey when they couldn’t move. Zhim just cleaved them in half with one fell sweep of his poleaxe. The battle ended quickly. <br>
<br>
Soon they began making a sport of the goblins. After each fight they grew stronger and stronger. At the end of the day they became very tired and had probably killed ten or twenty goblins, and some orcs. They had become very skilled at fighting these creatures and they enjoyed ridding the world of the beasts. <br>
<br>
That night, Zhim woke up some time around midnight and began searching for a potion that he had seen elder adventurers used.They called it a potion of wolf blood. It was supposed to have the same effects as Midnight’s Spirit of Wolf spell. When he found it he drank a sip and felt energized, then he took the potion, some rations, and a water skin, and then ran off into the night. <br>
<br>
Zhim traveled as fast as he could to get to the docks. He traveled past guard huts without being seen. He knew that if a guard saw him, he would be killed. So he knew he would have a better chance of surviving at night. When he did stop to rest it wasn’t for very long. When the morning light appeared he continued until he found a good, relatively safe place to sleep. <br>
<br>
When Midnight woke, she found Zhim gone, and realized what he had done. So she decided that she should move as fast as she could to find him. She knew it would take her a while so she chose to follow the paths of the animals. <br>
<br>
It took her a while to get to near where Zhim had slept. When he got into view her heart began to race. She saw Zhim lying there, lifeless. Apparently while he was sleeping an orc had badly wounded him. Zhim didn’t even have a chance. She did notice a very faint spark of life. <br>
<br>
She then began to chant in druidic. Zhim’s spark of life grew to a glow. His eyes began to open and he tried to talk, but he was still too weak. She continued but he just kept getting worse. He had lost a large amount of blood. She began to fear the worse. She feared that he was going to die. Midnight still tried her best, but nothing was working. <br>
<br>
Midnight, who was already crying, began to doubt in her power. Not only in her power of a druid, but of a friend. She thought that a real friend wouldn’t have let that happen. She began to hate herself. Midnight was so tired from the healing that she just collapsed on top of him. <br>
<br>
Midnight lay there crying for hours. She just lay there, crying, and hoping that he wouldn’t die. She could feel a faint heart beat in his chest. It just kept getting slower and slower, until she felt nothing for many seconds. Then it was over. Zhim was dead. Midnight brought Zhim’s body the druid ring in Greater Faydark and buried him there. She left him there, forever to rest in peace. <br>
