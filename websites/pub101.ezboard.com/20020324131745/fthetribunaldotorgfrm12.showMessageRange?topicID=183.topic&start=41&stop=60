Sure my joining to Vag is by luck, but you know what, Kimoto was the best monk skill wise in EQ, he almost beat a FoH monk in test final (mind you that Daahoud had ST equip at that time already, compare to Kim's PoF armors).  If he thinks I don't have the skills, he won't even bother getting me into Vag.  So, even me joining Vag is partly due to chance, but I am sure I have the skill as well.<br>
<br>
And, sorry, I've never hunted in Hing Keep before.  And, mind you, I've never said I am better than anyone else coz I am in EV.  I know good skill necro in other guilds as well.  Also, I didn't create the tier1/2/3 shit, it's the planar schedule committe who invented those terms.<br>
<br>
Pikel,<br>
I am glad you do appreciate the efforts, glad it's not wasted.  As the &quot;deserve more&quot; issue, I believe you've misunderstood.  How do you define deserve, what exactly does someone deserve?  I will tell you that you deserve more than me.  But, that's friendships that you deserve more than me, coz you chose to get into the crowd and to interact/know them.  If we are in the same guild, at the same raid, and we are the same class (and if I do still play), I will tell you I deserve more loots than you, becuase I've put more effort and time into raiding, not because I started on trib before you, or you before me (in fact, I started on Oct'99).  Also, deserve only applies to when both sides is fighting for the same thing at the same time.  So, if &quot;deserve/right&quot; is appied to planes, it's FCFS, which is what I want to explain to Kric, who obviously have no idea how politics work. <p><div align="center">

FCFS stands for First Come Fuck Shit.<br>
Here is what FCFS means. It means that the larger guilds can get a hair up there ass and decide to mobilize immediately and pull a Planar Raid. It means that the smaller guilds who must have allies and time to plan the planar raids are dicked. We schedule a raid 2 weeks in advance. Get the date and time set and get coordinated with the allies. On the set date and time we mobilize and zone into an empty plane or a plane with a larger guild already raiding............ First Come First Serve really sucks royal dick. Sorry Zomad but that is a 100% serious thought with no bullshit. I will repeat it so you know how I truly feel deep inside the chasms of my soul.  No fuck it. I will not repeat it. I go now to create a new thread entitled FCFS sucks royal dick.<br>

We clearly have very different ideaology, and it's clear that you don't understand how the game politics works.  Doesnt matter you have skill or not, if you cant see the big pictures clearly, skills are pointless.  Besides, you seem like a person who care only about upgrading loot to me, to yourself, or to your friend, since your idea of loots is for showing off, not preparing toward the end game or as a trophy of your effort being recognized.<br>
<br>
Btw, I think you can see that FCFS will be the future, since the majority of the voting on that FCFS favors it, and negative comments from your &quot;FCFS sux...etc&quot; aka &quot;uber guilds sux, coz they can get to a zone before me&quot;.  If you really believe in scheduling, let's see some scheduling for seb since it's such a nice equip zone and always populated.  If a group got to crypt before me and able to hold the spawns, it's not because they put more efforts into getting it or have more skills, it's coz they are ubers, and they sux, they are taking away my chances/rights/oppotunities even though I paid the same amount of money to VI. <p><div align="center">

<br>
Surely this cannot be true. If I were only interested in upgrading loot and showing it off I would have sold the Sorcerous Bowl I won the roll on and upgraded my equipment. Instead I gave it to a friend of mine. I would have sold the Journeymans Walking Stick and the Howling Harpoons instead of donating them to the needy.I would have sold all the extra Forest Loops I had. The list goes on. I would estimate 40k worth of loot I have donated to friends and newbies that could have been used to better my equipment. But if your above assupmtion is true then I am clearly just another show off type egotistical prick and I would fit in better with a Tier 1 guild than with a Tier 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10 guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufenz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/5/01 2:40:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why is Bowynn's asshole bigger than his mouth?</span><hr size=1> Krickett is mother Theresa in-game...Will the uber guilds please make way when he wants to go raid some place?

<br>
Krickett?  Get a fucking clue.<br>
<br>
The server is maturing.  Half the time when you do a /who all 60 count the number given will be greater than any other level count you can do.  Are your little alliances and such having a hard time getting the exact zone they wish open on the date that they set aside?  Welcome to the club!!  I challenge you to find any guild on this server that schedules raids for specific zones without even considering the possiblity that said zone will be taken.  Most of the time, unless E/V is raiding VP or something, there are... *gasp*... alternate raid destinations!!  Just a day or two ago Revolution had a City of Mist (oooh, uber) raid planned... a rather small guild with hardly anyone even over level 50 got there before us though.  =(  They died a few times, and they barely killed any reavers, whereas we could have cleared the whole zone in the time they spent for 10 CRs.  Cry... whine... pout... TEMPER TANTRUM TIME!!!!!  Er, no.  We shrugged and went somewhere else!  Norrath is a big place, my friend.<br>
<br>
If the lack of a scheduling system bothers you THAT much, then please... feel free to take the thousands of Tribunal players by the hand and lead us into your Promised Land full of Scheduling Goodness.  Oh, it's not quite that easy?  You mean getting the whole server to agree on a schedule is hard?  You don't want to do it?  Then live with FCFS, plan around it, and life will suddenly be full of happy butterflies and rabbits and colorful rainbows.<br>
<br>
If you are not a member of a guild or alliance who can send a /gu and have three 55-60 groups in a zone ready to kick ass, and this bothers you, then try to join one.  Don't come whining to the rest of us because your particular guild of choice is incapable of these things.  It makes you look ridiculous, and it accomplishes jack shit besides... hmm... making you look ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Please, please try to think things through before you continue making such a godawful complete moronic ass out of yourself.<br>

Whew, OK I do agree with one thing Zomad said... EV isn't a bunch of show off egotistical types. DOH!  <br>

...well I agree with half of what he said... lemme rephrase.  <br>
<br>
E/V isn't a bunch of showoffs when it comes to loot. (Of course that's cuz most of their members have shitty gear, only the oldschool types are oober)<br>
<br>
Krickett, FCFS stands for &quot;Fucking *covers Tanje's ears* CUNTS Fucked over Scheduling&quot;<br>
<br>
However, you are way too ill-informed and confrontational to ever understand why.

Lets assume that I wish to follow this sound advice. Tell me now how to join the larger guilds.

<br>
Our membership requirements center around being at least level 46 and having a certain level of resist gear, although they are somewhat flexible.  You basically have to show enough desire to join.  <br>
<br>
I don't expect or really even want you to go out and switch guilds, however.  What I would like for you to do is to realize that your anti-FCFS crusade is futile and stupid, and to try and change the way YOU operate to work with the system, rather than bitch to a few thousand people that the system we've been using for the last few months is screwy.<br>
<br>
Like I said, if you can think of a better way... go right ahead and give it your best shot.  Make us a new schedule.  Tell the &quot;uber guilds&quot; they can't screw with the small guilds/alliances when they have their weekend to gather and kill stuff.  Expect something to happen besides getting laughed at.  I'll be right there grinning.<br>
<br>
PS - if you're planes ready (level 46+) and have the play time and desire, you CAN get into a guild large enough to at least break into a plane or two on fairly short notice.  To say otherwise is laughable with all of the moderately powerful guilds out there.  At least, unless you're a total jackass and piss everyone on The Tribunal off with mindless posting.  Maybe I ought to stop =\<br>
<br>

                           I am currently in a guild with what appears to be 3 active members. I am looking for another guild. Perhaps I will check into the Revos. Yes FCFS is here to stay. Nothing to be done about it. Live with it and go on. Yes i am level 47 and I have been in Hate. Scheduled to go to fear this weekend. Dont know. Will have to check out all options. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 582<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 2:52:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visveres.com/ezboard/members/bowynn1.jpg width=118 hieght=191></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why is Bowynn's asshole bigger than his mouth?</span><hr size=1> What the fuck does any of this have to do with the size of my asshole? <p><center>
