<br>
We are currently negotiating for a 'clear' run at him, i.e. time enough to take more than 1 shot without the pressure and increased lag of having another guild waiting in zone for us to get it over with. Naturally this depends on the guilds in the rotation granting whosever turn it is an extra day to make up for the time Legendary would take up.<br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> Let's call it like it was, Jonlee.<br>
<br>
Once again, Legendary did not bother to ask anyone in the rotation and decided to butt heads with Aary last week during another guild's turn in the rotation.  Heck, they didn't even bother to send a courtesy tell to the guild they tried to jump.  It's not like they didn't know there was a rotation.<br>
<br>
This time it happened to be SI's turn in the rotation.<br>
<br>
Once again, Legendary has displayed it's usual lack of intelligence and tact by attempting to butt into the rotation.  Conno can't be blamed for this one.  He wasn't online.  Some other jackass must have been leading this raid.<br>
<br>
If Jonlee's post can be believed, which I sort of doubt given Legendary's track record to date of being lying shits, they've finally decided to request a shot rather than trying to jump another guild.  I hope they actually live up to their word this time.<br>
<br>
Maybe you lego's should wait and try to steal the spawn from all the rest of the guilds in the current rotation before asking for a clear shot.  After all, AN is the only one you haven't tried to jump so far.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
At any rate, for those of you that care, Aary had a brief snack of 47 Lego's (with ONE LD) before SI marched past them.  Given that at least 3 Lego's that I know of (and probably more) have deguilded in the last 3 weeks, maybe the Lego's leadership should think about showing a little integrity.  It might stem the tide of people leaving.<br>
<br>
I've met and talked to some of the Lego's so I KNOW there are some good people in there.  Why not let THEM lead?<br>

This is getting to be a nuisance.<br>
<br>
First off, I watched with bind sight (no, don't worry, I'm not stealing any strats or anything from you) and ya all had the pull fine and held it for about 30 seconds.  Great.  Then someone F'ed up and MT died and then you all died.<br>
<br>
No way ya got him to 60%.<br>
<br>
I was told around noon that you were in TOV.  Our raid was at 7.  At 6:30 you had not engaged Aaryonar.<br>
<br>
You will NOT get a shot at Aaryonar other than ones you can get in before the rotation guilds are able to get up there.<br>
<br>
Demonstrate some competence and some skill and SWIFTNESS OF EXECUTION and then perhaps we can talk.  Current agreement is 48 hours to clear entirely, and ABILITY to clear it entirely.  You cannot do that with spending 7+ hours just breaking in.<br>
<br>
<br>
It also amuses me how NOW you are going to &quot;talk about getting a shot&quot; after you have been a royal pain in the ass for the entire rotation for the last month+.  You zipped in and leached off another guild's hard work one week, and delayed raids TWICE after.<br>
<br>
My guess is your faction with NTOV guilds is probably Max KOS right now.   It is with SI.  Go round me up 20,000 mountain death salts and 15,000 green goblin skins and then we can talk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uvapor1assassin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vapor1assassin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/02 4:19:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://frustrated.com/images/revenge.gif height=166 width=78></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legos and Roy?

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> Chutoi, for your information. Legendary had contacted SI's raid leader and we talked for an extensive preiod of time before we cleared to Aary. Unfortunately a final agreement could not be reached regarding time frame of the attempt. But we wished each other well and went on with our raiding. She has consented that before your official raid time, we could have tried as many times we could but you guys would CoH in once your official raid time starts. Your raid leader was very kind in letting us know your guild's status and warning me of time when you guys will starting moving in Aary hallway reagardless of our raid outcome.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that you do not and will not trust any words coming from a legendary member. <br>
<br>
As of our membership status. Why does it matter to you? And why do you pay particular attention monitoring each of our member's movement? Every guild has its influx and outflow of members continuously. It is a progression of the game and the characters in it. For those that left Legendary on good terms. We wish them good luck in their future endevours. For those that were forcefully removed from the guild or for greed reasons. We try our best to just let him/her go in peace and be done with him/her. Out of the three memebrs left us in the past couple weeks, one was selling major guild property without authorization and subsequently denying any involvement when we confronted him with valid evidence. Mind you, not something small, but Velious City boss loot. He was immediately dismissed from Legendary. One left due to time zone difference and still express his desires to stay in touch with the guild whenever possible. Another member left due to various reasons but he has family in SI. So we'll see where he goes next. <br>
<br>
And rhynnia, if you deem us not worthy of YOUR rotation time. Why bother to have us ABIDE by it? As far as I know, we have officers contacting various guilds in the &quot;rotation&quot;. But the result is fruitless. She has not gotten any clear reply from any guild, sometimes no reply on the status and negotiation at all. <br>
<br>
I assume you are SI's leader although i could be wrong. But from your post, you said &quot;&quot; You will NOT get a shot at Aaryonar other than ones you can get in before the rotation guilds are able to get up there.&quot;&quot;, then why want us to fix so called &quot;faction&quot; with NToV rotation guilds. YOu have expresed your opinion very clearly that we will not be given a fair / clean shot any way possible. You are in essence _encouraging_ us to attempt aary without consent from rotation guilds. Every argument has two sides. I can see the frustation coming from rotation guilds that their precious pixiel draong might be killed by another guild. But also take into account the other party's effort and frustration. <br>
<br>
I do not believe SI had the time pressure we we face each time we attempt aary. You guy had attempted aary from 10 AM in the morning til late at night many months ago when you just started attemping it. It was a run in incident with EV. But you guys stayed tehre for at least a good 10 hours with more than 50 members attendance. and from my memory, you had more than 6 attempts without TIME PRESSURE or other guild around the corner ready to engage that dragon. But that does not excuse us from failure. I am just trying to tell you obviously had the advantage of time to refine and execute your strategies while we had constantly been under tremendous time pressure and outside influence, be it train, intra guild hostile converstaion, CoH past us, etc. Had we been granted a full day like you had the chance with no outside influence. I have no doubt results might be different and our stratgies could be refined more to take down the dragon. <br>
<br>
And no, not everytime we are in ToV means we spend our entire time in the north or trying to break into the north. We more than often just want to farm west or a group or two to farm picture hall for armor. It is a stereotype you forcing on us. <br>
<br>
Lastly, just think for one minute. Those are human beings sitting behind the comptuer screen. It is your freedom to speech. But sometimes you cross the line of flame in jest and slandering. THus you are hurting a true human being's feelings. Maybe you feel better about yourself by putting down other people who you have never bothered to talk to or found out more about. People play this game for fun not for mental baggage or unnecessary hostile confrontation and character slandering.<br>
<br>
I know this is your playground, the flameboard. But alot of people take flameboard very seriously and to heart. I know many legendary people have been hurted by this incident and feel very outraged that our leader has been slandered to such severity. He is the most honorable and straight forward guy I have ever meet. He is fair and would put the guild's well being as priority. Maybe if you bother talk to him online or talk to peopel that actually communicate with him on a daily basis, you will see the good soul in him. That's why he has the guild's support, trust, and respect.<br>
<br>
Good night all.<br>

<br>
&quot;How is anyone supposed to know who to contact when you won't even post the rotation for NToV?&quot;<br>
<br>
Try &quot;communicating&quot; with any member from either of the NToV rotation guilds (SI, RNG, AN, or Transcended).  Now this may be difficult for some people, so I will do the hard work for you.  Here is a generic example of what you could say to &quot;NToVperson01&quot;.<br>
<br>
You tell NToVperson01, 'Do you know who is in NToV this week?'<br>
<br>
Now, this question can only be answered 1 of 2 ways, and I will even do this work for you as well.<br>
<br>
Answer 1:<br>
<br>
NToVperson01 tells you, 'Why yes I do.  The guild scheduled for NToV this week is, (RNG, SI, AN, or Transcended).'<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Answer 2:<br>
<br>
NToVperson01 tells you, 'No, sorry I don't, but I will ask someone and get right back with you.'<br>
<br>
After you find out who is scheduled for NToV, you then send a tell to &quot;NToVguildofficer01&quot; asking if you can attempt Aaryonar on their turn.  Now here is the tricky part, you get to do the communicating for yourself this time.<br>
<br>
Now that I have done all this hard work for you, you no longer have the excuses &quot;We didn't know who was in NToV&quot;, &quot;We didn't know how to find out who was in NToV&quot;, or &quot;We are too fucking stupid to know how to communicate with someone from the guild that is in NToV in order to get a legit turn.  I must apologize for our profound retardedness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good luck, Jackasses<br>

In fact this is starting to look like every other rotation that has been on its last legs.
