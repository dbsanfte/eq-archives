Going to lower guk to complete my staff of the wheel at level 30.  Needed an invis to undead and this way my last piece for the staff.  I auction out paying well for an IVU he answers.  I had no idea who this guy and he leads me by LMH, casts dispell magic on me, I get my ass beat by the dar.<br>
<br>
Anyone remember Asrok?  He saw what happened, dragged my corpse, got me a res, got me the piece from LMH, and trained Alexandyr.  Amazing he could not get a ressurection.<br>

And as far as the comment I JUST ninjaed a CoF, okay.  You are not supposed to ninja ANY loot dumbass.  I feel this post and his movelog is a small amount of justice for all the grief he has caused the server.<br>

Met him a LONG ass time ago before he had a rep, I believe.<br>
<br>
Some friends had talked me into going to the Gorge to get some polished Bone Bracers (they were Oobar) yes, I did say a LONG ass time ago.<br>
<br>
Well, there's this little necro there who wants to join.  These were the good old days of &quot;the more the merrier&quot; so we invited him.<br>
<br>
These were also the days when we were all poor as hell and we rotated loot.  You loot, then you next then you, etc...  I DID say it was a long time ago.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this guy was nuts, he was looting before the corpse could even hit the ground.  After a few times, we told him to wait his turn to loot.  he's back at it again.  We warn him again.  No good, he's still looting everything in sight.  <br>
<br>
After about 20 minutes I told Drackmore (grou leader) to kick his ass out.  He did, and then we have this little moron running around yelling &quot;hey, invite me!  I got kicked!&quot; and we're thinking &quot;You sure as hell did!&quot;  Anyway, that was my FIRST encounter.  A bitch from the day he was born.<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Next.. this is when I learned to hate him.  <br>
<br>
Okay, I skipped Guk altogether.  I had no interest in going there so I did other things as I level up.  Well, I'm grouped with Zylee and Runaway and we're bored so they suggest going to Guk to goof off.  We get there and they check and the little bastard frog who drops the SMR is open. <br>
<br>
Well, I never had one of those growing up and I thought it'd be fun, besides, I'd need one for my Epic later on.<br>
<br>
We pick up a couple tank or two if I recall and go down there.  Here comes Alexandr hanging around.  He doesn't really do anything so it's okay, but he still makes us nervous.<br>
<br>
We kill the Frog guy a few times but no Robe.  The meleers go LD and the frogs all pop.  Zylee and I are half mana or so, and Runaway is our tank.  Alexandr is sitting there.<br>
<br>
Embarrassingly enough, we're getting our ass kicked.  We literaly killed them all except the Robe frog and he was at a sliver of health and Runaway dies.  I start yelling at Zylee to evac.  Alexandr still just sits there and I'm like &quot;DUDE HELP!&quot;<br>
<br>
I tank for a bit trying to get it under control then I get a stun resisted and Wham, dead.<br>
<br>
I ask Zylee if we got him, she says no, she evacced and missed me by half a second.  She tells me Alexandr is messaging her though:<br>
<br>
He wanted us to know that he killed the fucking Frog after we died/evacced and it dropped the Robe, and thanks! <br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Next was funny.  I zoned into Dreadlands once, and Alexandr said something in OOC and the shitstorm began.  It was like world war 3.<br>
<br>
Finally it died down and someone does /auc WTS Guide to Accidental Corpselooting by Alexandr, 100pp!<br>
<br>
I laughed pretty hard at that. <p><CENTER>

<br>
Was in CoM one day needed a tank so Vanusk is standing there.. we invite him..... say well its FFA loot rol lfor goodies... was playing my druid didnt care about loot... so i didnt really care to loot much, i saw him he looted every corpse for at least an hour.. some people were asking him to stop... So we make a loot order.... lol he still doesnt follow it and loots everything... finally he goes LD.... so we replace him right away.... lol he logs back on and starts cussin and screaming in ooc how we are assholes.. fucked him outta of a group.. ect... we told him why we didnt want him back.. says something stupid like &quot;i didnt loot at all&quot;  <br>
<br>
I didnt really care about money but it still was funny as hell... i have never grouped him again... but when i saw him talkin in DL in ooc asking where a 54 war can go solo cause he had a Fungi Tunic... i figured this wasnt the only group hed done that too...<br>
<br>
Ok that had nothing to do with Alexandr at all... but your story made that one just pop into my head from no where ... so i had to share it lol<br>

I was playing Caledhon (my warrior) at the time, and I happened to be the only one who knew the pulls, so I was making the rounds having broken the place nicely.  As soon as Alex joined the group, every minute for the next hour I saw in groupchat - &quot;Pull the sage plz!! pull sage!!&quot;  I tried to explain to him over and over that we had all the exe spawns broken and the sage would spawn when he was due up next, and I would pull him... but nothing seemed to get through this idiot's 5 inch thick skull.  After going on like this for a while I got a bad pull or our chanter went LD or something... somehow Alex managed to get himself killed.  We were all still sitting around happily killing spawns, but now Senor Alexandr needed a rez.  He asked around and managed to get a high level (wowowow, 49!!) cleric in the LMH group to rez him, asked us if he could drag his corpse over - &quot;Sure, go ahead&quot;, off he went.  He got his rez... and then sat there in the LMH room for a good 20-30 minutes.  We asked occasionally where the hell he was, a necro would be handy killing all these frogs, etc... no reply.  Finally, after about another half hour we suddenly saw Alex's health drop to zero.  Next thing we see in groupchat... &quot;LMH fucking TRAINED me!!!!  they r so st00pid~!!&quot;  or somesuch.  Apparently the LMH group had gotten a bad pull and been forced to evac, leaving our friend Alexandr stuck in the room with no invis apparently.  Squish.  As if that wasn't stupid enough, when he finally got back to LGuk he shouted and ooced constantly what assholes LMH (the same ones who gave him a rare and prized 49 rez) were for &quot;training&quot; him and killing him.  What an ass.<br>
<br>
Other than this, the only encounters I've had with him consist of me making fun of him in /ooc and him getting upset.  Oh, and once I duelled him... a warrior vs. a necro, yes.  I had actually beat necros before, but this time as soon as we both agreed to duel and I hit /d (mistake!), he immediately ran off to the other side of the zone and got full druid buffs including SoW, which I of course lacked.  One of those lesson learned things, I guess... seems a pretty dishonorable thing to do to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umaxamaji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/3/02 8:49:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alexandr/Munyo</span><hr size=1> Might as well throw mine in :P<br>

First Skywilker cusses at us *repeatedly* for &quot;stealing&quot; his (greenie) spiders, and after about 45 min of this, asks to join our group. Much laughter ensues. Then another person shows up and we head down to EL. Who do we meet at the lava pool with about 5 imps on his ass? Munyo of course. Fucknut feigns on us, and since rangers and druids are notoriously bad at FDing, we eat it. We go back, get our shit, start moving down, and who do we meet again? Yep, and the fucker kills us again, same story. We go down a third time and what do you think the little dipshit does after feigning at our feet twice? Asks to join our group.<br>

<br>
Yes, it was a Phalanx / CoP raid.  I believe it was spring(ish) of last year.  Yes, MC was the RL.<br>
<br>
Naggy drops, wiz group gets the kill.  I pop my head in to his ass to see what drops, and see the CoF.  Dance, dance, and all that shit, word gets out it dropped while we're waiting for MC to loot it -- of course he goes LD.<br>
<br>
I jump back into the loot window to lock the bod, and when MC gets back on I give him a tell to loot it, then stand off.  Of course, by the time he gets in there the cloak is gone, and everyone starts freaking.<br>
<br>
Noc gets called in and finds it on Munyo (now in EC, trying to sell it).  She takes it back from him, suspends him for a day or a week, and the cloak comes back to us.<br>
<br>
Being MCs last baby-dragon raid, everyone passes on the cloak and forces him to take it.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, I should have just looted the fucking thing and given it to him when he came back -- but I was a tag along on that raid and didn't feel right doing it.<br>
<br>
Live and learn, all turned out well because Noc rocked so hard, and Munyo is still an asshole.<br>

I've never had Alex ninja anything from me or my group, but I lived through a few of his LGuk trains. Yeah, they were pretty bad. Other than that he just acted like a retard, he was constantly sending me tells asking me if I wanted to buy something from him, or sell him something I was wearing. <br>

The best was when he ripped me off pretty bad on a trade ( I didn't know him, and made a trade not knowing the market value, pretty stupid I know ) but when I was trying to sell off the items I'd gotten from him (I did end up making up the deficit through some good deals) he kept trying to buy back the items he'd originally traded to me for like half what they were worth... didn't even realize that I'd gotten them from him in the first place. <p><IMG SRC="http://users.starpower.net/dmoser/images/Kaldayr.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usonovabeech.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sonova Beech</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/4/02 10:29:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a munyo story</span><hr size=1> had some friends in a botched fear raid.<br>
went in to help pull their corpses out with some monk trainage/loot and evac action.<br>
guess who was dead at that raid? Munyo<br>
<br>
so after about an hour or so (and 2 DTs from the golems) the CR is underway and remarkably smooth considering the awkwardness.<br>
<br>
we had all the melee's looted and only the druid and chanter's CR to go when guess who comes charging in thru the portal? Munyo <br>
pulls a fuckload of asslings to the wall and FDs. <br>
<br>
You tell Munyo &quot;You better /q to clear aggro&quot;<br>
Munyo tells you &quot; I know what i am doing!!&quot;<br>
<br>
he promptly stands up and gets raped by asslings while trying to loot his corpse.<br>
was funny shit<br>
<br>
eventually he comes back and FDs next to me again<br>
<br>
You tell Munyo &quot;Could you wait a few minutes while my friends loot their corpses? we will port you out when we're done&quot;<br>
<br>
Munyo tells you &quot; no i want my stuff&quot;<br>
<br>
stands up and trains the chanter and druid sinking almost an hours worth of prep time just so he could loot his fungi tunic.<br>
<br>
thats not the kicker <br>
he did that again later and i ended up sucking 2 more unnecessary unrezzed deaths<br>
<br>
we left him in fear without a port<br>
