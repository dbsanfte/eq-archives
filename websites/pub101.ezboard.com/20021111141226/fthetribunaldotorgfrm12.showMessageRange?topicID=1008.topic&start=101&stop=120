Just a quick flash into how horribly stupid that DM is.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also if you think you do more in ten hours then I do in a week, you really are smoking crack, I dont have to explain all I do, I know what I do, so do the people I raid with, but that was quite funny.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It was quite funny because you are incapable of comprehending a complete sentence. You only read what you want to and make up the rest so you can beat your chest and be a mighty little man-boy. To put it in kindergarten terms so you are more able to comprehend the statement....... I can play Everquest 10 hours a week and that takes care of my on-line hobby for that week. You need many many hours a week to fulfil your needs. Maybe you are jealous of me and other casual gamers like me because we dont have to sit in front of the computer day after day after long ass day in order to fulfil our desires of everquest.<br>
Look back on my original post you lackwit. I supported your guilds recruitment policy. But you come out thumping your chest because you think your guild tag means you are a great player. Your guild tag has very little to do with how great a player you are. It merely symbolizes the amount of your life you spend playing Everquest.<br>
Go ahead and spin my words again DM. Seems I took up for you when someone was accusing you of twisting shit around before. Seems I was wrong. You really have no abilities to comprehend the written word. All you can do is grab a couple phrases and twist the meaning around to fit your drab little lonely existance.<br>
The only reason I give a fuck about what you have to say is because you take my words out of context, twist them, then poke em back in my face and expect me, and everyone else, to eat them for the truth. Well your truth and logic are totally flawed. You should have your midsection replaced with glass windows. Then you could still see around you, even tho your head is buried so far up your ass.<br>

<br>
<br>
I disagree. While melee classes are heavily dependent on eqipment, casters are only dependent on resist gear. Most casters already exceed the AC softcap and the additional points, while they look nice on your Magelo profile, mean diddly squat as far as performance.<br>
<br>
Mana gear? Well, yes to a degree, but even the best mana gear only affords 2 extra casts of most high end spells. Besides, if you have C3 up, mana regen negates alot of the need for mana quantity.<br>
<br>
Focus items? Well, if you are raiding you have a mage there. Perma items are nice, but summoned will work just fine.<br>
<br>
HP? HP gear will help somewhat to negate AE damage, but no caster is going to stand up to direct melee for more than 2 or 3 rounds. Use LoS and resists as they are much more effective than HP.<br>
<br>
So, while I agree with you on melee, casters simply require the spells, good resists and some raid smarts imo.<br>

On the spell side, you are absolutely right though.  So much so that some certain spells (no they are not &quot;ancient&quot;) are put on item loot tables and until very recently were very rare or have yet to drop on this server.<br>

That is why gear is somewhat important to casters as well. The same goes for every other class that uses mana, the only exception is maybe the shaman, but although max mana means less to shamans, we still have to worry about AC and HP.<br>
<br>
Also, someone who plays for 10 hours a day will not likely be very high level, and is even more unlikely to have much AA skills, some of which make great differences in one's abilities.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget someone who can only play 10 hours a week will not likely be very knowledgable about what to do against certain mobs. I think I can speak for everyone who's ever lead raids, ignorance on an individual's part can bring about rather large consequences. However, if this is a &quot;great player&quot; then theoretically this person would listen carefully, and follow directions well, so this may not become an issue.<br>
<br>
I think the largest issue here is dependability. For guilds who's goal is to raid, they would want members who could be depended upon to show up, especially for key classes. For a guild who does raids and no much else, somewho who could only show up to 1/5 of the raids would not be very useful, because 80% of the time the person isn't there when he's needed.<br>

Nukers don't worry about how much mana they have all up except wizards and manaburn, because they can't chain nuke - there is always a gap between spell casting to avoid aggro. Same with clerics - they don't non stop cast CH, there is a gap between casting. It's all about how mana you can regen in between those casts - against Luclin uber mobs in fights that go for 20-30mins against very high damage output mobs, its having FT that counts. Even FT 5 gives you such a huge boost over 20mins its insane, and FT10+ are just incredible. c3 + bard song + other mana regen is good, but FT on top of that gives a major extra advantage.<br>
<br>
Against Velious ubers it was a mix of endurance and damage, in Luclin its *all* endurance. And casters in Luclin need as much FT type gear as they can get against Luclin mobs. And now with Focus effects going in, casters are even more dependent on gear, cause you can bet VI will begin to balance uber encounters with Focus effects in mind.<br>

Regen is important, but think about it. The wizard with 2600 mana will have to regen 1400 mana JUST to equal the wizard with 4000 mana.<br>

Actually the only reason you give a fuck about what I say is because you want to be respected and uber, you want people to like you and adore you thinking you are insightful and humorous. You couldnt accomplish anything in game so you decided to make an ezboard persona and level that apparently, lazy people usually take that route when they realize no one knows them in game and that camping a spider in velks was just so HARD. Also Krickett if, like I said, and asked, people dont respect what I say because I whored my way into EV, why would it matter what I said? It matters because you are crying at this moment, so upset feeling on the outside, feeling like me ( someone you supported which in yer mind should net you loyalty from me ) an uberguild player is making fun of you. Really do you need a tissue for your tears, its pretty apparent how upset you are over this. When you want to stop crying and whining like the little bitch you are, and maybe suck it up, then come talk to me, otherwise all your doing is throwing a tantrum pleading for acceptance and acknowledgement from someone whom you say dont respect, how pathetic you are. <p><center><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/RFthunderkickfinal2.gif><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92681>

I dont want to presume to speak for Loegan.  but what I believe his point is .. <br>
<br>
Take a naked warrior..  and a fully equipped warrior.  HUGE difference ..  In fact you can hardly even compare the two..  Now take a wizard who is naked.. VS one who is equipped .. BIG difference..  but they CAN be compared ..  <br>
<br>
then extend that some.. <br>
<br>
Take a Warrior in the best Kunark has to offer.   and a warrior in the best Velious has to offer..  <br>
<br>
HUGE difference again.. <br>

Take a wizard in the best Kunark has to offer .. and a wizard in the best Veilous has to offer..   There is a difference.  but not much of one.. <br>
<br>
I believe his point was that Melee are more dependant on gear than casters.  I dont see how anyone can really disagree with that..   Most casters had maxxed INT back before Kunark even.   How many warriors had over 1200 AC and over 4K hp back then.   Oneton and Pigg ... how many others ?<br>

<br>
How often do you go fighting a dragon NAKED ? The age old CR argument that &quot;casters have it easier because they can fight naked&quot; is about just as dumb. Naked or not : can I tank my way back to my corpse ? No.<br>
<br>
Your armor comparisons are also flawed: kunark vs velious : 2 MELEE expansions with about zero caster loot worth mentioning. Then again... we had bane spells back then and those weren't half bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (if expensive)<br>
<br>
As I said : it's not as obvious as bigger stats... but with Luclin, choices of gear are just as important for a caster than a melee. They are actually harder decisions to make IMHO because it's very often hard to evaluate the impact of some items &quot;in situ&quot;. It's not just about packing more AC/HP and resists. It's about compromising some stats to gain other advantages. Nevermind that you can't plan your gear ahead since we still dont know what high end items will have what focus added on them...<br>
  <br>
Enough freebies... i'll let you figure out the rest for yourself.<br>

<br>
AC - While there is no concrete proof, I believe most people would agree that there is an AC softcap for each class, beyond which you gain little if any return. For druid that is estimated around 750. I think most druids, uber guild or not, not can attain 750AC.<br>
<br>
Mana Gear - Click on my Magelo profile and you will see I have 920 mana from items. I realize that is not top gear, but it is well above average for most druid. Now what will that 920 mana do for me?<br>
<br>
2 extra Starfire of Ro's for 2250 damage.<br>
<br>
Or 2 extra Moonfires for 2200 damage<br>
<br>
Or 2 extra Winged Deaths for 2574 damage over the course of 2 minutes<br>
<br>
Or 5 extra Chloroblasts for 1925 HP<br>
<br>
Other spells are not time sensitive, so the mana regen would cancel out the mana pool. The one spell I see that might benefit signficantly from the extra mana is Chloroblast, but given that it heals only 385 a cast it does not keep up with the damage of end game mobs anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
HP - I have 585 HP from equipment. This is enough to help me on -some- AEs, however any end game mob will easily do 585 damage in two rounds or less.<br>
<br>
Focus Items - If I have a focus item it saves the mage from having to summon one at the raid. Otherwise there is no added benefit that I can see.<br>
<br>
<br>
So you tell me. Other than wisdom (which mine is maxed anyway), how important is the gear? Are my extra 2250 damage or 1925 healed HP going to seperate me from a druid who only has 750AC and 200 extra mana from non-end game mobs? I don't think so.<br>
<br>
What will make a huge difference is high resist gear. If you resist the AEs, it is a major impact for the healers (I know this from being a healer and having members in my group who have medium or low resists).<br>
<br>
Now I didn't take manaburn into consideration, but other than that, I think the above would hold true for most casters. Yes, it's nice to have perma focus items, but a mage can summon them if you don't.<br>
<br>
FT items are another matter and there is not much I can say to argue that other than that FT is not on most of the items in game anyway, so only a very small percentage of players have any real amount of FT numbers I am guessing. <p><br>

An extra 2200 damage means alot then as does having more HP. BUt what we are discussing is raids and that extra 3% damage I do over a druid with a regular mana pool is not going to seperate us. What will seperate us is:<br>
<br>
Resists<br>
<br>
Connection Lag<br>
<br>
Hardware Lag<br>
<br>
Spells we possess<br>
<br>
And most importantly, playing our character well.<br>
<br>
Take two melee and have one in sub par gear and one in top end gear, and I don't care how well the sub par gear melee knows his class, he just can't compete with the top gear one.<br>
<br>
Put me in ES armor and as long as my wis is maxed and I have good resist gear, I can keep within 10% performance of the better equipped druid. Being a caster is more about raid smarts than gear. <p><br>

Resists are almost useless in Luclin, simply because the majority of Luclin uber mobs don't have an AE worth resisting, and the few who do, have DoT type AEs that typically last for 2+ hours - so once you get once by them, it doesn't matter if you resist every AE from then on, you still have the effect. A good comparison would be the Vulak AE - no one ever bothered trying to resist his AE because it would eventually land, and it goes for 3 hours, or more. So everyone just puts on their AC/hp/mana gear (depending on class). Most Luclin mobs are like this - note: I've no idea how VT bosses compare - resists may become important again in VT.<br>
<br>
Add the length of the average fight against a top Luclin mob (20-30mins, or more) and you get into a situation where the only thing that matters, as a caster, is how fast you are regenning mana, because this equates directly to how soon you can cast your next heal or nuke, and have a net zero, or at least very small, mana loss over that time.<br>
<br>
I will agree with you that caster gear that boosts hp, AC, resists and mana is not super crucial. However, gear that boosts mana regen is so crucial its not funny. Practically every decent caster loot that drops off a top Luclin uber mob has a healthy chunk of FT on it - eg. FT 5 robes and tunics, FT 6 shields, FT 3 and 4 Range slot items, FT 6 rings, and so on. In 2-3 kills (of mobs like Burrower and Cursed esepcially - hell, Cursed even drops a ranger *only* weapon that has FT 4 on it =), you can easily see a total of over 15 FT &quot;points&quot; drop.<br>
<br>
Mana regen is where its at in Luclin - you need very decent amounts of it to last through the marathon battles against Luclin's uber mobs. Caster gear, specifically FT gear, is very, very important against Luclin uber mobs (and I'm talking about the top rank here - mobs like AL, HP, Cursed, Emperor, Seru, VT I imagine). Luclin gear can now make a big difference between casters, just as Velious gear made a huge gap between those melee who had ToV N/Vulak/ST loot and those who didn't.<br>

<br>
Ladmo you aint got anything you fucking moron, you might need to fall back to flaming me about Razzine, since thats the one thing you can hold on to that you think I give a damn about. I dont a give a shit, I aint with her now, I havent talked her in almost half a year, but yeah, feel free to keep trying to use that a flame, it only shows that yer flames lack any real gumptation or insight. You are the retard of this board that throws an occasional statement now and then that might be funny. Keep pretending your life doesnt revolve around this board.<br>
<br>
<br>
Krickett I must say how sad it is, you cannot even produce any viable flames of your own, the same old shit, oh god not another Razzine reference, omg, whatever shall I do, he hit me where I dont care. I do notice that the board campers like you and Ladmo often take what they think they know and harp on it like they have an inside tip. You spend all day trying to be part of my world, you know I was involved with Razzine, you know I draw pics, you know I am in EV. Hell the only thing I know about you is you claimed you were the best healer on the server or some shit I got from earlier in this post. I dont care about you, but apparently you care about me, so much you have all this supposed knowledge of me. You are such a fanboy of me son. Its okay though, keep pretending that you think I am stupid and evil, its a good cover for your hurt feelings. The more you protest the more you prove me right.<br>
<br>
So I expect a flame about me involving:<br>
<br>
My Artwork-<br>
    How it sucks, How I used it to get into EV and win favor, How I draw boobs too big, I draw noses too big, My artwork is too cartoonish,....etc<br>
<br>
My Old Relationships-<br>
    How I talked to Razzine on the phone over a year plus ago, How she is in a wheelchair and how you are intrested in people with two legs, How we never met but apparently we had sex, How I fucked her everyday when she lived on the otherside of the country, How I was the only one she fooled and ignore the other dozen plus guys on this server who got fucked over by her also....etc.<br>
<br>
My Guild-<br>
     How me being EV makes me a better player then everyone, How my guildtag is freepass, How I dont contribute to my guild, How I kiss up to my guildmates for loot with pictures, How my guild is mean and how can anyone respect someone in EV.....etc.<br>
<br>
My Posting Style-<br>
      How I quote people and reply, How I interpret things and apparently its twisting things around because people dont understand that words can be interpretted by different people different ways, How I am mean, How I get personal and dirty...etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Seriously if thats the best ya can do, ya better come a little stronger, I have been around a long time, and from what I can see you two bitches are just hanging around sniffing yer own finger hoping to get someone else to smell it too, thinking its a brilliant thing you do. Oh look, a retired poop slinger and noob buff slinger, I am terrified, they might make empty flames about shit they know nothing about....I am shaking girls, really I am.<br>
