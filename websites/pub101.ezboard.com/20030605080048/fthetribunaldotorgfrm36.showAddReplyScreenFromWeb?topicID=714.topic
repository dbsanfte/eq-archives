<br>
Because We Could<br>
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN<br>
<br>
The failure of the Bush team to produce any weapons of mass destruction (W.M.D.'s) in Iraq is becoming a big, big story. But is it the real story we should be concerned with? No. It was the wrong issue before the war, and it's the wrong issue now.<br>
<br>
Why? Because there were actually four reasons for this war: the real reason, the right reason, the moral reason and the stated reason.<br>
<br>
The &quot;real reason&quot; for this war, which was never stated, was that after 9/11 America needed to hit someone in the Arab-Muslim world. Afghanistan wasn't enough because a terrorism bubble had built up over there — a bubble that posed a real threat to the open societies of the West and needed to be punctured. This terrorism bubble said that plowing airplanes into the World Trade Center was O.K., having Muslim preachers say it was O.K. was O.K., having state-run newspapers call people who did such things &quot;martyrs&quot; was O.K. and allowing Muslim charities to raise money for such &quot;martyrs&quot; was O.K. Not only was all this seen as O.K., there was a feeling among radical Muslims that suicide bombing would level the balance of power between the Arab world and the West, because we had gone soft and their activists were ready to die.<br>
<br>
The only way to puncture that bubble was for American soldiers, men and women, to go into the heart of the Arab-Muslim world, house to house, and make clear that we are ready to kill, and to die, to prevent our open society from being undermined by this terrorism bubble. Smashing Saudi Arabia or Syria would have been fine. But we hit Saddam for one simple reason: because we could, and because he deserved it and because he was right in the heart of that world. And don't believe the nonsense that this had no effect. Every neighboring government — and 98 percent of terrorism is about what governments let happen — got the message. If you talk to U.S. soldiers in Iraq they will tell you this is what the war was about.<br>
<br>
The &quot;right reason&quot; for this war was the need to partner with Iraqis, post-Saddam, to build a progressive Arab regime. Because the real weapons of mass destruction that threaten us were never Saddam's missiles. The real weapons that threaten us are the growing number of angry, humiliated young Arabs and Muslims, who are produced by failed or failing Arab states — young people who hate America more than they love life. Helping to build a decent Iraq as a model for others — and solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — are the necessary steps for defusing the ideas of mass destruction, which are what really threaten us.<br>
<br>
The &quot;moral reason&quot; for the war was that Saddam's regime was an engine of mass destruction and genocide that had killed thousands of his own people, and neighbors, and needed to be stopped.<br>
<br>
But because the Bush team never dared to spell out the real reason for the war, and (wrongly) felt that it could never win public or world support for the right reasons and the moral reasons, it opted for the stated reason: the notion that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction that posed an immediate threat to America. I argued before the war that Saddam posed no such threat to America, and had no links with Al Qaeda, and that we couldn't take the nation to war &quot;on the wings of a lie.&quot; I argued that Mr. Bush should fight this war for the right reasons and the moral reasons. But he stuck with this W.M.D. argument for P.R. reasons.<br>
<br>
Once the war was over and I saw the mass graves and the true extent of Saddam's genocidal evil, my view was that Mr. Bush did not need to find any W.M.D.'s to justify the war for me. I still feel that way. But I have to admit that I've always been fighting my own war in Iraq. Mr. Bush took the country into his war. And if it turns out that he fabricated the evidence for his war (which I wouldn't conclude yet), that would badly damage America and be a very serious matter.<br>
<br>
But my ultimate point is this: Finding Iraq's W.M.D.'s is necessary to preserve the credibility of the Bush team, the neocons, Tony Blair and the C.I.A. But rebuilding Iraq is necessary to win the war. I won't feel one whit more secure if we find Saddam's W.M.D.'s, because I never felt he would use them on us. But I will feel terribly insecure if we fail to put Iraq onto a progressive path. Because if that doesn't happen, the terrorism bubble will reinflate and bad things will follow. Mr. Bush's credibility rides on finding W.M.D.'s, but America's future, and the future of the Mideast, rides on our building a different Iraq. We must not forget that. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 774<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/3/03 9:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> So... the ends justify the means.  Basically, this says that its ok the president lied and deceived, because Saddam was a *really* bad man.<br>
<br>
Even Walkabout doesn't disagree that Saddam was a bad man - but the rest of us are asking a) what gives us the RIGHT to go to war on that moral judgement and b) does this mean all presidents can lie if they do so for good reason?<br>
<br>
Bill Clinton was crucified for lying about his personal business.  Bush lied and it cost us $100,000,000,000.00.  If he was worried that I and other voters wouldn't have supported him if he's shown pictures of mass graves, then guess what - voters rule in this country.  If GWB wants to go get rid of Saddam, but the American people don't support his reason for doing so, he damn well better *not* go do it anyway.  That's NOT what this country is about.<br>
<br>
If any president has a reason for wanting to take an action, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>let him state his reasons and let the people decide.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If he didn't think he'd get the support, so he had to use a propoganda campaign instead, then he was probably right, there probably wasn't support, and he used and deceived people to serve his own agenda, instead of the popular will of the people.  Does that make sense?  Basically, if the &quot;real reason&quot; didn't have support, we shouldn't have done it.<br>
<br>

<br>
That's not what I understood Friedman to say at all. He said the president was too chickenshit to state the real reason (ok, that's biased but deal with it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) because he didn't think he could get support for it.<br>
<br>
What I want to know is, how does Friedman know what Bush was thinking? Sounds to me like he is giving him a HUGE benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> If he was worried that I and other voters wouldn't have supported him if he's shown pictures of mass graves, then guess what - voters rule in this country.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sorry, but you are dead wrong bro. Voters get to choose who represents them, but the decisions they make are up to them. If we don't like the decisions then we can vote them out (that's the democracy) but the US is a republic.<br>
<br>
Let me say this - I do respect Bush for having the balls to go against the polls, which is what he did in the beginning of this war. The problem is I don't believe it was the right choice based on the reasons he gave and I still think he manipulated the intelligence analysis to show what he wanted to believe.<br>
<br>
I put alot of stock in Tom Friedman's opinion, but I think he is giving Bush way too much credit on this one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If any president has a reason for wanting to take an action, let him state his reasons and let the people decide. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sorry bro, you and I agree on alot, but I think you are way off on this. The President is the guy who we elect to make the calls. Intelligence can't be given to the public to make calls, nor can the public be trusted to be informed enough to make the call on every issue. We have to rely on the President to take the info he has access to and make the right choice. That is why elections are so important and why people should vote based on past performance and not whether you like the way he looks or his speaking style.<br>
<br>
You seem to be under the impression the US is a pure democracy, but it isn't. It is a republic where the representatives are democratically elected.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But my ultimate point is this: Finding Iraq's W.M.D.'s is necessary to preserve the credibility of the Bush team, the neocons, Tony Blair and the C.I.A. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sorry, but I have to disagree with my boy on this one. I think the CIA gave good intelligence even when pressured because it didn't say what the administration wanted it to. Unfortunately I think the CIA is gonna be used for the scapegoat in all this and that really pisses me off.<br>
<br>
I also think we have to find WMD to maintain the credibility of the USA. Anyone who thinks that the US will magically get it's credibility back when Bush leaves office (if we don't find WMD) is living in fantasy world imo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Basically, if the &quot;real reason&quot; didn't have support, we shouldn't have done it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Depends on what the real reason was and if it was in the best interest of the country.<br>
<br>
There is one part of this article that stated my beliefs to the letter:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because the real weapons of mass destruction that threaten us were never Saddam's missiles. The real weapons that threaten us are the growing number of angry, humiliated young Arabs and Muslims, who are produced by failed or failing Arab states - young people who hate America more than they love life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I forget who said it, but the most underestimated emotion is humiliation. I just wish this administration realized this and dealt with other countries respectfully. The humiliation they cause today in their dealings with other nations are seeding the conflicts of tomorrow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1236<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 6:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> I suppose Saddam never humiliated Iraqis, either.<br>
<br>
Humiliated?  Maybe now, right after being defeated in a war.  But if we're succesful?  Iraq will become one of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region.  They know their potential.<br>
<br>
Anyway, sounds like you've made up your mind on the rest of it.  That's what I just don't get... there are many explanations for what went on, yet you grasp upon the one or two that best suit your needs and trumpet them as gospel.  I'm still waiting, myself... seems like the prudent thing to do.  I have my suspicions, but I'm not going to declare one thing or the other until, well, there are some hard facts to back it up.  Not just columnists opinions.<br>
<br>
Tuwene:  I understood the &quot;real&quot; reason.  I understood all the reasons.  This is what Wenin and I have been saying for months.  Bush did not explain all the reasons.  Why?  Who knows... but its not like they weren't on the table.  Apparently Bush's strategy worked, at any rate.  Besides, do you think most Americans would have understood the sort of complex explanation necessary to understand the &quot;real&quot; reason?  I don't know... The ends justifies the means?  If the ends is a justified war against a ruthless dictatorship which will greatly assist in the overall War on Terror, and the means are explaining one, but not all, the reasons you want that war, then sure... Bush may have hurt himself by not indicating the best reason(s) why he wanted to go to war, but if just the reasons he stated were enough for the American people, why bother with more anyway?  Besides - they were out there, like I've said.  You just couldn't get your eyes off the big flashing OIL!  OIL!  OIL! sign raised up by the Greens and wacko leftists long enough to see them. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 6/4/03 6:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 970<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 8:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> &gt; But if we're succesful?

Loegan, you're technically right - the people are stupid, which is exactly why the founding fathers didn't trust them with a real democracy.  However, when you're talking about issues of things like deciding our nation's moral standing, you have to look to the people.  If we did this because &quot;saddam is evil&quot;, then only if the majority of the people feel that way is it a valid sentiment IMHO.<br>
<br>
It's a VERY different story in the case of intel about WMDs, or whatnot, where if Saddam was a THREAT, we don't need 50% of the population behind it to take action.<br>
<br>
Just my 0.02 anyway.  At this point, I'm mainly just trying to keep some debate on this going, because it's really become a non-issue in reality :P  what's done is done, i think we all know that the world is a better place without Saddam in power, and all that's left now are the moral questions.  Since I'm quite undecided on the morality of our ruling Iraq, I'll stick to the one thing I know for sure:  I don't like being lied to by my government.  And I'm not talking about the little white lies - big, boldfaced lies that are told simply to prevent a revolt of public opinion for actions the president fears won't be popular.<br>
<br>
Cal:  you and i basically agree on this at this point.  I'll still take issue with you saying this in any way aided the War on Terror... but the only way I'll come around on that will be if we ever actually find WMDs or a paper trail connecting Saddam to real terrorists (everything so far has been mighty circumstantial or unreliable, you have to admit). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3403<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 9:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I suppose Saddam never humiliated Iraqis, either.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You misunderstood - the humiliation issue has nothing to do with Iraq. It's every other country we deal with. There was quite an article written quoting some of the Latin American ambassadors and one from New Mexico.<br>
<br>
Watch a news conference sometime where Bush and another leader are talking to the press... especially the ones in other countries... then tell me you have any doubt.<br>
<br>
Bush is a bully. Rumsfeld is a verbal assassin. Do you really think there diplomacy is any more toned down behind closed doors?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Anyway, sounds like you've made up your mind on the rest of it. That's what I just don't get... there are many explanations for what went on, yet you grasp upon the one or two that best suit your needs and trumpet them as gospel. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
How long ago did I post that article that claimed the CIA was being pressured into giving the answers the Bush administration wanted? How long after that did Bush get his own little group of analysts to give him the answers he wanted? I think current events have lent alot of credibility to those articles.<br>
<br>
You had Saddams own neighbors stating he wasn't a threat. You had the UN counseling against it. You had global opinion against it. You had other nations Intelligence agencies admitting they had false info and retracting previous claims. You had forged documents and plagiarized documents. You had smoking guns that evaporated at least every two weeks and still Bush just wouldn't accept an answer that in any way implied he shouldn't invade Iraq.<br>
<br>
What I believe is that all the signs were there that this was the wrong move at the wrong time and Bush chose to ignore not one, not two but every one of those signs. Now you think he deserves slack on the issue of WMD?<br>
<br>
Sorry, no dice. I have alot of respect for you Cal, but there is just too many little (and not so little) events that paint us a pretty good picture of how this played out imo. The lack of WMD is just the crowning event that dispels most doubt. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A> at: 6/4/03 9:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 1270<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 9:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.woc.org/public/oneirodynia/images/srllogo.GIF height=180 width=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> i am a lyrical assasin!<br>

<br>
Actually, thats not how our country works.  Voters do not rule our country.  The design of our government is to pick someone to rule it for us, because we as voters cannot make all the necessary decisions in our own best interests.

I'm thinkin that the average American attitude is &quot;oh, they can huff and puff all they want over there in A-RAB land but I know they can't touch us if they tried, even if they were uniformly against us because we so great!&quot; and thus the true agenda for the president to deal with a serious threat could possibly not be supported.  The president, senate, CIA, AND pentagon all consider(ed) it a serious threat and yet you still do not...obviously they were right about something.

My vote says &quot;I grant the president power to do things that I may not agree with because I am only one person with limited knowledge and wisdom on the subject of ruling a nation&quot; while yours is the opposite.

Yah, really.  Seriously is underestimated.  If an opponent can be dealt with respectfully, it should be.  If they cannot, then they should be crushed like a bug so severely that they cannot retaliate nor never want to (i.e. basically forcing humbleness out of them, which also requires giving them a helping hand after decking them to the ground) sort of like Japan in WWII.

<br>
I could see the &quot;bully&quot; in the way Bush talks, but lemme tell ya...Rumsfeld gives it straight up in a &quot;don't f*** with me&quot; way.  I love the guy to death.  Everytime a reporter tries to make em look bad or ask the same question over and over, he is straight up blunt and says somethin' like &quot;I already told you the answer, dont bother asking it again&quot; or some weird thing.  If other countries' leaders watch TV to get some reaction out of the U.S. to see where its at, Rumsfeld's reactions is what they should watch.  So if by verbal assassin you mean &quot;verbally squashes any political/media attempts of other countries to bad mouth the U.S.&quot; then hell yea I agree.  If you don't mean that, then I really don't know what ya mean...so you should clarify for me.<br>

 Wolfowitz: Iraq war was about oil<br>
<br>
George Wright<br>
Wednesday June 4, 2003<br>
<br>
Oil was the main reason for military action against Iraq, a leading White House hawk has claimed, confirming the worst fears of those opposed to the US-led war.<br>
<br>
The US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz - who has already undermined Tony Blair's position over weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by describing them as a &quot;bureaucratic&quot; excuse for war - has now gone further by claiming the real motive was that Iraq is &quot;swimming&quot; in oil.<br>
<br>
The latest comments were made by Mr Wolfowitz in an address to delegates at an Asian security summit in Singapore at the weekend, and reported today by German newspapers Der Tagesspiegel and Die Welt.<br>
<br>
Asked why a nuclear power such as North Korea was being treated differently from Iraq, where hardly any weapons of mass destruction had been found, the deputy defence minister said: &quot;Let's look at it simply. The most important difference between North Korea and Iraq is that economically, we just had no choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr Wolfowitz went on to tell journalists at the conference that the US was set on a path of negotiation to help defuse tensions between North Korea and its neighbours - in contrast to the more belligerent attitude the Bush administration displayed in its dealings with Iraq.<br>
<br>
His latest comments follow his widely reported statement from an interview in Vanity Fair last month, in which he said that &quot;for reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on: weapons of mass destruction.&quot;<br>
<br>
Prior to that, his boss, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, had already undermined the British government's position by saying Saddam Hussein may have destroyed his banned weapons before the war.<br>
<br>
Mr Wolfowitz's frank assessment of the importance of oil could not come at a worse time for the US and UK governments, which are both facing fierce criticism at home and abroad over allegations that they exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein in order to justify the war.<br>
<br>
Amid growing calls from all parties for a public inquiry, the foreign affairs select committee announced last night it would investigate claims that the UK government misled the country over its evidence of Iraq's WMD.<br>
<br>
The move is a major setback for Tony Blair, who had hoped to contain any inquiry within the intelligence and security committee, which meets in secret and reports to the prime minister.<br>
<br>
In the US, the failure to find solid proof of chemical, biological and nuclear arms in Iraq has raised similar concerns over Mr Bush's justification for the war and prompted calls for congressional investigations.<br>
<br>
Mr Wolfowitz is viewed as one of the most hawkish members of the Bush administration. The 57-year old expert in international relations was a strong advocate of military action against Afghanistan and Iraq.<br>
<br>
Following the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon, Mr Wolfowitz pledged that the US would pursue terrorists and &quot;end&quot; states' harbouring or sponsoring of militants.<br>
<br>
Prior to his appointment to the Bush cabinet in February 2001, Mr Wolfowitz was dean and professor of international relations at the Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), of the Johns Hopkins University. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3406<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> Like I said - in the end it wasn't WMD that ended Saddam, it was geography.<br>

<br>
This is one answer. It's the litigation analogy. When you litigate a lawsuit, you often come up with a number of arguments. The goal is to pursuade the audience (judge, jury). Although you may have 5 really good arguments, making 5 arguments dilutes them all. The accepted strategy is to make one or at most two arguments. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it works. It's the standard approach. You pick the one that you think will be most appealing to the judge and jury. Of course, you know that the argument will be subjected to extensive cross-examination, so you pick not only an appealing one but one of your STRONGEST ones.  Also, as you are going along, if you run into problems with one of the arguments, you've got more in your pocket and you hope that you can squeeze them in (court rules disfavor 'surprise' arguments so it can take a little creativity).<br>
<br>
The Administration went with what it thought was the most appealing argument that would withstand scruitiny. The scruitiny is intense. They knew it would be.  It remains to be seen how it pans out.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This does not denigrate from the validity of the other arguments they did not advocate so strongly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Just as in my litigation analogy -- those other arguments are good arguments, it's just that you can't put out all 5 and be pursuasive. It's a bad strategy from the start, and their decision in that regard is to be expected.<br>
<br>
The fallacy I see some fall into is to conclude that the other arguments are contrived because they were not put forth during the Administrations &quot;opening argument.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 1272<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 1:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.woc.org/public/oneirodynia/images/srllogo.GIF height=180 width=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> wolfowitz is a punk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3408<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 1:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> Seems to me they better shut him up.

They would have at LEAST honestly thought that WMDs existed in Iraq in order to have considered this as an option.  You may not like Republicans, but that doesn't make them idiots.<br>

Gross Distortion at the Guardian<br>
<br>
The Wolfowitz pile on continues unabated. This time Wolfowitz is accused of now admitting the U.S. went to war because of oil.<br>
<br>
The Guardian is headlining as follows:<br>
<br>
&quot;Oil was the main reason for military action against Iraq, a leading White House hawk has claimed, confirming the worst fears of those opposed to the US-led war.<br>
<br>
The US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz - who has already undermined Tony Blair's position over weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by describing them as a &quot;bureaucratic&quot; excuse for war - has now gone further by claiming the real motive was that Iraq is &quot;swimming&quot; in oil.<br>
<br>
The latest comments were made by Mr Wolfowitz in an address to delegates at an Asian security summit in Singapore at the weekend, and reported today by German newspapers Der Tagesspiegel and Die Welt.<br>
<br>
Asked why a nuclear power such as North Korea was being treated differently from Iraq, where hardly any weapons of mass destruction had been found, the deputy defence minister said: &quot;Let's look at it simply. The most important difference between North Korea and Iraq is that economically, we just had no choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil.&quot;<br>
<br>
But this quote is inaccurate on its face as well as taken completely out of context. Wolfowitz was answering a query regarding why the U.S. thought using economic pressure would work with respect to North Korea and not with regard to Iraq:<br>
<br>
&quot;The United States hopes to end the nuclear standoff with North Korea by putting economic pressure on the impoverished nation, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Saturday. North Korea would respond to economic pressure, unlike Iraq, where military action was necessary because the country's oil money was propping up the regime, Wolfowitz told delegates at the second annual Asia Security Conference in Singapore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The country is teetering on the edge of economic collapse,&quot; Wolfowitz said. &quot;That I believe is a major point of leverage.&quot; &quot;The primary difference between North Korea and Iraq is that we had virtually no economic options in Iraq because the country floats on a sea of oil,&quot; he said. Wolfowitz did not elaborate on how Washington intends to put economic pressure on North Korea, but said other countries in the region helping it should send a message that &quot;they're not going to continue doing that if North Korea continues down the road it's on.&quot; [my emphasis]<br>
<br>
Now it might not have been smart of Wolfowitz, on the heels of the Vanity Fair interview imbroglio (however much the press distorted his comments there too) to describe Iraqi oil supplies using evocative language like &quot;the country floats on a sea of oil.&quot; But any judicious analysis of his comments begs the conclusion that he was making an explicit reference to his contention that there were no viable punitive economic options with regard to pressuring Iraq on compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions given the monies the Baathist regime could access because of its oil supplies. This is patently different than the Guardian's spin (no, lie) that Wolfowitz said the U.S. had &quot;no choice&quot; regarding going to war in Iraq because of a too-tempting-to-pass-up-neo-imperialistic-oil grab-opportunity.<br>
<br>
It is hugely irresponsible of the Guardian to run such a distorted, tabloid-style headline. Regardless, however, this story will now make the rounds of the international press (it started in Germany) and conspiracy theorists will have new fodder to peddle their noxious claims that the U.S. went to war because of oil. <br>
<br>
BTW, here is Wolfowitz's take on accusations the U.S. went to war in Iraq to control its oil supplies:<br>
<br>
Q: &quot;I'm Satoru Suzuki with TV-Asahi of Japan. Mr. Secretary, eleven weeks have passed since the coalition forces moved into Iraq. Yet you've found no weapons of mass destruction in that country -- no convincing evidence yet. Given that, are you still convinced that you'll be able to find such weapons eventually and, in the absence of such weapons, how can you still justify the war, and what would you say to those critics in Japan and the rest of the world who've been saying that the war was mainly about oil?&quot; <br>
<br>
Wolfowitz: &quot;Well, let me start with the last part. The notion that the war was ever about oil is a complete piece of nonsense. If the United States had been interested in Iraq's oil, it would have been very simple 12 years ago or any time in the last 12 years to simply do a deal with Saddam Hussein. We probably could have had any kind of preferred customer status we wanted if we'd been simply willing to drop our real concerns. Our real concerns focused on the threat posed by that country -- not only its weapons of mass destruction, but also its support for terrorism and, most importantly, the link between those two things. You said it's eleven weeks since our troops first crossed the Kuwaiti border, and coalition troops first entered Iraq, as though eleven weeks were a long time. Eleven weeks is a very short time. In fact, unfortunately, significant elements of the old regime are still out there shooting at Americans, killing Americans, threatening Iraqis. It is not yet a secure situation and I believe that probably influences to some extent the willingness of Iraqis to speak freely to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
We -- as the whole world knows -- have in fact found some significant evidence to confirm exactly what Secretary Powell said when he spoke to the United Nations about the development of mobile biological weapons production facilities that would seem to confirm fairly precisely the information we received from several defectors, one in particular who described the program in some detail. But I wouldn't suggest we've gotten to the bottom of the whole story yet. We said, when Resolution 1441 was being adopted, that the most important thing was to have free and unintimidated access to Iraqis who know where these things are. Simply going and searching door to door in a country the size of the state of California is not the way you would find things. You would find things when people start to give you information -- we're still in an early stage of that process and there is no question we will get to the bottom of what's there. <br>
<br>
But there should be no doubt whatsoever this was a war undertaken because our President and the Prime Minister of England and the other countries that joined with us believe -- and I think they believe correctly -- that this regime was a threat to our security and a threat that we could no longer live with. It is also the case that, beyond a shadow of any doubt whatsoever, this regime was a horrible abuser of its own people and that there is no question the Iraqi people are far better off with that regime gone.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1396<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/03 4:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=714.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Friedman makes sense!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But I am sure this is just ... quoted out of context<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Bingo. In fact, I have to say that this little Guardian article puts them in the same league as, say, a Newsmax. So the article is telling us that our true reason for invading Iraq was to get their oil, it states it as a fact in the opening paragraph. How many quotes from that particular event in that article? One. Did they quote the question asked, or at the very least inform us of the conversation that sparked that question? Nope. They just  'told us' that a god damned question was asked, and that that question involved Iraq and North Korea. Very Newsmaxish, perhaps even exceeding the vile pieces of fabricated garbage that often appear on the pages of that site. But anyways...<br>
<br>
I've one question, Loegan. Just how much of a moron do you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>honestly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> believe Wolfowitz to be? Just how incompetent do you think he is? These two &quot;our true motive was oil&quot; &quot;admissions&quot; of Wolfowitz' are tragic mistakes that a 19 year old White House intern that accidently walked into the wrong meeting at the wrong time would make. You wouldn't expect it out of Bush's most famous 'hawk' that's been in this game for nearly 40 years who has an IQ rivaling Schwarzkopf's. At least I wouldn't expect it. I guess you folks would. But consider the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Q: ...what would you say to those critics in Japan and the rest of the world who've been saying that the war was mainly about oil?<br>

<br>
The above is a quote <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very shortly before</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the event in the Guardian's article occured(I believe it could have been yesterday actually, not sure). Now tell me, honestly, what do you think the chances are that Wolfowitz could have gone from telling everyone that the oil accusations are &quot;nonsense&quot; to, perhaps just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hours</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> later, telling everyone that the main reason we went to Iraq was to take control of its oil? I'm really beginning to believe that people just throw their common sense out the window when they jump on a Wolfowitz quote.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to deny that Wolfowitz is an at times scary, nasty individual with big, scary impossible plans for the middle east, but I certainly do not think that he's a complete idiot who could make such huge, US credibility destroying mistakes as you apparently believe he has made.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Q:  What I meant is that essentially North Korea is being taken more seriously because it has become a nuclear power by its own admission, whether or not that’s true, and that the lesson that people will have is that in the case of Iraq it became imperative to confront Iraq militarily because it had banned weapons systems and posed a danger to the region.  In the case of North Korea, which has nuclear weapons as well as other banned weapons of mass destruction, apparently it is imperative not to confront, to persuade and to essentially maintain a regime that is just as appalling as the Iraqi regime in place, for the sake of the stability of the region.  To other countries of the world this is a very mixed message to be sending out.<br>
<br>
Wolfowitz:  The concern about implosion is not primarily at all a matter of the weapons that North Korea has, but a fear particularly by South Korea and also to some extent China of what the larger implications are for them of having 20 million people on their borders in a state of potential collapse and anarchy.  It’s is also a question of whether, if one wants to persuade the regime to change, whether you have to find -- and I think you do -- some kind of outcome that is acceptable to them.  But that outcome has to be acceptable to us, and it has to include meeting our non-proliferation goals.<br>
<br>
Look, the primarily difference -- to put it a little too simply -- between North Korea and Iraq is that we had virtually no economic options with Iraq because the country floats on a sea of oil.  In the case of North Korea, the country is teetering on the edge of economic collapse and that I believe is a major point of leverage whereas the military picture with North Korea is very different from that with Iraq.  The problems in both cases have some similarities but the solutions have got to be tailored to the circumstances which are very different.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I expected that this was a quote in reference to something else, but what I didn't expect was an outright lie. What I thought the quote would be in reference to was how Saddam could hold the world hostage through the threat to his neighbors, who between all of them supply most of the worlds oil and thus would cause global economic chaos. I figured his invasion of Kuwait was the foundation and Wolfowitz was just building a case out of that. <br>
<br>
As to thinking Wolfowitz is an idiot... no, but I think he was talking too much in the Vanity Fair article and I think the more he tries to justify the case for war and explain the thought process behind it, the deeper he is going to dig the hole. I won't hold this article against him (like I thought I would be able to) as they didn't twist what he said to their purposes, they pretty much outright lied.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I'm not going to deny that Wolfowitz is an at times scary, nasty individual with big, scary impossible plans for the middle east, but I certainly do not think that he's a complete idiot who could make such huge, US credibility destroying mistakes as you apparently believe he has made.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We agree 100% but you saw the wrong twist on my post. As I said, I have never believed the US went to war over oil as in we want the oil for ourselves. I do believe however that one of the reasons was the supposed threat to his neighbors (who said there were none btw) which are all OPEC. I could see Wolfowitz claiming that we had to take Saddam out to protect the worlds oil supply and I thought that was what this was about. I never thought he claimed we were taking Iraqs oil to help our economy... in fact I don't think I would even believe it if he did say it as I don't think it would really help us for decades considering the condition of the equipment and the way the oil market works. <br>
<br>
As I have said, in the end it was geography that got Saddam. If he had ruled some little African country and invaded his neighbor, this whole thing would have never started. It's his location amongst the richest oil reserves in the world that did him in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <!-- .. -->
