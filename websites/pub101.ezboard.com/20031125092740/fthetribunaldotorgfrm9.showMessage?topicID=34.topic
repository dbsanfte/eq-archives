<br>
I'll give my comments in a second about this game, but so far I feel utterly ripped off. I know the babbages conglomerate has a &quot;no open box&quot; return policy, but I just purchased it two days ago. Is the publisher honoring returns by any chance? Any good way to go about getting a refund without making some BS up?<br>
<br>
Now I haven't had any of the locking issues nor the double CD issue some users have claimed to have. Prior to purchasing it I knew that it was a turned based game and looked forward to enjoying the strategy of a turn based roleplaying game - that is also not my issue.<br>
<br>
My issue is with the playability of the game - the human computer interaction. I think I've been spoiled by the Infinity engine and the depth, beauty, and playability of Baldur's Gate I and II, Icewind Dale, Torment..<br>
<br>
Pool Rad's user interface is so awful its amazing to me it ever made it into production and that noone stood up and said &quot;this is horrible.. go redesign it&quot;. Additionally the fundamental programming behind the game is a joke. I'm not talking about the algorithmic implementation of the 3rd edition ruleset. Little I know of this ruleset that seems fine.<br>
<br>
But SSI totally blew it. Here's some examples. <br>
<br>
You cannot SCROLL the backdrop past a very small area of where your party is even if you have already covered an area - there is no fog of war &quot;Event horizon&quot; - no rationalization at all for why you cannot scroll across at least a somewhat larger area than you are able to. <br>
<br>
Your party members must stay in a very close proximity of one another.. even in the same room you'll often get the message a party member has &quot;Strayed too far from the party&quot;.<br>
<br>
Combat is clunky. In order to use special abilities of your characters you must constantly access right click context menus and go through a laborious list of options (though you can set hot keys for more common actions to its merit). <br>
<br>
You'll wait ages for undead NPC critters to get from their location to your party to attack and for arrows to fly across the screen and hit their target. If you ever played the original Pool of Radiance.. its amazing almost 15 years later and the combat is SLOWER than the original turn based combat with no way to &quot;skip&quot; this.<br>
<br>
You'll also be frustrated by the feeling of &quot;ok I've made my attack&quot; and you have to find the spacebar to &quot;end your turn&quot;. How about the middle mouse button SSI? It doesn't do ANYTHING in pool of radiance..why couldn't it be configured to the spacebar?<br>
<br>
Not that you can customize any of the key configurations aside from assigning hot keys - trust me I looked for that functionality after the first combat fight.<br>
<br>
This is the best though... when you get text on the screen from the game (the GM) you must actually physically left click ON THE TEXT not just on the screen.. not anywhere even though the game is in what I would call &quot;modal mode&quot; and no other interaction is allowed. Yes, you can also press the spacebar - but I haven't had to press a spacebar to clear a message from a computer.. well ever.. even DOS gave you the option of &quot;press any key&quot;.<br>
<br>
Inventory is confusing and poorly designed.   You can't view what is on your character at the same time as you are selling items to a vendor. When you pick up an item and drop it on different squares it won't automatically select the items underneath as you would expect it to. Unequipping your character is a task. You have to be able to get a grasp on the item in their hand and somehow they totally screwed up the hotspots on it. Equipping is just as bad.. for example you can't just drag onto the paperdoll. You have physically drop it on the &quot;ring spot&quot;.<br>
<br>
Character selection is similarily bad. While you have the number keys to select characters, you'll try to perform actions and about half of the time accidently select another character. Again this has to do with the abhorrent limitation on range that characters can move and the limits on scroll field.<br>
<br>
Don't expect to be able to form a party from scratch either - you can only create TWO player characters of your own design. The rest have to come from prebuilt models supplied with the game.<br>
<br>
The up down user interface widgets are far too small even for an agile mouse user such as myself. The list of playability issues goes on and on. <br>
<br>
Now some personal things about it I don't like but could live with. Again, I'm spoiled by the depth of Baldur's Gate. The music is not nearly as good as other titles available today. The story is convuluted and confusing at the beginning and hasn't gotten any more clear nor do I feel a kin to the characters nor do I yet care what happens to them. <br>
<br>
And so far it looks like more like a turn based dungeon hack then a roleplaying game. Now I've seen that there is a &quot;world map&quot; that apparently will become important but at the moment all I've seen is dungeon. I like exploring dungeons Diablo style, but I thought I was buying a roleplaying game - not Diablo. I would never have bought a game knowing it was &quot;turn based Diablo&quot;.<br>
<br>
In terms of graphics, I would say they are stunning and did live up to their potential. Its too bad that the poor interaction and &quot;playability issues&quot; so overshadow this. Its also too bad that the playability is so bad I can't &quot;scroll past&quot; an entire object such as a cliff wall to know its a cliff wall and not a ravine or a path.<br>
<br>
To its credit the game looks like it will be immense. Unfortunately, the playability issues are making me dread the immensity of it as I currently dread every combat because its so slow and clugy.<br>
<br>
I was truly looking forward to this game. If it had half of the design thought behind the original gold box games, I wouldn't be writing this. I hope gamespot has the balls to can this game. Very interested to see gamespot's final review.<br>

I belive I saw this post last night on their forums (which were creaking under the load of a lot of pissed off people).<br>
<br>
I think it's a good game, once they fix the bugs. I actually like the setup otherwise. There are problems with how things from 3e are interpreted, or implemented -- I really want to choose my own feats, etc -- but it's not that bad imho.<br>
<br>
I do have one gripe about it (other than the bugs), which is that if you enter the combat system, your characters can only move a max distance away-- not per round, period. So you can run them away from the room you got ambushed in, but only so far, then you have to sit there sniping with ranged weapons. If you move too far away from the monsters they should either chase you or combat should end.<br>
<br>
BTW: the save invisible bug ruined a good night of fun for me. Waiting for a patch so I can go back to playing. Was having a lot of fun with 0 inclination to log into EQ for a bit...<br>
