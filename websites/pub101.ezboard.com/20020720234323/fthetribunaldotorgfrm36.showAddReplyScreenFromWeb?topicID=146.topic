Purjury<br>
Rape*<br>
Murder*<br>
High Treason<br>
Espionage<br>
Theft<br>

<br>
Obstruction of justice - that is a catch all charge that can mean alot or nothing, depending on the case it relates to.<br>
<br>
Purjury - His sex life was none of the nations business, so who cares if he lied about it?<br>
<br>
Murder* - I doubt even you believe that one.<br>
<br>
High Treason - bullshit<br>
<br>
Espionage - bullshit<br>
<br>
Theft<br>
Vandalism - ?? Have no idea what you are talking about on these two.<br>
<br>
Sexual Harrasment - This one I might agree with when he was Governor.<br>
<br>
Illegal Drug Use - He smoked pot, BFD. Bush is an alcoholic which is much more of a liability. While pot is not addictive, there is a possibility that Bush could fall off the wagon during times of high stress... and what is gonna happen with a drunk president behind the wheel?<br>
<br>
As far as Dem or Rep, who cares? Reagan was one of my favorite presidents despite being a Rep. Clinton is my favorite president of my era because of the changes he made and because I honestly believe 100% that he cared about the people and did his best to effect change. He had a vision - he was the Kennedy of my generation. Was he perfect? Not any more than Reagan, but in the end he got the job done and then some.<br>

<br>
&quot;Purjury - His sex life was none of the nations business, so who cares if he lied about it?&quot;<br>
<br>
He lied UNDER OATH in the American court system.  He is THE representitive of our country around the WORLD.  His actions and antics are reflected in what the rest of the world looks at us as.  He had no respect for his family, or his country because he did it in his office in the White House.  Did he think this was a joke?<br>
<br>
Sexual harrassment is a given when you consider he was having sex with his intern.  Unless you really believe he was an innocent bystander in this girls wicked plot to get the president to sleep with her.  He flirted with her, that's sexual harrassment.  Just because she went along with it, doesn't make it any less of a crime.  Had she been uncomfortable with it, he could have been sued for it.<br>
<br>
Illegal drug use.. Okay get this straight.  Prohibition is over.  Has been for many years.  I do NOT drink, or smoke, or do anything like it, and I don't condone it.  But, my personal feelings aside, smoking weed is against the law.  Drinking is not.  I don't care what your personal feelings are on rather or not its addictive, which one is more dangerous, or your hypothetical statement of &quot;What if he goes back on the bottle?&quot;  Bottom line is, he broke the law.  Period.  And then lied to us about it.  &quot;I smoked pot, but I didn't inhale!&quot;  So it's okay for him to lie to you huh?<br>
<br>
Not to mention he burned his draft card.  What is the president again?  Oh that's right.. he's the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  The person who led our military burned his military draft card because he had absolutely no care about what happened in the world.. till he could benefit from it.  He abused his power, made horrible decisions in world affairs that we're still paying the price of, and really didn't change a thing for the better.<br>
<br>
And don't go into how he bettered the economy.  The positive effects you saw were a mix of the Reagan administration, and of course, and obviously primarily, because of the internet/computer boom.  Best thing &quot;Clinton&quot; did was with healthcare reform.  And that was Hilary.. you know.. the Yankee cap wearing fan + New Yorker from Arkansas that never lived a day of her life in this city, but got the voters basically based on that.  The same woman who was more worried about her political career on 9/11, by stating over and over &quot;I must remind you.  This was NOT an attack on New York.&quot; Or in other words, this is not my fault. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Here's two.  Feel free to add your own.<br>
<br>
One year after the start of his first term, the World Trade Center was bombed.  What did we do about it?  Not nearly enough.  So because the building didn't actually fall, which was the obvious intention, it wasn't as bad as Sept. 11th?  If I shoot someone in the head, and they live through it, its no better then if I killed him with the shot.  The punishment should be the same.<br>
<br>
Yemen:  The ship was in harbor, docked, and we were attacked.  The crew members had to stand and watch the small boat with explosives float into their huge naval war vessel because Clinton decided that when docked in hostile but non warring nations, you must have all ammo unloaded, and no weapons available to you.  That attack would have easily been prevented if not for the anti-military stances he had.<br>
<br>
He had credible information as to the whereabouts and short-term future whereabouts of Osama Bin-Laden, but wasn't willing to give the okay to raid the area he was in because of the cost of the operation, and for fear that it might upset the terrorist country harboring him.<br>
<br>
And finally, I really wish people would stop giving him credit he doesn't deserve for the status of the economy. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Just looking for some ino I already have typed up to save me from doing it again. However the quick answer is:<br>
<br>
Clinton had a great crime bill that added many officers to state and local police depts. Crime reached new lows in many metro areas.<br>
<br>
Clintons eductation bills enabled many more to go to college than were able previously.<br>
<br>
Healthcare reform you already mentioned.<br>
<br>
His foreign policy was excellent. He got as closer to a mideast peace deal than any before him.<br>
<br>
The economy which in no way can be credited to Reagans &quot;Voodoo&quot; or &quot;Trickle Down&quot; (whichever you prefer) economics.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enviromental policies which struck a fair balance between nature and profit.<br>
<br>
He had one of the most inclusive administrations ever. Many women and minorities.<br>
<br>
The list goes on and on, but I will try to find my detailed info... there is alot he did in 8 years.<br>

<br>
george bush #1 seemed to do a good job, but i busted him on a campaign promise even at my still young age, and so did everyone else.  clinton called him out on it and i was not surprised when he lost.<br>
<br>
clinton seemed to do a good job.  where bush won us a war, clinton kept us out of them.  and he did a good job of keeping everyone else out of war too.  i dont know how he would have delt with 9/11 himself, and it's useless to speculate.  undoubtably he wouldn't have stopped at cruise missile strikes on a couple camps tho.  oops, i just speculated.  anyway, his foreign policy appears to be arguable, but his handling of domestic affairs sticks out in my mind.<br>
<br>
bush seems to be playing the part that destiny granted him just fine too.  he came in off a rough election, had a lot of opposition, not that good of a rep as a political type guy.  i remember someone saying that Bush shouldn't be the hero (of 9/11) the firefighters and police, etc. are.  i dont think anyone disputes that, even Bush.  but Bush is doing a hell of a job with the situation he was given.  i feel a lot better now knowing we blew the shit out of a country and killed and captured lots of bad guys.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   i'll feel even better when we do it again.<br>

It seems these arguments get started and continue to feed off of personal biases.  i dont get that whole dem vs rep battle.  shit, they all did good and great things, and they ALL fucked up somewhere.<br>
<br>
either way, keep it up.  i learn alot more from this political bickering than i would in years of namecalling on the flameboard. <p><i>There is not to reason why, there is but to do and die.</i><p>

<br>
I believe that one of the most important and beneficial actions taken, which has affected the last decade and a half in an immense way, was the 1987 nomination of Alan Greenspan by Reagan.  Clinton did nothing for or to the economy because he did not have to - it's common sense that you don't tinker with something that's doing great already, as it had been ever since almost immediately after the 1992 election. (I think that's right, I wasn't paying much attention to these matters at the time.) Economic policy is not something that happens immediately... it takes months and more often years to see the effect of actions taken.<br>
<br>
Please show me what Clinton did that caused the 1990's boom.  Otherwise I grant him not an iota of credit, other than that he didn't screw it up.  Which is something, I guess.<br>
<br>
His foreign policy was atrocious.  From Somalia to Bosnia to the &quot;Apology to Africa&quot; tour, I shudder.  Jaeron has already gone over the terrorist issue.  The Mideast Peace deal had lovely intentions, but it's not going to happen no matter how &quot;close&quot; it might seem to come.  A waste of time even reasoning with Arafat.  But that's been discussed in another thread.<br>
<br>
Inclusive administration?  Two words... who cares?  Nominate and appoint the people who will do the best job, not someone who happens to be the right race or sex.  Even worrying about the (non)issue is bullshit, imo.<br>
<br>
My broad, sweeping analysis:  Clinton is an egotistical, avaricious man who nevertheless had good intentions for the United States.  He wanted to do good, but his warped ideology (there's my conservative bias), worthless character (lying, in office, under oath is enough to disgust me completely), and simple lack of opportunities due to general peace, prosperity, and divided government kept him from having an impact on much of anything except the front page of the tabloids.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah... I almost forgot.  His half-dismantlement of the armed forces is one huuuuge strike against him in my book.  Raise taxes while cutting the military enormously?  /boggle... priorities in ALL the wrong places.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Just read your last post, Loegan.  I'm just wondering, are a lot of these more minor laws actually Clinton's work, or that of Democratic elements in Congress?  I don't know at all, which is why I'm asking. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">
