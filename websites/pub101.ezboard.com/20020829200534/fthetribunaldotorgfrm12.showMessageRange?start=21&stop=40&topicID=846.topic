I agree drugs and alchohol and cigarettes can become addictive.  The body becomes dependant on it.  But getting addicted to a game is silly.<br>

Yes, I understand psychological addiction, but I don't see how it applies to EverQuest.<br>

To everyone applauding Cog's post, you are supporting the very unpopular operative conditioning theories of BF Skinner. The box he placed the rats in was called a Skinner box. He had some mild successes with his animal behavior research with rats and pigeons, but he then made the conclusion that his findings applied to humans as well. He was so sure of it, and his ability to control human behavior to make them happier through operative conditioning, he placed his own daughter in the Skinner box. She ended up commtting suicide. Now before you say, &quot;See, it proves the article! EQ is the debil!&quot;, understand he was theorizing that his operative conditioning would make humans happier based on his research with making rats &quot;happier&quot; in the box.<br>
<br>
Has VI got us in some kind of Skinner box with EQ? Only if you believe Cogs. Or you have a mental problem that affects your behavior to make you act similiar to a rat. But believe it or not, EQ is very easy to just turn off for 99.9% of the world population. You do it when you go to work or go to bed right? It's only freaks like Rynnia that forget to eat because they have to get one more pellet.<br>
<br>
Huge difference between a rat in a Skinner box who will die without his operative conditioning and a human playing EQ for entertainment. Or I guess we could go watch our TVs. Anyone want to argue that TV is a Skinner box? If you do then you think all life revolves around stimulous-response operative conditioning. Art, music, science, curiosity all have no meaning? BF Skinner killed his own daughter with his theories. I think that shows how little he understood the human phyche. Quoting his research and jumping to included EQ is reckless at best. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

Don't assume you know my reasoning. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Actually the object as the observer is a common position to take when attempting to disprove the psychobabble touted by people like kaku.  This position is a bit silly to me as is the whole debate.  <br>
<br>
Does a tree make a sound when it falls if no one is around to hear it??  Of course it fucking does.  You can use the same position that *some* living thing is there to observe it to disprove it but then you are met with the &quot;prove something heard it&quot; so you can counter with the object in question (falling tree) being the actual observer.  And on and on and on it goes.  When everyone fucking knows that it made a damn sound, who cares if you can prove it or not, it happened.<br>
<br>
It's much simpler to explain by stating that Heisenberg uncertainly does not scale to the macro <br>
world.  Objective physical reality does exist, it isn't a <br>
consensual construct of human experiance. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>

&quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures were because of stints on the computer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.&quot;<br>

Eq was not the legal cause (proximate cause) of Shawn's death.<br>

I *do* believe that warning label cases have a place in society. My uncle handled a pretty important one many years ago.  His client was injured by flying metal bits after striking a &quot;hardened&quot; chisel with a &quot;hardened&quot; hammer.  There was no warning label on either item.  The court held that the manufacturers were negligent in failing to warn the consumer not to strike a hardened item with another hardened item.  Go to Home Depot and you'll see that warning (and a zillion others, some downright silly) on hammers, etc.  The theory goes that without such litigation, manufacturers would have no incentive to warn. <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~joshnya1/wsb/media/7948/site1033.gif"><BR>

While I will adamantly state that they are looking to add more timesinks now because 3+ years is a rediculous amount of time for this game to exist, when it started they didn't say &quot;Well let's make it hard to level so that people will become addicted.&quot;  That would be like saying ALL RPG's function that way, going back to MUD's and MUSH's etc.., and even paper and pen RPG's some of which you never paid for at all.  They didn't want to addict you, they just made a logical progression.  Level 1-10 should be incredibly easy so that your character can build up to a point with ease where it is fun to play, and you've established an existance for that character.  Now from there on out, you SHOULD have to work for the levels.  Name me one game that you can stay at the starting point and make level 50?  Can you walk outside the castle in Dragon Warrior and kill slimes till level 50?  Nope.  Not without wasting 200 years of your life gaining 1 exp per blue slime, and 2 exp for each red slime you encounter.  That would make for a pretty boring game when you consider max level was 65000 exp or so.  Oh yeah.. it would be a timesink though!  In order for your character in any game to make it to the &quot;cool&quot; stuff the designers have for you, you have to earn your way there.  Otherwise, I could go out, buy a game, and beat it at level 1.  I'd miss out on all of the content the designer poured his/her heart and mind into.  Game design is set up that way, as it should be.  Games should be rich in content, that only those willing to invest the time to get there should experience.  Now like I said.. Verant knows they have to milk this to keep Everquest alive, so they are making rediculous time sinks now.  (Ssra and Seru anyone?)  But with that said, they didn't start out to &quot;addict&quot; you.  Video games are addictive in any form.

Not knowing the source/substance that made him feel different could radically change what he experiences. People given stimulants, but not told what they were, have experienced anxiety in an uncomfortable way.<br>
<br>
Those given stimulants knowing what they were, showed the exact same physical effects, but experienced the &quot;high&quot; in a pleasent way, since they now had a preconceived notion of what it was supposed to feel like.<br>

So, more than likely if he was given crack without knowing it, he would perceive the effect as anxiety rather than the pleasent high.<br>

Elche, I agree with your statement, but how do we know your article is truth? Only Skinner's daughter knows for sure. I've heard tons of evidence that she is still alive and happy and that his daughter's Skinner box was just an eviromentaly controlled crib. Although there was a Nova documentary that suggests his baby box was not what it appeared. But those &quot;truths&quot; don't support my argument so I don't include them. My college psychology professor told me she committed suicide, and he is the smartest person alive. /nod <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

I have searched the web and everything i have read says that she didn't commit suicide, either there is a cover-up or its an urban legend. <br>
<br>
The best answer to the tree falling is like arleanna says &quot;we can never really be sure&quot; _however_, every single time that we cut down a tree and something or someone is there to record the event, the tree has made the sound. therefore we have no realy cause to think that if a tree falls and nothing is there to obseerve it, that it will not make a sound. the sound exists independently of the observer. <br>
<br>
does something exist it is not observed? Is existence predicated upon observation? If something is not observed does it cease to exist? do things spring in and out of existence depending upon their state of being observed?<br>
<br>
yeah but arleanna you included &quot;truths&quot; that were indeed falsehoods. Unless of course the state of skinner's daughter is entirely dependent upon whether or not she is being observed. If she is not observed, then perhaps I can postulate that she did indeed commit suicide, since she no longer exists. <p><font size="-2" face="verdana">Elche Proudfoot<BR>

<br>
I don't think this is true.  Even the word and definition of &quot;sound&quot; exists because we have had the ability to observe and measure it.<br>
<br>
If humans had no ears and no other way to observe sound would &quot;sound&quot; exist?  Maybe sound waves would, but would sound?  Would noises exist?  Would the word &quot;sound&quot; and everything associated with that word exist?<br>
<br>
I don't think it would. <p><div align="center"><image src="http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/eqsig.jpg"></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Send me a tell in game!</span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/02 2:03:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~jakecj7/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: total BS</span><hr size=1> Geez, Wolvar, all I'm saying is you don't know just as much as I don't know it. But you spout off that something is a certainty without any proof. I say it's just unprovable given the conditions.<br>
<br>
Who told you the solution to these paradoxes anyway? God? You have blind faith in your &quot;common sense&quot;.<br>
<br>
Common sense a thousand years ago dictated that the world can't be round because we would slip off of it. Duh. In my universe I don't care about the world being round or flat because it doesn't affect my daily life. Just like a billiards player doesn't care about relativity and places all his faith in Newton's flawed phsyical laws. But to a scientist smashing atoms together Newton was a misinformed mathmatician who made conclusions based on things he couldn't possibly observe.<br>
<br>
Just stop posting that you know the solution to a currently unsolvable paradox and I'll stop ragging on you.<br>
<br>
If Wolvar makes a post that no one reads is he still wrong? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

If something is unproveable, it cannot be a fact.  My position is that you don't have to prove something to reasonably conclude it to be fact, at least at the macro level.   I posted geek speak supporting my conclusion, to go along with the common sense that you keep harping on.  <br>
<br>
The paradox is not unsolveable in MANY peoples' opinions.  You need to broaden your circles I think and you'll find other people who will tell you the same thing.<br>
<br>
Sound does not require an observer to exist, altho that is also an unproven paradox.  If you listen to arleanna, she will probably tell you that the sound observes itself, and that is a common answer to that particular paradox.  Although THAT is also unproveable, hence the age-old debates on these types of subjects. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>
