<br>
Nice to know there are people here that are more expert in the Humane treatment of animals than the Humane society.  If this dog was truly suffering they have in the past shown no hesitance to put them down, sometimes I think they do it too eagerly.<br>
<br>
Wish I could post a pic of Tripod, that dog is proof of the nobility of spirit.  Try to feel bad about your day when a 3 legged dog comes bounding up, tail wagging, glad to see you.  Your troubles mean squat.  I love dat dog.<br>
<br>
What would you do to a starved three legged dog with horrible heartworm?  This guy probably had nothing but grief but now he is happy, dats worth every penny.<br>

wouldn't you agree?<br>

I'd consider that self-righteous and belittling the empathy people are showing the dog.<br>
<br>
You have every right to argue all you want, and I have every right to ignore you or tell you to go to hell.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You also have the right to keep your mouth closed and let people do what they want.

<br>
I disagree with people all the time... and when it's a difference of opinion, sometimes it's just not worth arguing.  Is there really a point to arguing about whether or not this dog should be put down?  The dog won't be put down, is recovering and being treated.  Arguing that the dog should have instead been killed is academic at best and is also rude to the person who posted it to bring the situation to light. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usolovey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/11/02 7:15:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1879.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If you own a lead pipe...</span><hr size=1> If the person did not want it argued he should not have voiced an opinion.

Well kids, we did it.<br>
<br>
I had a phone conversation with Jamey from the Humane Society yesterday evening, and I'm pleased to report they are completely inundated with donations, which is a good thing.<br>
<br>
Just from people donating via this website, we've managed to raise $10,300 in just over 24 hours...even now we're closing in on $13,000. In three words, WE KICK ASS.<br>
<br>
Comfortable that Daisy's medical expenses will be covered, Jamey reports that it's okay for people to hold off on further donations for her at this time! He also reports that any donated money left over after Daisy's bills are all settled, will be used to fund their Cruelty Investigation Unit, and hopefully keep other Daisy's from happening.<br>
<br>
I would suggest however, for any of you who still feel the &quot;need for speed&quot; and have to scratch their their donation-itch, you donate whatever you had earmarked for Daisy, instead to your town's local Humane Society. Remember they all are funded completely off donations.<br>
<br>
As of yesterday, the docs were starting to remove the bandages around Daisy's legs, and were very pleasantly suprised to see new tender pink tissue already growing. Thanks to a aid of a pain patch that is sewn into her skin every 72 hours, she isn't feeling much of the agony she would otherwise feel from her burns. And while she's certainly not up and chasing balls, she is moving aroud without too much discomfort. An additional positive sign is she is beginning to open her eyes when she's moving around and walking around objects (as opposed to bumping into them when she first arrived) which is a good indication to her improving eyesight.<br>
<br>
In short, things are certainly looking up for our poor barbecued dog.<br>
<br>
The vets say, with the exception of some ugly scars, they expect this poor pooch to make a full and complete recovery. And since she has so many people willing to help out, she won't be marching down that long road alone. What she needed desperately needed to survive when this whole ordeal began was money, care, and time. We all certainly took care of the money, the staff at the veterinary hospital are providing the care, and well, time is time.<br>
<br>
Reports of Daisy's progress will be frustratingly slow going from here on out. As much as I'd like to, I won't be able to say that by this time tomorrow she'll be up and dancing, unfortunately. Nay, instead Daisy's progress will be something to the effect of, &quot;Daisy walked around for 10 minutes today before getting all tired out and having to be carried back to her kennel, where as three days ago she could only walk for 8.&quot;<br>
<br>
And so with promised weekly updates from Jamey at HSNT, I'll be updating this page with the same frequency. Suffice to say for now, we all can be very pleased not only with ourselves but with Daisy's recovery. Thank you all.<br>
<br>
Oh, and one more thing... if anyone in the Dallas/Ft Worth area can find out when Robert Aretz Lindsay's court dates are, I'd be more than happy to post them here so we can arrange a &quot;burn fucker burn!&quot; cheering section during his trial.&quot;<br>
<br>
--ernie, www.ernieshouseofwhoopass.com<br>
<br>
This dog was lucky, if you could see fit to recognize that word at all in this fucking thing, that she was just a pup.  Her healing powers are 10x what they would've been a year or so later.  My dog was a pup when she got away one day and ran into the street and hit by a car -- she broke her pelvis and hip and recovered completely, just like Daisy will.  <br>
<br>
I still hold in my heart the faintest hope that someone will take a tire iron to that guy's head.  By the way, if animal attackists have a proclivity towards violence and will eventually bore and move on to human subjects, I suggest labeling them publicly like sex offenders.  'Herein lies an animal offender, you are so forewarned.'  Maybe then under the watchful eye of scrutiny they wouldn't be able to progress and will instead self-destruct.  At any rate, I'm glad Daisy got the response she did, and hopefully she will recover in full.<br>

Because the patch hurts like a motherfucker? Heh.<br>
<br>
It's definitely a sad story, I'm glad the dog is apparently going to be alright in time.<br>
<br>
While someone can easily argue that a human life is more important than the life of a dog or any animal, I am of the belief that it could just as easily be a five year old any time someone goes around intentionally lighting animals on fire or mercilessly torturing them.<br>

As much as I detest what that guy did to Daisy, it amazes me that people will focus on animal abuse faster than child abuse. <p><center>

<br>
People around the world are in intesive care for burns....Many of them can not pay for better care....10,000 dollers could make a diffrence in saving thier life. Yet now this dog is living breathing and has pain patches while some poor son of a bitch lies in a hospital bed and waits to die because no one will pay for him to go to a hospital that might be able to save his life.<br>
<br>
And yes I am glad the dogs alive.....Sometimes though things just work out very wierd. <br>
<br>
BTW I love animals...My family grooms/kennels them I have always  had dogs in my life and I have always raised them from pups. So no I am not some animal hater I am just explaining where ash is coming from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uganguskan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ganguskan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/14/02 6:35:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1879.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If you own a lead pipe...</span><hr size=1> hmmm.......I live near Ft Worth Texas....not sure about a lead pipe tho....<br>
