<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I can remember the night of July 20th 1969 sitting in front of my television in the early hours of the morning watching a grainy black and white image of Neil Armstrong climbing carefully down the ladder of the Lunar lander and stepping out onto the surface of the Moon, the first man to have done so. It was a magical, awe inspiring moment that I shall never forget. The space age had finally arrived. &quot;That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind&quot;. It certainly was.<br>
<br>
It seems incomprehensible to me, but there are now some people that are questioning if that event ever actually took place. They are basing this on what they perceive as some discrepancies in a handful of lunar photographs from among the hundreds that were taken by the Apollo astronauts, and for various other assorted reasons. They believe that the Moon landings were mocked up in a film studio and that the Apollo crews never left Earth orbit.<br>
<br>
All these claims are based on errors and a lack of understanding.<br>
<br>
Let's start at the beginning with the first claim, that they never left Earth orbit, before going onto the various photographs etc.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Apollo crews never left Earth orbit.<br>
<br>
This is an extremely odd claim in itself, that they never left Earth orbit, because if that had being the case, how do you explain the rather obvious fact that not one person noticed that the Apollo craft were still continuously orbiting the Earth when they should have been orbiting the Moon? They would have been very easily visible to the naked eye, just as satellites are today every hour of the night, and back then in the '60's satellites were a relatively rare sight as compared to today's crowded skies. The Apollo craft were, by many magnitudes, the brightest and largest artificial objects orbiting the Earth, and would have been impossible to miss, even if you were just out walking the dog. Some people even actually saw the Trans-Lunar Injection burn for Apollo 8, from low-Earth orbit to trans-lunar trajectory in the dark sky over Hawaii; and how could anyone fake all that? (See The Van Allen Belts and Travel to the Moon ). If you somehow manage to convince yourself (how?) that no one happened to notice that the Apollo craft stayed in Earth orbit, which would have exposed the 'hoax' there and then, do you honestly think that the entire Russian (and every other country)) national radar system didn't notice that they had failed to leave Earth orbit? No one would have been more over the Moon (sorry) to expose any American Moon hoax than the Russians, but it would have been quite literally impossible to fool the entire world that the crews had left Earth orbit if they hadn't, as any one could have seen it for themselves. This argument alone should provide sufficient evidence to show that the Apollo crews did actually leave Earth orbit, but this will not be enough for the Moon hoax believers, they love a good conspiracy theory.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
However, the only mystery about the Moon landings is why these people believe it was a hoax, but I really shouldn't be so surprised, some people even believe the Earth is flat. I can only assume though it is because they saw the TV program &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?&quot; It was shown In the States in February 2001 and later here in the UK. The program points out 'errors' in the photographs, that there are no stars visible, that the flag waves in the 'breeze', and a host of other detail.<br>
<br>
However, the manner in which the so called 'facts' were presented by the programme to support the hoax theory were so biased, unscientific and totally inaccurate, as to be laughable, and believing them makes as much sense as reading a comic to gain information on D.I.Y. brain surgery. This was just a run -of- the -mill sensationalist TV entertainment programme, the sort of programme that refuses to let the truth get in the way of a good story. Unfortunately though, some people will believe anything that involves a wacky conspiracy theory.<br>
<br>
For a full scientific explanation of every so called error claimed by the program, visit the following excellent site. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html">Bad Astronomy: Bad TV</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. <br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Photographic evidence.<br>
<br>
Let's just take a look at three photographs that demonstrate how these errors arise. I cannot include them all, otherwise this page would take a week to load, but these three silly claims come up time after time.<br>
<br>
1) NASA forgot to paint the stars in the sky.<br>
<br>
This is a classic, my all time favourite. It is very popular with the hoax believers, but I can't understand why though, it's so easy to prove for yourself. I think it tells us something very important about the way they think.<br>
<br>
Look mum! No stars, NASA forgot to paint them in!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Buzz%20Aldrin"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface, 1969<br>
<br>
The real reason is that when contrasted with the brightness of the astronauts and the lunar surface, the stars are just too dim to register on the photographic emulsion of the camera film. If the camera shutter were held open long enough for the stars to register, everything else would be over-exposed into a white featureless glare. You cannot have both visible on the one photograph, so the camera was set for the correct exposure for Buzz Aldrin and the lunar surface, not the stars. When standing on the lunar surface the astronauts could visually observe the stars in the dark sky, just as we can here on Earth. By the same token, if we take a photograph outdoors at night of a brightly illuminated object, our photograph also would not show any stars in the sky.<br>
<br>
If it is so easy for hoax believers to spot this 'glaring error' - and let's face it, to forget to put the stars in would have been an incredibly stupid mistake to make - do you honestly believe that not one single person involved in the 'hoax' wouldn't have noticed it either? Or is it just that hoax believers are all just so much smarter then all of them?<br>
<br>
Anyway, no need to take my word for it is there, I could be part of the conspiracy according to your way of thinking. (Wish I was, I would be getting paid for this.) Just pop outside one night and try to photograph the stars with a brightly illuminated person in the foreground. Try it, its easy enough to prove without the need of a massive conspiracy theory, just you and a camera is all that is required.<br>
<br>
Case closed.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
2) The Great Flag Waving in the Breeze hoax.<br>
<br>
I just love this one, very nearly as much as the 'no stars ' one. Below is one of the pictures in question.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Moon%20Flag"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin deploy a U.S. flag on the Moon in 1969<br>
<br>
The flag is held out in the unfurled position by an extendable rod running through the top of the flag, so that it can be viewed unfurled, and you can see the unnatural rigidity this gives to the top of the flag in the picture. The rod creates the effect of a breeze blowing the flag into that position. Without the supporting rod the flag would just hang limply down and would not reveal the stars and stripes. Flags are designed to be blown into position by the wind on Earth, so the support was added to replicate this, as there is no atmosphere on the Moon. The rod is not extended the full width of the flag and it looks like a breeze is causing a ripple in the flag.<br>
<br>
It has also been claimed that some video clips show the flag waving in the breeze when it was planted. Not so. The movement of the flag is because when astronauts were planting the flagpole they rotated it back and forth to better penetrate the lunar soil. Without an atmosphere it takes a while for this movement to damp down.<br>
<br>
Do you really think that an errant breeze blowing through the set causing the flag to wave in what was supposed to be a total vacuum would not have been noticed? Such an obvious fact could not escape the notice of an entire film crew, besides which they would surely have called upon the services of experts to oversee operations to guard against this very sort of 'error'. They would simply have done another take.<br>
<br>
Case closed.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
3) The cross hairs have been added after and go behind some objects<br>
<br>
I must admit to being rather fond of this one as well, as it is such a totally pointless 'hoax' that I fail to understand why anyone can believe it was actually done.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Cross%20Hairs"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Cross hairs shown 'behind' objects.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The explanation: Extract from Moon Hoax Under the section 'Photography and Film'.<br>
<br>
&quot;The cross hairs on this photograph appear to go behind the objects in the photograph.  Does this suggest that the photograph is a faked 'pasted-together' image? (The cross hairs are included as an aid to judging scale.)<br>
<br>
The cross hairs on the photographs were produced by a glass plate within the camera, between the lens and film. They result in a black cross on the film because they block the light from reaching the film directly below them.  If, however, you are taking a photograph of a really bright white object, the over-exposed part of the film 'bleeds' into other parts of the film. This is particularly the case if the adjacent part of the film is black. This is exactly what is happening where the cross hair meets a bright, reflective part of the photograph. It occurs in a number of the Apollo photographs, but you only see it where the cross hairs seem to disappear behind a bright white part. You never see it happening anywhere else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why do you think NASA would want to add the cross hairs after? If they had somehow changed cameras and forgot to insert the etched glass plate that produces the cross hairs, they would have just ditched the photographs, not gone to the trouble of faking them in afterwards. It would be a hell of a lot easier just to do a re-take if the photographs were considered to be important enough. The photograph shown here can hardly be considered to be in that category, its about as mundane as they come, so why fake it?<br>
<br>
Case closed.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
'Wrong' shadows. <br>
<br>
This is a general category and covers many photographs based on the shadows being 'wrong'.<br>
<br>
This is a good one as well. It shows how easy it is to make wrong assumptions when looking at a 'problem' with tunnel vision instead of trying to understand what is really going on from a scientific point of view. This I feel is a concept that must be alien to Moon hoax believers.<br>
<br>
Lots of the hoax claims rest on the belief that the shadows shown in the photographs are somehow wrong, that they indicate more than one light source because the object shown is illuminated from the front and the sides, and so on. This leads them to believe it is due to lighting mistakes on a film set.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is that there IS more than one light source. The light does not come directly from the Sun and illuminate only the one object in question, as a narrow beam spotlight would in a dark room. It shines on the entire 'daytime' surface, just as it does here on Earth. Therefore it also illuminates the surface, the astronauts themselves, rocks, mountains, the Lander and all the other objects on the surface. The reflections from these various objects is why there is more than one light source, it is not because there was more than one spotlight used on a film set. It is also worth noting that on the lunar surface the reflected sunlight from the Earth is 68% brighter than that of the full Moon as seen from Earth.<br>
<br>
You must visit this site, its very good. Are Apollo Moon Photos fake?<br>
<br>
It shows some of the photos in question with alongside little models of the scene appropriately illuminated. It is an ingenious and foolproof way of silencing the critics. Do check it out, its great, and worth a visit just to see the little models. Here is a sample from the site.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Moon%20shadows20shadows/"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The model on the left replicates a photo that hoax believers show how NASA got it wrong. They claim the astronaut standing in the shadow of the lander should not be illuminated, but should also be in shadow. The model on the right shows that it is the reflected light from the surface that is illuminating the astronaut, by placing a dark sheet of paper over the surface to reduce the reflection. There is nothing wrong with the photo, its just showing it how it is, the astronaut being lit by surface reflection, which is a lot brighter than the surface of the Earth. It is not because they used too many spotlights in a film set.<br>
<br>
Case closed.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So there you have it, the most commonly believed hoaxes shown not to be.<br>
<br>
Personally I find the most surprising thing about the whole business is that hoax believers think that NASA, armed with a budget of billions of dollars and the best experts in the world, could make so many incredibly stupid errors that even the most novice, untrained, inexperienced amateur can spot them easily.<br>
<br>
I think that basically, this is what this is all about. Hoax believers consider themselves to be very smart and all the experts at NASA incredibly stupid. This is the same hoax believers that didn't even think to try to photograph the stars themselves, because they just know its a hoax, no need to test it, they saw it on the internet. Oh yes, very smart.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Please note, the Moon is not the Earth!<br>
<br>
All the other 'fake' photographs are explained just as easily with a little knowledge, and an understanding of how conditions on the Moon are very different to those here. With no atmosphere to scatter the light, things look a little odd on the Moon, we have a very black sky and a very bright surface. We see strong shadows everywhere, and our sense of distance is also fooled because there is no atmosphere to produce the familiar atmospheric haze that creates a distance perspective on Earth. Furthermore, with the gravity being only a sixth of Earth's gravity, things move and behave differently as well. It's hard to make straight comparisons, because we cannot, the Moon is just not like the Earth. We have to think differently when interpreting the images from the Moon, and that's what causes the problems, people are not allowing for those differences when looking at the lunar photographs. They are looking at them as if they were taken under normal Earth conditions, and concluding wrongly that there must be something wrong with the photographs. There isn't!<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Scientific Errors<br>
<br>
It isn't just the photographs that have misled the hoax believers either, it's also a lack of scientific knowledge. It's difficult to select a favourite hoax that makes the most ridiculous claim, because there are so many to choose from, but personally I think this has to be number one, its a beaut! I just love it to pieces.<br>
<br>
The Moon rocks are just Earth rocks.<br>
<br>
Here's the explanation of why they can't be Earth rocks. Extract taken from The Great Moon Hoax<br>
<br>
&quot;Moon rocks are absolutely unique,&quot; says Dr. David McKay, Chief Scientist for Planetary Science and Exploration at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC). McKay is a member of the group that oversees the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at JSC where most of the Moon rocks are stored. &quot;They differ from Earth rocks in many respects,&quot; he added. Just as meteoroids constantly bombard the Moon so do cosmic rays, and they leave their fingerprints on Moon rocks, too. &quot;There are isotopes in Moon rocks, isotopes we don't normally find on Earth, that were created by nuclear reactions with the highest-energy cosmic rays,&quot; says McKay. Earth is spared from such radiation by our protective atmosphere and magnetosphere.<br>
<br>
Even if scientists wanted to make something like a Moon rock by, say, bombarding an Earth rock with high energy atomic nuclei, they couldn't. Earth's most powerful particle accelerators can't energize particles to match the most potent cosmic rays, which are themselves accelerated in supernova blastwaves and in the violent cores of galaxies. Indeed, says McKay, faking a Moon rock well enough to hoodwink an international army of scientists might be more difficult than the Manhattan Project. &quot;It would be easier to just go to the Moon and get one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have here in my office a 10-foot high stack of scientific books full of papers about the Apollo Moon rocks,&quot; added McKay. &quot;Researchers in thousands of labs have examined Apollo Moon samples -- not a single paper challenges their origin! And these aren't all NASA employees, either. We've loaned samples to scientists in dozens of countries [who have no reason to cooperate in any hoax].&quot;<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Another popular hoax theory, this time sounding more plausible than usual because it is difficult to verify without a very good understanding of the nature of particles and their effect on the human body.<br>
<br>
Astronauts could not survive passage through the Van Allen radiation belt.<br>
<br>
As this is a very complex subject I have wisely decided against attempting to summarise it here. You can either take my word for it that all the astronauts travelled through it with no apparent ill effects, or go to this site and study the full technical and scientific explanation yourself. The Van Allen Belts and Travel to the Moon It explains in great detail why the hoax believers have got it all wrong (as usual) and shows scientifically calculated radiation dosage levels that the crews would have been exposed to. If you happen to be smart enough you can check the figures yourself. The site explains that it is possible that some of the astronauts may possibly develop cancer because of this exposure, but so far the group have not developed cancer at any significant level different to that of any other group of normal Earth-bound people. They certainly managed to survive the round trip to the Moon in good health. The Moon hoax believers however, believe that in order to survive, the astronauts would have required lead shielding ranging from 4 to 6 feet thick depending on which hoax site you happen to prefer.<br>
<br>
As this is a hard one to prove or disprove because of the mathematics and knowledge of particle physics involved, most of us are at the mercy of others. So do your own research if you are unhappy about this issue, but just be careful to ensure that the source is acknowledged as a creditable. Select your sources carefully! For example, having to decide which view is correct here, would it be from someone who makes a living selling second hand cars, or an acknowledged expert in the field of astro-physics? Who's opinion would you logically accept? We do accept things on trust, we do it all the time. Do you not accept the fact that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth? Why do you accept it?<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Why doesn't the Hubble Space Telescope provide proof?<br>
<br>
This argument runs along the lines that as the HST can provide images of galaxies millions of light years away, why can't it provide images of a lander on the Moon, which is on our door step?<br>
<br>
Bit of a funny question really, anyone with normal eyesight can see the Andromeda Spiral Galaxy easily with the naked eye, and that's over 2 million light years away! As an amateur astronomer of some 30 years standing I have always understood why the HST could not provide images of the lunar landers on the surface of the Moon, but to get the correct figures I checked out the HST site at Hubble Space Telescope Its all down to the size of Hubble's main mirror, which is 2.4 metres. One of the factors of the worth of a telescope is its resolution, the smallest amount of detail it can see, and this depends on the size and quality of the mirror. Hubble's resolution is an amazing 0.05 arc seconds. This is how I calculate the minimum size object that HST can image on the Moon, in as simple a way as I could devise.<br>
<br>
Visual maximum diameter of full Moon = 31'40&quot; = 1900 arc seconds (a fraction over 1/2 a degree)<br>
<br>
HST resolution = 0.05 arc seconds<br>
<br>
Therefore HST can resolve an object on the Moon of (1900 divided by 0.05 ) = 1/38,000th of the Moon's diameter<br>
<br>
Actual diameter of Moon = 3476 km<br>
<br>
Therefore resolvable object size = 3476 km divided by 38,000 = 91 metres<br>
<br>
As the landers can only be around 10 metres across at the very most, it is not possible for the HST to resolve them, they just wouldn't show up on any image of the area under examination. I emailed the HST site to make sure I had got my sums right, explaining why I needed it for this site, and their reply was as follows: <br>
<br>
&quot;You are correct. Hubble's resolution is good and can resolve objects and areas as small as 280 feet, (86 meters) which rules out the Apollo debris on the moon. Hope this helps!&quot; <br>
<br>
Yes it does! Thanks to the HST Office of Public Outreach.<br>

<br>
Anyway, what would be the point even if the HST were able to image the landers? The good old Moon hoax believers would only claim the images were faked.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Enough of scientific errors, I cannot answer them all here, it would take a book, but a little research will always reveal that the hoaxers have got it wrong every time.<br>
<br>
If you wish to check out further sites that debunk the Moon hoax theory, this one is very good on facts, with clear easy to follow explanations, with a host of photographs, and offers a good choice of further sites.The Moon landings were not faked<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I think that's enough for now. It's all down to a poor understanding of physics, photography and science, sounding just plausible enough to convince others who also have only a limited knowledge in these subjects. Ask any photographer about photographing the stars, they will understand at once why they do not appear in the dark sky. Look back through any old photographs you have taken outdoors at night, you will not see a single star in any of them. It would only take a few seconds for you pop outdoors one night and prove it for yourself.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
What do I think?<br>
<br>
The Apollo missions landed 12 men on the Moon, no doubt about it. The so called 'fake' photographs are not fakes, it's just some people's mistaken interpretation of them that is the problem, the photographs themselves contain no problems. The Apollo crews did leave Earth orbit and did survive the Van Allen radiation belt. If you think you still have any problems remaining, then a visit to the sites I have put in links to should dispel them.<br>
<br>
As a matter of interest, if you believe otherwise, how do you explain the Moon rock samples held in laboratories throughout the world? As explained above, they REALLY ARE Moon rocks, and cannot possibly be Earth rocks that have been faked.<br>
<br>
You could, I suppose, argue that every laboratory, university, research centre, geological institution, professional scientist, etc, throughout the world that has examined the Moon rocks, are so incredibly stupid that they have failed to spot that they are really only faked up Earth rocks? (This is ignoring the fact that they cannot be faked anyway). Or perhaps you prefer the good old standby that it is all part of a world wide conspiracy. (No, you're not paranoid, they really are all conspiring against you).<br>
<br>
Or perhaps instead you think that a probe was sent to the Moon to bring back the Moon rocks? Well yes, that is possible, sort of, but not on this scale. Three robotic Soviet Lunar probes returned a total of about 3/4 lb. (301 grams) from three lunar sites in the 1970's. However, the Apollo crews from 1969 to 1972 collected a total 840 lbs, (382 kgs.) of rock and other surface material. One rock alone weighed 25 lbs. (11.7 kgs.) In comparison to the Apollo total of 840 lbs. the Soviet total of 3/4 lbs. is miniscule. Probes simply could not have returned that much material, (especially a single rock weighing 25 lbs.) and if they could have, it would have been the Soviets that achieved it as they were always way ahead in the field of robotic probes.<br>
<br>
Below: (Left) Nick-named &quot;Big Muley,&quot; this 11.7 kg (over 25 lbs.) Moon rock was the largest returned to Earth by Apollo astronauts. One side of Big Muley was peppered with meteoroid &quot;zap pits.&quot;<br>
<br>
Below: (Right) A close-up view of 1 mm diameter zap pits shows tiny craters lined with black glass surrounded by a white halo of shocked rock. (Remember, this cannot be faked!)<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Do you really think that all those people spread across the globe and tuning into the broadcasts from the Moon, both professional and amateur alike, were unable to tell the difference in the signal from one based in Earth orbit to one 240,000 miles away? The transmissions could not be 'altered' to give that effect. I have received emails suggesting that this was if fact what happened, that the signals were 'faked' to make it appear that they came from the Moon. However, this could not be accomplished even today, let alone back in 1969.<br>
<br>
Do you think Apollo 13 was just for fun, why fake that? You think every single one of the thousands of photographs was faked? All the video was faked? Think just how many people would have to be involved in the cover-up, and they all kept quiet? Really!<br>
<br>
Whatever arguments are presented claiming the Moon landings never happened, the fact is they did.<br>
<br>
I have even been emailed to have it pointed out to me that as the 'Apollo 13' film was made in Hollywood, so could the Moon landings have been made in the Nevada Desert. This theory also clearly demonstrates that the 'Titanic' may not really have sunk either! Just how bad can some people's reasoning get? How on Earth do you begin to reply to this type of nonsense? I sometimes just despair at some people's mentality.<br>
<br>
However, in reply to the person who emailed me to ask why I am so sure that the Earth is not flat, the answer is very simple. If it were flat then I'm sure that you would have been the first to fall off.<br>
<br>
If anyone still believes it was a hoax after visiting the above web sites, please email me with your reasons why. If it makes sense I will not only publish it, I will publish a full retraction and admit to being not only wrong, but also stupid. I do NOT expect this to happen, but please feel free to try.

UPDATE: 13th May 2002. <br>
<br>
Apollo 15 Landing Site Spotted in Images<br>
<br>
Article taken from Space.com<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON ­ Put aside those absurd claims the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax. Two scientists pouring over photos taken by a lunar orbiting spacecraft have eyed evidence of a touchdown. New research led by Misha Kreslavsky, a space scientist in the department of geological sciences at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, has found anomalies in the Moon's surface in the vicinity of the Apollo 15 landing site.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Landing%20site%20image"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Arrows B &amp; C show recent impact sites. Arrow A shows a dark patch at the exact point<br>
<br>
Apollo 15 landed<br>
<br>
Apollo 15's lunar module, the Falcon, touched down at the Hadley-Apennine region near the Apennine Mountains on July 30, 1971. Falcon was the first of the piloted landers to carry enlarged fuel tanks, as well as tote along a Moon rover. Moonwalkers David Scott and James Irwin scuffed up the lunar surface during their over three-day stay. Using an electric-powered car, the twosome wheeled their way back and forth over the crater-dotted terrain for a total of 17 miles (27.4 kilometers).<br>
<br>
Kreslavsky, along with research colleague Yuri Shkuratov of the Kharkov Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine, made use of images taken by the U.S. Defense Department's high-tech Clementine lunar orbiter. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's faster, better, cheaper Clementine probe circled the Moon in 1994, making use of a camera that snapped well over a million images in the ultraviolet to visible range. A set of Clementine images in the vicinity of the Apollo 15 landing site were intensively studied by Kreslavsky and Shkuratov. Their work was dedicated to help discern fresh impacts on the Moon, or to search for sites of recent seismic activity in the lunar crust.<br>
<br>
The work and the techniques utilized not only proved useful in studying the lunar surface, but also yielded a bonus find. A small dark spot found in the Clementine images is not associated with any fresh crater, but exactly coincides with the Apollo 15 landing site, Kreslavsky told SPACE.com.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a result of my processing 52 images taken by the Clementine spacecraft through a red filter, while the spacecraft went over the scene from the southern horizon through zenith to the northern horizon,&quot; Kreslavsky said. A diffuse dark spot can be seen exactly at the landing site, he said.<br>
<br>
Using Clementine photos taken of the Apollo 15 touchdown zone, several anomalies can be seen. &quot;All of them but one are related to small, fresh impact craters. The only one not related to any crater, exactly coincides with the landing site,&quot; Kreslavsky said.<br>
<br>
The disruption in the structure of the lunar regolith is caused by the landing, Kreslavsky said. He contends that the alteration has been created by the lunar module's engine during touchdown.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It is not possible to convince hoax believers!<br>
<br>
I do not think for one minute that the above picture of the landing site of Apollo 15 will go one jot towards convincing hoax believers, they will claim the picture is a fake (which it isn't) and that it does not reveal enough detail to be convincing (which is true). But what WOULD it take to convince them? Photo, TV and video evidence no, Moon rocks no, testimony from the Moon walkers themselves, no, reams of documented papers no, Scientists from around the world no. etc. etc. What would?<br>
<br>
Suppose that a prominent hoax believer was taken, at enormous costs to NASA, to the Moon and showed the old landers, would that do it? No, of course not, all the others would claim that he or she was bought off by NASA or was even working for them all along!<br>
<br>
There is no way possible to convince these people, it just can't be done. Ask them what they would accept as evidence, and the answer, short of going to the Moon themselves, which as I have explained would be pointless as far as the rest of them are concerned, is nothing! If the Japanese go to the Moon and show images of the Apollo landers would that do it? No, they would claim the images are fake.<br>
<br>
I can't help but wonder how these people manage to be so selective in choosing what they are prepared to accept when confronted with such a mass of evidence. How on Earth do they manage to accept other events that they have not personally witnessed?<br>
<br>
Do they accept that JFK was shot dead? Why? Were they there at the time?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Hiroshima"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Do they accept that the Titanic sank? Why? Were they there at the time?<br>
<br>
Do they accept that Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb? Why? Were they there at the time?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hiroshima after the atomic bomb.<br>
<br>
Do they accept that men walked on the Moon? No. Why not? Every argument they have put forward for not believing has been proven wrong.<br>
<br>
If they can accept that Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb, and accept countless other historical events, based on eye witness accounts, photographs and documents, why not accept that men walked on the Moon? The sources of evidence are the same!<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
One way you could prove it for yourself.<br>
<br>
All you need is a laser, a light collecting mirror, and a detector. The Apollo astronauts left a reflecting prism on the Moon that acts like a mirror. Simply aim the laser beam at the prism and it will be reflected back to you, collected by the mirror, and recorded by the detector. Only a mirror could reflect the beam back, a naturally smooth and polished rock (how?) that just happens to be at the precise shape and angle could not do the job. The prism is often used by scientists to reflect back laser beams and provide a precise measurement of the distance to the Moon. Only a man could have placed that mirror at the exact angle and position required.<br>
