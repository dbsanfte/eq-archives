How to Ruin American Enterprise<br>
Friday December 13, 12:02 pm ET <br>
By Benjamin J. Stein <br>
<br>
<br>
We're well on our way to squelching what gives this country an edge. What would it take to kill innovation altogether? <br>
As a casual observer of what makes this country work and what stops it cold, I hereby offer a few suggestions on how we can ruin American competitiveness and innovation in the course of this century. I think the reader will agree with me that we are already far down the road on many of them: <br>
<br>
 1) Allow schools to fall into useless decay. Do not teach civics or history except to describe America as a hopelessly fascistic, reactionary pit. Do not expect students to know the basics of mathematics, chemistry and physics. Working closely with the teachers' unions, make sure that you dumb down standards so that children who make the most minimal effort still get by with flying colors. Destroy the knowledge base on which all of mankind's scientific progress has been built by guaranteeing that such learning is confined to only a few, and spread ignorance and complacency among the many. Watch America lose its scientific and competitive edge to other nations that make a comprehensive knowledge base a rule of the society. <br>
<br>
 2) Encourage the making of laws and rules by trial lawyers and sympathetic judges, especially through class actions. Bypass the legislative mechanisms that involve elected representatives and a president. This will stop--or at least greatly slow down--innovation, as corporations and individuals hesitate to explore new ideas for fear of getting punished (or regulated to death) by litigation for any misstep, no matter how slight, in the creation of new products and services. Make sure that lawsuits against drugmakers are especially encouraged so that the companies are afraid to develop new lifesaving drugs, lest they be sued for sums that will bankrupt them. Make trial lawyers and judges, not scientists, responsible for the flow of new products and services. <br>
<br>
 3) Create a culture that blames the other guy for everything and discourages any form of individual self-restraint or self-control. Promote litigation to punish tobacco companies on the theory that they compel innocent people to smoke. Make it second nature for someone who is overweight to blame the restaurant that served him fries. Encourage a legal process that can kill a drug company for any mistakes in self-medication. Make it a general rule that anyone with more money than a plaintiff is responsible for anything harmful that a plaintiff does. Promulgate the pitiful joke that Americans are hereby exempt from any responsibility for their own actions--so long as there are deep pockets around to be rifled. <br>
<br>
 4) Sneer at hard work and thrift. Encourage the belief that all true wealth comes from skillful manipulation and cunning, or from sudden, brilliant and lucky strokes that leave the plodding, ordinary worker and saver in the dust. Make sure that society's idols are men and women who got rich from being sexy in public or through gambling or playing tricks, not from hard work or patience. Make the citizenry permanently envious and bewildered about where real success comes from. <br>
<br>
 5) Hold the managers of corporations to extremely lax standards of conduct and allow them to get off with a slap on the wrist when they betray the trust of shareholders. This will discourage thrift and investment and ensure that Americans will have far less capital to work with than other societies, while simultaneously developing that contempt for law and social standards that is the hallmark of failing nations. Hold the management of labor unions to no ethical standards. <br>
<br>
 6) While you're at it, discourage respect for law in every possible way. This will dissolve the glue that holds the nation together, and dissuade any long-term thinking. Societies in which the law can be clearly seen to apply to some and not to others are doomed to decay, in terms of innovation and everything else. <br>
<br>
 7) Encourage a mass culture that spits on intelligence and study and instead elevates drug use, coolness through sex and violence, and contempt for school. As children learn to be stupid instead of smart, the national intelligence base needed for innovation will simply vanish into MTV-land. <br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Mock and belittle the family. Provide financial incentives to people willing to live an isolated existence, vulnerable and frightened. This guarantees that men and women of sufficient character to bring about innovation will be psychologically stifled from an early age. <br>
<br>
 9) Develop a suicidal immigration policy that keeps out educated, hardworking men and women from friendly nations and, instead, takes in vast numbers of angry, uneducated immigrants from nations that hate us. This, too, leads to the shrinking of our knowledge base and the eventual disappearance of social cohesion. <br>
<br>
 10) Enact a tax system that encourages class antagonism and punishes saving, while rewarding indebtedness, frivolity and consumption. Tax the fruits of labor many times: <br>
<br>
First tax it as income. Then tax it as real or personal property. Then tax it as capital gains. Then tax it again, at a staggeringly high level, at death. This way, Americans are taught that only fools save, and that it is entirely proper for us to have the lowest savings rate in the developed world. This will deprive us of much-needed capital for new investment, for innovation and our own personal aspirations. It will compel us to ask foreigners for ever more capital and allow them to own more of America. It will also promote an attitude of carelessness about the future and, once again, encourage disrespect for law. <br>
<br>
 11) Have a socialized medical system that scrimps on badly needed drugs and procedures, resorts to only the cheapest practices and discourages drug companies from developing new drugs by not paying them enough to cover their costs of experimentation, trial and error. <br>
<br>
 12) Elevate mysticism, tribalism, shamanism and fundamentalism--and be sure to exclude educated, hardworking men and women--to an equal status with technology in the public mind. Make sure that, in order to pay proper (and politically correct) respect to all different ethnic groups in America, you act as if science were on an equal footing with voodoo and history with ethnic fable. <br>
<br>
My list need not end here. But I stopped at a dozen because I realized that this is already, in large measure, the program of so many of our elected representatives. The debauchery of our tort system is already in place, and the rest of the agenda is under way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ladmovonwallace>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 2230<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/15/02 7:03:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ben Stein's &quot;How to Ruin America&quot; Essay</span><hr size=1> ben is wise <p>retired poo slinger</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 1804<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/15/02 8:18:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> The number one threat to this country is the stupid citizenry that refuses to take responsibilities for their own actions and the frivolous lawsuits that come with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/15/02 12:06:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> First tax it as income.

My fucking god this is so true. You dont really know how fucked up our tax system is until you Either A: work for the IRS. Or B. Try to give away/Inherit a large sum of money.<br>
<br>
People who save get screwed. 28%-50% Income tax, Then an Intrest/Capital gains tax, Then if you do decide to give it away to family, A 30% Inhertence/gift tax. <br>
<br>
This letter hits the nails on alot of heads, Ben is wise. <br>

<br>
Family values, tax cuts, less power to judges and more to the president, pinko teachers are ruining our kids, racially-based immigration, defending the poor little tobacco companies, and OH THE POOR DRUG COMPANIES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY!<br>
<br>
Fuck that, I work in medical journalism and it's the NUMBER ONE MONEYSPINNER in the media. Why? Because beside our news stories, they can advertise drugs to doctors. Before this, I worked in the technology media and I thought we had some wealthy advertisers ... oh boy, you ain't seen nothing till you've seen the filthy rich companies that produce medicines. If anyone EVER tells you that drug companies don't have enough money to research new drugs, laugh in their face. It's a lie. Their research decisions are based on what they think they can sell, which is not necessarily what the public needs.<br>
<br>
Ben Stein is a stunt. <p>--<br>

<br>
The plan is that if you constantly point out the same problems and blame them on the things you want changed as a conservative, it gets into the public consciousness as &quot;this is how things are&quot;. President Bush thrives on this.<br>
<br>
Here are the simplified points he makes:<br>
<br>
1) Pinko commie teachers are to blame for everything that is wrong with America's education system. Everything would be fine if we had an old-fashioned conservative school system. Ask yourself: Is that really the problem? Is that really the solution?<br>
<br>
2) The separation of powers makes life difficult for big corporations. Ask yourself: Isn't that the way it's supposed to be? The separation of powers is part of the US Constitution, to stop politics and money from influencing the law.<br>
<br>
3) ... to be continued<br>
<br>
<br>

Actually groz, What he is saying is the FDA should take off thier stifling off the drug companies. The U.S. spends an enourmous amount of money on drug research, Yet most of the discoveries happen abroad because the U.S. Drug laws are so stringent.<br>
<br>
If the laws were a bit more lax, And  everyone who took 50 of a pill they were only supposed to take one of could not sew, Then mabye we would have so more usefull treatments out now for cancer/AIDS ect ect.<br>

And low and behold Guess who is getting sewd for serving the now &quot;Evil&quot; french fries of death.  French fries cause hardening of the arteries like cigarets, And MCdonalds makes just as much as the tobaco industry....Wanna sue them too?

Or How about Coca cola, The sugar in that is atrocius, Soft drinks may very well be the Poison of Society. One reason why many americans are so fat is because of the influx of Cola drinks, And their outrageous sugar. I guess we should sue them too right? Obeisity is a national disease, And causes many complications like Diabetes ect ect. Lets sue them too.....Lets sue everything thats bad for you!<br>

<br>
1)  Pinko commie teachers are bad, but hardly pervasive in our secondary school system.  The problem is a culture of &quot;leave no child behind&quot;, which sounds great, but is rather silly in its implementation.  Don't get me wrong - everyone needs an education, and it is the state's duty to see to it that they have one.  Education is the best investment a democratic state can make.  However, when universal standards are imposed, and then consistently lowered in order to accomodate those who cannot or will not perform, the system becomes geared to the lowest denominator and loses a great deal of efficacy.  A better solution, imo, is the European model with different classes of schools depending on the abilities and desires of the student.  Of course, this demands a more consistently effective school system overall, with no room for poorly performing ghetto schools.  This problem, however, has nothing to do with the amount of funding provided, but rather the attitudes and upbringing of teachers and students.<br>
<br>
2)  The separation of powers has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;stopping money and politics from influencing the law&quot;.  In truth, I'm not really sure what you're talking about there, although I am afraid it has something to do with the recent &quot;campaign finance reform&quot; craze.  If so, then I would beg you to read the First Amendment, and reflect on the fact that the most basic and important of all rights to free speech is regarding politics.  If the government says you cannot talk about painting, that is bad, but at least you can talk about how bad the government is for censoring painting discussions.  If the government starts to censor political discussion, on the other hand... it doesn't take an ACLU activist to figure out where that line of reasoning takes you.  If, you are talking about corruption, there are many factors which deal with that, ranging from ethics committees and penalties to a political culture which won't stand for greased palms among officials.<br>
<br>
Pray tell, why are drug corporations so evil for having a lot of money and spending it on researching drugs that people will buy?  Let's think about this for a minute... most profit would be gained by developing a drug that lots and lots of people will need... so the incentive is to spend money where it most benefits the most people.  That sure makes sense to me.<br>
<br>
Then we have, for example, the case of Canada.  Price controls on drugs limit the amount one can charge to a tiny amount over the cost of production... wow, Grandma can now buy her pills more cheaply than before!  That's great!  What?  It's 10 years down the road and that illness Grandma contracted can't be cured?  Why not!?  Damn those drug companies and all their filthy... er... wait... they don't have enough incentive for research any more... no new drugs.<br>
<br>
Solovey... we regulate our drug industry, but not NEARLY as much as almost every other industrialized nation does.  You're wrong about medical discoveries - the vast majority of new drugs come from the U.S., and its for a reason.  People like Grozzer who claim that the drug companies are bastions of evil are astonishingly naive.  I guess we should just nationalize the drug industry, huh?  Spend fifty million to develop a drug to cure a disease affecting 1 out of 1 million people while 1 out of 1 hundred are afflicted with something else...<br>
<br>
Admittedly, the system is not perfect.  It is sad when that 1 out of 1 million person dies due to their rare illness.  To claim, however, that this is unacceptable and requires huge restructuring and regulation belies an underlying obsession with abstract social justice which defies reason. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

From reading both articles, I draw the conclusion that Krugman stepped into Stein's territory, made some sweeping, biased, sometimes stupid observations and got smaked.<br>

You ever heard of developing countries being sued for breaking patent laws to mass produce generic drugs like AZT ? Drugs are developped for -rich- people who can pay for them the most. Not necessarily for those who -need- them the most. Pharm. Corps are probably the most competitive and ruthless companies out there, incidentally also responsible for some serious environmental damage. That would be fair enough, but them posing as philantropist organisations through the lavishing of the biggest PR budgets is where the hypocrisy strikes. Even their &quot;aid&quot; is most often a double edged sword, as it turns out to be &quot;dumping&quot; of perempted stock that is not only tax deductable, but usually creates expensive disposal problems for the recipient.<br>

The republican system of government exists to strike a balance between outright democracy and rule of the majority, and tyranny of any minority which might attempt to take control of government.  The checks and balances are further safeguards against any one body to gather too much power for itself.  None of this has anything to do with money and politics (what is that supposed to mean anyway?  politics is the struggle for power in government by definition, of course it will have everything to do with lawmaking).<br>

Although President Bush's budget proposal for fiscal year 2003 calls for a &quot;major increase&quot; in spending to prevent bioterrorism, funding will remain &quot;flat&quot; for a number of health programs, including HIV prevention projects and the Ryan White CARE Act, the New York Times reports (Stolberg, New York Times, 2/5). <br>

<br>
Planned economies quite a few steps from putting some regulation and funding into medical spending.  Because, as pointed out earlier, the best economic interest of medical conglomerates does not necessarily match the best interest of the population at large. It is becoming more profitable to sell very expensive drugs to a few privileged customers than it is to sell cheap ones to masses. HIV cocktails and the patent laws abuses are one example where profit of the manufacturer goes against the best interest of the population. <br>
<br>
You could also look at the effect of health care privatisation and the results of public health HMOs. Despite popular belief, US health care sucks majorly for the average citizen compared to the ready and very cheap access most Europeans still enjoy (might not last too long though). But you can bask in the glow that being non-socialist, competition makes it more &quot;efficient&quot;, because god knows it never gets monopolised, defrauded or abused... <br>
<br>
&gt;and tyranny of any minority which might attempt to take control of government.<br>
<br>
The problems arise when money is power and power is money. There is currently a tiny minority of extremely wealthy citizens who controls so much economical power that it defies imagination. When those citizens start lobbying and funding electoral campaigns to the tune of millions of $, what do you think they are promoting ? The betterment of society or their own self interest of getting wealthier ? Wouldn't that qualify as tyranny of a minority ?<br>
<br>
&gt;The checks and balances are further safeguards against any one body to gather too much power for itself.<br>
<br>
Define checks and balances and compare with the current state of domestic policies and how bills get introduced.<br>

Vaccine Scandal: White House Ordered Last Minute Rider:  Rep. Dan Burton (R-In.) on CSPAN tonight calling for a thorough investigation into vaccines. Says his grandson had nine shots in one day, and developed autism three days later. A caller asked why he voted for the Homeland Security Act when it had an amendment calling for the widespread vaccination of Americans, and a legal &quot;get out of liability free&quot; card for the big pharmaceutical companies who produce the controversial vaccines. His response, &quot;I didn't know it was in there.&quot; Burton says Dick Armey told him the White House ordered him to slip the vaccine rider in there at the last minute.<br>
<br>
Democracy at work.<br>
<br>
Later in the program. a classic exchange:<br>
<br>
Caller: &quot;I can't believe you just admitted to voting on a bill you didn't read.&quot;<br>
<br>
Burton: &quot;We thought after it had gone through committee ... there wasn't going to be anything bad in there. I was confident there wasn't. This amendment was thrown in at the last minute. I am guilty of not knowing about it. I don't think anyone else in the House knew about it either. I wrote most of the bill, and I was confident there wasn't anything else in there. My committee was the committee of jurisdiction. They should have contacted my committee, but they went around me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another caller: &quot;It's a sad commentary that we pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars and you don't know what you're voting on . . . &quot;<br>
<br>
Burton: &quot;As I said, we wrote most of the bill. We were the committee of jurisdiction. We were supposed to be informed of any changes. But we were not informed. They didn't contact us. They went around us. I do stand guilty. Had I known about it I would have fought.&quot;<br>

The reason for this isn't that they aren't getting the funding, it's that they'd rather take the safe, money making route than risk the money.  It's all about the money.<br>
<br>
It isn't that Drug companies are fearful of being sued for new drugs, it's that they would rather make the money they know they can make.<br>
<br>
Break-Through drugs are a rare thing these days.<br>
<br>
PS: Viagra was discovered more on accident than it was researched.  I [b]believe[/b] it was some heart medicine that they were looking into.  The idea was to open up the veins to allow blood to flow more freely.  One of the side effects they were finding among men were erections after taking the medicine.<br>
<br>
I may not have the facts completely correct, but I know I'm in the ballpark.<br>
