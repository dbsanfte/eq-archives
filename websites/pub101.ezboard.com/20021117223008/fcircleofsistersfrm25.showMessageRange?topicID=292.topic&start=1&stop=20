The blood still freely running down this artistic piece of death denotes that this message had just been arrived.. but already the flies had arrived to fiest upon the dead flesh of this one. His cuts, red, searing as if they were cut open by pain itself had residues of Salt minerals about them. These cuts were all over his Indigo flesh, the expression upon his face, that of shock. This one did not expect to lose.<br>
<br>
What story does this body have to tell. A grand fight he was, bringing the Murderer to the very brink of his lifeforce. He held back the finishing move and was able to barley slay him, but slay this warrior he did. After the death was assured, he tore at the body. First the spine had to be removed, and replaced with the Velium Spear that holds the body upright. Then, a staff was sewn into his arms to hold them up, as if he was on a Cross. The Blood stained weapons held the body in place, the Note was cleanly pierced into his flesh.<br>
<br>
Its a Painful way to die, this one was lucky however. He got to die before the artistic value was added to the corspe.<br>

Upon closer inspection, you notice something. A tattered piece of clothing within the hand of the body.<br>

Even from inside the building, she could hear people yelling outside and it seemed that quite a crowd had gathered.<br>
<br>
Opening the door, two things came in.  First, Krystarn, running up the steps to come into the hall.  Second, a terrible smell, rancid and sickly; the smell of death.  She could even smell it over the normal ripe aroma of Freeport.  A few fat bluebottles buzzed around her face and she brushed them away with her hand, her nose wrinkling in distaste as the smell filled the air.<br>
<br>
"What in tae name of tae Tribunal's happened out here, lass ?" she asked Krystarn, opening the doors fulling to let her in, but watching warily in case anyone else - such as the Freeport militia - might choose this moment to come in and ask pointed questions as to why a crucified Teir'dal had been left as a gory present on the steps.<br>
<br>
Squinting out from the cool shade of the guildhall into the harsh light of the street, she could see a crowd clustered around a body, blue-skinned (a Teir'dal ?).  Pushing down the street was a patrol of militiamen, a burly captain shoving his way through the curious people.  One of the crowd was brandishing a bit of paper (from the body ?) and fingers were being pointed at the guildhouse, and her, in the doorway.  <br>
<br>
She suddenly felt rather vunerable.  She caught a few of the words that people in the crowd were saying, "Hunted" was being mentioned alot in connection with gestures towards the guildhouse.  Ushering Krystarn in, she closed the door behind her.<br>
<br>
"I think we ought tae get one of tae elders.  Tae militia are going tae be asking questions."  She sighed.  "What maniac could have left that...thing... and their threats outside our home ?"<br>

Something pervaded the air among the usually stench of Freeport. It was a scent that may not be noticed by most people, and maybe not even most Rangers...but to Solufein who was part Teir'dal, he recognized that smell.<br>
<br>
A rotting Teir'dal body.<br>
<br>
With haste he followed the scent to the Sisters Guildhouse and was greeted by the grisly sight. He did not know what to make of it at first. Then he noticed the injuries to the body. The cuts were very precise, and while many Teir'dal were great warriors, few showed enough dedication to the art of the blade to be this exact.<br>
<br>
Once in his youth he had come across a lone Teir'dal slaughtering the elves of Felwithe, they eventually pushed him back and out of the city, but he had seen the artist at work, he remembered the bodies.<br>
<br>
Shintou...<br>
<br>
He walked past the crucifed body and into the hall. There stood a very distressed Krystarn. It had been quite sometime since he had seen her and he wanted to spend time with her, yet this was obviously a bad time for repaste. <br>
<br>
He walked up to her quietly and wrapped his arms around her stomach, kissing her ear and smiling slightly as she grasped his hands with hers.<br>
<br>

I shall ignore you. Why? Because you are a worthless piece of garbage. My sights are set higher than the mortal realm, higher than your vain attempts to understand the true heart of evil.

I am not offering my assistance, he can kill you, slaughter you repeatedly, smack your little red head all over Freeport, I won't bat an eye. Why? Because I don't care whether you live or die.

&quot;He is a little man trying to be big and tough, and I have bigger schemes and plots underway to care about your petty little hatred of me, or his over-inflated ego.&quot;<br>

I havent gotten any good Roleplaying like that in a very long time, espically the open mindedness to acually play a storyline like this. While it seems hard for some People like Vivienne to understand that this is Fake and False, acually, I got most of these Ideas out of a Midevil Book I read a while back.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm not really a Hurtful person, like some people apparently believe and naturally fear. <br>
Shintou is just a Character I play in a game which it is. A Game. People'll never understand that so it will never truely be any fun.<br>
<br>
Well, no fun for me that is. Maybe the other people that enjoyed this thread and this storyline.<br>
<br>
Quite Frankly, I have better things to do to deal with PoVivienne's sudden Moral shunning of my Storylines, when she herself gets involved in probably the most Sexually strenous storylines on this server.<br>
<br>
Take it how you like to. Anyhow, I'm finished dealing with Half ass roleplayers. Thanks again for playing, and you all did make that one day fun. If you want, I can do a story involving you all killing him, I don't think I'd mind that too much.<br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>

OOC:  Vivienne, I've never liked your style of roleplay.  Ive even asked you oocly to back off but you obviously dont have a clue.  (And i only did so because you were affecting other brothers and sisters)  So, i will give you hell ICly no matter where you go.  Maybe i should envade your board as well?<br>
<br>
Shin, I've ALWAYS loved your stories!  As far as im concerned, you are always welcome to wreck havac in our halls.  *giggles*  You dont take it too far like some people and what is a good side without evil?   NOTHING!  =)  Let me know if you want to start any stories...  Im more than willing to help.  <br>
