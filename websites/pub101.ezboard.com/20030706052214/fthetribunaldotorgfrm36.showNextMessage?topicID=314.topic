None of the above.  Idiot is his label.<br>
<br>
I could defend the argument that he's a traitor, but it's easier to defend the position that he's an idiot.<br>

The only idiots are those who swallow everything the media and government spoon feeds them and then slams on people who go to find out what the fuck is up for themselves.<br>
<br>
Sean Penn did nothing... NOTHING wrong. All he did was go on a tour of Iraq and see for himself the country we'll be attacking if Bush has his way. He made no political or policy comments whatsoever while there.<br>
<br>
So just what is it that he did wrong?<br>

These people's egos are boggling, Penn's especially if you look at his past. His high profile is a weapon that's gonna be used against us. And it was, of course, when Iraq throwed out some wacky interpretations of what he said(which of course made its way onto FAIR AND BALANCED Fox News Channel and they screwed things up quite a bit). Oh well.<br>
<br>
He's far from an idiot though. He's got the money, he's got the interest, he's got the friggin stones to go visit Iraq. He put a $50,000 commentary in either the NY Times or the Washington Post I believe a couple months ago expressing his thoughts on the situation and his intention to go on over there. Funny the press didn't make much of it til he was in the country and Iraq's own version of what he said leaked out.<br>
<br>
He's not some moron going to Iraq to see for himself if he can find any WMD. He's not going over there and saying &quot;I love you guys! You know that country I come from, the USA? It's evil and I hate it, just like your government!.&quot; <br>
<br>
He did not say anything at all, really, besides stuff like this:<br>

Hardly the words of a traitor or an idiot. I largely disagree with pretty much everything he's been saying for the last few years, but I respect him for actually doing something like this.

Gore is the elected president, Bush is the selected president.<br>
<br>
Face it, Bush got in because of confusing ballots, inaccurate voting lists and a Supreme Court who made a bad call. Everyone knows he lucked out on 9/11, because if not for that tragedy people would be focusing on the economy (which after 2 years is still in the shitter). Instead, Bush has used patriotism as a political safety net.<br>
<br>
I don't blame Alec Baldwin for being so pissed. I was pissed then and I am still pissed now. Bush lost all my respect when his desire to win caused him to disenfranchise thousands of voters.<br>
<br>
Call Baldwin an idiot if you wish, but that doesn't change the fact Gore got the most votes... and that's not even counting all the ballots Bush trashed. <p><br>

I'm not really worried about it... he didn't actually endorse Sadaam a la Jane Fonda, merely visit, hear propoganda, and leave still chanting his anti-war mantra.  /shrug<br>
<br>
Loegan... you really need to get some facts straight.<br>
<br>
First of all, you need to come to grips with the electoral system we use.  If you think the electoral college is unfair or bad, fine, rail against it, try to change it... but don't try to pretend that when the rare Bush style result rolls in, that it's somehow invalid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Face it, Bush got in because of confusing ballots, inaccurate voting lists and a Supreme Court who made a bad call.&quot;<br>
<br>
File this under &quot;Great Liberal Myths of Recent American History&quot;, because that's all it is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone knows he lucked out on 9/11, because if not for that tragedy people would be focusing on the economy (which after 2 years is still in the shitter). Instead, Bush has used patriotism as a political safety net.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah... right.  You expect the economy to turn around all of a sudden in two years, when Bush's stimulus package hasn't even gotten beyond the very first step?  Even Efnita would probably be able to tell you that economies do not react that quickly... naturally, that doesn't change the fact that many Americans would blame Bush regardless, because they don't understand such simple concepts, but your position that Bush would be so unpopular and in bad shape if not for 9/11 has no basis in reality.  His approval ratings were good, if not great a la 9/11, the whole time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't blame Alec Baldwin for being so pissed. I was pissed then and I am still pissed now. Bush lost all my respect when his desire to win caused him to disenfranchise thousands of voters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where did Bush disenfranchise thousands of voters?  Show me.  Where did you get the idea that Bush managed somehow to trash people's ballots?  /boggle...  Even with all the controversy surrounding the ballots (oh so confusing, for a retarded orangutan maybe), faulty machines, inaccurate lists, or what have you, I completely fail to see how any of that could be blamed on Bush.<br>
<br>
If you want to talk about someone whose desire to win caused him to attempt to disenfranchise voters, take a look at Gore and absentee ballots. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

Have any of you morons wondered why every American president since the Iraqi Baath party came to power 30 years ago has either won or been nominated for a nobel PEACE prize, yet the leaders of nations who's &quot;blood&quot; is on American hands are usually up on war crimes charges? I guess presidents just have a good PR company working for them. I tell you that nobel commitee sure is easily duped by our war mongering American presidents. It's obvious that they could care less about world stability. Americans only give away hundreds of billions of our tax dollars in foreign medical, economic, and humanitarian aid so other countries don't realize that we are only there to steal their oil. It was a pretty good scheme, but Sean Penn saw right through it.<br>
<br>
The only blood on my hands is all the blood gushing from Sean Penn's bleeding heart. Go cry on Saddam's shoulder. I hear he s just a poor dictator trying to make it in a cruel uncaring American run world. Poor guy. Can't we just leave him alone so he can get back to gasing his own people!?<br>

Wrong. Florida used a two year old voting list and they were told the year before the election that 25% of it was inaccurate and Geb had them use it anyway. Why? Because those 25% who were desinfranchised from this list were minorities who more than likely would have voted for Gore.<br>

How is it that the agressor country (U.S.) can get away with attacking another country and claim that their hands have no blood on them?  Americans are the aggressors, not the Iraqis.  The fact that Iraq has bent over to comply with unreasonable demands for the past decade that no other sovereign state should stand for, and the fact that time and time it has given in to America's excessive demands and suffered 11 years of sanctions is enough proof that America has been bullying Iraq for the past 11 years and now that Saddam's usefulness has expired it is ready to drive the fatal stake through that country, install a pro-American government and declare it as a victory against terrorism.<br>

Thanks to pointing out to us - &quot;morons&quot; - that U.S. presidents surely must be peace loving individuals if all of them in the past 30 years have been nominated or won a Nobel Prize.<br>
<br>
Hold on lets examine, this closer.  That would be from 1972-2002, during which U.S. had a whopping 7 presidents.  Holy shit, 7 whole guys!<br>
<br>
Richard M. Nixon (1969-74)<br>
Gerald R. Ford (1974-77)<br>
Jimmy Carter (1977-81)<br>
Ronald W. Reagan (1981-89)<br>
George Bush (1989-93)<br>
William J. Clinton (1993-2001)<br>
George W. Bush (2001-present<br>
<br>
And Nixon is one of them, wow!  How many of them actually won a Nobel peace prize?  Only one, Carter, and that was in 2002.  Who else won?  Yassir Arafat in 1994!!  Wow, he sure must be a peace loving man!!  Or not.<br>

<br>
what do you try to imply with this even Efnita thing?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have to admit I dont know what Bush stimulus package is exactly about but I heard it was mainly a huge tax cut, mainly affecting middle &amp; higher income groups. Increasing trade trough more trade pacts and introducing incentives that should lead to more investments by businesses. This doesnt sound like an package that will jumpstart the economy to me.<br>
Negotating trade agreements is a lenghty business. Increases in investments normaly lag behind increases in spending (consumer &amp; government). Tax cuts to low income groups tend to lead to much more consumer spending then equal cuts to higher income groups. Higher income groups are more likely to save and spend on imports/abroad. Increasing government spending by buying a bunch of militairy hardware is a good way to increase government spending but better for the economy would be to spend that money on education, infrastructure etc.. Fiscal responible plans that focus on immediate consumer/government spending are a way of jumpstarting the turnaround of the economy. Bush plan more sounds like a long term strategy to me. Increased geopolitical risks because of the *war* threat, tariffs and NTB`s and interfering with China`s currency policy dont help in improving the economy either.   <br>

Yes it is. Remember that when Dubya came to power, the USA was looking to him to protect against a recession sparked by the end of the tech boom.<br>
<br>
He immediately began raising international tension by making speeches about the rising danger of China, followed by the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; speech. Significant increases in military spending were announced.<br>
<br>
I believe the philosophy was that the Cold War days were economically good for America -- it created stuff for industry to do (particularly conservative financial backers in the arms and drug industries). As a conservative, he wanted a return to those days. Manufacturing international tension was his solution for the domestic economy.<br>
<br>
Then Sept 11 happened. Dubya simply ramped up what he was already doing and refocused it on Al Qaeda and terrorism, which hadn't even been mentioned before.<br>
<br>
Post-Taliban, there is now a determined effort to maintain the tension and fear, to continue the same economic plan. That's why I don't participate in these Iraq-oil discussions -- it's not about oil, it's about the US economy. <p>--<br>

The tension has always been there, mostly because American economy has always relied heavily on industries such as steel, oil, etc. as the backbone of the economy.  That is why maintaining tension during Cold War and spending exorbitant amounts of money on defense, claiming that America needed to contain communism - stimulated the economy during the difficult times.<br>
<br>
While that is still true to an extent, the technology boom in the 90's began delivering wealth in other sectors of the industry like computers, internet, e-commerce, etc.<br>
<br>
When the tech bubble burst, it was back to basics for the country.  Which means saber rattling to justify spending exorbitant amounts on defense again when there is really no need for it while the tech sector is trying to recover.<br>
<br>

I see Bush grasping to the terrorism platform for dear life because he realizes that he would go down as the worst president this country ever had if it wasn't for 9/11, and his never ending chest beating.<br>

The War on Terrorism is a joke.  The closest it got to actually delivering a blow against terrorists was when their camps were destroyed in Afghanistan.

Where to start? You were not attacked by a country, you were attacked by a stateless terrorist group that had attacked you before. All the tension that Bush manufactured was with countries such as China, which had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. You sound like you think everything &quot;international&quot; is a big conglomerate that works together with one mind.<br>

Yep sorry Dumai I got my speeches confused, the Axis of Evil was a post-9/11 speech.
