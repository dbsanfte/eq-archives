And I ask for advice cos I’m not quite pathetic enough to tie my ego to my leet skills. Not so with Javelyn, I remember now… Truly, it was a case of Mr. Know-it-absofuckinglutely-all, which was really impressive – until it ended with a train that looked like one of the bug invasion scenes from Starship Troopers. <br>
<br>
I think I only went to Hate one with Javelyn once after that, cos I wanted to attend as many Fear raids as Hate raids, cos I worried I might look like a loot greedy bish – a worry that Javelyn was not too concerned with, seeing that he lived in Hate from the moment he joined the guild, and only left once he’d filled his load of Enchanter loot. I think I’ve spent about ten minutes total, of all my playtime, in discussions over loot – and nine of them were with Javelyn. One time, this non-Companion enchanter joined a Hate raid, which had Javelyn crying like a child, cos he was so afraid she might get some enchanter loot. I figured it was just cos the player was very young and immature, and there’s nothing to be done about that, I mean good manners is a social skill you gotta learn. So I generally stayed away from the guy, which meant staying away from Hate – which was cool cos those enormously long raids didn’t appeal to me anyways. <br>
<br>
One thing I was wrong about though: Javelyn didn’t come across like an infantile, lowlife, selfish prick because he was a child. He came across like that, because he actually is an infantile, lowlife, selfish prick. <br>

<br>
You could, of course, be quicker to react on a keyboard than others, and that would translate to a fast reaction in game, but the difference between an enchanter that can react in .5 seconds, and an enchanter that reacts in .9-1.5 seconds is so very unnoticable. If people base skills on something like that in this game, then I believe they would have a great career making millions of dollars in drag racing, where reaction is a true factor. People's reactions are generally the same in situations such as those that pop up in EQ. <br>
<br>
Reaction may seem to save the day at times in EQ, and other times it may seem to ruin it in EQ. The person that ruined the day by not mezzing a mob in time did not react slow... the person simply did not try hard enough, by either not using all of the tools available to them in game or by eating dinner at the computer desk. The person that saved the day used all tools at hand and remained focused on the game. It's all too easy to confuse skill in regards to reacting with effort in regards to reacting in any situation. <br>
<br>
There is no true skill, quick thinking, or quick moving involved; I wish there was, as the game would be more fun for me today. This whole thing is the reason I very rarely log onto EQ anymore; I realized what the game really is. I almost <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> play games that require a great amount of thought and/or a bit of quick moving of the hands. EQ was not one of those games. <br>
<br>
No matter which class I played, which style of play I chose, which zone I played in, it all boiled down to the same thing: hotkeys and the click of a mouse. There are no factors besides that that effect gameplay. The game was designed this way. If there were more factors involved that could determine if I was a good player or a bad player, and if there ever is, I'd be back putting in the sad amount of time into the game. I enjoy competition, so the thought of competing for the title of &quot;Best Skilled Warrior on Tribunal&quot; would pull me back in faster than you can say &quot;this reply is too long&quot;. But for now, the &quot;best skilled (any class)&quot; means nothing more than &quot;best equipped (any class)&quot;. <br>
<br>
What's the main topic of this thread now anyways? Hate, Krickett, ghosts, or whatever I was just talking about? I'm groggy from pain medications that I had to take after being shoved into a wall by another car today... my reactions were slow at the speedway today, you see, and next thing I knew I was dreaming that I was talking to the ghost of Krickett in a small motel in a flooded town in I believe Montana while these dark elf enchanter types were running down the street outside screaming something about the Plane of Hate and narcolepsy.

The first time I played a 60 cleric, I was complimented by my group on being a better than average cleric, and at that time I didn't even really know all the misc spells yet. Second time I played an enchanter I was complimented by 2 different groups because I was pulling crowd control for both groups (just to be nice while the other group didn't have one). I'm not saying this to brag, merely to prove my point. If you're coordinated, reasonably intelligent and at decent game player, this stuff really isn't that tough to do well.<br>

By like I said originally, obviously this doesn't apply to everyone.<br>
<br>
But yes Jav, it is a blanket statement, that DOES apply to all classes, not just some. They all have differences and specialties that not everyone can grasp, but by the same token any one person claiming to be the best is more than likely no better than the other 1/3 that are just as capable, but just happen to be playing a different class.<br>

<br>
In the first case you're talking about such a minute amount of damage that it only means something in the raid case, where many people benefit from such a difference.  <br>
<br>
In the second, you're easily talking about the difference between life and death.  The best enchanters and shamans will mes/slow before the mob even touches anyone.  The round or two of the mob's damage that can be saved by quick moving/stunning/mes'ing, is HUGE in a group situation, I've already said it means little to nothing in a raid situation.  When you have 8 mobs, and you're doing a combination of mes'ing/rooting/stunning/tashing/ etc., it becomes very obvious.  When you're sitting in Seb pulling 2-3 mobs, yes, it's not rocket science.  <br>
<br>
How would I know this?  My regular nightly group liked to do things that were considered by others to be undoable at the time.  When one of us weren't around, the person who filled in couldn't do the job nearly as well.  Going back to the Maleus example, for a few months he didn't really play at all, so we were constantly using other shamans to replace him.  It became even more obvious that he was more skilled than the rest, because things never went as smoothly as when he was around.  With him there, a pull of 8 mobs was like a pull of 3 mobs.<br>
<br>
If a chanter reacts .5 seconds slower on mes'ing each of 3 mobs, no big deal.  They lose 1.5 seconds, a round of damage from 1 or 2 mobs.  But if they do that on 8 mobs, it's enough to swarm a healer, or kill a puller.<br>
<br>
I have no legacy to protect by defending EQ skill, I know I ebay'd, I know the reaction it made, and I knew the responses I'd get before I posted here.  If it bothered me, I would have quit before I started, considering the 20 or so flame posts I've already had directed at me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So feel free to continue, I don't mind being the target of someone's aggression.  <br>
<br>
I can almost guarantee that the majority of those who say EQ takes no skill as a main has played a melee, or a support caster.  To play it a few times means nothing, I've played my share of 60 clerics while I was in Comps, usually Beened, and while I did just fine and didn't let anyone die, it was obvious that Beened was more skilled at it than I.  Could I have become as good as he if I played it more?  Maybe, but who could ever know?  That's why it's silly to make blanket statements.  <br>

You aren't testing your groups then.  Try doing some stuff that wipes you once in awhile and you'll see where skill and speed come into play.  Assuming you have some people that HAVE skill/speed to compare it to.<br>
<br>
I will agree that there is no real BEST of any class.  I will also agree that many people are capable of being as good at anyone else at playing a given class.  But to imply that most people are about equal on any given class is ignorant at best.  To state that there is no skill involved or that reaction time doesn't matter is just more ignorance.<br>
<br>
One thing that wasn't mentioned was decision-making.  Reaction time is extremely important, but so is taking the correct action.  Most classes have quite a few choices and only experience will tell you the right one in given situations.  Take a one hour chanter to Juggs or as the only chanter on a planar break and you'll see what I'm talking about.  Try doing CT or Ssra with a newbie chanter and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
What some of you are telling me with your statements is that basically all you did with your EQ time is camp B2 in Sebelis.  That, or you've only ever grouped with either fucktards or professionals and have nothing to compare them to.<br>

<br>
Why do you keep coming here? You have no EQ character. You no longer play.<br>
<br>
Any respect you may have had from former friends and guildamates, you lost by ebaying your character. You may not realize it, because perhaps not everyone has told you straight up to your face, but I for one am tired of your continual appearances, like we should all be dying to spit shine your shoes for the absolutely godly things you did as an enchanter when you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> used to play</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I agree that classes take time to play well, but who cares? You sold your character!<br>
<br>
Get over yourself Jav. Everytime you come back here it makes me think &quot;Oh god, Jav's back...wonder what self-centered shit we get to put up with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> this</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> time...?&quot; <p><center><b><a href="http://darkmask.windsofstorm.net/images/ladies/fullsize/muse.jpg">Muse</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.the-elitists.com">Elitists and Vagrants</a>>

There is the best decision, and there are the not so good decisions. It takes 2 hours to realize this. Again, this is how the game was designed. That it takes 80 days /played to realize how to play a class, make the correct decisions, at the correct time, is nothing more than an illusion. Illusions get us all the time. People think a full moon is actually bigger when it's rising over a hill. The moon is the big bad enchanter that people percieve to be the best ever because he reacted so quickly, and the hill is the other enchanters people compare uber enchanter to, that simply do not try hard enough. I am not saying that one enchanter on this server is not better at times than all the other. I am saying that the enchanter that's better than all the others at times is not better because of the reasons that you would expect.<br>
<br>
I've seen the &quot;difference in a situation that mattered&quot;. Gad, I've seen the difference in a situation that mattered the first time I was at an orc camp. The difference is effort, not reaction or making the correct decision.<br>
<br>
It's not ignorance; it's me analyzing a game more than most others will ever want to analyze a game in their lifetime, with a bit psychology thrown in. Others here are basing their thoughts on EQ being easy on, simply, opinion. You are basing your thoughts on EQ requiring skill and mental readiness on, simply, opinion. I'm basing my statements on EQ requiring no massive amount of skill on, sadly, research. EverQuest the game, the psychological effects, the perceived difficulty, the community, were all part of a report of mine. heh I even collaborated with an area psyhcologist that did in fact agree with me in full. Nay, he never played EverQuest, but there is no need to experience the game to gain this information. <br>
<br>
The report mainly focused on what actually needs to be done to be successful in the game, what people credit their success to, and what actually effected their success. In most cases, it was nothing more than common sense, effort, invested time, and friends that have like-minded goals. Common sense and effort were the main factors. Reaction and &quot;making the right decision&quot; never came into play. Observing(I've about a dozen videos of people raiding in the most &quot;difficult&quot; situations) people proved this.<br>
<br>
Strategy came into play, of course. That's the only argument that could require quick thinking to be taken into consideration. Strategy, in all cases, however was based on a minute knowledge of the game and trial and error. Monks' pulling is a good thing to bring up here. Trial and error and effort are what makes a monk's pulling strategy good or bad. All strategies used in pulling are well below the required intelligence level of the majority of players in this game. This is not Command and Conquer where there are so many factors that play into any given strategy, nor is it Tekken where quick thinking and decent reaction are required to be the best, or among the best. By way of design, everyone is on a level playing field at all times in all situations.<br>
<br>
I know it may be hard to believe, but there are some things in this world that do not require intelligence, reflexes, muscle, and thought. This pseudo-complicated game is one of those things. Take some time to think about it and you'll come up with a few similar games/tasks/jobs that have similar requirements. Again, it's an illusion. With a game like this, reality is butchered because there are so many &quot;factors&quot; that you would think come into play, but do not. The power of suggestion even comes into play every so often. I prefer to think of EverQuest as the Oregon Vortex of video games. It just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> has</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be the way you see it because it's common sense to think that what you think you see right in front of you is truth, but it is in fact quite different from the way you see it.<br>
<br>
This report/study cost $1,500, so I do pray that I am not wrong and it was not all for nothing heh, but &quot;expert&quot; opinions do not believe I could be. But whatever the case may be, at least it helped me graduate a year early and provide the flame board with enough food for thought to last out the remainder of the year.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now back to your regulary scheduled ex-guildmate/friend arguments or whatever the topic has returned to by the time I hit add reply.<br>

Put down the opium a second, and get really close so you can catch my meanin'.  Get yourself a hobby, anything to take your mind off of being an enchanter.

<br>
To completely lack the ability to actually understand someone's simply laid out and explained post is also ignorant at best.<br>
<br>
How come so far it's only enchanters popping up and saying 'OMG no way, NOONE could do what I do because it takes SO MUCH timing and skill and experience, nah uh no way no how!!!'.<br>
<br>
To straighten out the entire meaning of my posts so that there's no way someone could possibly miss what was intended, 'most everyone' = 'lowest common denominator of EQ'. Note that only basic stuff in my post applies to them being able to do it, and the bar is raised a tad on each item thereafter.<br>
<br>
And Jav, since you have an deep seeded obsessional hatred with 'blanket statements', realize (as I've noticed you failed to do from the content of your posts) that the 'blanket' was meant to cover classes, not people. Classes were blanketed, people were seperated into groups. Use this information to read between the lines.<br>
<br>
And to the statement obviously meant to trivialize melee and support casters...If you can tell me you haven't seen even average and exceptional Warriors, you have no idea what you're talking about. Everyone thinks all melee do is 'mash buttons'. Tell that to the asshole pushing the mob into a wall at a raid, and the other warrior on the other side yelling at him not to. Or the rogue who knows when and when not to evade, as compared with those that thought 'Hide' was just for sneaking places.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying anyone can be as good as anyone. I'm saying those who are exceptional at their class, chances are, could be just as exceptional at any other class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=61&stop=79>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=815.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=815.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=815.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=815.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=815.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=815.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
