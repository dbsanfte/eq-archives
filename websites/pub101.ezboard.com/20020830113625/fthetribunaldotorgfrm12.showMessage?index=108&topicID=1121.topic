The person who tattled on him for flaming on a flame board is a fucking moron. Yes I said it. A fucking MORON !! If you cannot take the heat get the hell out of the kitchen.<br>
All i was saying was why does anyone even listen to the redundant fuckwad.  All his post say the same damnn thing. Its like he wishes he was great like DV but he cannot grasp the concept of new or original flames. DM is a weak, sick minded individual who grasps nothing more than &quot;hey I am getting my ass handed to me here, I better invoke the family flames&quot;<br>
Fuck You DM, I never sought to be your friend nor will I ever. I dont need a mental midget who failed basket weaving 101 in my circle of friends. If I want a good fantasy drawing I will get one from the masters. Not some no-name hack that uses tracing paper and finger paints. Put a crayon up a wormy dogs ass and let him drag the ground....... That would score up there with what you call art.<br>
I am not sure what kinda meds you are taking or susposed to be taking but anyone with half a brain can read your redundant posts and see you are not playing with a full deck. Someone missed a post of yours because it was deleted?? No problem, just read on of the others. They are all enterchangeable. <br>
Get a life you fucking freak. <br>
While it was the lamest damn thing I have ever seen for someone to report you for flaming them on a flame board...... How many goddamn times are you gonna reply with &quot;uh gee, I didnt mean her personally, I just flamed family members like everyone else did. I didnt really know them. She started it by coming here and exposing herself&quot;.<br>
Get a life you redundant piece of dog shit. Either that or just dry up and blow away. You were nothing, You are nothing, and you will never be anything.<br>
Now call up the stairs for mama to bring you your cheesey poofs and a root beer. Take your meds and instead of taking the time to type out a reply here......... Just copy and paste one of your orher wordy posts of drivel instead. We have all read everything you got to say so it will save you time and energy.<br>

<br>
I see someone learned a new word, but didnt take time to see the irony in posting redundant three times.<br>
<br>
As for my redunacy, you mean the fact that I argue the same point? Um how is that a bad thing? Someone says the sky is red, I say the sky is blue, their response is no no the the sky is really mauve, I say the sky is blue and explain why, they retort, that maybe the sky is really an amber, to which I say no, I have explained it before the sky is blue. If you think thats being redundant you are a fucking moron. When arguing a point, it makes sense to stick with only one and since that is the truth of what happened I dont really see how I can alter is too much to make it more entertaining for you and less redundant.<br>
<br>
I will give you an example you might understand Krickett.<br>
<br>
Krickett: Can I hang out with you guys please?<br>
Group: No we dont want you around<br>
Krickett: Can I just follow you around?<br>
Group: No we dont want you around<br>
Krickett: Maybe just tag along?<br>
Group: No we dont want you around<br>
Krickett: STOP BEING REDUNDANT<br>
<br>
Its only redundant when the person reading got it the first time, but most of my posts are counter posts where someone didnt get it so I have to repeat myself sticking to the same point. I am sorry this is such a new concept for you. I dont change my opinion to be cool like you Krickett or get people to like me more. Which you clearly did in this post<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Dont lie, you would love to see me banned, you only say you dont because you dont want people to dislike you. You felt bad enough already when I whipped your ass before I sent ya scampering away like a poor little puppy whose nose I just shoved in its own shit. I showed you how stupid you were and you ran, apparently something good must of happened in your life, that helped build your self esteem, so I will say congratulations on moving up from fry guy to counter worker at McDonalds, but it doesnt change the fact that you are a complete and utter moron. Your flames are wasted reading time which are cries for attention from a child who despertly wishes to be accepted. ( OMG I have said this before, it must be redundacy, but see above, its only redundant when you dont understand it the first time ). You are a joke, your whole flame board persona is a joke. You are part of this new generation of look at me post on every subject spamming it so you will learn my name posters. <br>

<br>
Yeah I cannot grasp the concept of of flaming, HAH. I will listen to the master flamer on this, Krickett the one with all the best flames LOL, omg, do you really believe this when you write it? Yes please criticize my flame, like the fat slob who sits in the stands of the baseball game, tell me how my swing sucks. Your opinion means so much to me, it really does, any tips on flaming I can get from a master like you * stiffled chuckle*, please post them.<br>
<br>
What I dont understand though, as a master flamer, you believe family flames are a last resort? Did you hear that, that was the short bus honking for you, put on your protective helmet and get out there. Family flames are indeed one of the first attacks because they are fun. If I really want to debate something I will, but in a flameboard, its more fun to piss freaks like you off, whose whole exsistence depends on my words and my attention.<br>
<br>
You do make me laugh though, I havent met anyone with your level of stupidity since Valkary. The real humor in all of this, you werent even around to see Darkvenom flame, you are a by product of this board. Like I said one of the new generation of wanna be flames attention whores who heard a name dropped like Darkvenom and you latch onto it. You dont understand what, you who didnt even know Darkvenom, latching onto his name says about you. You got the name from us, and since you respect us deep down inside, hope to be us, you respect our idols. Please tell me all about Darkvenom, I am sure everything you know comes from us whose every word your cling on to.<br>

Hah then get one. I never claimed to be one of the masters, or even my artwork was good, I just dont see ya doing anything better. I am glad I graduated from crayons to finger paints, but wait you said finger paints in a post almost a month ago, god you are being REDUNDANT. Once again, I will say, cling to the artwork flames, if ya think it effects me at all, you dont know the first thing about flaming. I have been flamed about my artwork since before you created your ezboard account, and I am still drawing, but if you want to keep being REDUNDANT ( wow big word score ), more power to you. Perhaps you will actually convince yourself your flames are good. <br>
<br>
You are quite torn that I dont like you, upset it seems, thats too bad, but it was time someone told you that you are a moron, that your posts are empty and boring and the only reason anyone replies to you is to keep themselves entertained, playing with one of the board retards and giving you some of that attention you crave.  <p><center>

The best ya tossed out is, some art flames which are old hat, looked up my guild history and made some guesses which made you look like an ass who doesnt know shit, telling me that sticking to a point is being redundant, and that I am not as good as Darkvenom, a person you dont even know, someone who ya never read his posts, whose name you only know through through us. Are you gonna flame me or what? Or ya gonna go back to your &quot; Look at me Look at me, let me spam the board &quot; posts.<br>
<br>
Quick construct another stunning post by stealing other's ideas and posts and trying to pass their posts as your own. You know so little of what is going on you depend on hearsay from other people's posts in order to pretend you have the slightest clue as to what is going on.  <p><center>
