<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How do you explain former homosexuals who are now straight and live a straight &quot;lifestyle&quot;? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
With my experience, just people I know, no statistics although I should look them up, most of the people in those programs fail. <br>
<br>
I also know people who have gone through the program, marry someone, and don't have sex, intimate relations with the person. They just do it to maintain that straight lifestyle, and remain celibate. <br>
<br>
I know people who went through the program, tried as hard as they could to be straight, and ended up going back to being gay.<br>
<br>
Now, something you won't hear many people admit is there ARE people who classified themselves as homosexual, lived the &quot;homosexual lifestyle&quot; and later in life realize they are actually straight. I don't know many people like that, actually I think I only know one person, don't see it often at all. From reading up on it, most of those people, and the people that are successes with programs like exodus and the like, were sexually molested as children and, without trying too hard to delve into things I don't know about, felt like that was what they deserved. Not always the case, but I seem to find a lot of sexual abuse in the history of the successes. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What Causes a Person To Have a Particular Sexual Orientation? <br>
<br>
There are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation; most scientists today agree that sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors. In most people, sexual orientation is shaped at an early age. There is also considerable recent evidence to suggest that biology, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality. In summary, it is important to recognize that there are probably many reasons for a person's sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people. <br>
<br>
Is Sexual Orientation a Choice? <br>
<br>
No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation? <br>
<br>
No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable. <br>
<br>
However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals. <br>
<br>
What About So-Called &quot;Conversion Therapies&quot;? <br>
<br>
Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.<br>
<br>
The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Exodus International, one of the more widely known and loudest gay to straight conversion groups says<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What's your &quot;success rate&quot; in changing gays into straights?<br>
What you are really asking is whether there is realistic hope for change for men and women who do not want their sexual orientation to be homosexual. And the answer to that is yes! <br>
<br>
In 1 Corinthians 6:9–11, Paul gives a list of all kinds of sinners that will not inherit the kingdom of God, including those that practice homosexuality. But he goes on to say, &quot;and that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.&quot; Some Corinthian Christians had formerly been homosexuals, but now were counted among the saints. Now, that's good news indeed! <br>
<br>
No one is saying that change is easy. It requires strong motivation, hard work, and perseverance. But we find hundreds of former homosexuals who have found a large degree of change--attaining abstinence from homosexual behaviors, lessening of homosexual temptations, strengthening their sense of masculine or feminine identity, correcting distorted styles of relating with members of the same and opposite gender. Some former homosexuals marry and some don't, but marriage is not the measuring stick; spiritual growth and obedience are. <br>
<br>
On the statistical side, careful reviews of research studies on sexual orientation change suggest that real change is indeed possible. Studies suggesting change rates in the range of 30-50% are not unusual, although &quot;success rates&quot; vary considerably and the measurement of change is problematic. For details and review of several studies, see the link below.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

It *IS* a choice to live a &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; and have gay sex and all that. It's most often NOT a choice to have the feelings, and be gay.

I would contest that - being a homosexual puts you in the minority, but being in a majority doesn't make something normal and being in a minority doesn't mean it's abnormal.<br>
<br>
Red heads are in the minority. Is that abnormal?<br>
<br>
Left handers are in the minority. Is it abnormal?<br>
<br>
At best (for the rights argument), you could claim it was a birth defect of sorts, but then it pretty much shoots down the moral argument... that is unless you are one of the few who believe it is not a sin to be homosexual, only to act on it. But then you are saying that God intended to have people born who would be forced to be celibate all their lives. Personally, I don't buy it.<br>
<br>
Either way, I think it is perfectly normal for a small percentage of the world population to be gay.

Whether we 'misuse' it for pleasure or whatever else, it's intent is for procreation.  The other creativeness we have with it is wholly brought on by being horny.  Horniness is a natural event that is used to tell you that you want to procreate.  Masterbation is a natural urge intended to teach you how it works.  It's a natural thing!  In society we can't just grab the nearest female and start humping so we come up with other ways of sating this physical phenomena.<br>

&quot;Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. <br>
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. <br>
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? <br>
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?&quot; <br>

No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. <br>
