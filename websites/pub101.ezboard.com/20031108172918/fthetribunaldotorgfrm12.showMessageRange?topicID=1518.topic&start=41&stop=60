Things were going OK on this rant up until he started bitching about &quot;the Liberal Media&quot; who is only as liberal or conservative as the ratings for the form of entertainment they call the news will allow.    Conservative owned yes, but as true conservatives it’s the bottom line that means everything.  Wanna know who is in charge?   Follow the money.<br>
<br>
Then the writer goes to attack anyone who shows disagreement with the war as &quot;...chanting anti-American obscenities.&quot;  Fuck that.  George W's war plans for Iraq have nothing to do with the War on Terrorism, it started as a smokescreen for the mid-term elections.  Turned out to be a quite effective smokescreen &amp; now the people in charge are salivating at a shot at controlling Iraq oil.  Wanna know who is in charge?  Follow the money.   Being against his war &amp; disagreeing with that X-nosepacking, draft dodging, silver-spoon president does not make me un-American.  The moron that was “voted most likely to wear a lampshade” was blind, stinking lucky to win the presidency.  Seems our liberal media missed all that during the election, even to the point of downplaying his alcohol abuse problems.  <br>
<br>
Then in the next line not forgetting the Vietnam era protesters that supposedly spit on our vets.  Not saying that it didn't happen, but I don’t know any vets that got spat on.  However I DO know Vietnam vets that were treated like shit at VFW posts because they &quot;lost&quot; what wasn’t a &quot;real&quot; war by some CONSERVITIVE assholes.  They were discriminated against getting jobs &amp; generally treated like shit by the public at large.  <br>
<br>
So it’s hip to be conservative today, fine.  When you dittoheads are still living in mom’s basement, sending out stacks of resumes, wishing for a job that pays a living wage with that college degree, you can always play EQ.  <br>

I dont think the US said.  &quot;OH your going to commit genocide!&quot;<br>

Well here have some money!<br>

The US was assisting a &quot;side&quot; that was more aligned to their interests and for reasons other then Genocide.<br>

I'm willing to bet a hefty amount that you have no fucking clue.  If you're as ignorant as you present yourself on major issues such as Iraq and U.N. - then its a good chance that you are absolutely clueless about some of the more obscure foreign policy blunders like Guatemala.<br>
<br>
Let me give you the short gist of it.  U.S. knowingly supplied the ruling party in Guatemala which was trying to supress opposition that they labeled as &quot;communists&quot; - they werent anything even remotely related to communism, they were indigenous Mayan people who didn't agree with the ruling party of Guatemala.  Decades of civil war and genocide which U.S. supported by shipping weapons, money and training those Guatemalan officers on American soil in what they called &quot;counter-insurgency&quot; tactics.  The CIA was fully aware of the horrible human rights violations that those officers were perpetrating and they knew that those officers would take that training back to Guatemala to continue in the same vein as they have before.<br>
<br>
U.S. Government KNEW that the ruling Guatemalan party was systematically trying to exterminate the indigenous Mayan population and still supplied them with tools to do it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=matancoindancer>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 864<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/03 12:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.newdream.net/gru/gfx/ring.gif width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Your stupid.<br>

Back to the question at hand.  U.S. and Iraq situation breaks down fairly simply.<br>
<br>
According to the law:  US has a right to invade Iraq to make it comply with its obligations due to the violation of the agreement that was set out in 1991.  Even the leftists cant deny the fact that Saddam isn't fully cooperating for whatever reason which is grounds for an invasion.<br>
<br>
According to the leftists:  US has no grounds to invade Iraq because they didnt show reasonable proof, etc, even factoring in Powell's speech there is not enough evidence, etc.   All this is fairly irrelevant because neither Libs nor the Cons deny the fact that Saddam is being as accomodating as his obligations require him to.<br>
<br>
Once that is established, we can move on to the pressing question.<br>
<br>
Whether it is right to invade Iraq:<br>
<br>
AT which point the leftists will point out that the war is not about WMD's but rather about oil, that US sold the WMD's to Iraq in the first place, that the war is being perpetrated to boost sagging economy, that the war is a smoke screen extension of the War on Terrorism which keeps the nation united and presents the American populace with a visible foe: the favorite bad guy of the 1990's - Saddam.  Or that the US has no business at all to order countries around and that considering the history of American foreign policy - that America doesn't iknow its head from its ass when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
In turn, the right wingers will respond by saying that Saddam is a direct threat to US, that Iraq is harboring terrorists, that its American right to secure whatever interests are necessarry to ensure the continuing dominace of US, or that the Iraqi people need democracy, or they will trot out Saddam's human rights violations and probably a bunch more that I forgot.<br>
<br>
It's an impasse and at this point you wont get anywhere.  It's obvious that the US government has already decided to wage war regardless of UN's opinion, so the point of &quot;should US invade&quot; is not much relevant at this point of time.  I just hope that they pull it off as cleanly and quickly as possible to avoid complications.<br>
<br>
Personally, I am against the war because I disagree with the main reasoning for the invasion:  Saddam has WMD&quot;s and is a direct threat to America.  I don't think that Saddam is a threat to US, no more than the rest of the countries in the Middle East - the only difference is that while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others probably feel just as harshly about US as Saddam does - they wont show it.  I do think it has in part to do with the oil and in part with the fact that Israel must be getting antsy and need reassurance.  I don't think those are good enough reasons to wage war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 2016<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/03 12:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Slight correction to my previous post:<br>

The only thing I think he downplays too much is the involvement of Israel.  I believe Israel is the main influence behind Bush's push for this war.  Bush basically is killing a flock of birds with 1 military...he gets his oil, he gets the guy who went after his father, he betters his bid for re-election, he takes the focus away from the economy and the big corp scandals, he gets to indulge every privacy obliterating bill/amendment he wants, and he does the deed for Sharon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I will now insert the obligatory Ladmo response for him, to save him the post:  &quot;Yeah, well yur just a stoner, go smoke some drugs you dirty hippy&quot;.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Back to the topic at hand:  I was really disappointed by Powell's speech.  Why 'disappointment'?  Well, it's a given we're going to war...there's no chance in hell Bush will pull out now. First off he won't be able to justify the money already spent over there with no result, and secondly he'll lose face before the world.  (In his eyes and the muslim world that is).  So I was really hoping there would be some concrete evidence Powell would present to justify our imminent invasion.  <br>
<br>
No such evidence was forthcoming.  The drawings were pretty, the satellite photos nicely captioned, the tapes dubbed just sub-par quality enough to be believable.  But that's about it.  I can't see anywhere or anyone that 'evidence' he declassified would have endangered anyone.  The meat of it were those satellite photos (and it was nice of CNN to add the text 'XXX weapons facility, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>disguised</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from inspectors' on each, since the inspectors that were there obviously can't tell but we can from 20,000 miles above the earth) and you can't endanger a satellite now can you?  My question is, if we have all these photos of such apparent facilities, why not give them to the inspectors?  Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
Those tapes?  Would have been nice if they could have named some names.  'High ranking general, high ranking officer' tells us shit.  And it's not like we've faked tapes before, have we (osama tape anyone)?  But the drawings were pretty though.<br>
<br>
I was hoping for concrete evidence...film of them moving stuff ahead of the inspectors, actual gas/chemical construction facility elements, or even the toxins themselves.  None of that was forthcoming.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">&quot;He did have it!  Where is it now?! Huh?! HUH?!&quot;</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is not evidence. The report Powell cites from the British that provided a good bit of information for his presentation?  It was plagiarized from a grad student heh.<br>
<br>
About the only thing I could agree with in that whole speech is that Saddam does appear to be hiding what he's doing, i.e. he's not coming completely clean.  What I don't understand is why we just don't take him out?  Assassinate his ass, Bush revoked the CIA restrictions that held them back before.  But doesn't beget us oil fields does it.  But I guess our intelligence agencies would have to know where he is huh?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dont mis-trust our governments intentions. Our Intelligance agencies are pretty much on the ball. They know what is going down .. so does everyone else because they have intelligance agencies too.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah...the british intelligence agencies pull their stuff from grad students and our agencies can't put 3 reports together to figure out planes are going to be hijacked and flown into buildings.  Or could they?  Remains to be seen if they had a hand in that.  Mistrust?  Shit, I think it's the only viable option at this point.<br>
