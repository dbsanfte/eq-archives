War against Afganistan? that would imply that the taliban were the legimate representatives and recognized rulers of the Afgan people, yet only a few other countries recognized their legitimacy. <br>
<br>
not only that but have you seen the press responses to the demagoguery in the articles that you sited?<br>

Nobody is saying it wasn't a war. But it was a war against thugs and warlords, not against an entire country. I think that when Cogs ask where was the Nagasaki, he was asking &quot;where is the evidence of war against an entire nation of people?&quot; WW2 and other wars against countries, were marked by massive and deliberate civillian causualites, where is the evidence for that?<br>

You're basically accusing me of taking the high moral ground against war. I am not anti-war, I'm anti-Bush. I have stated several times that I am glad the US ousted the Taliban and I have always expressed my total support for the USA since Sept 11, so get off your high horse about &quot;until it's your loved one&quot;. <br>
<br>
The USA is not its government. Just because you are at war doesn't mean you have to support everything the government does. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, and that applies domestically as much as it does internationally.<br>

Sensory deprivation only works well when the majority of the senses are affected, the key ones being sight and sound. They can still see.<br>

<br>
The Nazis got to power in a similar fashion to the Taliban -- they manipulated events in a difficult time, and assumed control. They then manipulated the people to retain control and wage war, much like the Taliban. Not everyone supported them, much like the Taliban.<br>
<br>
Allied forces helped a new interim administration run Germany after the war, much like in Afghanistan. The &quot;most dangerous&quot; prisoners of war were taken away for trial in a specially altered prison at Nuremberg, but they didn't undergo sensory deprivation en route.<br>
<br>
What's the difference? Propaganda and hype. A war is a war, and prisoners taken during it are POWs. The terms &quot;Battlefield detainees&quot; or &quot;Unlawful combatants&quot; are simply more woeful spin.<br>

I for one was born and raised in one of those countries. I know the way they think. I know that they will take anything such as human rights, justice (innocent until proven guilty) as an opportunity to strike. These people have no problem drafting 11 year olds to go to war. They have no problem sending young kids to walk on mine fields because they have no other way of getting rid of the mines. They have no problem strapping explosives on themselves to blow something up. Why, because they feel they are just in their cause and God will be on their side. <br>
<br>
American Justice and human rights are not a universal thing. As much as we would like it to be. The reason we are so shocked and surprised at their actions is because we as a genereal rule would never ever think of doing what they do.<br>
<br>
Majority of middle eastern people and majority of muslims in the world are peacful civilized individuals. The Contempt that I feel for these people is because they violate the rules of civilization. They violate the teachings of Islam. They should get no protection of the law because they do not respect the law. It's pure and simple as that. Societies are created with the understanding that the people in that society will follow the laws set forth. If you get people who wish to follow no rules and commit horrible act against humanity, they deserve no protection what so ever.  <p><font color=cc0000>

It might be worth rereading my original post, just so you can be reminded that I made only TWO points:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  1) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Announcing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you're not going to respect the Geneva Convention is really bad public relations!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2) It sets a precedent for third world dictators to say &quot;well if the USA can say that, I can say it too!&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Does anyone actually disagree with those points? Was all this defense of my politics really necessary or relevant to the original post? Nope! <p><br><br>

<br>
You are stretching things when comparing the manner that the Taliban and the Nazis came to power.<br>
<br>
Its pretty simple, Taliban took power in a full-on civil war/revolution situation, they grabbed power by force of arms. Nazi's took power in a devious fashion but not from a civil war or by force of arms. Once Nazi's took power, they were treated as the legitmate rules of Germany, given the benefit of the doubt and full diplomatic recognition by the world community. Was not Hitler elected initially?? Did the Nazi's not run legitmate candidates for the Reichstag?? When if ever did the Taliban follow the existing legal structures to gain power? No I don't think they did, they gained power by waging war against the rulers of Afganistan.<br>
<br>
I know that reactionary is usually associated with conservatives, thats why i used it to describe you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but you do appear to me to be knee jerking your responses to the propaganda reported by the left leaning newspapers and ignoring the alternate information from other sources.<br>
<br>
I do have a question tho, when taken prisoner did the nuremburg fellas have TB? where they transported in Cargo jets that were without the benefit of sound dampening insulation? Did they vow to kill their guards before their time was up?<br>
<br>
I dislike the term battlefield detainees as well, but I do believe that the government will resolve their status soon. It sounds like doublespeak to me. <br>

If this is true...<br>
<br>
Couldn't the same be said for U.S.?<br>
<br>
U.S. manipulates events post 9/11 to build global coalitions and use the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to conduct military operations at will in any country it deems as a terrorist haven.  So far it has been only Afghanistan, however the definition that the Bush administration uses for states that &quot;support&quot; terrorism is so vague and nebulous, it could be applied to practically any Arab state.<br>
<br>
They manipulate people to retain control and wage war.<br>
<br>
And finally, not everyone supports the U.S.<br>

They are demonstrably two different things. To be against terrorism you do not have to comply with George W Bush's every single far-right dream. Those who say &quot;it's dangerous to question&quot; are wrong.<br>
<br>
Before September 11 I made a post on Trib.org about the Taliban and a documentary entitled <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Afghanistan: Behind the Veil</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by Saira Shah, a British journalist of Afghani descent. It was in a discussion which mentioned Australia's refusal to accept Afghani refugees on board a boat called the Tampa in late August. I was pointing out the cruelty of rejecting people who had fled the Taliban.<br>
<br>
Then Sept 11 happened and everyone finally took notice of the Taliban. The same documentary was even shown to US troops to motivate them prior to the recent war.<br>
<br>
Later, I linked to a German article which stated that Palestinian people in Germany were offered cake and candy to cheer for an Associated Press camera crew, footage which was shown on TV as &quot;Palestinians cheering about Sept 11 attacks&quot;. My German is not as good as it used to be, and I mistranslated it as referring to the footage shown on CNN of Palestinians cheering (I only figured that out recently -- so I was wrong, but so were the people who responded by confusing it with an unrelated incident reported on snopes2.com). My linking to the article was unfairly interpreted as being &quot;anti-USA&quot;.<br>
<br>
To respond with &quot;Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh!&quot; when I say &quot;I have always expressed my total support for the USA since Sept 11&quot; is to ignore my posts of sympathy and shock following the WTC attacks. At 11:45pm on September 11 my time, I was about to go to bed, when someone on Anarchy Online said &quot;a plane just crashed into the WTC&quot;. At 4am I was still standing in the same spot in front of my TV, in shock. The way people treat me here, they would have you believe that I was cheering -- they would have you believe that I was the type of person who thought &quot;the US deserved it&quot;. I didn't -- I only posted messages expressing my shock and sympathy, because that's how I feel.<br>
<br>
I oppose the Bush administration and its political allies. I am opposed to economic and cultural imperialism perpetrated by large corporations, many of which are US based. I oppose many facets of the manufactured western culture in which I live.<br>
<br>
But I am a big supporter of the American people and their right to live in peace, and to be free of terrorism.<br>
<br>
Some societies end up jailing or executing people for their political beliefs, because of exactly this kind of confusion -- campaigning peacefully for change, and expressing ideas that I think will make the world a better place does not make me an enemy of the USA. Respectful disagreement is not support for terrorism.<br>
