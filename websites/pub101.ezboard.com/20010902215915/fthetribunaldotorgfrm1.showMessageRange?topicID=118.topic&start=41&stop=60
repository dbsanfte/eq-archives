Not sure how many of you even know Qudos, but he is one of the nicest people to play this game.  He not only has help me personally and my guild but just about any person that has ever asked for help.  I have seen him across zones or to adjacent zones just to help people with rezzes or what ever they needed.  I do believe this was just a misunderstanding and an all around unfortunate incident.  It is obvious that RF is a F*cked up spawn taht has many of our guilds opposing each other with every spawn.  It is a shame VI has not done something to fix this problem and this problem is doubled on Trib do to our wonderful Server Crashes every other day.<br>
<br>
Just curious now on what is expected since our guild has about 8 Clerics stuck on this part.  The 1st person to hand in item, regardless if he/she has the forces to kill spawn, is the one who is rewarded with the spawn?  This is according to what I understand the GM told Nerple and her group.  The MOB belongs to the Spawner until it is dead or Despawns.<br>

<br>
I sat with Nerple for 4 RL days (I know Nerp in RL) to help with Rage in the event peeps tried to steal him or they needed numbers. Honestly, I didn't think anyone would try the former, and I doubt (still do) the latter would have ever been true, but I wasn't doing anything at the time, and I had been watching Nerple work through the various steps for some time now and said I'd help if any help was ever needed at any point in the quest.<br>
<br>
What I saw caused me to lose a lot of respect in humanity.<br>
<br>
The first time, I was camped out to sleep when Comps took Rage, so I don't have direct details, and won't make any comment as to what happened. Then, there was the server crash, and of course we had to wait for Naggy to be killed again. By the time the fourth day was beginning, we had dealt with verbal abuse by RNG, which was nothing major, but already had us in a sour mood. As Rage popped the second time, SI started gathering and I was already in the waiting area. <br>
<br>
"Somehow" (I won't name names, as it is neither here nor there, and wouldn't change anything anyways) Eligrants caught wind of the spawn, and were fast able to gather a rival force to try and beat Nerp to killing Rage. =\  Despite pleading from SI, Nerp, myself, Comps AND the RNG, (who, despite their earlier words, stuck up for Nerp in the end, which was a very nice gesture on their part) EV simply told us to deal with it, as "Rage gets taken [by others] all the time." and proceeded to turn in their pearl then and there.<br>
<br>
As I said before, Nerp and I had been waiting 4 RL days with not a lot of sleep, AND a server crash. I felt disgusted that one of the largest groups in our server would set an example like this. I can only imagine how Nerp felt because he immediately camped out and went home as soon as word was sent EV had indeed killed Rage. (He refused to answer the phone all day =\ )<br>
<br>
I was pretty out of it by then, and logged off myself. I haven't been on in a few days, and I see this before logging on to do my usual routine.  I'm glad Nerp got her Pearl back, but she should have never lost it in the first place if people had been civil.<br>
<br>
Show some respect people, or at the very least courtesy for the person trying to do a quest, epic or otherwise.<br>
<br>
Crap like this makes me want to quit EQ some days. Comps, SI, EV, Legendary and other larger guilds - you people are supposed to be the best the server has to offer. You can go places people in the smaller guilds only dream of. You can fight monsters that send others fleeing without batting an eye (relatively speaking). You have the strongest characters, the most skills, the most freedom.<br>
<br>
Please, realize this and realize that you are an example of the server as a whole. Take some pride in yourselves, and show some respect for not only yourselves and your guild, but everyone else too. If there is any decency left in the larger guilds, I ask this - how hard is it to get along? Not very I would think. With a bit of respect for others and some little-exercised restraint and civility, I think that situations like this could become a memory. But of course, that all lies in the hands of you.<br>
<br>
This game's getting way too political....I need a break.<br>
<br>
Peace<br>

Actually, considering that it seems that Comps tried to help Nerple _twice_ with this while they have clerics of their own without epics indicates to me that they are some of the best the server has to offer.<br>

So yeah, if you want to risk your whole Epic and hand in the pearl to make Ragefire spawn so you can &quot;claim him&quot;, you better hope you can get a proper force there and buffed/medded up in 30 minutes or you will be starting your epic over from scratch. <p><img src=http://personal.lig.bellsouth.net/lig/g/_/g_daspit/hopkins2.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uvigz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VIgz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/29/01 12:41:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Congrats to Qudos (of Legendary) on Epic...</span><hr size=1> The only thing one of our clerics did was res EV after the RF fight.

Anyways we now know now that a capable force means nothing. Guess there will be alot of clerics next time when Naggy dies. All waiting till RF pops so they can hand in the pearl, after that die in the room and after that get a capable force to kill him.<br>

hehe.. Guess it shouldn't be surprising that Legendary would do something like this.. But there just HAS to be some way we can blame this on Revolution.<br>
<br>
I have two possibilities<br>
<br>
1.<br>
<br>
After they spent so much time recruiting active members and sending tells to everyone who posted on the Want To Join forum for Revolution..  <br>
<br>
They have so many of those dirty, KSing, cheating bastards from Revolution in their guild that they cant help but do Reprehensible things like what I just read..<br>
<br>
2.<br>
<br>
If Revolution hadn't zoned into an empty plane four hours after Legendary cleared it and vacated it.  To kill the shissar who I MUST assume had popped after they left. ( I mean NOBODY would be stupid enough to vacate a plane for 4 hours with the shissar sitting in it ). Then Legendary wouldn't have had to KS Ragefire.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 + 1 = 7<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Either way you look at it..  It cant be because Legendary have tossed whatever morals they may have posessed out the window.  It MUST be Revolution's fault.  <br>
<br>
<br>

What would have happened if Legendary had not been there? Would SI have had enough time to do CR &amp; gotten enough to kill him? Just wondering, not trying to stir shit up. I am just wondering what had been the result if only those SI people had been in the zone.<br>

Ragefire sucks ass. I feel sorry for the clerics still going through this. I wish they would turn him into a triggered spawn somewhere besides Naggy's lair to help stop the bottleneck &amp; endless camping. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><B><FONT color="gold">Ladida Hohum<BR>

Not that they will ever do anything with it. I basicly suggested to make Ragefire the same like Faydedar for druid epic.<br>
<br>
- Zordak ragefire spawns in regular intervals of 5 hour after Naggy is dead.<br>
- Cleric gets the pearl back from Zordak Ragefire when he turns it in.<br>
- Cleric has to turn in heart *and* pearl to Omat Vastsea to finish his epic.<br>
<br>
This would mean nothing is lost when a guild looses the fight because the cleric still has the pearl to spawn Zordak Ragefire again.

<br>
Legendary has *never* done a joint raid on Ragefire with EV, when Nerple was there or not.  During that scenario, we purposely waited in the Prep room and Assumed FCFS rules.  Our view of FCFS is the first guild with a **capable** force in place is first and should be entitled to spawn the mob.  Spawning the mob without the ability to kill it is at least in my view, no different that kiting around Lodizal to delay others from killing him.  A pathetic and cheezy tactic that we *never* subscribe to.<br>
<br>
Second, Qudos had been camping the Ragefire spawn for 2 days as well as Nerple.  For much of that time, Nerple was not logged in as his cleric but logged in as his monk, FD in the corner safely while Qudos assumed commensurate risk.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this to justify actions, I'm saying this to clarify that even the issue of who was spending camping time was contested.<br>
<br>
As far as the Ragefire spawn, when we were alerted to the Ragefire spawn, we checked online.  Total number of SI members online == 4.  Total number of Companions online == 9.  Basically, between both guilds, they had a combined force of 13 people, not nearly sufficient to take Ragefire.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Legendary had over 35 people online.  IMHO, and this is not necessarily a guild position, you don't claim a spawn if you don't have the capability to take it.  I might as well sit at the zone in to Seb and call Trakanon, Raid looking for 25 more people.<br>
<br>
That being said, when we went to buff in the prep room, our intention was to gather our force, buff, and then spawn Ragefire only if and when we were ready.  If SI/Comps gathered a similar force in SolB, our intention was to let them spawn Ragefire and attempt to kill it.  If they did not have a sufficient force in zone or online by the time we were ready, our intention was then to spawn Ragefire.<br>
<br>
We do not like the idea of racing to hand in a pearl.  Ragefire is such a rare and painful spawn, that I personally have problems with the idea of Spawn first, mobilize later.  To risk having RF despawn because you want to &quot;lock&quot; the mob does nothing but encourage people to spawn a mob that they can't kill, thus wasting Everyone's time.  Case in point, Nerple spawned a mob without sufficient support, they died.  You don't battle rez under a dragon.  CR would have taken tremendous time.  End result?  Ragefire may or may not have been killed before depop, possible waste of the spawn.  If we had spawned him, one more epic on the server.  <br>
<br>
As for destroying the pearl, the GM did NOT force Qudos to destroy the pearl, he asked him to.  Qudos had every option, and every right to appeal that decision through both email and appeals to the lead GM.  The GM *Cannot* delete an epic item until a final decision is reached, which is why he asked Qudos, and why the GM offered the possibility of another solution.  Nerple refused, which I can't say I blame him for considering he wasn't very happy.<br>
<br>
Qudos, instead of appealing and going to E-mail support, chose to delete the heart instead.  Nerple, was NOT awarded the heart because the GM considered it to have been a failed quest attempt.  Why?  Because the entire SI/Comps raid was dead.  One cleric bound in a corner is NOT going to finish off Ragefire.<br>
<br>
So where does this leave us.  It leaves all of us in a pretty crappy position.  IE, we are stuck with the rule that whoever hands in the pearl owns the spawn.  Being able to kill it is irrelevant.  Being camped there is now irrelevant.  If ClericX sits in RF room for 60 hours, and ClericY runs past and hands in the pearl, guess what?  It's ClericY's spawn.  Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
So, I now guess FCFS is who can throw up DA and hand in the pearl the fastest.  Maybe your view of FCFS is who says it's their camp.  Maybe mine is who is actually capable of killing the mob.  Either way, it's all moot.<br>
<br>
And as for the comments from our dear friends at Revolution, well if you read the Trib scheduling board rules, when a plane was Reserved, it was locked for a period up until 12 hours before the next plane reservation.  Regardless of vacating the plane, it *NEVER* becomes FFA unless the guild who has scheduled it Agrees to relinquish rights to the plane.<br>
<br>
What you also forget, is that when Revolution spoke to our Guildleaders, we Clearly informed you that we were NOT done with the plane, that we intended to kill Shissar and CT, and then you basically told us, &quot;Screw you, we're taking Shissar anyway&quot;.  As far as we're concerned, we agreed to a set of rules in the Trib board, and you basically decided to follow it when convenient.  It's crap like that that has driven larger guilds to go FCFS, not greed, not the desire to stomp smaller guilds.<br>
<br>
We played how we thought was fair.  Might not be how you view it, but I'll be sleeping fine at night.<br>

<br>
I mean, after all, it was her butt on the line. She staked her work to that point on being able to take Ragefire down. The least you, or anyone else, could do is to let her have her 30 minutes to succeed or fail.<br>
<br>
Considering that the Comps were helping out, I wouldn't have been surprised if there was someone there with an epic to make the resses happen very quickly and go for a second shot.<br>
<br>
Yes, the bottleneck of Ragefire is a pain. Lack of scheduling and random spawn timer means that more than likely guilds like my own, who killed Naggy for the first time before _this_ Ragefire spawn, are going to have a very difficult time getting to Ragefire.<br>
<br>
That said, once we trigger him, I'd expect the chance-- a 30 minute window once triggered-- to be left to us to succeed or fail.<br>
