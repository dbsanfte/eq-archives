<br>
Probably a safe assumption.  The reaction to this event has made me sick to my stomach and I personally am not looking to repeat that feeling.  <br>
<br>
Zierain, do yourself a favor and stop talking as an authority on Legendary's Tormax attempts.  You were probably still working your way up through your 40s when we were working to get a server first on him.  Bind rush was not even a possibility as we were CoV allied, maybe you are thinking of a different guild.<br>
<br>
In any event, I highly doubt anything will be accomplished here as far as solving the problem.  Conno does not read here, thank god, but i'm sure you can reach him for comment (I'm sounding way too much like a secretary) on the Legendary board<br>
<br>
As far as Aary's hp, if you really want to know, here is a pic I took before I died.  Unless the &quot;ENRAGE&quot; announcement over guildchat while I was sitting in bazaar was a lie, we got him further, but I don't have the physical proof.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqlegendary.com/~telemakhos/aar.bmp">www.eqlegendary.com/~telemakhos/aar.bmp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Challia, if you are really looking for Conno to say something to you on this subject, you aren't helping your case by slandering him here repeatedly.  Look for him in game or on our board and you have a chance of getting his attention, though if I were him I wouldn't give you the time of day.<br>
<br>
This whole ordeal has pretty much taken a lot of my desire to play EQ.  It's a wonder what you people can do when you really try.<br>
<br>
Take it easy, <br>

I agree one hundred percent with this.  I am not here in an attempt to laud how superior my guild is to Legendary.   I am here to point out how bad Legendary is.  So it's once again time to go to work.<br>
<br>
Arec, I'm glad that you posted that your reason for gimping ToV was because of the training incident.  That just lowers you even further.  Was this Connovar's decision?  If so, maybe you should change the Legendary guild tag to Divine Madness, and make Babilove and Clangeddins officers.  As far as I know, the training was not intentional.  You say Slyie send tells to people saying that the training was intentional.  Produce them.  Slyie has denied training them on purpose; and since we have heard no denials about Connovar lying to your guild about being allowed an Aaryonar attempt, I see no reason but to think that your guildmembers are merely imitating their leader in an attempt to justify your foolish attempt at claiming to be a 'North ToV' capable guild.<br>
<br>
And what's this bullshit about a second train?  When your coh hoor died, and no Trans did?  Could this be the exact same thing that happened when RNG was there?  HAHAHAHA.  Making up even more shit.  I remember Ringa saying &quot;Hahah.  Their mage aggro'd XXXX, and he's trying to train us with it.  Too bad we're not kos.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh well.  This thread has served its purpose.  It has made Legendary look petty, incompetent, AND ignorant.  An added bonus is that it has made your guildleader look bad, as well.  Lying to his own guild....tsk tsk tsk.   I would have NEVER expected that.  And certainly not about an issue of this significance.  Here's a new Legendary slogan:  &quot;Legendary:  A Guild on the Tribunal that got Aaryonar to enrage!&quot;  Good luck on your next Aaryonar attempt.  Because you have shown that you will need it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Arec, here's a l337 strat for you on your next Roy try:  Maybe if you bring 120 people, and have 55 linkdeaths, you'll be able to keep enough 'Key Elements' around to kill him with only 65 people.  How fucking pathetic. <br>
<br>
<br>
And finally, my leet test of moral superiority.  I already won the 'Let's see you put your money where your mouth is' test.  Now let's see how fucking mercenary is your guild?  How many of you can be bought? Let's see who is the biggest loot hoor in your guild.<br>
<br>
------------------The Temptation ------------------------<br>
I am offering 10k for logs of Legendary guild chat during their Aaryonar attempt on Wednesday.  The log must run from 2PM EST to 9PM EST on June 9th, 2002.  I will pay upon review of the log.  Contact me in game.  I will agree not to post it in a place accessible to any member of the Tribunal, and I will agree not to post your name anywhere.  The transaction will be strictly confidential.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
My time on this thread is over.  I will not be back.  Have fun talking about how you *will* get into North ToV, about how you *can* kill Roy, and about how he *will* die next time.  I'm sure you will kill him eventually.   Just like I was sure that you couldn't kill him on Wedneday.<br>
<br>
Later, and good luck to you on Roy.  Because you will need everything you can get.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------FINI --------------------------<br>
<br>
Staring at the cherry blossoms, a small sigh escapes from the lips of the Iron Chef of the Flameboard.  Spring is such a beautiful time, he thinks.  He bends down and tears a strip of silk from the clothes of his fallen foe, wondering just why it is that this person decided to seek him out and disturb his meditation.  His heart grows heavy, as the silk grows heavy with blood.  So many foes.  So many lives cut short.  The wind blows past, carrying petals from the cherry tree.  So short a time to appreciate them, he thinks as he sheathes his sword, a whisper of steel on leather, a tiny click as the tsuba contacts the top of the sheath.  A bird calls from the branches of the tree, and is answered by its mate.<br>
<br>
The Iron Chef moves away from his fallen opponent, circling the tree.  He finds a spot in the shade of the tree.  this is good, he thinks; it is past noon, and the sun will not reach me.  He removes his sword, and sits, then places it on the ground before him.  Assuming lotus, he resumes his contemplation of the cherry blossoms.  His face slowly forms a mask of tranquility as he gazes up at the beauty of the cherry blossoms, and his thoughts slowly cease to move within his mind.<br>
<br>
He has almost attained the void, when an unwelcome thought mars the stillness of his mind.  A frown mars his face. Soon, he realizes, another will come, to test my blade.   <br>
<br>
He checks to make sure his sword is within easy reach.  Good.  Good.  And he reaches out to the void again, embracing it, attempting to reach the end of the eight fold path.  Somewhere, a dog barks, disturbing the stillness, but he ignores it.  Slowly, the sun sinks, as the Chef remains motionless, his eyes fixed on the blossoms.<br>
<br>
Who is going to be the barking dog? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaeadiinswordsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeadiin Swordsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/15/02 11:32:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Re: LEGENDARY AND A BUNCH OF FAGS WHO JUMP GUILDS</span><hr size=1> &quot;Trans fucked legendary.

I was laughing at the 2 cheal chains going off at same time, which including the same clerics for different targets. (timed so 1 cleric was still in the middle of a CH for one target when called for another) I was in my 50's, not my 40's. And god i thought u guys were a waste of my time. I was watching people that werent raiding shouting things that made no sense. <br>
<br>
I lost over 3 blues of exp being battlerezzed constantly. GD i im so thankful i never joined.  Your awful showing to me made me never post again or even speak to an officer again. Im surprised you even get any people at all. I guess the promise of full set of Skyshrine armor really pulls em in huh? <br>
<br>
I think im touching on a nerve here huh? Dont like ppl taking away from your hard work do ya? Just how we felt when you killed 2 of NToV dragons after we did all the hardwork to get em. <br>
<br>
And Kalstadus (sp), if you want to work this out like adults, it sure as fuck isnt happening on the flameboard. Have ur pussy guild leader contact some officers, get a chatroom going with Leaders/officers from Transcended and Legendary, and maybe a moderator from RNG or SI or both. You can work it out there. You come here to take out your anger, not to talk it out like adults. <br>
<br>
And this thread has been beaten with a stick. It needs to die. GD, someone tally up all the times Gimp or any variation of it has been used in this thread. That wll tell you how badly this thread needs to die =P<br>

Days before the Trans/Legos Gimpdom, Connovar is told by Lilwee that they can have 2 days to kill Aary on RNG's turn. Lego's still want to &quot;practice flurry drakes&quot; on Trans's turn and end up going for named which results in this thread. <br>
<br>
A patch is up and its RNG's turn in the rotation. Connovar i guess thinks that deal with RNG is still good after everything that happened even though he talks to no-one from RNG bout it. So Legos go against Aary while its early and RNG is still gathering. Connovar told all his guildmates to lie to other people saying they were &quot;doing Wtov named&quot; instead of trying Aary. <br>
<br>
Enough said Legos. You can congratulate Connovar on probably being one of the worst leaders of any higher up guild on the Tribunal server ever. Not to mention someone who has helped earn you all the reputation of Zergendary and Gimpdom. The hate you recieve from other guilds now is very much warranted. It's not misplace distate for your guild, as has been stated here, time and time again...people have tried to talk to your leadership only to have it fail, due to your own ignorant leader.<br>

anyway...<br>
<br>
Let me get this straight, Trans trains you and you lose, what 15 minutes to rez/rebuff whatever?  So you decide it's fair to kill mobs that Trans won't get another shot at for a month?  That means the punishment exacted on Trans for their train is 2880 times the transgression.  That's pretty fucking harsh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uariarsagittar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ariar Sagittar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/15/02 1:35:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re: LEGENDARY AND A BUNCH OF FAGS WHO JUMP GUILDS</span><hr size=1> Wait a minute it took 12 hours for Transexuals to kill Aary on Sunday ?
