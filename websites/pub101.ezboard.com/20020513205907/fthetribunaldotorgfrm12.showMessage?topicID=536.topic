Sorry</span><hr size=1> I hear everyday &quot;I got trained at the exit of Maiden's Eye&quot;.  People do CR, hang out, cybor at the exit to some of these zones and wonder why mobs are there.<br>
<br>
Would be different if someone just ran a bunch of mobs to some corner of a zone or chardok/seb enterance looking to save their pathetic asses.  Their is a special spot on this board to list the accomplishments of those (Ladida trademarked title) &quot;pieces of monkey shit&quot;.<br>
<br>
People at the zone out of maidens that get upset that 15 mobs are being run by someone that can sow/selo's/summon a horse should know its coming.  I have no sympathy.  Doing a CR at zone out is lazy and just piles up more corpses.  You dont need a warning that mobs are coming, just expect it.<br>
<br>
Its not like a zone like this is new either.  Most of these people crying about being trained at a zoneout have probably never heard of Mistmoore or only seen it with people farming the zone post Kunark.  These rookies probably have not been there when 30 to 50 people were in the zone and it was a train a minute.  For people like this they had to make a zone like karnors with two enterances/exits.  I wonder if people are whining to tell people to &quot;go right&quot; at Maiden's Eye??<br>
<br>
Drag the corpses by another group (without training them).  Most are cool about it, let you med up and probably help you out.  Your group is out of the way of zone out, can med up and go back to your orginal spot.<br>

Sorry</span><hr size=1> My biggest bitch about trains is actually almost the opposite.<br>
<br>
I almost always see trains coming, regardless of whether they're shouted or not so I don't really care if they get shouted.  What I HATE is when people STOP at a group, yell at them to zone, when if they'd just zoned, the train would have lost agro and never made it to zone in the first place.<br>
<br>
If you have agro mobs, get the fuck out of the zone as quickly as you possibly can.  If you can shout, great, if not, oh well.  Just GET RID OF THAT AGRO ASAP.  EASILY 50% or more of trains never would have made it to zone if everyone who was involved would have just gotten the fuck out of dodge a little faster. <p><IMG SRC="http://users.starpower.net/dmoser/images/Kaldayr.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaeadiinswordsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeadiin Swordsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 12:15:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trainnnn...Doh that was in group still! Sorry</span><hr size=1> Worst thing is when you DO shout a train, and then get bitched out for it. I was pulling for a group in The Grey a few days ago, before they nerfed the zone to all hell and back, and picked up a band of skeles. Anyone who's been there know how these things ambush you in hordes. =x<br>
<br>
So I shout train to desert zone, and even run around for a min to widen the difference between myself and the skeles to prevent the things camping the zone line and ambushing any poor bastard who zones in.<br>
<br>
I zone into Groobash being a tard and screaming his ass off about how he died and told me to get him a rez. I have no problems with finding a rez for someone, but damn, I gave fair warning, and if you're gonna be an idiot and med at the zone, then have the common sense to get the fuck out of the way when someone says a train is coming.<br>
<br>
I go out of my way to avoid training people, but sometimes you can't help it. When that happens, I say something in ooc or shout, and then to have some asshole bitch me out because he's too stupid/lazy to MOVE from the fucking zone is too sweet. Its cumstains like this that bitch about anything they can, just for attention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatancoindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 12:41:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.yesterdayland.com/images/popopedia/shows/saturday/sa1024.jpg width=135 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trainnnn...Doh that was in group still!

But they happen.<br>
<br>
Best advice.<br>
<br>
When applicable.. (Dont conduct buisness at zone exits)<br>
<br>
Try to find a safe place in zone.<br>
<br>
Example: (The Allmighty of Train Zones: Karnors castle)<br>
<br>
Just head to the Left or right moat and do your camping, shouting for groups, and rezzes. Its safer.<br>

This only applies to zones like Maidens Eye that are outdoor areas...<br>
<br>
If you are hauling ass for the zone and come upon a group in the middle of the zone...dont run through them...<br>
<br>
This happened to me twice by 2 different groups the other day.  There are no mobs around me except the 1 or 2 we are fighting and some group dragging 3 or 4 mobs run right through the middle of us.

Typically skeletons, bats and worms.  often if a group is running through the zone they don't know they have the stuff on them because it spawns and then takes a second to start running after you.<br>
<br>
Then again some people are just idiots  : P<br>

Also, what's with the trains in fungus grove lately?  They made spawn time 3x as long and now there are 3x as many trains in there.  People running around without invis or something?

Sorry</span><hr size=1> Groobash, I'm talking about the shitty way you talked to me when you asked me for a rez, and then later in ooc when you bitched about how people had been training *you* all day.<br>
<br>
tip #1, if you're gonna ask someone for a rez, do it nicely, they might not always comply if they're talked to like crap.<br>
<br>
I was grouped with a mage at the time and was pulling 2 mobs at a time. I went out, grabbed a golem, started looking for another, and BAM got hit with a mob of skeles, quickly becoming the grey's trademark. I shouted then that I had a train headed to scarlet desert, and then proceeded to widen the distance between myself and the mobs so they didn't land at the zoneline and ambush some poor bastard zoning in. I zone into you being an asshole about it.<br>
<br>
Contrary to popular belief, I don't go around training people for the hell of it. I was about to say something to you regarding how you were talking to me, but I bit my lip and asked a friend if he could rez you. then you complained about it only being a 49 rez. Again, I bit my lip and zoned in to drag.<br>
<br>
Next, regarding the comments in ooc. As everyone else has pointed out in this thread, don't sit your fucking ass at the zoneline and expect people to die to prevent training you. If you're gonna be stupid enough to fight there, then use some common sense when someone gives a warning. Zonelines are bad places to set up camp, and if you would've had enough brains to fill a thimble, you would have moved to one side or the other of the zone wall. But that would be too easy, because as far as I've seen in game and on the boards, you'll bitch about something just to bitch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=536.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=536.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=536.topic&start=61&stop=66>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=536.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=536.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=536.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=536.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=536.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=536.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm33">Spell Traders<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm2">Admin Stuff<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://tribunal.windsofstorm.net/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
