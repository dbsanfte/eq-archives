<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Defining politics through cows...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people into office who put a tax on your cows, forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for then take the tax money, buy a cow and give it to your neighbor. You feel righteous. Barbara Streisand sings for you.<br>
<br>
SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. You form a cooperative to tell him how to manage his cow.<br>
<br>
REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. So?<br>
<br>
COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with milk. You wait in line for hours to get it. It is expensive and sour.<br>
<br>
CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.<br>
<br>
DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The government taxes you<br>
to the point you have to sell both of them to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.<br>
<br>
BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The government takes<br>
them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the drain.<br>
<br>
AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell one, lease it back to<br>
yourself and do an IPO on the 2nd one. You force the 2 cows to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when one cow drops dead. You spin an announcement to the analysts stating you have downsized and are reducing expenses. Your stock goes up.<br>
<br>
FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on strike because you<br>
want three cows. You go to lunch. Life is good.<br>
<br>
JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign them so they are<br>
one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. They learn to travel on unbelievably crowded trains. Most are at the top of their class at cow school.<br>
<br>
GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You reengineer them so they are<br>
all blond, drink lots of beer, give excellent quality milk, and run a hundred miles an hour. Unfortunately they also demand 13 weeks of vacation per year.<br>
<br>
ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows but you don't know where they are. While ambling around, you see a beautiful woman. You break for lunch. Life is good.<br>
<br>
RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You have some more vodka. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka. You produce your 10th, 5-year plan in the last 3 months. The Mafia shows up and takes over however many cows you really have.<br>
<br>
POLISH CORPORATION: You have two bulls. Employees are regularly maimed and killed attempting to milk them.<br>
<br>
FLORIDA CORPORATION: You have a black cow and a brown cow. Everyone votes for the best looking one. Some of the people who like the brown one best vote for the black one. Some people vote for both. Some people vote for neither. Some people can't figure out how to vote at all. Finally, a bunch of guys from out-of-state tell you which is the best looking one.<br>
<br>
TALIBAN CORPORATION: You have all the cows in Afghanistan, which is two. You don't milk them because you cannot touch any creature's private parts. At night when no one is looking, you have sex with both of them. Then you kill them and claim a US bomb blew them up while they were in the hospital. <br>
<br>
FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both and sells you the milk. You join the underground and start a campaign of sabotage which ultimately blows up the cows. <br>
<br>
SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others. If they give milk, you tell no one.<br>
<br>
BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon you have 1000 cows. You expropriate them.The American corporation goes Chapter 11. <br>
<br>
INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship them.<br>
<br>
CHINESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You have 300 people milking them. You claim full employment, high bovine productivity, and arrest the newsman who reported on them.<br>
<br>
ISRAELI CORPORATION: There are these two Jewish cows, right? They open a milk factory, an ice cream store, and then sell the movie rights. They send their calves to Harvard to become doctors. So, who needs people?<br>
<br>
ARKANSAS CORPORATION: You have two cows. That one on the left is kinda cute.<br>
<br>
TALIBAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You turn them loose in the Afghan &quot;countryside&quot; and they both die. You blame the godless American infidels.<br>
<br>
A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, <br>
but you're not sure where they are or what they look like. You decide you'll look for them tomorrow and take a nap.<br>
<br>
FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.<br>
<br>
PURE COMMUNISM: You share two cows with your neighbors. You and your neighbors bicker about who has the most &quot;ability&quot; and who has the most &quot;need&quot;. Meanwhile, no one works, no one gets any milk, and the cows drop dead of starvation.<br>
<br>
RUSSIAN COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the government takes all the milk. You steal back as much milk as you can and sell it on the black market.<br>
<br>
DICTATORSHIP: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you.<br>
<br>
PURE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. Your neighbors decide who gets the milk.<br>
<br>
REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.<br>
<br>
BUREAUCRACY: You have two cows. At first the government regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not to milk them. Then it takes both, shoots one, milks the other and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.<br>
<br>
SURREALISM: You have two giraffes. The government requires you to take harmonica lessons<br>
<br>
OLYMPICS-ISM: You have two cows, one American, one Chinese. With the help of trilling violins and state of the art montage photography, John Tesh narrates the moving tale of how the American cow overcame the agony of growing up in a suburb with (gasp) divorced parents, then mentions in passing that the Chinese cow was beaten every day by a tyrannical farmer and watched its parents butchered before its eyes. The American cow wins the competition, severely spraining an udder in a gritty performance, and gets a multi-million dollar contract to endorse Wheaties. The Chinese cow is led out of the arena and shot by Chinese government officials, though no one ever hears about it. McDonald's buys the meat and serves it hot and fast at its Beijing restaurant.<br>
<br>
BRITISH DEMOCRACY: You have 2 cows. You feed them sheep's brains and they go mad. The government doesn't do anything.<br>
<br>
ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters <br>
 of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary  to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder  who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option to own one more<br>
<br>
PURE ANARCHY: You have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair price or your neighbors try to take the cows and kill you. <br>
<br>
CAPITALISM: You don't have any cows. The bank will not lend you money to buy cows, because you don't have any cows to put up as collateral.<br>
<br>
CAMBODIAN COMMUNISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and shoots you.<br>
<br>
PERESTROIKA: You have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the Mafia takes all the milk. You steal back as much milk as you can and sell it on the &quot;free&quot; market.<br>
<br>
ENVIRONMENTALISM: You have 2 cows. The government bans you from milking or killing them. <br>
<br>
FEMINISM: You have 2 cows. They get married and adopt a veal calf. <br>
<br>
TOTALITARIANISM: Your have 2 cows. The government takes them and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned. <br>
<br>
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: You are associated with (the concept of &quot;ownership&quot; is a symbol of the phallo-centric, war-mongerism, intolerant past) 2 differently aged (but no less valuable to society) bovines of unpecified gender. <br>
<br>
COUNTER CULTURE: Wow, dude, there's like ... these 2 cows, man. You got to have some of this milk!  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
