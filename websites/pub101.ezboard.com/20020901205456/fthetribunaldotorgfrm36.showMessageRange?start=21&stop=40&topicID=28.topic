PRIOR to the purge. 1941 was AFTER the purges had gutted the army. Learn to read. And read up on the history. In the early 30's just before the purges in the army began the Soviet army was the envy of many INCLUDING the germans. Who adapted many of the things they saw. <br>

Care to mention some of these things that they adopted?  I am really curious.<br>

Before the purges the Soviet Army's order of battle very much resembled what the Germans would later use. Mass tank formations, Aiborne units, combined arms. etc. You are selling the Sovirts short. It was there competency AND the loyalty of the soldiers to the generals that made them such a threat to Stalin. Once the purges were under way the army reverted to a far more conventional set up.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Its the other way around.  The order of battle of the German Army was essentially their invention.  Later on the U.S. Army adopted it for their own use and as far as I know they still use it.<br>
<br>
Soldiers were loyal to Stalin first, then their generals.  Stalin may have had a different view on this, I dont think he ever realized the amount of influence that he exerted on the average &quot;G.I. Ivan&quot;<br>
<br>

At the begining of the war the Russians had perhaps the beast tank in the world at the time, the T-34 It could run circles around the german tanks and was very hard to kill. But with the officer corp gutted they no longer had the men who knew how to implement them. Those purges while securing Stalins personal power nearly cost his country the war.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, yes.  The problem was that the quantities of the T-34 were so small, that their full potential was not utilized until the Jan. '42 counterattack at Moscow where the Siberian divisions actually had them in quantities where they wouldn't have to be used piecemeal as infantry support vehicles.  Although, Soviets had the biggest tank park in 1941(~ 20,000) most of them were light tanks and recon vehicles.  Not many of them were suited to do combat against Mark III or Mark IV.<br>

As to Stalin's thoughts. Yes he THOUGHT he was going to be ousted this comes from both advisors and the few confidants he didn't turn on. But he did not realize just how successful his purges had been. There was no one to take his place. It is all that saved him. <br>

Not too familiar with this.  Looks like I got homework to do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Also the only reason there was NOT mass upheavals during the war was because the germans treated the people in the conquered territories if it was even possible worse than Stalin had done. There was nothing to be gained by them turning on Stalin. <br>

Excellent point.  One that I unintentionally overlooked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Oh and one last thing. Are you telling me that the first 6 months of the war that saw the army collapse and the germans knocking on the gates of Moscow and Leningrad were the best they had shown? Who is smoking the crack?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It was an utterly pathetic show.  But compared to the military disasters they endured in the half a century prior to 1941, it was still some of the best Soviet resistance seen up to that point.  That was my point.  No matter how pathetic it seemed, it was still better than the utter and complete failures during WW I and Russo-Japanese War.<br>
<br>
During the WW II, I can only think of only one other time where they performed as poorly as they did in the first 6 months of the war: the Summer of '42.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Even with the non-aggression pact. There was no love lost between the Soviets and Germans. The Pact was seen by both sides as simply a device to buy time. The surprise was how soon the pact was broken.<br>

<br>
Yeah, but I think Stalin figured that wouldn't happen until the Germans beat Great Britain (read at least until 43, perhaps, if at all) which would have taken several years since at the time, the Germans still fully believed in Operation: Sea Lion.<br>

<br>
First, I think you're wrong.  But you already expected that response from me.  Second, I think you are naive, although you accuse me of the same thing.  Third, I come from a completely different background and have a completely different perception of life.  You speak of lack of life experience, I can assure you I have plenty.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I laugh at you because your country, the country that you so dearly love and support is snuffing out dozens of these innocent souls per day.  If you treasure them so much, when will you stop killing them?<br>
<br>
You say that I adore the inhumane, that I have sociopathic qualities, a god complex, that my mind is &quot;hellbound on a path that has already been trodden by the vile and sadistic souls of this earth&quot;.  <br>
<br>
If you think that I defend evil because I enjoy it, because I enjoy watching people suffer and because I wallow with glee in misery of others, you are mistaken.<br>
<br>
You see, we as human beings have a natural fascination with human suffering, or human embarassment.  I've seen my share of human suffering, you know, people being shot in the streets, beaten to a bloody pulp, etc.  Whereas, you find human suffering to be abhorrent and an anomaly, I find it to be typical and normal.  Its not something that is necessarily just, but it always exists and has to exist for affirmation of life.  <br>
What I am able to do unlike you is embrace it.  I can embrace &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;imperfection&quot; without becoming identified or dominated by it.  If I say &quot;yes&quot; to a single instant of life, I say &quot;yes&quot; to all existence -  it is the love of fate, the affirmation of the entire circle of life and the ability to embrace all evils which are being denounced by others like you.  The acceptance of all the evils of life, for which you call me inhumane, sociopath, etc. is simply the understanding that is what life is all about.  It is adopting a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> tragic</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> posture towards life wherein even the deepest suffering(and the most exuberant joys) are affirmed, embraced, vindicated and redeemed.<br>

<br>
You teem with disgust at all we uphold here. Why then, do you stay?  Your support, or your admiration rather, of dictatorships is reprehensible.  I know nothing of your backround nor do I want to.  However, whatever your reasons for being here, you are taking advantage of part of what makes this country great, and I would hope that you recognize that on some level.<br>
<br>
I must say with what I can gleen from your views, in those posts I do peruse, I am thankful you are too busy playing EQ and posting here to ever be some sort of activist who can impact something on a larger scale.  Your contradictions in opinion are fearsome.  You seem to love to rip apart American policy and historical events as if we are the greatest of all evils.  ALL countries have done evils to justify some end for the benefit of their people.  We have all disagreed, at some point, with some facet of policy, but we forge forward in hopes that the good we do outweighs the evils that have occured.<br>
<br>
I do not think anyone here purports that America is perfect. I do however find it ill mannered that you come here and scoff at our faith and pride in the country we call home. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ualajan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alajan</A> at: 11/20/01 9:30:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 1651<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/20/01 11:01:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 40% of British Muslims polled support bin Laden...</span><hr size=1> I think, if the opportunity presented itself, Merton could extol the virtues of the USA as well.  This simply happens to be a time when the negative side of things presented itself.<br>
<br>
Merton, I'd honestly like to hear your opinions on some things such as US Freedom of Speech policies, our aid to countries that we have no interest in monitarily or resource-wise, our encouragement of artistic pursuits, our medical and technical research advances (I know we are not always at the forefront but we do our part), our attempts to mend ties with the former Soviet Union (sure, there are some strategic interests there, but there is also some altruistic interest in being good neighbors) after the cold war, and the thing I love above them all, the mulit-racial and multi-cultural mix of people here who all call themselves Americans, while strained at times, has been an example to all other countries dealing with ethnic dividing lines and the problems that lie there.<br>
<br>
I've listened with an open mind.  I've agreed with some of your opinions and ideas and I've disagreed with others.  At any rate you usually discuss them with the demeanor of a scholar who is willing to discuss a subject without hostility(provided the other party is provoking.. can we just sew Kricket's lips shut?) which I can appreciate. <p><CENTER>
