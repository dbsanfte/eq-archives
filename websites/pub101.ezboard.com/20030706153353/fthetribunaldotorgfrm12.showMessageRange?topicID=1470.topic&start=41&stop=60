He was pissed off when he sent a charmed thing after a MOB I was root dotting in tactics broke charm at like 10% health on the MOB and he didnt get the kill.  To his credit he *thought* he engaged it first, as when he sent his pet all I had done was rooted and snared it.  No way for him to tell really.  But he flipped out like a baby after I got the kill and ran around shouting about how he was so violated.<br>
<br>
It dropped BOAR MEAT.  Get a grip ya moron.<br>
<br>
Castsonu I believe has me confused with Podaman, or thinks Podman is in SI or something.  This was a long time ago, but my group zoned into POV, and moved to one of the sides of the castle without people on it.  There were corpses on the ramp going up and inside the castle.  So we set up there and pulled some stuff and after a few kills we were told &quot;ummm... this is camped.&quot;  His group had been on CR after a wipeout and were waiting for the corpses to appear in the graveyard or something.  When we didn't move, he trained my group, and 2 other groups in the area.  So when he says podawhatever or something, he means Rynnia.  Such is the madness that spews forth from his mouth.<br>
<br>
Castsonu is incoherent when upset, or when calm.  Can't make heads or tails of what he says.  Frustrating to deal with, and an asshole with a fucked up sense of the &quot;rules&quot; of the game.  If he's waiting for his corpse in the graveyard, don't move to &quot;HIS&quot; camp or he will train you or threaten to petition.<br>
<br>
The problem with the named is their regen rate.  2 Enchanters could not kill 1 named.  It would take 2 Enchanters and a cleric.  2 Pets is not enough, it just negates the problems of charm breaking, but does not negate the DPS put out by the main monster on the pet.<br>
<br>
Speaking with a GM Admin, bind rushing the monster to exploit the low regeneration rate is ... well, considered exploiting, and is warnable or bannable depending on the GM you get and their mood.  Some GMs may even let it slide as &quot;it will be fixed soon.&quot; (the regen rate)  The problem is not the charm.  Warrior, rogue, cleric, druid can kill one of the named.  No reason a couple enchanters, a cleric and a druid shouldn't be able to.<br>
<br>
A good enchanter has always been able to solo at fairly high risk.  It has been that way since EQ was first released.  The problem now is the fucking morons such as Arcibu who pull stunts like he is doing and ruining other people's fun through exploitation.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to bet that next patch, those named regen full shortly after deaggro.  That will solve 99% of the enchanters soloing them.  Might deter even 90% of the enchanters with a hotboxed cleric (considering if charm wears off in the middle of that fight, the cleric AND enchanter die and probably have a much longer recoup time to try again, at which point the thing will have regenned full).   Might not stop 2 enchanters and a cleric or something, but that's gonna be a rare find.<br>
<br>
Your best bet in dealing with scum such as Arcibu, is if he is in the same zone as you, turn other's spells on, and be ready to use the /report feature if trained, or if something is dispelled on you, etc.  GMs are well aware of this moron, and the greater nuisance Arcibu becomes to the server, and the more petitions and reports that are sent in, the more likely they are to act on the situation if not only to get the mess cleaned out from the queue.<br>

<br>
<br>
The method enchanters use for killing these named involves dying and or zoning repeatedly over several charms.  A single charm cannot last VS the named, and the named summons, thus they bind at zone and either zone before the pet dies, or if the charm wears off they get summoned and die and run back up again.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you die, or if you zone and lose all aggression on a monster, you LOSE your &quot;claim&quot; to it regardless of if it has regenned full yet because of your exploiting.  This means that if you knock it down to 20% over 3 or 4 charms and deaths or zonings, and zone back in to find another group or enchanter or anyone engaged with the named, you do not have the right to:<br>
<br>
train that person or group<br>
dispel their slows or charms<br>
charm, haste and root something next to them and invising to break it so they have a hasted giant on them<br>
<br>
etc. etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=podamandv>PodamanDV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/7/03 2:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Nah he doesn't have us confused, he just thinks I'm in SI for some reason.  Prolly because prior to Arcibu learning this little exploit (gg Safehouse...) SI pretty much had the names in BoT locked down.  SI however does it legitimately and while they may happily take a named after another group wipes I've never seen them leapfrog to do it.  Castsonu is just pissed because one night his group was leapfrogging us and we pulled the named and killed it anyway.  We weren't even there for the named really, we were heading into the towers to do a tower boss but the named was up and in the way so we killed it.<br>
<br>
GM's finaly caught up w/ Arcibu btw... from what I hear his account is flagged and one more warning earns a ban, so if you see him doing it, by all means petition.<br>
<br>
On a side note... CoD is insanely overpowered, making manaburn look like a good idea in comparison.  There's no doubt that it will be nerfed eventualy.  In the meantime the way BoT is setup screams for a second look because even without CoD the potential for leapfrogging and training is just too tempting.  One or more of the following should happen: Make more giants in BoT see invis, take the loot off of the lower bosses and put it on lvl 65 names in the towers, flag the giants that spawn near the bosses uncharmable. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/sapphirez/images/poda-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yvil>yvil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/7/03 6:07 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ghost.3drealm.net/webshare/sigs/crazy-head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Regardless of the situation, you never have the &quot;right&quot; to do any of the following:<br>

Camp competition started in North Ro over the dervs and has yet to find a peaceful resolution.  Why is this so difficult.  If you can't hold the area you don't get the named.  Dying perhaps should require more time out of the game perhaps, to eliminate the willingness to die so easily.  Perhaps if you died and had say, 10 minutes of sitting at  your bind point with &quot;death effects&quot;, no spell memming, no interaction with mobs, etc. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76272" target="top">Yvil</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Bullshit<br>
<br>
While Casts seemed to lack the tact at the time (we've all lost our temper when people act like asses), <br>
It was YOU who leapfrogged US Podaman.<br>
<br>
Our xp group was camping named in that tower for a good 2 hours before Dork Virtue started zoning in...we even politely said in /ooc that that wing was camped before you even had to do a Camp Check.  Someone from DarkVagina told a member of our group that they were just passing through, then the zone crashed.  While we were waiting on our shaman to log in to head back into the wing you guys started forming right there again...you saw us...you knew we were camping that wing.<br>
<br>
We both started heading up at the same time from the best i could gather during the various battles going on around us.<br>
<br>
We got up there invis while DV was seemingly clearing thier way to the tower, we killed all the guards in his room while your monk watched...as soon as it was clear he pulled it right from under our noses...<br>
<br>
you even had the gall to call his loot in /ooc after you stole it from US.<br>
<br>
do us all a favor and put that warrior back on Ebay where he belongs and go buy an enchanter if you wanna fuck people over...at least then you can do it without having to drag other's names through your shit trail. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1549<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/7/03 12:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arcibu GREEDiness GETS you NOWHERE!</span><hr size=1> blah, that deserves it's own thread.

You claimed yourself to go invis PAST DV to steal the camp or did i miss something?<br>
<br>
Rynnia, <br>
<br>
Yes I was pissed at the time you stole a mob I felt I engaged 1st...I was the only one in zone for 3.5 hours and only noticed you after I didnt get the &quot;you have gained experience&quot; message. So I can admit it is possible you rooted it after coming into zone when I didnt notice, as I keep other players spell effects on. Racknar had to FD after our healer went LD on the 1st pull and when we re-engaged mob you could have rooted b4 my pet attacked. I know for a fact that the original pull Racknar, Ros, And myself were the only 3 in zone.<br>
