<br>
I really have no idea what it is, but seems to me that ppl are misguided on how long those guys are down there for or something. The majority of the ones that were down there in the beginning are long gone now. New ones come in all the time, and others get released and leave. Yeah, the ones that said &quot;I'm not leaving here without killing an American&quot; are still there, but the majority of them dont stay there as long as they would if they had to go through court procedures.<br>

From what I've seen they wouldn't stand to gain anything by being POWs anyway, mostly because they have no country to demand them back or whatever. Everyone wants to bitch about it but noone wants to touch them with a 10 ft. pole, including Afghanistan.<br>

Bush correctly acknowledged that the Geneva Conventions apply to the conflict in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said today. But he erred in deciding that the Conventions do not cover al-Qaeda detainees and by categorically ruling out prisoner of war status for Taliban detainees without convening a competent tribunal, as the Geneva Conventions require.<br>
<br>
The Geneva Conventions should apply to both Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees being held by U.S. forces at Guantanamo and in Afghanistan, even if ultimately the al-Qaeda fighters would likely not be accorded POW status, Human Rights Watch said. The Conventions provide explicit protections to all combatants captured in an international armed conflict, even if they are deemed to be unprivileged combatants not entitled to POW status. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Administration is right to acknowledge that it has to play by the rules, but it can't then rewrite the rules to suit its purposes,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;What makes this decision hard to understand is that the Geneva Conventions don't prevent the United States from interrogating or prosecuting detainees.&quot; <br>
<br>
Unlike the al-Qaeda fighters, detainees who fought for the Taliban probably should be accorded POW status because they fought for the armed forces of a party to the Convention, whether or not their government was recognized and whether or not their fighters respected the laws of war. The United States has traditionally accorded POW status to captured combatants fighting for enemy powers in either circumstance. <br>
<br>
&quot;This decision puts soldiers around the world at risk,&quot; said Roth, &quot;especially U.S. troops who<br>

This is the view of other realists in the Pentagon and administration, some US allies, and the vast majority of international law and human rights groups. <br>
But the question goes far beyond the treatment of individual detainees. Rather, it sets the stage for how, in a violent world, the rules of war are established for everyone. For almost 100 years, the Geneva and Hague Conventions have provided a framework that protects combatants. The United States has always argued for a broad reading of these conventions regarding POWs, both to set an example and to ensure fair treatment of its own soldiers when captured.<br>
<br>
Regarding the detainees at the American naval base in Guantánamo, Cuba, the US is currently violating its own Army regulations as well as the Geneva Convention, namely in the way the prisoners are housed (in open-air cages with roofs).<br>
<br>
US Army rules reflect the convention and require that all persons taken into custody by US forces during a conflict be treated as prisoners of war, &quot;until some other status is determined by a competent tribunal.&quot; This means that all combatants - Taliban, Al Qaeda, and others - captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan must be treated at first as POWs until their status can be decided by a competent tribunal.<br>
<br>
These fighters won't necessarily receive POW status. Some people have argued that Al Qaeda fighters may not qualify as POWs if they did not wear distinctive marks identifying them or obey the laws of war; others have argued similarly about the Taliban. But the facts are not established, which is why US Army regulations require a &quot;competent tribunal&quot; to judge each individual case fairly.<br>
<br>
We must also remember that POW status hardly protects captured fighters from prosecution: POWs can be charged with war crimes.<br>
<br>
They can also be interrogated, cajoled, and questioned - they just cannot be coerced or tortured. The Geneva Convention does allow POWs to limit their responses to name, rank, and serial number. Yet over the years many POWs, questioned under the framework of the convention, have provided much more information.<br>
<br>
Finally, treating prisoners initially as POWs does not mean the United States abandons security concerns. Under the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war may not be abused, starved, left out in the elements, or with their wounds untreated. But they are subject to measures that keep them securely captive, under lock and key.<br>
<br>
The reasons for complying with Army regulations and the Geneva Convention are clear: The US has an immediate and long-term interest in upholding international conventions that establish universal rules of war and regulate the treatment of POWS.<br>
<br>
Even as Washington politicians bluster, our own soldiers live with the threat of capture. They, like all other combatants, deserve the protection of the Geneva Convention.<br>
<br>
The United States also has an interest in not alienating its battlefield allies by high-handed, unilateral decisionmaking and selective compliance with the law. If the rules of war can be abrogated at any moment on the whim of the secretary of Defense - even over the objections of the secretary of State - our ability to form solid and lasting alliances will be gravely undercut.<br>

<br>
A few months ago, after illegally holding them for a year, the USA sent a group of these prisoners back to Afghanistan. Why? They couldn't find any reason why these people were being held in the first place. They just shipped them home and dumped them, minus a year of their lives, with their lives scarred and in ruin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you very much, innocent people whose rights we have abused, you can go now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you rely 100% on your military to be holding guilty people now? I imagine they have plenty of guilty people, but surely there are some more about whom they're not sure? Why do you accept the ruining of innocent lives by your country?<br>
<br>
This is why Guantanamo is an abuse of international law. It is also a big, fat licence for every right-wing dictator around the world to follow the US example. People in many troubled countries will suffer or die in the future because of this example. Your government has let us all down by being unable to follow its own standards.<br>
<br>
By definition, &quot;illegal&quot; means breaking a law. They are accused of being &quot;illegal combatants&quot;. Therefore it has to be determined by some accepted legal process whether they are guilty. <p>--<br>

Once a war has started I am very much on the right because all that matters then is survival. That is why I am so hesitant to engage, because once you start there is no doing it halfway without fucking it up. Once war starts it's all the way - you do whatever it takes. <p><br>
