<br>
Christians pick and choose out of the Bible.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old Mosaic law applied to the Ancient Israelites for whom it was written.  Its role in the modern day Bible is as history, like all the rest of the material in the books surrounding it.  This is a very basic and easily grasped concept.  Christians do not live by the Mosaic law because its function is to teach us what God's will for the ancient Israelites was, and for us to learn from it.  We have an updated version, so to speak, in the New Testament that, while it does not invalidate the Old Testament, supercedes it... that is why Christians do not offer burnt offerings like Israelites do to this day, even though it is written in the Old Testament as a very definite command.  So you ask, how do you know which is which?  Most of us don't, and that is why it is critical to have an insightful, intelligent pastor/teacher who can make the call.  Of course, each person will have their own individual interpretation, it has always been so in the history of all religions, but my explanation is the generally accepted one.  Feel better now, Boinshar?<br>
<br>
Of course people, being imperfect, are going to obey parts of the Bible and not others.  People will pick and choose those passages they prefer and ignore those that they don't - case in point -  many &quot;Gay Christians&quot;.  Many of them will defend to their last breath the notion that the Christian God has absolutely nothing against homosexuality, when there is an overwhelming amount of Biblical evidence this belief is false.  The fallibility of humans is no excuse to invalidate the Bible, however.<br>

I think if you believe that your God will send a loving gay couple to eternal torment in Hell, I certainly don't want to be a part of that religion.  For the same reason I would never want to be a part of a religion which feels it's ok to murder doctors who perform abortions.<br>
<br>
I am a Christian, and churches and pastors go out of their way to quote anything they can in the Bible to get you to do what they want or to get your money.<br>
<br>
There are only two things that Jesus said in New Testament that truly matter as to how you live your life: &quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart&quot;, and &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.'<br>

If a Christian decides, for whatever reason, to get it on with another guy (or girl), then he's still going to Heaven regardless.  Note that this is a Protestant belief - I'm not really sure what the Catholic/Anglican position is.  However, we (Protestants in general) believe that once you accept Jesus and truly believe, then nothing can ever separate you from that moment.  Lapses, evil deeds, nothing... it's all paid for.  So no, being gay won't damn you to Hell for eternity.  Having gay sex would just be one more in a long list of all the sins that everyone has committed, any and all of which are sufficient to damn you, except for Jesus' intervention.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's not quite that simple.  Then you get to the popular theory of &quot;Ok, I'll say the words and talk to a preacher for an hour, then go do whatever the hell I want, because I'm set!  I can't lose my ticket to Heaven!&quot;  Well... no.  Because if you think like this, you don't really believe in Jesus and everything he teaches and stands for, because if you did then you would actually care about His word, his commands, etc.  Therefore, having gay sex might be a lapse... like adultery would for a straight person... everyone is tempted, some by different things.  Everyone gives in to temptation occasionally.  But someone who convinces themselves that being gay and continually having gay sex is OK with God and consistent with being a Christian is fooling themself terribly.  Whether they are truly a Christian or not, only they know... odds are, they aren't, because someone who truly is would care about the issue enough to find out what God's will is, and then follow it.<br>
<br>
The issue is much deeper than most people here seem to think.  Can a gay person be a Christian?  Certainly... but if they were *truly* a Christian, with heartfelt honest belief in Jesus and the Bible, then rather than attempting to justifying themselves, they would do their best to repress the homosexual urges they feel, and not act upon them.  The same way that a straight Christian would attempt to block out thoughts of adultery and hopefully not act on them.<br>
<br>
The base issue is that of true, heartfelt belief.  The problem - how to detect such belief?  How do you know it is present?  Answer:  Actions. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

Many do.  Don't go there.  Don't give them money.  I despise them.  It is very important to find a good, honest, pastor who knows what he's talking about.  They're hard to find, but when you do, you'll learn a lot.  Money shouldn't be mentioned at all in public services, at least not the issue of money being given to the church holding the service.  Nothing wrong with advertising charities etc.<br>
<br>
I don't think you'll find a lot of Christians who know what they're talking about that will honestly and firmly support murdering doctors to stop abortion.  That's a big stretch - you might as well claim that all Christians are gun toting wackos because of what David Koresh and his cult believed.  That's about like saying that all Muslims are evil terrorists because of what Al Qaeda did. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

<br>
It's not a loving gay couple that is a sin, but the sex they engage in. Just as is pre-marital sex in a heterosexual couple. No difference in the bible there, a sin is a sin. As far as the abortion thing, is there actually a religion out there that condones the murdering of anyone? I wouldn't subscribe to a religion that condones abortion either, would you?<br>

<br>
Homosexuality may be a sin according to the Old Testament, but then again so is looking at anyone with a 'lustful' eye. Or for that matter, not being a virgin at the time of your wedding.<br>
<br>
I think too many Christians buy into the hype and hysteria of TBN and what their pastors say. People have been raised not to think or try to make their own judgment calls on their faith. If Pastor Rod says homosexuality is wrong, by darn it has to be!! <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you have read the same Bible I did, but Jesus loved everyone. He went against society to pour out his love for prostitutes, for tax collectors, for the sick and lame. He pointed out what was wrong with the greed, oppression and hypocrisy in the Temple. The Pharisees hated him for his radical beliefs.<br>
<br>
The same thing exists today. Churchs are monster tax free corporations more concerned with gathering money from their 'flock' than actually doing things that matter. I would rather go downtown and give my money to a random bum than shell out money to a church because all its going to do is help pay for new drapes or choir robes. Look at your Church. Question what they are doing.<br>
<br>
As a Christian, your faith should come from within and your relationship with Christ.  <p><p><center>

Like listening to your self-righteous nonsense? Time to get off that high horse, I think your nose is starting to bleed. Although, it's nice to see that you have the whole history of mankind, religion and history figured out. What an extremely naive and simplistic view of the world you have. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

I think too many Christians buy into the hype and hysteria of TBN and what their pastors say. People have been raised not to think or try to make their own judgment calls on their faith. If Pastor Rod says homosexuality is wrong, by darn it has to be!! <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you have read the same Bible I did, but Jesus loved everyone. He went against society to pour out his love for prostitutes, for tax collectors, for the sick and lame. He pointed out what was wrong with the greed, oppression and hypocrisy in the Temple. The Pharisees hated him for his radical beliefs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Homosexuality is a sin according to the New Testament, too.  Passages are easy to find, check any concordance.<br>
<br>
TBN is good for about 5 minutes of comedy once a week, past that I become physically ill.<br>
<br>
&quot;If Pastor Rod says homosexuality is wrong, by darn it has to be!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Pastor Rod is human, and given the context he's probably another one of those money grubbing pustules on the ass of Christianity, too.  If he says its wrong, you take it with a grain of salt while quickly making your way to the exit of his overly decorated and funded church.  On the other hand, if he can supply a clear Biblical backing, then it's wrong just like he says.<br>
<br>
Pastors who are hysterical should be avoided.  Like I said... look around, find someone who will teach, someone who knows Greek and Hebrew, who will interpret wisely and explain what the writer of a particular passage is saying.  Find someone who teaches from the Bible, and backs up every word of his sermons with solid, contextual Biblical references.  Nothing wrong with making your own judgement calls either, but much of the time the Bible is simply far too esoteric for the average person to sit down, read, and fully understand.  <br>
<br>
&quot;He went against society to pour out his love for prostitutes, for tax collectors, for the sick and lame.&quot;<br>
<br>
He certainly did.  He does love everyone, including gay people.  I fail to see the point that this makes in the argument.  Jesus was not legalistic, in the sense that many people take it... he would reach out to prostitutes, sinners.  That's great!  We should do the same.  However, if we love the Lord our God with all our heart as you say, we will also be conscious of what displeases Him, and attempt to avoid those things.  That is, avoid taking those actions ourselves.  It is not our place to judge others actions, we just take care of our own.  What someone else does with another consenting adult is between those two adults and God.  Now if they do it in public, or come shoving their flaming ass in my face, I'll get pissed... but that has more to do with simple good manners than morality. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

<br>
Rokkr - I am actually quite familiar with Lincoln's position on slavery, as well as how the issue played out during the Civil War.  He stated that he believed it was a moral evil, but a political necessity and necessary evil before the Civil War.  During, he used it as a weapon against the South.  These were common views of Northerners of the time, the Abolitionists were actually a minority.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get a grip religious folks, you believe what mom, dad and the good reverend at church told you because you've been assaulted with it since birth.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are correct.  I have been taught for a long time, since I was very little, many of these things.  If I had been born in Syria, I would be a Muslim.  I would also be wrong.  Of course, I would be convinced I was right... the world is a funny place.  But this relativism means nothing except that people believe different things.<br>
<br>
Questioning and thinking for yourself is great - I do it to, believe it or not.  I just happen to come to the same conclusions I was taught.  I'm not a sheep, and I'm not a moron.  You seem to arrogantly believe that everyone who follows a religion has been simply hoodwinked and would snap out of it with a little introspective, analytical thought.  Is it so hard to understand that people really, actually, buy it, even if you don't? <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

However, unfortunately it also illustrates how much the Christian religion had changed over the years.<br>
<br>
Of course now that the majority of those of the Christian faith follow the New Testiment (not to the letter, will get into that later) because over the last two thousand years, the human society have, shall we say, out grown, the simple idealistics of the Old Testiment. In fact, many today would argue many things listed under the Old Testiment were in fact barbaric.<br>
<br>
Interesting notion, eh? Part of the Bible, a holy text of a religion, is considered barbaric. I would go into detail, but I'm sure many before me have found some things said in the Old Testiment hard to swollow as a civilized person. The point of the matter is, the human society developed, both in understanding of the world around them, and in understanding of each other. As a result, new laws, and new expectations must be created in order to keep up with our expasion of thought. Hence the reason why the New Testiment was the &quot;rule book&quot; since, say, the 12th century.<br>
<br>
Now that we are in the 21st century, the inadiquisies of the New Testiment have long since became apparent. It no longer fit our lifestyle, and our way of thinking, to blindly follow a preacher and his interpretation of a book. Instead, in our society we encourage free thinking, to interpret what we ready by our own understanding, which, the human ego dictates as vastly superior to many around us.<br>
<br>
The Age of Reason have come and past. Today is an age of, I donno, Individuality? We all read the &quot;holy texts&quot; and come up with our own interpretations, deciding whether we want to follow, and what we don't want to follow. In fact, we point our fingers and laugh at those religions whom the clergy withold all power of interpretation. (The current middle eastern crisis comes to mind) We have out grown the &quot;laws&quot; and &quot;rules&quot; in the Old Testiment almost entirely.  We are almost to the point of out growing the New Testiment, as evident by the more and more abstract interpretations of the Bible you hear from clergy today.<br>
<br>
By reading, and interpreting the Bible, or any other holy texts as an individual, it is likely we develop unique understandings of what we read. Therefore, instead of having one preacher giving his interpretation to 300 odd individuals, we now have 301 versions of interpretations. As our society changes, our individualism may have a profound effect on the organization of religion. Instead of going to church, we can just read the Bible ourselves and see what we can get from it. In fact, if you look at the percentage of people who went to Church 800 years ago, and compare it to today, I think there's probably a huge decline. <br>
<br>
Yes, the Christian faith have changed over the years, as the society of their followers change. Gone are the days when no one worked on Sundays. Gone are the days when there was only one demonimation. Gone are the days when preachers could make people to go church by talking about the punishments. The Christian God has been protrayed as forgiving to vengful, from all-caring to almost to aloof, from all-forgiving to knit  picking to the point of annoyance. Throughout the ages, preachers have used their influence an interpreted the Bible according to their needs. Now, the individuals do the same.<br>
<br>
How many years will it take for us to out grow the New Testiment? How many years before we only follow the core values of the Bible, which is essentially the same as the core values of half a dozen religions and fully a dozen philosophies?<br>

<br>
The point of the matter is, religion is based on faith, and faith does not, and cannot be proved in a logical mannor. In fact, to have faith is to belief against all odds, therefore it is extremely difficult to convince someone who has faith to change their views. Call it blind faith, thick-headedness, stubborness, having their heads up their asses, or truly devout. As long as one has faith, then I suppose whatever gods they follow is happy.<br>
<br>
However, that these faithy often fails to understand is that since faith has nothing to do with logic or reason, it is impossible to prove your faith to someone who doesn't have this particular faith. Trying to use reason and logic to prove the existance of any god is nothing more than wasted effort. <br>
Therefore, I find it *extremely* amusing when members of one faith accuse members of another faith of being &quot;wrong&quot;. I always wanted to ask the particularly ensuthiastic to prove why their faith is &quot;better&quot; than someone else's faith. <br>
<br>
I do this just to see if they are stupid enough to fall into the logical trap. When they start to jabber and start quoting from their &quot;holy text&quot;, you've got them. They are now attempting to prove something that cannot be proven, which gives you a hint of how much understanding they have of their own religion, of their own faith. Nine for ensuthiasm. Negative several thousand for understanding.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the ultimate goal of most religions that survives to date is simply there as a way of conduct for a person to get along better with those around him. The core of a religion is simply a set of values that the members of the faith should follow. Unfortunately, it seems the human society, with its politics and greed, corrupts religions faster than they could &quot;save&quot; the world. <p><BR>

I can provide you with non-biblical, non-Christian texts that mention the existance of Jesus.  Approximately 150 years after his death, there was a large Jewish movement that suggested that Jesus was a sorceror - both admitting his existance and leading to the thought that he performed Miracles, but instead through sorcery.<br>
<br>
Do you believed Alexander the Great existed?  The first known documentary addressing his existance appeared approximately 200 years after his death, and you accept he exists.  The first written references we have from the bible are dated around 55 AD, 22 years after the alleged Death of Christ.<br>
<br>
Please list one historical document that is more valid than the bible.  Over 24000 historical bibles exist in different languages.  There are over 100000 discrepancies between these copies.  If you are to check what the discrepancies are, in most cases it's either spelling, or sentence structure.  Sentence Structure to any document written in Greek is pointless.  In English, saying &quot;I fed my dog&quot; and &quot;My dog fed me&quot; are totally different, but in Greek there is a definate word that is the subject of any sentence, therefore you could write the same thought of me feeding my dog many times over, different ways, and have the same meaning.<br>
<br>
The only book that comes close to having the number of historical copies and references and validity as a historic document is the Illiad, which has approximately 1/100'th the number of historical copies that the Bible does.  The earliest known copy of a Gospel is on a piece of papyrus found listing some of the quotes from the Book of John.  In Egyptian cultures (the language that it was written in) the style of writing changed dramatically depending on who ruled Egypt at the time.  The date of the writing on this papyrus is placed at between 98 and 150 AD, which would mean that we have proof of at least one copy existing as early as 55 years after the death of Christ.<br>
<br>
Even the most devout of Athiests or Agnostics will admit that Jesus existed.  Whether or not he was Christ is not going to be proven by any amount of factual basis that anyone will accept as being true.  But you have to be pretty unifnformed to argue that he never existed at all.<br>
<br>
If you would like, I can provide solid factual proof of most of the events of the bible.  I'll grant you that I can't find proof of a single miracle, other than suggestive texts that show that there was an eclypse in the middle of the day on the day Jesus was crucified.  But I can show you where historians have challenged it and later found it to be accurate.  I can provide you with many non-biblical references to the existance of Jesus and his death.  If you want me to, say the word.<br>
<br>
It's incredibly uninformed to say that he never existed.  I consider it debatable as to whether or not he is God.  But basically, what you are doing is akin to jumping into a discussion of whether the earth circles around the sun or vice versa, and trying to say there is no sun.<br>

I'm not denying the existance of Jesus, since it does not particularly matter, since a man could have existed, but his supposed expoilts may not have existed.<br>
<br>
I just found this quote to be amusing. Just because a book was popular, and was printed or copied a number of times, hardly makes it a &quot;valid historical document&quot;. You even used the Illiad as an example of a widely documented book, and do you honestly believe everything inside the Illiad was in fact the truth? <br>
<br>
Sorry, but basing the validity of the contents of a book on the number of  historical copies in existance is ridiculous. If 4 million copies of Steven King books are still in existance in two thousand years, will it make whatever King wrote true?<br>

<br>
A few things.  Homosexuality is a sin according to the New Testament as well, and looking at someone with a &quot;lustful eye&quot; isn't defined as a sin until the New Testament either.  Before that it was actions that defined sin and not thoughts, it was the reform Jesus attempted to bring to the Jewish church that taught that thoughts and intentions were sins too.<br>
<br>
If Pastor Rod told me that eating cheese was wrong, I'd go look it up and see if it were wrong with biblical references.  I'm a stickler, anything anyone tells me about the bible, I immediately demand quotes to back this theory.  ESPECIALLY if they are a Christian.<br>
<br>
Like earlier, someone mentioned Moses dropping 10 of the 20 stone tablet commandments he brought down from the mountain.  This was in a Mel Brooks Movie, and not anywhere in the bible.  I went and researched it because I didn't remember it, and I wanted to have a good standpoint for saying that it was not biblically sound.<br>
<br>
I don't have time to go through the gospels right now as I'm on my way to work, but I can tell you that 1st Timothy 1:10 address homosexuality, I can do more research later if you'd like.<br>
<br>
I do believe homosexuality is wrong, in the same way that I believe that stealing, murder, and not honoring your mother and father are wrong.  I don't believe in levels of sin - in fact, Jesus speaking of the Golden rules was in direct response to people asking someone to provide a heirarchy of sin.  Any Sin in sin, there is not first degree or second degree sin.  Therefore, while I believe homosexuality is wrong, I believe that we are all sinners.  I believe that if you are going to remove Homosexuals from your church, why stop at that sin?  Throw out anyone else who commits sin on a daily basis, and see what an eventful church service you have.<br>
<br>
Mulberry, you make some very blanket statements about Churches that seem to be based more off of propoganda than fact.  In the church I attend, I often pull aside my teacher and ask him to provide biblical references for anything I think is suspect.  I often privately call him on inconsistancies where he is teaching, or things I think are not right.  He doesn't say &quot;Holdan, leave here and don't come again,&quot; instead, he respects me for not taking everything he says at face value.  To suggest that all priests are liars and all churches are corrupt is simply wrong.  My church accepts donations, a small basket is passed around while people are praying - the intent is that if you don't want to give money, you don't feel peer pressured into it as no one is looking at you.  And they never mention you duty to give.  Instead, in the pamphlet they put out each week, they explain what percentage of donations go where, and what specifically those were spent on.  In essence, they provide us with simplified accounting books each week.<br>
<br>
I find your statements and demeanor a bit too blanket for things going on.  I personally dislike Christians who flame homosexuals, because it's pretty clear that we have already had our Last Righteous Judge.  I don't believe it's my place to judge individuals.  So while I say &quot;Hrm homosexuality is wrong&quot; in the same way I say &quot;Stealing is wrong&quot; I don't declare PEOPLE as wrong, or try to preach to them to change.  In fact, I don't preach to anyone to convert religions.  The only people I will dig into with biblical references for the point of altering them are people who claim to be Christians but show actions EXACTLY OPPOSITE of being a Christian.  Sin isn't exactly opposite of being a Christian, before we go down that road.<br>
<br>
I haven't mentioned them much but here are my beliefs:<br>
1.  God doesn't list proof for his existance out of respect for Free Will.  If God woke everyone up every morning as an alarm clock, we would have no will to accept or deny fellowship with him - we'd be ignorant to not accept it.<br>
<br>
2.  The Big Bang and evolution did occur, but they are not contrary to Biblical references.  I believe that evolution did occur because of Intelligent Design of creatures and the universe, and a guiding hand in the process.  While the bible says God created all life, I can create art with paint and a canvas, I don't have to magically conjure the materials to create it.<br>
<br>
3.  I believe in most Christian truths, I'm not going to list them because it will sound like preaching, and I don't preach or convert people.<br>
<br>
4.  I believe science provides examples both for the existance and non-existance of God.  I believe this is how God intended it.  If he could be proven, then again, we lose free will.<br>
<br>
5.  I believe in the existance of Hell, but not with literal Flames and suffering.  These were figures of speech.  I believe hell exists as an existance forever seperate of God, and that is the torture.  I don't believe in rivers of Lava and Flame, but instead believe these were illustrations to describe how deep the suffering was going to be.<br>
<br>
I don't think any of my beliefs are superior to anyone else's.  I think mine are right because they are mine, and I wouldn't follow them if I didn't think it.  But I don't think that I have a right to say that mine are more valid or that you are wrong for HAVING other beliefs, because that is judging you as a person.  I think that anyone who judges you for being an Athiest or Agnostic is wrong.  I believe anyone who forces morals or their religion on you is wrong.  That's why I chose to merely debate the issues being brought forth on this.  As people continue to raise intelligent questions, I will adress them.  I also concede that some people claiming to be Christians have done more damage with things they've said in this thread than any of the Athiests or Agnostics have.  And I believe that occurs on a daily basis.  There is a bummper sticker that I myself have considered purchasing - it reads &quot;Jesus protect me from thy followers&quot;.  And I believe that we often damage our faith more than anyone with a lack of faith ever could.<br>
<br>
So yeah, I agree most churches do things that are wrong.  I myself don't claim to be better than anyone else for being a Christian.  I don't think I have a right to tell you what to believe, but if you approach me with questions I will address them in a concise and factual manner.  I don't argue the topic of &quot;If you had faith you'd know&quot; because that's a pointless argument.  If they had faith and would know, they obviously don't have faith and don't know.  So arguing it is pointless.<br>
<br>
I don't think I've offended anyone with what I've said, but I do hope on some level I've offended some Christians for bashing on things they have said here.  I will not hesitate to correct I Christian I think is behaving poorly.  In fact, I will blast them out of the water if I can find scriptural proof that what they are doing is not right.  But I don't do the same to athiests, as forcing my religion on them will only make them bitter to it.<br>

Just because a book was popular, and was printed or copied a number of times, hardly makes it a &quot;valid historical document&quot;. You even used the Illiad as an example of a widely documented book, and do you honestly believe everything inside the Illiad was in fact the truth? <br>
<br>
Sorry, but basing the validity of the contents of a book on the number of historical copies in existance is ridiculous. If 4 million copies of Steven King books are still in existance in two thousand years, will it make whatever King wrote true?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The reason I listed the existance of the many copies is to prove the validity of the bible as existing closely to as it exists today.  Think of it this way -<br>
<br>
If one of your friends comes up to you and says Larry said you are smelly, you are probably not too likely to believe it if Larry is a good friend and you lack a ripe odor.<br>
<br>
But if 10000 people all come and say larry told you that you smell, you would start to believe that Larry indeed, did try to tell you that.<br>
<br>
It's the same way with assessing the validity of old texts.  If I have a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a statment made by someone, it's like the telephone game.  But when I have over 24000 ancient texts that all are nearly word for word exact translations of the same document, I begin to belive that what they listed of the document saying is correct.<br>
<br>
And I argue that the Illiad has far less copies of historical nature for a point.  If you are to look at the inconsistancies in the Illiad in these 300 copies, they are paramount.<br>
<br>
If the bible were subject to the telephone game being played throughout generations, of the 24000 copies we have things would be added or ommited from them.  They existed in different regions of the world in different texts.  If you are going to say that oral tradition and changes are present in the texts presented, then these concepts should be apparant in the texts found.  One from India should have Christ saying that Cows were sacred to get believers from that area to convert to Christianity more easily, and perhaps some in other cultures should have Christ saying that all who follow him willbe resurrected into another earthly life.  But the point is that they don't.<br>
<br>
The inconsistancy of the Telephone game is apparant in modern society.  But it's important to note that in Biblical times, paper and books were so expensive that Rabbi's had to memorize the entire Old Testament.  People had stellar memories.  I've seen this, as in High School we had a Masai warrior come on tour.  He would take questions from the crowd for over 2 hours, and then he would go back over and point at each individual and repeat, verbatim, their question to him.  I know I couldn't do that.  Why?  Because when I have to remember something I write it on a post-it note or calendar.  He says that he has a stellar memory because he doesn't have post-it notes or calendars.  This was the same way back then.  People didn't own copies of the Old Testament, and yet there were SCORES of people who could recite the entire document from memory from reading the one copy that temples normally had.  Memory was huge in these times, and the chances of people forgetting to add part of the translation (uniformally, I might add, as the copies in existance with historical dates before 400 AD are more or less flawless in consistancy) is pretty much nil.<br>
<br>
A lot of the Gospels came from the Q, which is a written record of everything Christ said.  This hasn't been located yet to my knowledge, but it was very common in these times to keep a written record of what people others thought were important said.  While it was acceptable in rewriting stories to change how someone said something, it was very much not acceptable to change the content of what was said.<br>
<br>
And 4 million copies of a Stephen King Book in existance doesn't make what he said true for a few reasons - first, it's fiction.  If you want to argue that 4 million copies of a Stephen King book prove that Stephen King existed and did create that story, I agree.  That is what I argue that the 24000 historical copies of the bible present.  Plus, you have these found in different cultures and different languages (including ethiopic) with the same core meaning and very few changes in consistancy or even exact wording.  This shows that the translations were all fairly accurate from the origional text.<br>
