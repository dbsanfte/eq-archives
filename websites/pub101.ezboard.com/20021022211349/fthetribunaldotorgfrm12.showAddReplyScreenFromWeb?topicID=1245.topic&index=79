<br>
She doesn't have the scales to return.  Panolas is not now nor has he ever been in DV.  He attended two raids as a guest and we decided not to invite him before this incident ever took place.  He has never had a DV tag, not even as a raid invite.  I did suggest a while back that he should be receiving the brunt of this outrage since he sold the scales and has told at least 3 different stories as to what happened to them.<br>
<br>
Poladara contacted Chutoi before Panolas ever had the scales, and before she left for vacation, and before a GM ever replied to Charsi's petition.<br>
<br>
Rynnia isn't a bitch for working out the best deal for her guild, I'm not a bastard for working out the best deal for my guild.  Rynnia is a bitch for breaking a deal she made with DV when the deal wasn't in her guilds best interest, that is the difference.<br>
<br>
30 DV do not equal 30 SI and nobody has ever claimed otherwise.  Being a stronger guild does not give anyone the right to change the terms of a deal when it suits them to do so.  It gives you the ability to negotiate a better deal at the outset and Rynnia failed to do that, then changed the terms of the deal after the fact.<br>
<br>
The 2 scales I gave Eusa on Monday night came from the 2 Ragefire and 2 Talendor kills we had over the last week or so, despite your attempt to imply they were tainted.  <br>
<br>
SI has nothing to gain from arguing the point other than to reinforce my belief that it's not worth attempting to deal with them beyond an individual level.  There are many people in SI I enjoy talking to and grouping with.  However I can't see working any kind of deals with them on a guild level while their only defense for breaking 2 deals with us is that they were bad deals.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umorannonubermonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorannonUberMonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 6:01:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> The accepted DV conversion rate is as follows:<br>
<br>
30 DV = 15 Bog Bridgade<br>
15 Bog Brigade = 5 Anklebiter's United<br>
5 Anklebiter's United = 2 SI<br>
<br>
So, that's exactly 30 DV for every 2 SI. If my calculations are correct, despite DV having 30 characters (approximately 120 truncated limbs excluding toes, fingers etc...) in the wee hours of the chinese new year during the year of the yak, they did not indeed come close to the amount of power SI had present in fear at the time. Assuming that SI had the 30 people they claimed and using some simple math calculations, DV had only 1/15 total of SI's net power present. If all of the above is true, Podaman and his merry band of followers would truly not have been able to control and slay a powerful god like cazic-thule. In case you didn't know, the little drakes in WTOV don't count as dragon encounters, they won't give you much practice for the real world Podaman. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157701>Sensei Morannon McJohnson</a></center><br>

wait wrong defense, errr<br>

I am not the one to point the finger to! I did nothing wrong besides be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>
<br>
I am tired of Podaman trying to place blame on me and saying that &quot;if you want to nail someone to the wall, you should nail panolas.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here is what the GMs told me....<br>
(note- dont have logs so i will just summarize)<br>
<br>
first night a gm sends me a tell at around 4am<br>
&quot;yo dawg, wassup. mind if i ask you a question?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uhh...sure.&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you have two red dragon scales, fewl?&quot; GM asks<br>
&quot;I only have one, the other one was passed to a twink.&quot; I say.<br>
&quot;Oh, I'm just warning you that they might be stolen. Later dude!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, so i heard that and went to sleep that night. The next day I log on and try to sell the scale (i was still trying to sell because the gm never confirmed that it was stolen.)  I look in my inventory a little later and realize the scale is gone? How did it go missing? I'm not quite sure. Then a GM sends me a tell.......<br>
&quot;Wasssssssssssssssssssssu!&quot;<br>
&quot;hey&quot; I reply.<br>
&quot;why were you trying to sell the scales?&quot;<br>
&quot;cause someone asked me to.&quot; i say<br>
&quot;ok thanks, stay cool freak.&quot; the gm says.<br>
<br>
Ok, getting to the point of my post......<br>
Podaman should shut his fuckin mouth before someone sticks a dick in it.<br>

That is a distraction and you know it. Panolas was the laundering agent, Poladara was the thief.<br>

What is the big secret that makes it worth defending Poladara? Unless you give us some reason to believe in Poladara, everything you post is going to harm your guild further. Give us her side of the story in full.<br>

i offer her support because she is part of our guild, our family. we support her because she is one of us. if theres a dv member i hated with every bone in my body, i would support them over random people that arent in my guild. guild is all. thankyou.<br>
<br>
personally, i think pola is an idiot. erm.. if i see a guild raiding, and a mob die, i am NOWHERE near the damn corpse, and i certainly wouldnt check the body. its her mistake totally. and.. im infuriated as a person that she doesnt place guild reputation over the comfyness of staying in DV. in her position i would force myself to leave, no matter the pain it would cause me. but of course.. i wouldnt be stupid enough to get myself into this particular position. its her responsibility. if she had looted and not tried to fix it at all, i guarentee she would have been guildremoved instantly. but she did not. she tried to fix it. and that is where the ole second chance thing comes in.<br>
<br>
guild = all. you guys can scream bloody murder all you want.. i dont really care what you say, i care about how this effects people in my guild. and the fact they get upset. if there was a way to make everything perfect again id do it in a second, but its human nature to bitch and complain... and theres no way to fix this. not since it was brought to the flameboard *poke mulberry*<br>

No deal was actually completed.  Yes, the above was offered, but was never set in stone.  You never agreed to anything.  You said you had to think about it, you said it sounded fair, and then shortly thereafter, after going LD, you said you could not hold connection and greyman was going to take over speaking with me.<br>
<br>
When you went ld and left, and several of your raid force left, the chance you had to take down Cazic was reduced from a small percentage to a flat 0.<br>
<br>
As far as my people went, we had approximately 32 people there, and a good spread of classes similar to the spread of classes we had when we killed CT the other night with 34.<br>
<br>
Therefore when I spoke with greyman I certainly did alter the original &quot;propsed&quot; deal, and I asked him if such an agreement were acceptable.<br>
<br>
SI / DV roll.   Highest gets 2 items and lowest gets 1 item but gets first pick.<br>
<br>
He said that would be more than fair as far as DV was concerned, because without SI present DV wouldnt be getting any items.<br>
<br>
<br>
CT had not even been engaged yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
After CT died and the roll happened the trade for the SBOZ was made.   This was not forced.

It was offered and I accepted.  That constitutes a deal in my book.  The fact that you changed it after I told Grey to accept the deal settles it in my eyes.<br>

Glad to hear you finaly admit that that was the deal in place when my connection crapped out.<br>
<br>
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Poladara fucked up, and fucked up bad.  She's sad as much.  She said it to me, she said it to Mublerry and Chutoi.  She apologized and attempted to make ammends.  I respect that and in my eyes she's learned her lesson and paid the price (incidentaly, I'm holding on to the boots until she repays the guild for the red scales I gave SI out of the guild bank).  On the other hand, Mulberry and Rynnia both admit to renegging on deals and are totaly unremorseful about it. <br>
<br>
I'll take Poladara in my guild over either of those two any day of the week and twice on sunday.  <br>

DV and SI made a deal.  SI renegged on the deal.  DV and SI made another deal.  SI renegged again.<br>

I understand all about family and unity and loyalty. I was in a guild at one time. I have also stepped to the defense of friends and guildmates. Even at times when I was not in total agreement with them.<br>
<br>
But I have never defended scamming or stealing or ninjalooting. In fact, I remember blasting a fucker in our guild named Jama who fucking scammed this one guy &amp; lied his ass off to. Our wizard captain rode his ass as well and the dude who got scammed got his crap back. Nobody backed Jama. Nobody.<br>
<br>
But you guys are not just defending this ninjalooting whore. You are fucking blasting the people she stole from. To me that is just brilliant. What a wonderful guild. <p><BR>

<br>
A rich kid gets busted shoplifting.  While the store is holding him for the cops his parents show up.  They don't want their precisous little angle to have a record so the give the store manager $1000 to let him go.  The manager agrees to this, but the assistant manager doesn't like it.  Let's just she has an over developed sense of justice and doesn't like to see thieves get off scott free.  So she places an add in the local paper saying what a thieving little shit the kid is, and how is parents buy him out of trouble.  The parents of course are pissed, but there's nothing they can do about it really since the assistant manager has not commited slander or libel.  The parents should have let the kid take his punishment then they wouldn't be seen as assholes who try to buy their kids freedom. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrozzer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 4:25:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> I liked Unnone's story better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usashanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sashanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 5:00:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> So let me get this straight.<br>

So Panolas is now sitting on 60k of plat that belongs to the rightful owner of the property.  So when is SI getting its plat back?<br>
