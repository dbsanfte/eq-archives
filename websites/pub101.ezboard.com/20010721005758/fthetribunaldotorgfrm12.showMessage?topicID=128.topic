I had a run in with him yesterday in EC when i was trying to get the GEBs from him for a friend... all i had was an item to trade worth double the amount of his GEBs so i told him how about GEBs and FBSS for them, since he seemed to take alot of interest in the item i was trading, and he flat out told me FBSS was worth 13k that he had had many offers close to that and his friend sold one yesterday for even more.. so i kept on looking...<br>
<br>
well, he inspects me about a million times and says i got a 54 bard im going to log him on (like thats goign to make a diff to me making trades) he logs on this 54 bard (Attao) with bronze pants mith bp and lambent arms and thats jsut about it.. i ask him about his equip and he says he lost it all (wouldn'y tell me how he lost it) i started gettign curious after that especially when he started asking me to help him camp items... driving me absolutrly fucking mad.. plays his invis song then asks me if i can see him.. what a twit.<br>
<br>
whats funny is after i got it across in his little head i didnt want to help.. he asks me where does singing steel armor drop? a 54 bard doesn't know this? a 54 bard asks me if hes high enough to do lambent quests? all i gotta say is a) he bought this char or b) someone was dumb enough to let him have it<br>
<br>
WTF is up with him and all this shit? theres alot more random crap but i dont feel like making any longer of a post.. beware hes looking for a guild.. dont make that mistake<br>

<br>
I've run into him a couple times already this past week, and both times he's done things that caused me to say &quot;*sniff*...smells like ebay&quot;...<br>
<br>
1) He needed a guide to the LGuk zone.  Granted, it's *possible* that he hasn't been to LGuk and is 54...but highly damn unlikely.<br>
<br>
2) He asked me for an invis for the run to LGuk.  When I politely reminded him that he had a song that did that...he said &quot;which one?&quot;<br>
<br>
3) When going after Eejag in lavastorm (ya know...down in the lava) we asked him for his fire resist song.  He cycled through CR, PR, and DR songs before he found the fire one...<br>
<br>
4) After we were all bloodied and bruised outside the lava with everyone around 1 bubble of life, with a 52 druid and a 50+ cleric in the group, he insists that his Hymn of Restoration is more effective than doing a clarity and having the healers heal (not to mention the fact that we had a warrior with 4k+ hp in the group)...<br>
