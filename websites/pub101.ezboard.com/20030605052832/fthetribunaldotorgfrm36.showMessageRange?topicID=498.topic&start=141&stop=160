<br>
I know that its different, but it does not change the concept one bit.  This is why:  I am betting on something that I don't know about...that means its a risk and I very well could die.  That is the connection I was making.  The connection had nothing to do with the &quot;guilt&quot; of the driver.  It had to do with driving home the point that the death of that woman is placed squarely on her shoulders.  A strong argument can always be made that it was the bulldozer's fault, but it is absolutely positively 100% also her fault...a strong case could be made that it was both of their faults.  Everyone that wants to say its not her fault tries to focus on the driver, and everyone who wants to say it is her fault wants to focus on her.  The point is that she put herself into that situation, and she also forced the driver into that situation...therefore even if you want to place *some* amount of blame on the driver...you MUST place *more* blame on her.<br>
<br>
If that driver CHOSE TO RUN OVER THIS GIRL, it is murder. Not really.  Murder means you have to have some hatred or emotion for wanting to kill her in the first place.  That means if she got out of the way, he would gotten out of the bulldozer and then chased her down to kill her...which you have no evidence for.  You can say he killed her...but not murdered.<br>

<br>
Murder is when he had to choose whether or not she would die at that moment, and chose to do it.  If it was entirely out of his control (car slides on icy road, kills pedestrian...) it is an accident.  That's in the eyes of US law, and most western nations as well (read up on the difference between murder and manslaughter).<br>
<br>
Further, what he did may be construed as premeditated murder (he was out to kill some people he didn't like that day, she just happened to be there?) as opposed to a &quot;murder of passion&quot; or whatnot.  That'd be a tougher argument to make.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;personal&quot; attacks on this board, people are attacking your attitude and views, not you personally.  Fine line, I know, but its really more the sprit of the attack/debate... on the FB it's done to be either amusing or hurtful.  Here, it's done to make a point.  That's been my take on it, anyway.  Others' views will very likely differ.<br>
<br>
I hope you don't go running back to the FB - you actually do have a base of understanding of what you're talking about (not just ranting senselessly) and you bring an extreme viewpoint to this board which makes it all that much more interesting.  Just don't be so locked in your views that you are completely inflexible; only then does it become pointless to post on a board like this.

If this had happened in the U.S. in a run of the mill situation - guy in a tractor wants to bulldoze something, girl stands in the way, guy goes ahead anyway and kills girl - the driver would be convicted of murder.  In which degree is another matter, but it would be murder.<br>
<br>
The critical difference lies in the fact that &quot;war zone&quot; analogies are indeed applicable.  On the one hand, I do believe that the driver was responsible for his actions, and I expect he will suffer the consequences in a military court, whatever those are.  However, there are mitigating factors on his side - he was following orders (no Nazi references please, not the same situation), he was doing his job, and going out on a limb here, I'm going to say that he *probably* did not intend to kill the girl, simply frighten her into moving out of the way (the game of chicken).  On the other hand, I see a very real parallel with other human shield incidents.  You say that it cannot be compared with Iraqi human shields being bombed - I say it can.  True, at the instant the bombs are dropped the human shield doesn't really have a choice any more; he's going to die.  But the critical point is that he *chose* to remain there, despite being told over and over and over, and being able to see for himself, that staying where he was, remaining a &quot;human shield&quot; would result in his death.  This is precisely what happened to Rachel C., it just happened over a shorter time frame.  As war approaches, the &quot;bulldozer&quot; of American air strikes creeps closer and closer to Iraqi human shields, who have the option of giving up and leaving right up until the last second, when they &quot;fall down&quot; and are killed by American bombs.  Is it the American pilot's fault for killing the shield?  Is it the commander's fault who ordered the strike despite the fact that the human shield was there?  Are they responsible for the death of that person, even though they *could* delay the strike, call in ground forces, and have the human shield dragged away, all the while risking the chance that the building he was guarding will be used once again for nefarious purposes, risking the chance that opposition will be organized against the ground troops as they go in to remove the offending human shield... see where I'm going with this?<br>
<br>
In the end, the most vivid lesson to be learned is that &quot;human shield&quot; operations are just plain nutty, stupid, and useless.  If these people valued human life, they wouldn't risk their own in pointless personal crusades which accomplish nothing. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 3/19/03 11:16:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1799<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 11:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=147>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange</span><hr size=1> Bulldozing that house was not a military imperative.

I have little sympathy in general towards liberal pussy human shield types.  I think the whole concept is stupid and yes, the girl was knowingly placing her life at risk.  The context of this incident however, places the blame of her death squarely on the person that chose to kill her.  Therein lies the flaw of bombs dropping and firing range... being unable to prevent a death does not equal a choice to cause a death.  <br>
<br>
That choice to cause a death, in a military scenario, must be justified either by the imperative need to destroy the target, the inability to prevent the death, or a lack of time to clarify the order. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 482<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=148>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange</span><hr size=1> In a &quot;war zone&quot; a soldier or fighter pilot can't wait for someone to remove all the &quot;innocent targets&quot; before that person does their job.

You make a good point though, Wolvar.  If it turns out that the situation was in fact completely non-imperative (difficult to judge no doubt, especially for us with absolutely no information regarding the operation itself), then I would cautiously agree, although I would use the term &quot;manslaughter&quot; rather than &quot;murder&quot; myself.

<br>
No, thats not the only question.  The other question is whether or not her life was her responsibility. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to deny your questioning of the operator tho, i mean, yea, its relevant too.<br>
<br>
However, the way you phrased your &quot;only&quot; question infact justifies his running her over.  The reason being that you threw into the question &quot;if she was not putting them into a life-threatening situation or interfering with a combat operation&quot;.  Firstly, it was a military operation being conducted, so that leads to arguing about &quot;combat operation&quot;, and secondly it was most definitely a life threatening situation.  She may not have had a bomb strapped to her, but that doesn't mean the threat isn't there.  Israel is in a state of war...she posed a threat.  That is fact, and that is something you have to deal with when you ask that kind of a question. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 629<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 5:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=154>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Question Count.

Yes the proterster is breaking the law, but that does not absolve the killing of them unless they are threatening the life of the 'dozer operator.  You have Police or security remove the protester THEN proceed with your job.<br>

While the rules of war arguably apply in the situation in Isreal, same difference.  Running over this protester was not justified, because she is NOT a combatant and thier were non-lethal means available to remove her (unless you think it takes a bulldozer to move a collage student. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

No doubt at all.  He would be in serious problems in such a peaceful (i.e. not at war) state at this current time.  If the U.S. had been invaded by Russia during the Cold War and Russia had taken over 30 states and was continuing their attack and some Russian woman came over to the U.S. to try and stop a Russian (or even American) bulldozer from bulldozing down our beautiful homes and the operator ran her over....without a doubt he would be let off the hook...if even on the hook in the first place.<br>
<br>
As you can see, clearly two different situations.  The situation with Israel aligns much more closely to this made up one than it does with America's current peaceful state.<br>

Ah so you think there are some sort of &quot;rules&quot; in war eh?  Not really.  There are a few international agreements, some of which are even laws...but when it comes down to it there are no real rules for war.  Also, you make it sound so distinct as if every war is the same...when its not.  You act as if a &quot;state of war&quot; means Israel can still conduct itself being polite and yet survive.<br>

Well yea, you know that now.  Once again (as I have mentioned in unrelated topics) you assume that the people in the present action somehow have Godly knowledge of the future and of everything that is about to happen.  You forget that each person is placed in a situation in which the facts aren't there, and the best judgement one can give does not hardly ever yield the best results.<br>

Except it is Isreal who is occupying.  And bulldozeing homes in arreas they occupy.  Now this is NOT about whether that policy is right or wrong.  This is about running over an unarmed civilian, instaed of taking more appropriate steps to remove her.<br>

Try looking up the Geneva and Hague Conventions Mr. History major.   Large hunks of those agreement deal with how to handle non-combatants.  Running over them with a bulldozer is not one of the options.  <br>

All it would have taken was for 2 soldiers to drag this girl out of the way (and detain her or what ever else was deemed appropriate.)  <br>

It's this obvious detachment from reality that is highlighted by your bizarre scenarios which makes you a perpetual joke on this forum.  Combined with your baseless arrogance (I'm a history major, look at me!) and extremism, and you can see why conservatives and liberals laugh at you in unison.<br>
<br>
I dont know what kind of school you go to, but when I took up my history major, one of the first things they always told us was that you will never be able to find absolute truths in history, but that does not mean that you shouldn't attempt to get as close to them as possible.  Like Tuwene said, History is written by victors, there is always 2 or more sides to every story and event, so to watch some rookie who hasnt even finished his degree to claim to be the absolute and definitive authority on all history matters is hilarious.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'll be done with my history degree next year, and even then I can fully acknowledge that there are people on this board who are better educated and better informed in history/politics even though its not a subject that they do for a living, but rather as a hobby of sorts.<br>
<br>
Pay attention in your classes next time, and notice that NOT A SINGLE ONE of your professors will ever claim to be the definitive authority on a subject: unlike you.  The model of a mature man allows for differeng opinions, differing accounts and different ideas - a concept that seems alien to you.  And as much as you like to cry out against it - you are still a boy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Frankly, as a fellow History major, I'm embarassed for the both of us.  You certainly shred the little credibility that my degree has with your ignorant rhetoric. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/03 8:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=158>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Protesters woke my ass up this morning at 7am, as they managed to shut down most of the city of San Francisco.  The sirens, honking, and helicopters are enough to get you out of bed...<br>
<br>
They (are as I type this) sitting down in the middle of intersections and freeway on/off ramps.  The police are, one at a time, removing them quietly... no violence, just carrying them off to the bus where they'll be dragged off, charged with a misdemeanor, and released this evening.<br>
<br>
30 minutes ago, in front of a TV news crew doing a live report no less (oops), some guy who probably had been sitting in traffic for ages due to the protesters, decided to just go through the interestion anyway, hitting a protester.<br>
<br>
It was rather interesting to see how fast the police went from quietly carrying people off to swarming the guy's car, smashing his window, dragging him out, cuffing him, and basically dragging him by his feet off to a patrol car to go spend 5+ years in jail.  (keep an eye out for it - that kinda stuff makes national news when it's caught on TV!)<br>
<br>
That's how the police of THIS country handle protesters, and the people who decide protesters are in their way.
