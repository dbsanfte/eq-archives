only monks died on dagarn <br>
we never once wiped on guards <br>

those mobs arent meant to be easy i'll give you that<br>
but by the time you get to that stage of the game those mobs are trivial.<br>

its fine how you want to defend your friends in legendary, but do you have to be so insulting to ppl who actually work hard and perfect their techniques so that can take down said mobs with 35 peeps and only 2 deaths?<br>

so when they retool it and someone breaks em with 50 peeps are you going to cry foul again?<br>

Don't cut and paste things without the entire context they were in as they lose validity.<br>
<br>
&quot;[Sat May 25 02:49:33 2002] Temurik tells you, 'would have spoken to nieros who was the one who approcached me, but he isnt on now...im just saying there is no longer a rotation in tovn, can you pass that message onto him ?'<br>
<br>
So no rotation now.&quot;<br>
<br>
You came to that conclusion after speaking with one person?  What did Sol Invictus say?  What did Royal Norrathian Guard say?  What did Transcended say?<br>
<br>
&quot;[Sat May 25 16:03:38 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'ok, not sure if you've heard, but Comps and EV have pulled out of the NToV rotation...right now, RNG and SI and more than likely Trans would like to keep a rotation going. (talked to Think, he likes the idea, but has not given a deffinite a'<br>
[Sat May 25 16:03:43 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'answer yet)'<br>
[Sat May 25 16:04:13 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'I know your looking to get in as well right now'<br>
[Sat May 25 16:05:17 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'Hmmm, they told me (if i understood him right) that it was going FFA'<br>
[Sat May 25 16:06:08 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'I would prefer to avoid FFA if possible, it wastes time and resouces for the most part'<br>
[Sat May 25 16:07:35 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'I know about AN...they are the only real wild card, they will not abide by any rotation'<br>
<br>
Been told new rotation being setup, but AN won't accept it. No one has told me other wise on that.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
Where is the entirety of that conversation?  Why did you not contact the other guilds in the rotation?  I did not receive a tell from you.  Did you speak with Transcended?  Especially because Lilwee indicated they were an uncertainty.<br>
<br>
&quot;[Sun Jun 09 21:09:36 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'I have no problem if your gonna go FFA, i would just like to know for sure'<br>
[Sun Jun 09 21:10:10 2002] You told Lilwee, 'Unless AN are in the rotation, i dont see any other choice but FFA for ntov'<br>
[Sun Jun 09 21:10:31 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'ok, so you will not abide by any rotation?'<br>
[Sun Jun 09 21:10:39 2002] You told Lilwee, 'not unless AN are'<br>
[Sun Jun 09 21:10:46 2002] Lilwee tells you, 'kk'<br>
<br>
Yet again, no mention nor reply that AN are in any rotation. And it was said that unless AN are part of rotation then there is no choice but to do FFA really.&quot;<br>
<br>
SUNDAY JUNE 9TH at 9 PM.  You had ALREADY gone to NTOV after Transcended had killed Aaryonar for you.  I fail to see the relevance of this conversation other than showing you trying to negotiate AFTER you had fucked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;At no point since the initial talk to lilwee about the rotation, has there been any mention of us having an offical shot at Aary. Not one officer in the guild has been told that we had a definite shot, nor when. No one from Sol Invictus or Transcended as far as I know, have spoke to any officer regarding the rotation and an Aary attempt. Neither has any officer from AN told us such.&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you ask me?  No, you didn't.  Why?  Cuz you would have been told &quot;Sure, your attempt on Aaryonar will happen at the end of the current rotation, which is XXX then XXX then you go.&quot;   Easy as hell.  No bullshitting.  No beating around the bush other than, yep, give it a shot on this date.<br>
<br>
But you didn't even bother to contact me, and I am on frequently enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
From your website:<br>
<br>
&quot;The only time we were ever approached about it was by Lilwee, about a month ago, who stated that if we wanted into the rotation we would get to try Aary on Transcended's turn. What happened there?&quot;<br>
<br>
Number one, I don't believe Lilwee said this.  If he was going to personally let a guild go on anyone's turn it would HAVE to be RNG's.  He cannot make the decision for Transcended to forefit their turn.  I'll let him refute this whole mess but I really do not think he would tell you you can &quot;try Aaryonar on Transcended's turn.&quot;  If he *did* say that I will eat my words here but it sounds like a crock of shit to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want to behave as your are behaving, then so be it.   There is a civil way to go about things.  There is a sneaky and underhanded way to go about things.  If you were honestly interested in joining the rotation you would have gone about this FAR differently than you did.  And the amazing thing is all it would have taken would have been a quick tell to me, and you would have had a date set approximately 2 weeks from the time you sent me a tell, for your Aaryonar try, and 48 hours to kill him.<br>
<br>
And like I said before, yes you pissed off Transcended, but you also pissed off the other guilds in the rotation to varying extents.  It was just a completely brainless move. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 877<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/02 10:00:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This will be my only post on the subject</span><hr size=1> i gots a friends i gots a friend .. flassh is cool flassh is cool <br>

It happened first plane raid that ever took place...it happened when the planes were upgraded (I've been here for it all) 5 hour cr's whine whine whine, mr gm PLZ save us. I was there...I hear it, I saw it. So the hell what. Legendary went into tov to learn and have fun...they Cr'd themselves...they didn't whine to Gm's they rose to the occation . got kicked picked there asses up and will continue on...Trans got baned for 24 hours...hmmm....2 strikes....Yup I'm lording it...cause I hate pos dictatorshits like you.

Who:<br>
1.Can't speak english for shit<br>
2.Holds a grudge against Trans, or at least some of its members<br>
3.Seems foreign(see number 1)<br>
4.Has a strange and anger-filled way of expressing themself<br>
5.Seeks a new identity to cover up their past(maybe its me, but who the fuck has ever heard of Vothe before?)<br>
6.Is actually a man...despite her previous characters<br>
<br>
Vothe is no other than our good old friend Aanoene! <p><hr>

Yea...trans got baned for 24 hours and a second warning. it won't help. People need to work together to make this a game again, fun and enjoyable by all. If trans were real adults they should have applauded the try. cause they were tired and done. nothing to stop them from going in after is there? Legendary didn't clear it out did they? Trans got the big boys right? this post is the product of of a 12 year old mentality who caused trans to get banned for 24 hours from Ntov. you have all heard their pissing and whining.maybe they should have included them for the experience. but of course too many greedy ignorant kids around for that. legendary went in..walked around and got a few kills...maybe some loot. Hell for all you know they got shafted and did nothing but lose xp. but they learned. and this game is about seeing new stuff going new places and learning fun new things. and then when you learn...the excitment of doing it a first time.  <p><img src="http://www.bioware.com/_global/images/sidenav/tob_icon.jpg" border="0">
