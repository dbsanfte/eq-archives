I didn't actually get to watch the show on Fox the other nite but at work its all i have been hearing about (i work with children who are in danger of dropping out of high school, so being with 14-18 year old kids 3 days a week, its a big discussion among the other teachers and I.)<br>
<br>
From what i got last nite from a third party news program, was that michael jackson has in fact payed off a numerous amount of other families in fear of their relationship going public.  Ok my question for you is if Michael Jackson thinks that this is sweet and innocent than why must he pay off these families.  I used to love Michael Jackson when i was growing up and this shocks me that he has turned out to be this way.  <br>
<br>
Harassment is wrong and it is especially when it involves our children ya know.  I believe that the FBI should open up an investigation on Michael Jackson and let him get what he deserves.  Because when you are molested or sexually abused in anyway it really messes with you.  Trust me...<br>
<br>
Let me tell you a story about a student that I work with.  Shes 16 years old and from the time she was 6 until just recently her father would wake her throughout the nite to have sex with her.  Since we reported all of this she has attempted to commit suicide 2 times and is nursing on anti depressants probably for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>
She tells me how bad she wants to end it all because she knows her father will get out of jail.  Michael Jackson is just like this man, he has made an emotional scar that will live on until the day these children die.  People like the girls father and Michael Jackson make me sick and they both deserve to rot in a prison cell until the day they will burn in hell.<br>
<br>
Peace<br>

Like I said there has been more than a handful of investigations and while showing strange and inappropriate behavior, no evidence of sexual contact.   <br>
<br>
You have to remember MJ was severly emotionally and physically abused (but not sexually)  The prime result seems to be a stunting of his emotional development.  He is physically and intellectually an adult but emotionally still a child.  I don't think there was any sexual contact because I don't think MJ is actually capable of sexual attraction.  I think his claims to fatherhood are false.  Because I don't think he could perform the required act.<br>
<br>
MJ has issues.  Deep issues and it leads to inappropriate behavior, especially around children, even if no sexual activity is involved.  I 40+ year old man cannot behave toward and amoung childern like he is a child himself.    He should not be haveing other people children stay over night with him.  It isn't healthy for him or for the children.  Some of these parents who did sue, bear SOME responsibility.  Its not like MJ kidnapped these kids. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Or how about if you are babysitting your nephew or a close friends kid overnight and they don't want to sleep alone, do you let them sleep in the same bed as you?  I've slept in the same bed as my 3 year old nephew several times and there was nothing sexual or even inappropriate IMO... Hell, he had a deathgrip on my neck for half the night and kicked the hell outta me the other half the first few times he stayed the night.  I know a couple friends of the family that I don't think anyone in the family would have a problem with letting their kid stay the night even if that meant the kid had to share a bed with the friend.<br>
<br>
So, to play devil's advocate, it IS entirely possible to sleep in the same bed with a young child and for it to be completely innocent IMO.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I think the guy is too screwed up personally to be taking care of any kids by himself.  Whether he molested any children or not... I have my doubts, but it wouldn't surprise me to find that there was at least some truth to the allegations. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=361026">Sciek</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> &lt;Sol Invictus&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

MJ is oen messed up dude all around and IMO shouldn't be left in charge of anyone especially not young children.  It's one thing for a kid and his parents to hang out at Neverland and see all the fun kid shit he has there, it's another to just send your kid over and leave him totally in the care of Michael Jackson... <br>

It just seems strange that any parent would settle with someone who supposedly molested their child in that way.  <br>
<br>
Fact is we live in a country where people are lawsuit-crazy and there are plenty of lawyers that will take any lawsuit against a high-profile person like that and run with it.  The bad press alone is enough to ruin a celebrities reputation and thus the reason/excuse given for settling is often that it's better for the celeb financially to pay up and get it dropped from the headlines asap.  I can somewhat understand that, but then again in a case like this I'd have fought to the end to show my innocence rather than leave any doubt as to whether I was a child molester so that makes ya wonder about MJ.  Like I said before though, I also have to wonder about the family that just lets it drop for a payoff and doesn't pursue criminal charges.  <br>
<br>
The whole case is just too screwed up to draw any definite conclusion IMO.  I can't imagine myself settling for what either side was willing to do.  Seriously, if some rich guy was molesting your kid would you just drop it for a payoff???<br>

Yep, but he sure as hell wouldnt be doing it to my kids again.  Let him get it on with Sciek's kids or something.  I'm not a vindictive person.  Dragging MJ to court just to be able to prove that he is a monster wouldnt make me feel any better, and I dont think that having my kids having to go through the ordeal of trial would be a picnic for them either.<br>

<br>
There is a reasonable argument that can be made for taking this route. If your child was molested your first priority should be to try and minimize the emotional damage done, ie threapy. Therapy is very expensive. Not to mention that having enough money to send your kid through college and give them pretty much anything they need can be very theraputic... and I am not saying that tongue in cheek. It's alot easier to be rich and miserable than poor and miserable.<br>
<br>
Now if you go the police route, what are the odds of winning a case against the kind of lawyers MJ can hire? Where will the money come from for counseling your child? Where in this process will your child come out ahead?<br>
<br>
Going the criminal route would be a huge gamble imo. I hate child molesters, but I would not murder a person who molested my daughter, as much as I would want to, because then I would go to prison and she would have to deal with losing a father as well as the memory of being molested. It would not make anything easier for her. By that same token, forcing a child to testify in court and trying to nail a mega-rich celeberty for rape would be a long and painful process that would scar them even further. It's bad enough fighting a regular scuzdick, it worse fighting a rich scuzdick, but the worst is fighting a rich and famous scuzdick.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that taking the money would be the best thing for the child. It may not be the right thing, but it is the best thing. <p><br>

To be honest it is because NONE of them attempted to get criminal charges filed that tell me thier case was weak.  It may have been strong enough for a civil jury.  they are not bound by the same rules of evidence and considering what DID happen for sure (not illegal but....just plain ewwwww...) MJ was not likely to get a favorable judgement from a jury no matter what. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
