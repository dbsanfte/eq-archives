<br>
At least that's how I see it.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bush was duped about the Babies just like anyone else</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That is what you choose to believe, just like the people who chose to believe Reagan had no knowledge of trading arms for hostages. I have no problem with that, but my belief is that it's wishful thinking.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I will agree with you however on the fact that He did screw up and not pay attention when he should have, This oversight however was not condoning Saddam to Invade Kuwait.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And I suppose there is no possibility that the ambassador was the fall guy. Someone has to go down when things go public and it's usually the low man on the totem pole. But of course that just happens in the movies, never real life, right?<br>
<br>
Either way, the ambassador was the representative for the US to Iraq. Whether it was a mistake or not, the ambassador to your country is only allowed to convey approved information. How was Iraq to know the difference? It was our ambassador that screwed up, so claiming how evil Saddam is for invading Kuwait is a dishonest argument, just like arguing he is evil for killing 1 million Iranians. Don't you even wonder why they didn't use WMD during their invasion and occupation of Kuwait, but he did on Iran and even his own people. Think about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Btw loegan, the rapes were real, The murders were real, Stop adding things in just to make it look like Bush was an evil dictator, Your hatred for the man is becoming evident again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If the incubator story was a lie, how can you be so sure the rest of the stories are true? We were lucky the press caught on to the incubator thing.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Loegan your conspiracy theories are way way out there, I can Understand being cautious about war, But you are painting a picture of Bush being the anti christ....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I never bought into the oil arguments until it was shown we were setting up a US government and taking control of the oil fields. Now if you want to believe that is all perfectly innocent, that is up to you. I too dismissed it until the evidence came out. Now I see it in a different light and war for oil no longer is an unsubstantiated theory. It still may not be the reason, but it doesn't change the fact we are taking over their oil in the end, so make of it what you will.<br>
<br>
Facts are facts and my or your opinion doesn't change them. How you interpret those facts is up to you.<br>

It was not soley on a &quot;pr stunt&quot; everyone knew what was happening over there.....He simply added what this girl was saying to it.

If they have Photoes of where Chem siloes and factories are and they share it then saddam will move said Siloes. If we lose the Ability to strike before saddam uses these weapons, Then we lose the Advantage and yes Loegan many soldiers will die because of that.<br>

To tap a phone line require soldiers or Intelgence agents to operate in the field...This puts people at risk two fold.<br>
<br>
1.) If you give out the names of the people talking then the leaders of said country will discontinue using whatever it was that they were talking on....The agents who were tapping it physicaly (the actual line) then are put at risk.<br>
<br>
2.) If you getting good info from the Phone line, Lets say Military leader info then giving out who it is cuts that info out, There for you lose valuable intelgence which again ultimatly puts soldiers at risk. <br>

The reason for this, was to protect the level of detail our satellite photos are able to obtain.  It's like not disclosing exactly how fast our jet fighters are able to go.<br>
<br>
Some things are just meant to be kept top secret, no matter how much the public cries to have the information disclosed.<br>
<br>
FYI the photos Powell presented was nothing new to many of our allies.  A lot of it was the same stuff Powell has been showing people in all those secret meetings.  But showing someone a physical picture, and disclosing to the world the same picture is two entirely different things.  A senator looking at an image couldn't tell anyone how accurate the image was, but an image shown to the world would give experts the ability to accurately judge the quality of optics we have.<br>
