<br>
<br>
As I passed through the partof this world known as the dreadlands I came across someone with news I did not need to hear. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aatlaar, I'm glad I found you I have news for you and it can not wait&quot;<br>
<br>
...Said a warrior I had never laid eyes upon. Clad in armor stained with newly dried blood, and a look upon his face I could not ignore, I stopped and settled myself for what was to come.<br>
<br>
&quot;A friend, an ally, Has fallen m'Lord...&quot;<br>
<br>
I couldnt begin to understand him before he continued his frantic speech, but I took him in my eyes and calmed myself for what was to come.The day became heavy and I felt tired and spent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladida, Cleric of Brell, Fell this day in an Epic fight. He fought, I was told, and saved many lives in his last, Glorious fight for Norrath.&quot;<br>
<br>
I Suddenly lost my wind, the strength Cazic had given me gone in a heartbeat. I fell to the broken dirt and pounded it with all my might, not knowing Iwas crying to my god and those that had slain my closest friend. <br>
<br>
&quot;No M'Lord, Cazic had nothing to do with this. His minions were not nearby. He fell in a glorious battle against Veeshan and her minions.&quot;<br>
<br>
I arose and swung my mighty mace to this, this, WELP that brought me such ANGER. I knew not, that moment, what I did and the anger that raised in me took control to a degree i had never known.<br>
<br>
As he landed upon the same earth I raged against, I found myself again and quickly began my ritual to heal this poor brave soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry young one for my outburst, I can not control what is inside me when confronted with such news. I am sorry for the trouble you took to seek me out, and I am sorry for my reaction to it.<br>
<br>
I suggest you find your way and far from me. I will not forget this day, you can trust that. In you I owe a Debt. Call on me any day and Iwill repay it in kind. This soul you talk to me of is one you should talk of in reverance and respect. He stands now with his god, in a place of respect. He also stays with me in my heart and for him I will forge forward to end those lives that sought his end. I will have him with me when I understand my new goal and he will stand next to me in the final sleep.  Take yourself away and know Cazic thanks you for your sacrifice.&quot;<br>
<br>
He bowed to me and backed away in fear as it should be, but I took no pleasure in it as I should. I only knew that my allies lessened this day and felt the weekness of time creep into my bones. <br>
<br>
I stole a look to the sky and the moon that beckoned me. I will stand strong and i will fall before those that seek me out as they did Sir Ladida. Untill that day comes, all i slay will know his name....<br>
<br>
<br>
...Running to the Peak of Dragons,to ask questions of those left behind, my thoughts raced. They HAD to know of the moon, They had to know of those that fell this ally of mine, and they HAD TO PAY FOR IT ALL. <br>
<br>
This nights sleep could wait, this days rest would not come for me. I am the Avatar of Fear, I am the one that will avenge his death and i am the one that will be the BANE of the dragons.....<br>
<br>

<br>
I quickly walked into the recesses of my temporary camp inside the ruins of Kaesora.  Lately I'd been attempting to retrieve any items of scholarly value from the ancient library there.  An arduous and often unrewarding task, especially considering the vile creatures that sometimes stalked me within it's confines.  The fear I had known when I first encountered these ruins had over the years been replaced with a calm power and caution.<br>
<br>
One book in particular, the Mitsandu of Charisis, a seeming book of prophecy had held my interest.  A blood moon.  I flipped through the ancient pages heedless of the possible destruction of priceless pages in search of a reference that tugged at a corner of my mind.  I'm no wizard, but I'm also no stranger to this sort of research.<br>
<br>
A blood moon.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Shit!&quot; I exclaimed as I found my mark.  I quickly closed the book and placed it in the large travelling pouch I slung over my shoulder.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Chenssir, I want you to seal this area until I return,&quot; I instructed my Iksar Thrull.  He nodded his head and began moving the various items I had uncovered into great chests and placing them into a recess in the stone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Andalusia, we're moving out.  You prepared to travel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anytime.  Where are we heading?&quot; my old friend asked.  The Woodelf Ranger was quite ill at ease covered in the dust from the Field of Bone rather than the shadow of his forest home.  He stood, shouldering his bowstaff and latching his double scabbarded belt. <br>
<br>
&quot;We move to the Dreadlands as fast as we can,&quot; I replied calmly gathering my arcane implements.<br>
<br>
&quot;That could take days, Bowynn,&quot; Andalusia said looking at me oddly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not the way we're traveling,&quot; I replied releasing a small bird from a wicker cage to fly due south.  &quot;Let's go.  We're to meet Tiersa near the swamp to the south.&quot;  Andalusia complied without question.<br>
<br>
After half a days travel we came upon a small grey wolf with bright intelligent eyes.  She bounded up to Andalusia placing her paws on his legs, then over to me with the same greeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Tie, thank you for coming, this is urgent,&quot; I told her with a scratch of her head.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Anytime, Bowynn,&quot; the wolf spoke to them.  &quot;You two ready?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Tiersa,&quot; I nodded to her.  Andalusia just nodded.<br>
<br>
With a pulsating light she shapeshifted into a small Halfling woman with mischevious eyes and a motherly smile.  She placed the small bird in my hands that I sent forth.  I placed the bird back within the wicker cage.  She lifted her hands into the air and began a chant to Tunare, the mother.  While I don't put any sort of stock in this stuff of Dieties, it is an awesome power to be able to alter one's location in Norrath.  With a gut wrenching twist we witnessed oblivion.  The earth is not gentle.<br>
<br>
With a thump we landed in the lost valley of the Dreadlands.. a lush valley in an otherwise barren waste.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for your assistance, Tiersa,&quot; I said to the druid as she shapeshifted back into a small grey wolf.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have but to call on me, Bowynn,&quot; she said and bounded off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where to now?&quot; Andalusia asked as I took my bearings.<br>
<br>
&quot;The tunnel to the barrens,&quot; I replied marking my direction with the sky.  Andalusia called upon his own &quot;spiritual&quot; powers to haste our travel.  We moved with the speed of winds towards the tunnel.<br>
<br>
As we climbed the cliffside it got colder and colder the higher we went.  We finally reached the tunnel's mouth and entered it on our way to the barrens. <br>
<br>
As we made our way through the dimly lit tunnel a voice from ahead spoke saying &quot;just turn around and go back.&quot;  A kneeling figure ahead looked at me with fiery eyes and a snarl.  Andalusia pushed forward and I reached out to hold him away.  I patted him on the shoulder to let him know all was well, and noticed he had both gleaming blades drawn as I moved towards the figure.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aatlaar?  What in the hells are you doing in here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go away, I convene with my Lord at the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know I don't buy into that nonesense.  What are you doing in this dank dark tunnel?  Come let's have some food and drink,&quot; I said reaching for his arm.<br>
<br>
He stood to his full impressive height and bristled with menace.  I flinched back a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's gotten into you?&quot; I asked getting very concerned.  First the blood moon, now this.  Strange things were afoot.  <br>
<br>
He looked me in the eyes with an intensity that almost burned.  He then looked to the ground and his shoulders slumped.<br>
<br>
&quot;My friend.. what's wrong?&quot; I asked stepping closer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladida...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladida what?  Is he here too?  Tell that little lush to keep away from my wines-&quot; I was interrupted by the full force swing of a great mace.  My world rang as my Rune absorbed the blow, shattering into dissipating shards of magic.  As my vision cleared I saw lethal bloodlust on the face of Aatlaar.  Andalusia was charging full force now straight at the Cleric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anda, NO!&quot; I shouted as swords and mace crossed themselves. &quot;Back off both of you!&quot; I yelled.<br>
<br>
With a snarl, Andalusia backed up, not sheathing his swords.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aatlaar, what in the shit is going on!?&quot; I yelled at the panting Cleric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladida is dead, fool!&quot; he spit at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;What...?&quot; I stammered, not quite grasping.  Ladida.  If the lands of Norrath had a legend it was surely this drunken womanizing man of an odd faith.  Any tavern you went to was sure to have a story of how Ladida Hohum had done this or that.  &quot;What the hell are you saying?  Dead?  He can't be dead!&quot; I spoke, my face close to Aatlaar's.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's dead.  That fucking bitchqueen and her minions took his last breath. I'm on my way there now,&quot; he said sitting back and taking a deep breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry...&quot; I stammered for lack of better words.  &quot;I knew him, but not like you did.  My god, Aatlaar, I'm so sorry...&quot; I said lamely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry won't bring him back.  Nothing will.  But I have hate, oh do I have hate to make Cazic himself tremble,&quot; Aatlaar said the lines on his face tightening in rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know of the blood moon, Aatlaar.  The Iksar worshipped Cazic Thule as well and left many histories and prophecies behind.  You know as well as I do that marching to your death will accomplish nothing,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know nothing of this,&quot; he spat. I pulled the Mitsandu from my bag and laid it on the ground for him to see.  I opened it to the passage that concerns the blood moon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you read Chariisan?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A smattering, but I know Ancient Sebilisian as well as my own tongue,&quot; he replied looking at the pages with interest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very similar,&quot; I said pointing to the passage.  &quot;Read here,&quot; I instructed him.  He read with interest making an occasional grunt.<br>
<br>
&quot;This changes nothing,&quot; he said, sitting back.<br>
<br>
&quot;This changes everything!&quot; I shot back at him.  He leaned back and rubbed his now tired looking eyes.  This looked to have aged him years.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take your book and leave,&quot; he ordered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aatlaar-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave,&quot; he ordered again, &quot;I will consider.  The hatred burns so bright within me I don't know if I can contain it.  Tell them, tell them all what happened to Ladida.'<br>
<br>
&quot;You have my word.  The bards will sing of him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Make sure of it.  Now leave,&quot; he said as he turned to leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;May you find peace, my friend...&quot; I called after his retreating form.<br>
<br>
&quot;Andalusia, we need to get this news to our people,&quot; I said slumping to the ground.  This was the worst sort of news.  Aatlaar needed strength not weakness.  Now was my time to be weak.  My face went into my hands as I sobbed until there were no more tears.  Andalusia watched in solemn silence for a few minutes before seating himself next to me and putting his hand on my shoulder in comfort.  <br>
<br>
As the sunset we began travel south to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie to begin our journey. <p><center>
