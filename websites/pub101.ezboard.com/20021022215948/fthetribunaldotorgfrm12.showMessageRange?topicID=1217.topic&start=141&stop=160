Setting things right is a good move. But you can sure bet that a lot of people will be warry to let any trans member into their group, or be ML for that matter. Its a good move in the right direction by yourself that will probably earn back some respect, for yourself and your guild.<br>
<br>
Although the fiasco is almost at an end, be assured that like any negative media coverage, this episode will taint your reign as leadership for a long time. And probably longer for Backstabb.<br>

<br>
But on that subject, I'll raise you an Aanoene/Romy, Memmree, and a few others who are not quite as notorious.  What about them?  They sucked at their classes, trained raids, slowed raids down, etc.  Everyone hated them and begged you constantly to kick them out.  But you didn't.  <br>
<br>
So don't say &quot;I was ONLY a shitty guildleader&quot; ONCE for doing something that you constantly did.  <br>
<br>
I wasn't even talking about that though.  Im talking about the flaky reluctance to make a decision, the unwillingness to give anyone else credit for the work they were doing, (taking it for yourself even) the random sets of inactivity followed by a return where everyone should welcome you like you had not ever left, etc.  That's what I mean by shitty guildleader. <p><br>

<br>
Was Merton a good monk? Yep, sure was. I even mentioned that earlier.<br>
Was Xavre a good cleric? Hell yeah, he was one of the best clerics I have come across in EQ. He knew when to change strats and was could focus on the raid in a moments notice.<br>
Was Estevan a good mage? YOU COULD SURE SUMMON THOSE MOD RODS REAL GOOD! WAY TO FUCKING GO!<br>
<br>
Don't give credit to yourself where it isn't due you dumb piece of shit. No way am I am bashing mages, but cmon, compared to a monks or a clerics job...yours is simple for EQ.<br>

1) Ever heard of officer discussion? It takes time when you want to hear the fucking opinions of your officers before making a decision. Thinkness steps up when he needs to but for lots of situation he likes getting a clear point of view to the other people who help run the show. REAL GREEDY!<br>
<br>
2) Please name me one time when Thinkness was cocky about a strat and took all the credit for himself? Are you even talking Estevan, because all I am hearing from you is a bunch of sperm filled drivel.<br>
<br>
3) Again, give me an example of how he came back from his absence and acted like he hadn't missed anything. Then, once you do that, please tell me the way a god such as yourself would handle coming back from a need absence and trying to get back into things. It's not like he didn't know what the fuck was happening while he was gone either. Maybe you didn't know but Wildien and Thinkness are RL friends. They both founded Transcended but due to the game mechanics only one can wear the game title as &quot;Guildleader&quot;, though we all know it's not the tag that matters. Therefore Wildien is co-guildleader. Now, if Thinkness hangs out with Wildien in RL, you don't think they would talk about what's happening in game? Not only that,  but there's also a nifty little thing called a message board where the guild posts information about what it's been up to. Nope, Thinkness may not have BEEN IN GAME, but he knew what was happening inside it. Wow, would've though.... <p><hr>

<br>
It's funny I actually got more complaints about you and xavre than I did about Aanoene.  I've even lost my rep with some people/friends defending you and Xavre.  Yeah Aanoene became more trouble than an asset later which lead to her being booted.  As for Memmree, she became a really good cleric and Xavre and you were the main ones that had a problem with her.  Lots of the others got along with her just fine.  You two made things really hard on her and started a lot of shit with her for no reason just to try to piss her off enough to make her leave.  What great guildies you were.  <br>
<br>
So yeah.  I was only a shitty guildleader for not booting you guys for causing more grief than help.<br>
<br>
I know what you were talking about and you don't know shit.  Surprise as usual.  You don't know what decisions I make and well shit you've been out of Trans for a while now so you can take whatever second hand info you get about anything since you left and stuff it back up your loose ass.  Who are you to know who I give credit to and don't??  That's right, you're a nobody that doesnt know.  <br>
<br>
I don't know how you saw things, but obviously I was so power hungry, needing to take credit for everyone elses hardwork as I sat on my throne and demanded all my followers to bow down whenever they were in the presence of their all great god Thinkness.  Heh you're pretty funny lassie. Im sorry you felt the need to welcome me so warmly when I returned back to the game.  That isnt my problem you felt you needed to.  I have many friends in guild and you would think its normal for people to welcome their friends when they come back from awol.  Isn't that normal? I think its normal.  <br>
<br>
I try my best to make sure everyone in guild feels appreciated for what they do to help the guild.  I would also think that's why they are still guilded.  I never knew people gave me so much credit on things Estevan nor have I asked for it.  That is nice to know because maybe, just maybe that means I actually make some decisions.. Wow who'd of thought??? Not Thinkness Thought!!  Lots of people are given credit, so again my friend you are wrong.  Keep talking though. <p><hr>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) Ever heard of officer discussion? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No.  Im talking about decisions that he asked everyone in guildchat how they felt about it because he couldn't decide himself.  FLAKY.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) Please name me one time when Thinkness was cocky about a strat and took all the credit for himself<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That's not a question, it's a statment requesting an answer.  Therefore your question mark is incorrectly placed.  But anyway, I never said he was cocky about a strat and took credit for himself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3) Again, give me an example of how he came back from his absence and acted like he hadn't missed anything.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->When he came back from a long absence where things were really going downhill.  Wildien stepped up and got that guild back on it's feet.  He took the guild to it's first Vindi kill, which was significant at the time in regards to the guild's progress.  Thinkness came back and never even thanked Wildien in public.  Even when others on the board were doing so, he would only reply with answers like &quot;Yeah I tell Wildien what to do and stuff.  I told him how I wanted him to do things.&quot;  Instead of &quot;Thanks dude! That was really cool of you.&quot;  I commented about it at the time.<br>

I was under the impression that Rifkind and Xav were both tagged as GLs of Revo as well. It can be done. <p><center><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/P6020/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P6020CustomImage0091544.gif></center>

<br>
Funny... way back when I said a lot of this I was the one that was wrong.  The truth always comes out.<br>
<br>
I would never call Think a loot hoor because I don't remember him taking much, if anything at all (I even gave him a fungi a long time ago cause he didn't have one), but he wasn't at a fraction of the raids a lot of us were either.  Wildien was the one working to keep the guild together.  I remember working our asses off to keep things together while he was off on one of his drug trips or whatever he does, then after we finally killed Vindi he shows up again.  I WILL say he has no balls...He can hide behind posts and his little peons but not say a word to your face.  <br>
<br>
And this is just hysterical....<br>
<br>
&quot; I try my best to make sure everyone in guild feels appreciated for what they do to help the guild. &quot;<br>
<br>
Make you feel needed maybe until you might want to take some time off.  Its okay for him I guess...but the rest of you better get back to work.<br>
