I have a huge phobia of anything with 6+ legs. Spiders, scorpions, those scarabs from The Mummy. It's not so bad if their legs are too small to see, and some insects don't bother me, but some do really bad. when one gets really close every muscle in my body locks up and I can't even scream. And gods forbid if I happen to be cuddling up with someone on the couch and see a spider, I almost broke someones rib 2 weeks ago that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubebops.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bebops</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/02 8:56:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hawaiialoha.net/lilikoicandles/buttons/fugga.jpg height=195 width=176></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Weird Phobias?</span><hr size=1> I have to Agree with Ala..I HATE the sound of metal on metal.

Any job that would normally call for a cotton ball I usually subsitute with a paper towel or a soft rag. I can get use a cotton swab only if I it has the cardboard stick attached. I'm sitting here with goosebumps thinking about touching damn cotton balls now :(<br>

 The things people do with their mouths while eating completely makes my skin crawl. And what can be worse is afterward! I see alot of guys do this thing for half an hour with this vivid show of getting food out of their teeth and gums with their tongue. I can't stand that. Had one date with a guy who sat around doing that after dinner and didn't see him again just because of it.<br>

 One that I haven't noticed here that is a big one for me (ask Cartug) is being tickled. I seriously fear being tickled. My brother used to hold me down and tickle me when I was little until my ribs were purple so now if anyone even looks like they might be about to tickle me I jump and go to punch them, it seriously makes me violent. I will do anything to get someone to stop tickling me. <br>
<br>
 Spiders, bugs...yeah, I could do without them. But thunderstorms?! wow, I love them and if there is a tornado to chase in it, even better ! Dunno why, I have always had some sick fascination with tornadoes...<br>

<br>
Ya, like some chick.. Get to know her.. Respect her as a woman and all that bull shit.. Finaly get around to gettin the panties off.. and as the panties slowly comming down.. then it hits you like a sewer main backed up next to a truck stop.<br>
<br>
I fear this sittuation and have great sympathy for anyone who has had to deal with it. Here you have this girl you like but her tuna is all funky. Then the next few words that come out of your mouth are all in slow-mo and your boy is goin on strike. " I.. Think.. This .. Is.. Wrong.. " or " We... Should.. Take.. It .. Slower.. " Both of which phrases completly go against anything that has to do with being a man.<br>
<br>
Or you could go the route a friend of mine took "Girl.. your stuff is funky" .. But like him, you wont be able to get out of the room w/ out a high heel in your side and a black eye.<br>
<br>
So, in general i just fear the Bad Vagina smell and all the sittuations that come with it. <p><p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1172">

I dislike people who fail to do this, it's like their born in a fucking barn or something. I've found a good way to help people learn to put their hand up when yawning, is to throw shit into their mouth. They close their eyes when yawning, so you can just lean in and get a good aim, toss a French fry or a curled up piece of paper; anything. <br>
<br>
Being scared of heights is normal. Even animals are scared of heights, by birth. It's a natural instinct, pre-programmed. But it can be un-learned... I got assigned to doing some work in a factory once, that involved getting hoisted around in a basket, in a crane. The foreman asked me and another guy if we had a problem with heights, and we lied and said nope. We were putting insolation into the walls of this huge, tall factory building, way up, and we were both scared shitless. We were both safely inside this basket, but we barely managed to get any work done the first day, we were so scared. This third dude had done this work for years, and he jumped out of the basket and hung on to the beams in the wall like he was fucking Spiderman -- we would just about piss ourselves when he did that... <br>
<br>
But after a couple of days I got used to it, and were doing the same stuff. However, the other guy, who started at the same time as me, he never got used to it, and was sent back to his old job. The dude was so scared we joked that we could measure how far up the basket was, by how green his face was.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaeloura.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeloura </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/4/02 6:59:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/aeryn/milesCD.gif height=30 width=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Weird Phobias?</span><hr size=1> Herely!!!

<br>
My younger sister collects clown dolls, and had them displayed in her room. She had a friend that was very scared of clowns. When she would spend the night, she would turn all the clowns around so they weren't &quot;watching her while she slept&quot;.<br>
<br>
One weekend she stayed over and they fell asleep early, leaving the TV on. Since my room was next to hers, I went to shut it off so I could sleep. While I was in there, I turned all the clowns around just to see what would happen the next morning. Next thing I know I'm waking up to blood curdling screaming at 4am. The girl woke up and noticed that all the clowns were &quot;looking at her&quot;. I couldn't stop laughing, my father, however, didn't think that it was very funny. <p><A HREF="http://www.wm3.org">

<br>
I can go to the top of the Empire State Building (did twice last year) and be completely fine looking down at all the people on the streets, look at the skyline and watch a sunset or something, but as soon as I look up my legs buckle. I feel like Chicken Little and want to start calling out &quot;The sky is falling! The sky is falling!!&quot; Plus I ALWAYS do it whenever I'm at a high spot. At a mall near me, it's about 3 stories or so. I go to the top floor, look up and cringe.<br>
<br>
I absolutely LOVE to torment people by raking my nails against a chalkboard. My physics teacher my senior year still had a chalkboard, while the rest of the teachers had dry-erase boards, and I would always rake my nails across the board to annoy people. But not with utensils on a plate or chewing like a cow who just found a patch of untouched grass. It annoys me when people do it too, but not as much as the rest of you guys. Sometimes I actually do chew with my mouth open, but only cause of sinus problems, allergies, and difficulty breathing with it sometimes.<br>

<br>
I'm petrified of the crap..not the stuff that floats up on shore, or the little crap that grows near it..but if I'm swimming, and can look down and SEE it under me, or feel it touch my feet...forget it, Damn near drowned my father when I was sixteen and he tried to drag me out over some to &quot;conquer&quot; my fears. Think it stems from some weird ass dream I remember as a kid. I grew up on a lake, and I remember dreaming that I was swimming in the lake, out near the middle. I look down and it's VERY VERY deep, and seaweed is far below me. No biggie, I keep on swimming...next time I look down a big ass whale is coming up under me, mouth wide open. Woke up just as he was about to swallow my ass. <br>
<br>
Go figure, /shrug.<br>
<br>
Even odder, I used to water ski, till about age 10..that's when I fell in my first patch of seaweed, and that was the end of that.<br>
