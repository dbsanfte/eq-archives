$20 per month for DVD rentals in the mail sounds like a pretty good deal but I'm still unsure if I want to try it out.  Their web site isn't as informative as it could be.<br>
<br>
Basically, my big question is - how large is their stock of &quot;in demand&quot; movies such as new releases?  How long does it take to actually <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>get</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a new release?  And how easy/difficult was it to cancel your subscription to the service if you weren't satisfied with it.<br>

Sometimes new releases do queue up for a week or two, but ideally you'd have a list of 10-15 movies going, so if your #1 isn't available when you return a movie, they just send you the #2, and you'll probablyjust get the #1 when you return another movie (you get 3-4 &quot;out&quot; at a time, so as you return them one at a time, they send you a new one... its pretty rare that you'd return all 3-4 at once and wait for 3-4 new ones to show up).<br>
<br>
If you *ABSOLUTELY HAVE* to see a movie the day it comes out on video, go to the video store and take your chances, NetFlix is far from a guarantee.  However, if you are just content to always have 3-4 new movies lying around for when you're in the mood to watch a movie, and you don't REALLY care which 3-4 they are (since you'd only put movies on your list you wanted to watch, anyway) then its fantastic.<br>
<br>
Its FAR more convenient than a video store, and pays for itself as long as you watch 3-4 a month (assuming renting them traditionally would cost $5 each).  Needless to say, I'm a fan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=witzo>witzo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/28/03 10:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2630.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: newflix</span><hr size=1> I haven't used Netflix in two years but a roommate and I used to split the cost on Netflix and it was fantastic.  In fact when we finally cancelled the service when he got married and moved out, Netflix hadn't received one of the DVD's in the mail (must have got lost), but took my word that I had mailed it in and gave no grief regarding the issue.<br>
The way it used to work (not sure if it still does), but when they send you the dvd's theres a return shipping label that's postage paid that you just dump the DVD's in and ship them off.  <br>
<br>
Overall if your lazy and hate going to video stores and you don't like buying DVD's its a good deal.<br>
<br>
DVD's are starting to become so inexpensive though it might just be worth buying em unless you churn through 3-4 dvd's a week and can get maximum usage out of the service. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=565191 target=_blank> <img src=http://aaleni2002.com/WitzoPink.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chyra>Chyra</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>[Pickup P00ns]</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/28/03 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2630.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.leetgear.com/chereya/icon.gif width=40 height=137></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: newflix</span><hr size=1> Hey, thanks for the feeback, guys.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I forgot to ask about the average delivery time for sending and returning.  If I understand correctly, Netflix has to receive your return and &quot;check it in&quot; before they send the next movie out.<br>
<br>
So for instance, if I signed up on the 1st of the month and started a list that day, how long would it take for the first 3 to arrive?  If I watched one and dropped it in the mail the very next day, how long would it take to receive the next movie assuming that this stretch of time included return delivery, check in processing and new movie delivery?<br>

I honestly don't remember the turnover time but I don't think it was very long.  At least by having several dvd's you can send one at a time and always have the others to watch in the meantime. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=565191 target=_blank> <img src=http://aaleni2002.com/WitzoPink.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 660<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/28/03 11:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2630.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: newflix</span><hr size=1> You can't mark them on the website anymore - they have to physically receive them.  However, they'll turn them out the same day they get the order; so if you return one, the minute they get it in and marked &quot;returned&quot;, the next one on your queue will go out, typically the same day.<br>
<br>
So, let's say you live 1 day from a distribution center.  You watch a movie on sunday, and drop it in mondays mail... they get it tuesday and put a new one in the mail for you, you'll get it wednesday.<br>
<br>
Any delays in that are 100% due to USPS and how long it takes in the mail; if you live near one of their warehouses, it's literally a 2-day turnaround.  Honestly, once you get the list built and get the first few ones going, you'll never notice any delay (because you'll still have 2 unwatched ones while you're waiting 2-5 days for the next one to come in). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=matancoindancer>Matan CoinDancer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shogunofsorrow.com/jackpix/eleven-5.jpg width=135 height=135" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 968<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/28/03 12:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2630.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.shogunofsorrow.com/jackpix/eleven-5.jpg width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: newflix</span><hr size=1> Its a good deal if your constantly renting and such.<br>

Their stock is not a bad pic either.  Look at what they are doing in todays market.<br>
<br>
I am not one to tell people where to invest but I looked at it and it seems to be interesting.  Research it for yourself.<br>
<br>
I made the comment to a buddy of mine jumping in the stock market.  he did the research and put some cash in a few months back when it was lower.<br>

He is up 3k.  I dont know how much he bought though.<br>

I can't really speak for how quickly they get new releases in because we have about 30 movies in our queue so we don't always get the new ones right away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But you can reorder your queue at any time so that you can get the movies you want, when you want them.<br>
<br>
As for turn-around time, I'd say probably a week at most.  Like someone said, they ship you the next one in your list the day they get one back, and we often get a disk a day before they say it should arrive.  They'll send you an email when they receive a movie back and then when they send you one, so you know what to expect and when.<br>
<br>
Their rating service is kind of nice, too.  You can rate movies you've seen as to how much you liked them, and then they can predict how you might like other movies.  It seems to be a fairly accurate sytstem, although we've never used it to find a movie to watch.  But when we go to rate new ones and there's a suggested rating, it's usually close <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One apartment complex that we lived in was kinda trashy and we wouldn't always get our mail.  During that year, there were probably 5 or so movies that we never got.  We would go to the site and mark it, and they'd send a replacement, no questions asked.<br>
<br>
All in all, a good investment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Oh, and btw, if you are recomended by a friend, you can get a month free, but I don't know how that works exactly.<br>
