That's a fact and something I've come to accept and deal with (though sometimes it's hard!).<br><br>A little history: Forsaken Lords was started by a group of friends who left Remnants some months back.  Instead of scattering to the 4 winds, we decided to create our own guild and remain together.  Amazingly, many of our founding members are still with the guild despite head hunting by some of the bigger guilds.  Sorta tells ya what sort of folks we have here.  The ex-Rems, and many of our new additions are all very excellent people who are pretty open to sacrifice and helping their fellow guild members out.  We currently number around 55 to 60 people with an average level range of mid 40's to mid 50's.<br><br>My problem is that I don't want to seem partial in any way towards one member or another.  <br><br>If I come up with a system that basically leaves it up to the officers to decide who gets what based on merit, sort of as rewards, I will undoubtedly make some peeps angry and possibly alienate them because of a perception of favoritism.<br><br>If I come up with a &quot;point&quot; system, I'd first have to set up a &quot;point&quot; system and assign values for certain deeds.  The problem with this is that regardless of what the points &quot;say&quot;, someone will undoubtedly want to throw &quot;mitigating circumstances&quot; in as to why they should get the item vs. so and so because... blah.. blah...  and I'd be back to justifying the reason behind the decision to award this person the item.  This system is perhaps the easiset to use when defending an award.  The &quot;numbers&quot; don't lie...<br><br>If I don't have a system and just let the dice decide who gets what when, we will have angry &quot;bad luck&quot; players, or angry &quot;im always at raids but so and so gets the item on his first raid&quot; people to deal with.  And of course the guild will sort of evolve haphazardly with no real stratgey behind it.  Not my best option by far.<br><br>So I guess what I'm looking for are examples of some of the looting schemes you guys use?  But I also greatly appreciate all the responses made here.<br><br><br> <p><center>Morit ~52nd Wanderer ~ Guild Leader ~ <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bforsakenlords>Forsaken Lords</a></center><br><center><img src="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/jaykelly/_uimages/MoritSig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelcheproudfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 561<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/02 1:16:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.about.com/specials/service/promotion/sod/male_lead_stealer/josh_ryan_evans.jpg width=129 height=163></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looting system...</span><hr size=1> hey morit. <br><br>drop me a line if you want<br><br><!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: shining_path@hexenworld.com"> shining_path@hexenworld.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--><br><br>I have wrestled with loot systems for far too llng <p><font size="-2" face="verdana">Elche Proudfoot<BR><b>Founder and Chief Mystic</font><br><font color=red size="-2" face="verdana"> Shining Path</FONT></b> </FONT><BR><font color=black size=-1><I>And then she got out of the car and commenced a whooping on me,'" the victim said</i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umakino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/02 1:20:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looting system...</span><hr size=1> Have the officers decide loot.  Of course people will bitch and moan, but as has been said before, no system is perfect.  Also, officers can get the right people, who you know will stay with your guild and help you better in the long run the gear they need to be the most effective.   If you leave it up to the dice, you will see nothing but lame asses get valuable gear.  Always bear in mind, not all guildmembers are created equal.  There are those who are more vaulable to your long term success.  You can't treat your guild like a democracy when it comes to loot and expect to see tangible results anytime soon.  As Muse said, this will bog down your guild a lot.<br><br>As for the point system, either create a database to track all the crap or don't even bother because you'll be spending more time just calculating all that junk out rather than actually playing. <p><hr>Insert Cool Makino Picture Here!<br>Makino Tsukushi<br>Flowers Before Boys<br>The Companions<br>The Tribunal</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 1741<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/02 1:51:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ladida5000.homestead.com/files/ladidadwarf3.jpg height=147 width=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looting system...</span><hr size=1> Tanje, you are so wrong. There is a perfect looting system. It is one that I devised for CRoN, but unfortunately never went into effect do to those racist bastards on the naming committee.<br><br>1) Have everyone who wants an item, say in shout, “NICE!” (WOW! is also acceptable, but it must be in all caps and include at least one exclamation mark).<br><br>2) Then, after enough time so that enough people can voice that they want it, you say in shout, “let the perfect loot system begin!”<br><br>3) Then everyone starts yelling about how they deserve it more than others, and how so and so is the biggest greedy loot whore, etc. Even people who are not up for it can rag on others or say how so and so needs that item more or deserves it more. (This lasts for 4 mins.)<br><br>4) People who originally wanted the item may be able to back down if they want to if the insults get to hard or they themselves see that someone else may deserve it more. To drop out of contention, all you have to say is, “Jesus. It is just a fucking item,” “You guys take this game waaay to seriously,” or “Fuck it, I don’t want it anymore.”<br><br>5) At the end of the 4 mins, if there is only one person left, then they get the item. If not, then Catch 84 is put into effect.<br><br>Catch 84: Guildleader roles a number between 1 and 100. If the number is 1 – 30, then the raid leader loots the item and may destroy it or just tell everyone he did. If the number is 31-70, then it goes to the person who the raid leader thought was the best in insults and reasoning. The losers of the Rule 84, have to remove their pants or greaves for the remainder of the raid unless later they loot greaves or pants later on and can then wear those. <p><BR><B><FONT color="gold">Ladida Hohum<BR>Vicar of The Tribunal Server<BR>Retired from the Elitists<BR><a href="http://pub90.ezboard.com/bcablerepairmenofnorrath">Co-Guildleader to the Cable Repairmen of Norrath!</a><BR>Follower of Brell</FONT></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uestevaneldiabolo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Estevan Eldiabolo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mock turtleneck sweaters<br>hide my bewbs right?</span><br>  Posts: 530<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/02 1:55:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/ssswomac/tee_cont.gif width=100 height=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looting system...</span><hr size=1> I like the class leader system.<br>I.E. ->  Class leaders or placeholder for CH sends a tell to raid leader for his/her classe's representative for that piece. Hopfully the class leader is well aware of what pieces that their classmates have already, what needs updgrading, etc.<br><br>If you have the right class leader in place, they will help you to make sure that the loot is assigned fairly.  They will hopefully weed out those members who rarely log on and only raid when they think they'll get something out of it.  <br><br>As your guild grows, hopefully your members will learn that raiding is a part of exploring and conquering new things, as opposed to being a way to attain presents for going.  It seems like it takes a raid crew a while to get past this stage sometimes, because everyone wants all the new toys.  But once you start getting equiped it's common to see people passing on a item that they may be able to use but is a better upgrade for someone else. <br><br>I just suggest avoiding the loot whores like the plague.  If you award them with loot you're only encouraging them to keep bitching and moaning about it.

It's what happened afterwards that sort of got some peeps on edge.<br><br>Without going into too many details, here is what happened in a nutshell.<br><br>A bracer is dropped in Kael.  All the appropriate peeps roll for item and peep (1) wins the item, obviously beating out some other peeps.  No probs, everyone is satisfied that the item was won fair and square.<br><br>After the raid, peep (1) gets approached by peep (2)... <br><br>... and peep (2) basically makes his case to peep (1) that peep (2) and the guild would be better served by peep (2) getting the high ac on the bracer vs. what peep (1) would gain from it.    <br><br>Peep (1) agrees, and multiquests the bracer with peep (2) in exchange for some twink gear.<br><br>Ok, bear with me because we have one more peep (3) to throw into this mess.<br><br>Anyway, peep (3), who lost out on the bracer when it was rolled upon, hears that peep (1) and peep (2) have MQ'ed the item.  Peep (3) feels that if peep (1) had no intention of using the item for himself, he should have excluded himself from the rolling and let those that were going to actually use the item, roll.  He's a little put off by it, but by no means rabid or anything.<br><br>Anyway, a post is made on our boards that we are going to be looking at trying to iron out a system where some &quot;rules&quot; are put forth to govern items looting, multiquesting and so on and so forth....<br><br>Well, Peep (1) and Peep (2) get upset, figuring the post is aimed at them (it really wasn't, we had been discussing making up a loot system for the longest time), and post a couple of somewhat irritated posts defending their actions and all that good stuff.  Anyway, the post starts to deteriorate so it's locked and eventually deleted and so here I am... looking for some help in trying to avoid these sorts of problems.  <br><br>And before any of you start passing judgements, all of the peeps (1,2 and 3) are all good, loyal and trusted members of the guild, none of them are what you would call loot whores.  So please, no bashing.  <br><br>Thanks for your time.<br><br> <p><center>Morit ~52nd Wanderer ~ Guild Leader ~ <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bforsakenlords>Forsaken Lords</a></center><br><center><img src="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/jaykelly/_uimages/MoritSig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utrujabi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trujabi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/02 3:51:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1394.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looting system...</span><hr size=1> if you didnt want people passing judgements, dont post situations.
