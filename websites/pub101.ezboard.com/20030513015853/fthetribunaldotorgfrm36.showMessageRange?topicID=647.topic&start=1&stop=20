He is a &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; believer and is generally very paranoid. I told him he was being childish and stupid, but was well within his right to do it as long as he wasn't doing it to incite a riot (that whole yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a theatre thing). Personally, I don't see how burning the US flag in the US can ever be any safer than telling a thousand strangers that their mother was a whore. One of them is going to punch you out, so how is it protected speech? But, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> won't stop him from his Jehova-given right to be a moron if he choses.<br>
<br>
Now for the real meat of this story. He became upset when someone mentioned that a constitutional ban on flag burning was a good idea. His main complaint was that it infringed on his rights to free speech. He went off for about 5 minutes on how the constitution was a sacred document and conservatives were ruining America by not protecting it and instead actively attacking the ACLU. I told him if flag burning became a constitutional amendment then he really couldn't bitch about anything since it would be part of the constitution, and basically the will of the majority. I tried to understand his point of view that the fundmentals of the constitution could not be amended, but he started yelling after I reminded him it was an amendment that abolished slavery (he was black), so I left.<br>
<br>
So why do liberals feel the need to envoke the constitution only when it suits their needs? OK, loaded question. But really, I see it all the time, even here. The constitution becomes the holiest document when refering to right to speech and fair trial, but mention that powers not expressed are delegated to the states, and they look at you like you have a third eye. I get the feeling that it doesn't fit their Big Government New Deal Agenda, so it has always been ignored. I see the same double standard when it comes to the broad interpretation of the first amendment into the untouchable &quot;free speech&quot; and the interpretation of religous freedoms into &quot;speration of church and state&quot;, and then they do a 180 on the second amendment to limit its interpretation to &quot;guns for the Nantional Guard only&quot;. How does this make sense? It doesn't to me. I think this is just the tip of the iceburg on a vast left wing conspriacy by socialists. <br>
<br>
Haha, OK so maybe I really don't. But last friday's Penn and Teller's Bullshit sure did. They were dealing with enviromentalists, but the message was the same. Impressional youths were being preyed upon and lied to by people with a socialist agenda in order to attack corporations and more specifically free market capitalism. They even got the organizer of an earth day rally to sign a petition banning Dihydrogen Monoxide (Water), simply because they told her it was a chemical used in nuclear power plants (duh). They revealed her as a follower and one that takes to issues without doing any research. This stance was shocking to see from self proclaimed liberals like P&amp;T. When I look back at the stories of recent anti-war marches in major cities, which are very expensive to organize, being funded by the Socialist Workers party (communists) and ANSWER (more communists), I think maybe P&amp;T are on to something. And I'll admit that both sides are being manipulated, money will always do that. Although I still have my doubts that big oil influenced the administration to go to war with Iraq.<br>
<br>
So why can't flag burning bans be amended into the constitution? I'm all about freedoms, but really, this is such a non issue, its like calling for a constitutional ban on pumpkin chunkin. If the majority of the US feels so strongly about an issue that they are willing to amend the constitution, and I oppose that decision I would either live with it or I would vote for people who would overturn it. What I wouldn't do is burn the symbol of the country I claim to love. That just seems idiotic to me. But knock yourself out if it works for you. <br>
<br>
I don't hope my coworker gets arrested and his security clearance revoked, but he'll have no sympathy from me if he does. I'm only a small &quot;L&quot; libertarian, after all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

I also am rather anti-gun, but I don't interpret the 2nd amendment to say anything other than I have the right to own one if I want.  Same sorta thing - if I were really *THAT* against personal firearms, I'd move somewhere that outlawed them.<br>

I'm not quite sure what the issue is, I guess; our country operates on the will of the majority, and those who don't like it are free to leave. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadaetidalstorm>Jadae Tidalstorm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~jadae/pain.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 429<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/21/03 10:16:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=647.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Random small &quot;L&quot; libertarian rantings</span><hr size=1> Just tell him it's perfectly in his rights to dress the flag up all perdy-like, buy a coffinn and have a service for it.

Seeing as burning a cross is met with anger which can then lead to conflict.....<br>
<br>
burning a flag is often met with anger which can then lead to conflict.....<br>
<br>
Both groups have the &quot;freedom of speech&quot;.  The problem with both is the same, in that they are likely to invoke anger in another group, and is often done so for the express purpose of invokeing that anger.<br>
<br>
So from the view of &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;, how is burning a flag any different than burning a cross.<br>
<br>
Freedom of Speech doesn't just protect the speech that most people &quot;like&quot;, for if that's all it did, it wouldn't be a real freedom. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It can ONLY be made illegal in limited circumstances.<br>
<br>
ie.  Burning a cross AT a KKK rally is protected speech (just as burning a a flag at a peace rally is)<br>
<br>
Burning a Cross can ONLY be made illegal if its intended purpous is to intimidate/terrorize.  (Burning a cross in the front yard of a Black family is the best example)<br>
<br>
If you can come up with a similar intimidation/terroristic purpouse to burning a flag, then in THAT specific situation it can be made illegal also.  <br>
<br>
NO right given by the Constitution is absolute.<br>
<br>
And I might add that emphacizing certain rights and downplaying others is hardly the exclusive play ground of liberals.  Who do you thinks pushed the hardest for the vast increase in the Federal Govmt's, role in basic crime?  It wasn't the liberals.<br>
<br>
Conservatives have been just as happy to downplay certain things as well to push THIER agenda. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
