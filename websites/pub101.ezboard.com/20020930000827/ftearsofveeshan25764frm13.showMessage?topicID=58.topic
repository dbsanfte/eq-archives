Some of you may know that I have been promissing a story to explain where Avyriel has been for quite a bit. Well this is it !!!It covers everything from her mystious disapearance nearly 3 months ago and why she is not seen nearly as much as she use to. Hope every one likes it (^_^)  ))<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ayvriel laid in her bunk at the Tears compound, at was late and everyone else was sound asleep.  Avyriel wished she was asleep as well, anything whould be better then laying awake with her thoughts.  She sighed deeply and rolled over on her side tring to get comfortable.  Finding her side  no better, she flung herself on to her back .<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;What am I doing here?&quot; her mind asked.    &quot;Following your destiny&quot; she answered to herself silently.  Her mind reeled,  &quot;No, my destiny is back at Kerra Isle,&quot; a battle was begining in her, torn between duty, destiny, happiness, and a promisme she had made many months ago.  &quot;I don't want to be here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You have to be here you have your duties&quot;, came the answer.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And what about the children?  I am all they have left&quot;. She tried to argue.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;They are safe and thanks to you will live very happy lives on Kerra Isle.&quot;  the other voice replied, always it tried to validate her desion to leave.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But I was happy there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You didn't become a Paladin to be happy, you can not ignore your destiny. Besides you are only truly happy when you are fighting.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No that can't be true! I was happy with the children, and... I..I.. promised that I whouldn't fight anymore&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The voice in her head took on a more sinister tone &quot;Thinking about the dream again, and what happened at the outpost?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No!&quot;she nearly screamed, but instead she sat up in bed and gave up on sleep.  She put her hands to her face and rubbed her eyes. Her nightgown clung gently to her body.   Slightly damp from a cold sweat that poured from her brow.  As she stood up and walked over to her wash basin. Taking a handfull of water she splashed her face.The cool water was refreshing and it helped clear her mind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Avyriel walked over to the window and opened the shutters, a gentle breeze caressed her face she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The air had a sweet scent to it, a mix of wildflowers and pine. Finally she felt a little more relaxed, she liked the wind, and whould offten pause during the day to turn her face towards it and simply enjoy the sensation of it on her face. Feeling calmed and relaxed, she allowed her self to reflect on the events the had brought her to this place and this time. Slowly the memories flooded back....<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Avyriel leaned over the edge of the rail of the boat, the best place for her to ride concidering her dislkie of boats. The sea was thankfully calm and her lunch was in no danger of getting lost. She was heading to see the Sister of Erolisi Marr or Sister Island to seek thier help and guidance, about an issue that had been troubling her.  So lost in thought she didn't notice the large shadow that cast itself over the ship.  It was the sceams of her fellow passangers that finally made her turn around.  She was just in time to see the cyclops'  massive fist as it smashed into the deck, snapping the planking like tinder wood.  A large section of the deck came hurling towards her, to late to move she took the full force of the blow and was knocked over board and quickly blacked out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I think she's dead&quot; was the first voice she remebered hearing, as a stick was beening roughly prodded into her ribs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;She is not Dran, I can see her breathing, we should get her off the beach before the others find us. and stop poking her with that stick.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Two small forms grabbed Avyriel's limp body and begain draging her off the beach an in to the nearby forest.  The trip took the trio up hill and past a small waterfall formed by a sping in a moss covered cliff. The fall formed a small pool several feet wide before draining into a stream that ran back twards the beach.  Further past the pool and fall there was a small opening in the cliff, well hiden by two large boulders at the entrance. Inside was a small oval shaped cavern that branched into two smaller holes. Across the entrances to those where makeshift curtains block the view of what lay beyond. The room was lit with a two light stones from wisps and on the floor there was a mat and an two crates laid out as chairs.<br>
<br>
A small high pitched voice rang out from behind one of the curtains. &quot;Yay! Dran and Arisa home.&quot; and a small human girl of about six ran out from the curtain. She stopped and let out a gasp as she saw the Paladin's limp body being dragged in, by her twin brother and sister her seniors by five years.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aurora, run and get us some water for her from the pool.&quot; her brother Dran said as he kicked a beatup bucket towards her, and contuined to strugle with his share of the burden that was the semi-consious paladin Avyriel. She moaned slightly and then all was black once more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next few days seemed to meld togther in a fog of pain and partial awareness.  Avyriel only rembered partial images and sensations from those days.  Mostly of a throbing pain in her side and head.  Sometimes broken by a gentle touch and a cool moist dressing applied to her head every so offten.  Whether she dreamed at all in this semi awake state, she chould not recall, but if she did then she was certin that even in her wildest dreams that the events to come chould have been seen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her saviors where three small children, the twins, Arisa and Dran and their younger sister Aurora. A more unlikely rescue chould not have been planned by Bristlebane himself, as the three where befret of parents or guadians of their own. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Arisa was the thinker of the small band, quite and thoughtful she seemed to radiate an aura of control about her, as if she had years of experiance far beyond her youthful age.  She was also as gentle as she was wise, for it was her hand that tended to Avyriels' wounds.  Her long red hair, was pulled into ponytail that fell to her mid-back, it showed signs of neglect that one whould expect from living  in a cave on an uncharted island. Even with the grime of the life she lived her emerald green eyes shone with a light that chould be found in only two other places in all Norath. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of those places was in the eyes of her twin brother Dran, mischivous and brash, Dran was everything his sister was not.  Trouble seemed to follow in his wake and one had to wonder if Dran might be an Avatar of Bristlebane himself, if not one that was blessed, or perhaps cursed with the Lord of Pranks touch.  Unlike Arisa, Dran's hair though matted and dirty was closer to the color of a black coal on a hot forge, touched faitly with a touch of crimson from the embers below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last place that the emerald glow could be found was in the bright and innocent eyes of Aurora, youngest of the three siblings.  Shy and quite Aurora rarely spoke and when she did it was normaly only with Dran and Arisa, as she tended to hide behind them when ever anyone else was near.  She had a quality to her that was hard to describe.  One could jouney a thousand leagues and be ready to collapse of fatigue, but one look at Aurora's eyes and one whould be as light as a feather and could not help but find themselves smiling<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Perhaps the Twins of Marr played a hand in delivering Avyriel to the children. For as they rescued her she in turn whould now be in position to aid and protect them.  Though a tropical paradise the island was anything but safe. A small Teir'Dal outpost was on the island and only by the grace of the gods had the children gone unnoticed. The outpost was a trading port of sort, the Dark Elves took advantage of the pirates of the area, and used them to secretly attack shipments of value bound for Freeport or Kaladim. A perfect setup, should anyone survive an attack the pirates not the Tier'Dal took the blame.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was onto this island that Avyriel had landed, a paladin skilled in the ways of warfare aganst the Dark Elves. For her heart carried  a scar apon it, that burned like a searring iron at the slightest sight of one.  Few escaped the talons of the Lighthawk when she was seeking prey.  Teir'Dal had learned to fear her blade and avoid her vengeful gaze. Such was her hatred she carried for them that many times she whould make trips to the dark woods just to seek them out. Then again having ones famliy butchered infront of your eye will do that.  Such scars sometimes never heal, but sometimes fate intervenes.....<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Avyriel spent many days living with the children in the samll cave and soon regain much of her strength. The benifit to the children was noticable right away. With the paladins' help they where able to catch and find far more food then normal, and if not for the outpost and the events of a certain day the story may have ended there, the four living out thier lives on the small island. But Destiny can sometimes be a  cruel misstress with her lessons. On that day Destiny was a very bad girl. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It started with Arisa, Aurora, and Avyriel going out to gather some vines and reeds to fasion a new sleeping mat for Avyriel.  It had been weeks since any of them had seen the Tier'Dal, their outpost was on the other side of the island and the rarely came to this side. So one could forgive the paladin for her lapse in judgement and leaving behind her blade.  They did not hear the dark elves as they aproached and only barely made into the bushes as they neared.  Arisa though was on the far side of the field that the were in and was separated from Aurora and Avyriel as the Teir'Dal nearly twenty strong entered the field on a disaplinary patrol ordered by thier comander for some unlnown offence. All whould have gone well if not for the last of them. He paused as if sensing somthing was amiss and called to the others. he drew his blade and cautiously move in the direction of Aurora and Avyriels' hiding spot. Before Avyriel had a chance to act Arisa spang form her hiding spot and ran off down the trail away from her sister and the paladin in an a successful atempt to lead the dark elves away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The company of Teir'Dal quickly took after the young girl and sone caught up with her and Avyriel cursed her forgetfulness for leaving behind her weapon. Outnumbered and without a blade there was little she could do as Arisa was lead off to the outpost on the farside of the island. It was not long after the llast of the dark elves where gone that Aurora begain to sob. Avyriel lifted up the inconsolable child and returned to the cave, not to retreat but to prepare. The burning of her own tears where matched only but the burnning of the scar on her chest. It burned with a fire that needed to be quenched, and only the blood of Teir'Dals whould do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It took only a few moments to get her arms and armor ready. She left Aurora with Dran and gave him a spare blade, incase Arisa was forced to give away the location of the cave. Ayvriel moved swftly to the beaches on the otherside of the island.  Even so it was nearing nightfall by the time she neared the huts of the camp. To her surprize she found the outpost lightly guarded. The guards appeared distracted and many busily hurried about preparing a bon fire and several torches were being placed in a circle around to fire. Two of the Tier'Dal appeared in preist robes and set about setting up a makeshift altar at the head of the circle. The bile climbed in Avyriels'  throat as it became clear that the Dark Elves where preparing for a ritual of some sort. Her mind reeled with the thought of a sacrifitial offering, with poor Arisa as its sacrifice. Still she managed to stay calm and watched as the priests and guards continued thier work.  In so doing rightfully guessed that a small hut behind the fire held the captive Arisa.  Avyriel made her way to the back of the hut, its grass and hide sides gave way quickly to her blade, as she slowly cut an opening into the side of the hut.  There she found Arisa, her hands bound behind her and her body covered in runes that apeared to be writen in blood, There where a number of  small but intricatly cut pattens on both her arms that still ozzed slightly. Yet she was still alive though a bit surprized to see the fully armed Avyriel by her side.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Shhhhh.&quot; hushed Avyriel as she removed the rag that was shoved in Arisas mouth and cut the girls bonds..  Arisa responded by tightly wraping her arms around the paladin, in a near choke hold.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That was very brave of you, to run like that but very foolish as well&quot; she gently scolded. Arisa started to reply but was quickly quited by the paladin as she put her finger softly over Arisa's lips.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We are not safe yet. hide yourself here in the hut and no matter what you hear do not leave till I come for you.&quot; Avyriel added as she stood up. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a cold and dark expression on the paladins face, devoid of any expression. She seamed to stare at a distant person oor object that was beyond Arisas' sight. It frightened the young girl, to her it looked like the face of a person that had accepted a grim fate and yet was still determinded to meet that fate head on. Part of the girl wanted to cry out for Avyriel to stay, but another part was to frighten of what it saw in the paladins face to do so. So she did as she was told and found a spot among the boxes in the back to hide. As Avyriel left, walking out the front door, she added &quot;Remeber do not move till I come for you, there are things here that no child should ever have to see and I whould protect you from them if I may.&quot; With that she was gone she step out of the hut and into the clearing outside.What happened next would set new scars into the souls of both Avyriel and Arisa.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At first Arisa remained hiden out of terror. the sounds of the battle outside where terrible to her the screams of the dying mixed with the moans of the wounded.   Above it all the constant sound of metal on metal clanging together only to be punctuated but the sickening sound of steel apon flesh or bone.  But worse of all the the smell, a thick and stomach churning aroma of copper, the smell of blood spilled in large amounts.  After a while it was more then poor Arisa could stand and her consitution failed her.  Her stomach revolted and she spent many minutes wretching and vomiting.  Finally the sounds of battle subsided replaced by the soft moans of the dying and wounded.  And then something odd, a soft noise that Arisa could not place. She heared it several times and each time the wailing became softer and more faint.  Finally her curosity became to great to fight and she walked outside the hut.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Arisa emerged just in time to see Avyriel putting the last of the Teir'Dal out of it's misery. She was spattered with blood. It matted her golden hair and spotted her face with small flecks of crimson. Their was a small cut on her left cheek and a slighly larger wound  was hidden by her armor just above her right hip. She bent forwar and held her hip with her free left hand as her right finished it grim work.  Around her the sand was soaked in blood, and the bodies of the dark elves laid in heaps at her feet.  Some where little more then unidentifiable chunks of blue flesh and gore.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The blood drained from Arisa's face and she tuned a deathly pale white.  She felt faint and let out a small gasp.  Avyriel turned quickly towards the small child, her sword ready and a wild look in her eyes. She had been expecting another Tier'Dal, not a small frightened child.  She had the look of a crazied beast about her, more feral the human.  The two stood and stared at each other their eyes locked, Avyriel chould see the terror in Arisa she was afraid, not of the dark elves but of Avyriel.  She dropped her gaze and looked at the carnage around her and was painfully aware of what she had done. The outpost was empty save for her self and Arisa.  She had killed themm all, not one Teir'Dal was left alive. Her blade fell from her hand and she walked to Arisa, but as she reached down for the child Arisa recoiled and pulled away. &quot;By Marr what have I done.&quot; thought Avyriel.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The trip back to the cave was quite and sullen. neither could find words that spoke any clearer the the heavy silence.  As they pasted the pool near the cave Avyriel stop and finally broke the deafening silence.  &quot;We shoud stop here and clean up&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The girl nodded and allowed Avyriel to help her undress and wash off  the dark runes, and tend to the wounds left by the glyphs carved in to her arms.  Agin the silence grew as the two bathed, yet again it was Avyriel who broke it.  &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't want you to see any of that.  That is why i asked you to stay in the hut.&quot;  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You didn't have to kill them all&quot; Arisa said and tears welled up in her eyes. &quot;Why... why, didn't you just grab me and leave?.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Because they whoold have followed eventully, their was no other choice killing them was the only way to make sure that  all of you whould be safe.&quot; Avyriel rationalized, but somewhere inside her a part of her that had died on the day of her families death, slowly begain to stir. For the first time she wondered if  her rightous quest of vengance was as rightous and just as she thought. She continued to tried to explain to  herself and Arisa.  &quot;Teir'Dal are evil and ville creatures, they ...they  are  devoid of love and think nothing of killing those they consider unworth..y&quot;  Her last words hung in the air and landed in her heart like the head of a sledge hammer. She relized the same description chould be aplied to her as well. She stared blankly at Arisa, but inside her she begain to question everything she belived in. A nagging question begain to gnaw at her and the voice made its first appearance &quot;Why do you fight?  To protect you freinds?  Or for your owm hate and need for vengance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It took several days for Arisa and herself to recover, and it was only after promising to never fight again that Arisa finally returned to her normal self. Without the Tier'Dal getting off the island was easy the Outpost was well stocked, though Arisa refused to go near it. There was also a small boat docked nearby. It took a few days to prepare the ship and a week of sailing to find land. Eventully in an effort to hide the childred from Eglath and the Order they headed to Kerra Island.  It was durring the trip to the isle that the dream frist begain but it was the last night on Kerra Isle that had been buried in her mind and soul......<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Avyriel stood alone in the darkness, &quot;A cavern perhaps?&quot; She thouhgt to her self, but she was unable to recall how she got there.  A noise, an ever so tiny sound, like the sound of a feather falling or the breath of the dead.   Though not sure if she had even heard the sound, Avyriel reached  for her blade to he surprize twas not Soulfire nor Ghoulbane at her side but a massive great sword.<br>
<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Long in reach and wide in girth, the blade was darkand  twisted.  An errie pale green light shone keenly from its well honed edge.   It seemed as though it should weigh far too much to wield, but Avyriel found the blade light and nimble. Almost as if  it had been made with her in mind so perfect it felt in her hands.  The pale light from the blade's edge illuminated the darkness about her, yet stilll no sign of a cieling or walls did she see.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The hair on her neck begain to stand on end, and a wave of dread passed through her. She begain to pray for a sound, a rattle, a noise of any kind, as long as it shattered the deafining silence.  Slowly she peered in to the darkness, seeking a sign of some kind. Something was comming she chould feel it, but what she did not know. Sweat begain to bead upon her brow, and her grip on the mystrious blade tightened. &quot;Thump Thump&quot; her heart pounded and her breath came in ragged gasps.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;Calm yourself  Lighthawk there is nothing for you to fear hear in the darkness, for there is nothing created by the dark that could match as you are now.&quot; a calming voice spoke to her inside her head.<br>
<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Avyriel opened her mouth to respond when at that moment the silence was broken by the battle cries of many Teir 'Dal.   She found her self  surounded by them, charging and shouting obsenities at her.  the first of the hoard reach her and fell before he chould even realize how fast her blade was. The rest did no better one affter anouther fell to the dark blade, sometime one at a time and at time two or more wher hewn down in one mighty stroke. Yet still they came wave after wave.  the bodies around her begain to pile up, and around her feet thier blood pooled into a great puddle. Her face was spattered with it, her shinning armor now shone a dull crimson as it was smeared with it, and her golden hair was matted and damp with it.  The stench of death permeated the air.  It was a bitter copper scent, that to Avyriel now suddenly found as sweet as the aroma of a rose, and she let out a shrill laugh of pure delight.<br>
<br>
    When finally the last of  the Teir'Dal lay in his pile next to his kin, she sat down in the middle of her handie work.  The battle must have taken many hours yet she was not weary, full of enrgy she felt as if alive for the first time. She had always enjoyed the thrill of battle but this, this was differant a wave of extasy that seemed to wash over her.<br>
    &quot;Well done Lighthawk, Well done.&quot; the voice had returned. &quot;I knew you where capable but I never dreamed I whould find my Champion among one of your race..&quot;<br>
      <br>
     &quot;Why is that?&quot; Avyriel replied half giggling, as she laid back to stare into the deapths of the darkness above.   The voice took on a sinaster and dark tone as it replied.   &quot;Because, the Teir'Dal are my children and  where created to hate.&quot;  Avyriels face went blank as she tried to  scramble to her feet. As she did she lost her footing on the blood slicked floor and fell into the pool face first. The salty tast of blood filled her mouth and she begain to wretch. Still the voice continued cackling gleefully.<br>
       &quot;A Paladin of Mithaniel Marr no less!  Yet your hatred for my children is far stronger then anything I chould have instilled apon them myself .&quot;   The voice was now filled with a terrible delight and seemed to be quite satisfied with its self. while on the ground Avyriel body shook as the blood on the ground begain to flow towards her and started to engulf her. Unimaginable pain filled every fiber of her being, as if her body was being slowly torn apart.<br>
        &quot;Never chould I have even dreamed of creating anthing as delious as you my dear, and now i shall give you your just reward for your service to me. Arise anew and accept my gift to you.&quot; The voice was now cackling manically as Avyriel meekly tried to stand in her new Teir'Dal blue body...<br>
<br>
<br>
      <br>
     Arisa woke with a start at the scream from the next room, but knew instantly what had happened. She threw herself out of her bed and ran to the to door leading to the other room.  She pushed open the door and walked half ran in.    &quot;Avyriel? Lady Avyriel are you OK?&quot; she whispered into the dark of the room.<br>
Avyriel sat upright in her bed, her body drenched in a cold sweat, her breath ragged, and her heart about to leap from her chest.  She sat there with her bed sheets pull tightly to her chest and stared blankly at the wall as she tried to regain her breath. Then she felt a small but warm hand touch her shoulder.  &quot;Miss Avyriel was it the dream again?&quot;   Avyriel turned her head to face the soft voice that came from over her left shoulder and looked into the bright green eyes and ember red hair of the young Arisa.<br>
<br>
    At only twelve years old Arisa was in many ways like the  Paladin whos bed she now sat on both had lost thier parents to a Teir'Dal attack, but some how Arisa escaped the bitterness and hatred that has cunsumed Avyriel.  Arisa's eyes reflected the beauty the young girl saw in everything. One could not look in to them and not be moved and comforted.<br>
&quot;Yes it was the dream again.&quot; Avyriel replied weakly still trembling slightly,&quot;But Dream is not the word I would chose for it&quot;. The young girl noded in agreement.   &quot;Did I wake the others?&quot; asked Avyriel   &quot;No, Aurora whould be crying if she was awake and Dran chould sleep through a cyclops stampead&quot; Arisa huffed obviously not too fond of her brother's penchant for over sleeping.  Avyriel lied back down in her bed and was about to tell Arisa to go back to bed when she was surprized by  finding a mess of red hair on her chest.  <br>
    &quot;Whould it be alright if I stayed here with you for a while Avyriel?&quot; Arisa asked. The stunded paladin found herself at a lost for words and chould not help but ponder just how wize Arise might be. Was it that her young ward was frightened, or that she was only pretending to be so as to comfort Avyriel?   Avyriel gently place her hand on Arisa's head and said &quot;Alright, but just for a little bit you should go back to your own bed though&quot;, Arisa's head lifted slightly and Avyriel quickly added &quot;But I guess we can make an exception tonight.&quot;   With that the child's arms wraped tightly around her and  the tangle of hair snuggled itself against her chest.....<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some how the memory of that last night in Kerra Isle commforted the paladin as she looked out the window and stared at the moon. But it was not the moon that she wa looking at it was at an uncertain future and the difficult questions she must still answer, if she is to find a reason to fight again.  The mark and her newly found destiny where stromg pulls and her sense of duty forced her to stay. Yet a part of her wanted to scream &quot;Destiny be damned all I want now is to be happy!&quot;...<br>
