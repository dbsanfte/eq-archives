<br>
Actually FCFS IS technically what Verant has decided for the planes.  Go to hate and you will understand that crossagroing each other is actually quite easy to do.  Now there have been circumstances such as epic mobs where the server GMs will make you roll on that spawn, but as for this perceived threat of these guilds who are left out of the planes all the time (loosely paraphrased) I don't see this happening.<br>
<br>
For example, I go to Hate and am there say 50 minutes and I cleared to maestro room.  You enter Hate and decide oh what they hell, we'll pull to NE corner.  Eventually, your puller and my puller will bump into each other with mobs and guess what? Everyone dies :P<br>
<br>
You also state that the real hard work is breaking the plane.  If this is the case, then why would you go up after someone is already up there and avoid the real work as you like to think of it?<br>
<br>
You do realize that for those guilds that MUST plan their RLs around a planar raid that yes, this is actually real work for them to organize this up.  Don't cheapen this and blow it off as not being real work.  For those guilds that have large amounts of people online at any given time that they want to raid, then that again is work because they took the time and recruited all those people.  Don't cheapen their efforts for making their guild strong and keeping it that way.<br>
<br>
The planar raid schedules were only for Hate and Fear.  Even with FCFS the planes are hardly occupied all the time.  Plane of Growth doesn't see all that much action really, and it is definitely possible to schedule a raid for there internally for your guild and go there and find that it is open.  Not only are the drops better, but also it is a harder plane to do and therefor more &quot;real work&quot; to break.  Although I understand that people on Tunare religion are adverse to killing in this plane, for the most part I don't see a lot of them doing any of these quests in there apart from the odd Ranger or Paladin.  <br>
<br>
I think Legendary took this path and went to Plane of Growth on a regular basis, outfitted their guild with armor that was equivalent and sometimes better than the highend kunark armor, and now that they are set there they have moved on and hell they even killed the Statue of Rallos Zek in Kael the other week.  In my mind, they had the right mentality and this is what has made them successful.  They did not get trapped into thinking they MUST go to Hate and Fear.  Legendary people, please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.<br>
<br>
There are also a gazillion things, in my opinion that people can do these days other than raid the planes.  For example, there are plenty of places in Kunark that could provide plenty of raiding that remain for the most part unutilized (deep chardok springs to mind) or heck even going deep into the Hole would provide a nice, hard challenge.  Then there are the Velious zones that could provide plenty of great raids.  I think with all the new content that has been added since the planes were first introduced, people have to expand their mindset beyond the thinking they must get their clerics Ethereal Mist armor for example.   <p><hr>

What I was offended by was the accusation that those who want a schedule, don't want work for it.  That is a load.  FCFS/Schedule require the same amount if different kind of work.  Organizing for a scheduled raid and organizing a DO IT NOW raid require the same amount of work, it is just done differently.  It is great that some guilds have built up to a size where they have no problem working in a FCFS system.  But they still represent a fraction of the player base.  <br>
<br>
It should not require joining one of the half-dozen largest guilds on a server in order to be able to play the high-end game.  Those guilds certainly don't want to invite every player who may want to do those things(even if they are competent) and all those players should not have to face staying with there friends or going to where they can still progress.<br>
<br>
Again I put a lot of blame on VI for not thinking through more carefully the implications of some of the decisions they made for the basic and generally unchanngeable aspects of the game design.<br>
<br>
As to VI backing FCFS in the Planes, well when the 2nd schedule system fell apart, and WoP and Consaguine found themselves in the same Plane at the same time.  GM's were called but they did not give a damn bit about &quot;2&quot; entities being up there, they only cared about the &quot;training&quot; accusations that were flying between the 2 raids.  In the end they did NOTHING.<br>
<br>
PoG is not an option for a lot of us, and I would LOVE to hit more of Velious but that target level is just a tad above what is needed for the old world planes.  Kunark well Yes I like hunting the lesser occupied zones but Then again, I want my shot at an epic eventually just like everyone else.<br>
<br>
FCFS works best when the demand is less than or equal to the supply.  When the demand is more than the supply people get left out.  Often for reasons that ARE beyond thier control.<br>
<br>
Now it is the easiest system to enforse universally.  mostly because it IS generally accepted that taking advantage of someone elses break is at best bad form because that is the real work.  And because it is not realy possible to take advantage of someone elses organization.  That is something that even a Plane jumper will have to do for them selves. <p><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Ranger of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Etheios</font></b><br><img src=http://www.geocities.com/radgen/source/tiger_run_md_clr.gif>

<br>
<br>
Let's go back to the amusement park analogy and emphasize a couple of things.  <br>
First, a ride will only hold X number of people.  <br>
<br>
Second, you can only ride a ride once per day; in some cases once per 3 days; and in other cases once per 7 days.  <br>
<br>
Third, there is a limited number of &quot;fun&quot; rides and it's time consuming to get to all of them. (i.e. if you race for a ride and lose, it could cost you as much as half of a day leaving much less time to &quot;find&quot; another open ride)<br>
<br>
Fourth, and this is a big one, many people by virtue of time zone and/or playtime slot, get into the park before everyone else.<br>
<br>
Finally, the park sells daily tickets without regard for the number of rides available.  So that the number of people grossly outnumber the available &quot;fun&quot; rides.  Many people that have purchased tickets will rarely get to ride a &quot;fun&quot; ride untill &quot;funner&quot; rides open up and people move on.<br>
<br>
Summations..<br>
<br>
There is no amusement park in the world like this, but it makes the analogy accurate.  The reason there is no amusement park in the world like this is because it wouldn't work, it's a design flaw.  So the bottom line is that it's VI's fault, period.<br>
<br>
Now, let's assume that one did exist..<br>
<br>
If they were children/teenagers..<br>
The patrons would band together in sizes of X or greater and jump on every &quot;fun&quot; ride they could as soon as they could.  They would have no concern for anyone else aside from getting as many &quot;fun&quot; rides as possible.  <br>
Early time zone &quot;children&quot; would get there pick of &quot;fun&quot; rides, only losing out on those that don't come available until later in the day, this is rare and unpredictable.  <br>
Larger &quot;gangs&quot; would be able to get enough people to multiple rides to conceivably lay claim to them if they happened to be available.<br>
Later timezone and smaller gangs would never get a choice and would have to settle for whatever &quot;fun&quot; rides the other gangs didn't want and the rare ride that would &quot;pop&quot; in conjunction with their arrival at the park.<br>
<br>
If they were adults...<br>
They would band together in gangs the same way, but they would choose their gangs by playtime and pleasant company rather than by number of fun rides attainable.  <br>
Adult gangs would be much more amicable towards each other and treat each other as equals, seeking win/win solutions.<br>
Adult gangs would understand that everyone is in the same boat and strength of gang or playtime/timezone shouldn't overly benefit another at the expense of those weaker or later.<br>
Adult gangs would be much more likely to try and find a way that everyone can have a chance to ride the trakanon ride.<br>
Adult gangleaders would be much more sympathetic to the &quot;we've never rode this ride before&quot; reason for choosing another ride. (or haven't rode this ride in 3 months)<br>
Adult gangs would be much more likely to develop a scheduling system that benefits everyone equally, and they would be much more likely to help new gangs and ensure that they don't fall off of a ride.<br>
<br>
<br>
The tribunal is neither a teenager amusement park nor an adult one.  I would say that we lean more towards the adult.. but we do have a ton of teenagers.  You can't have a scheduling system with large teenage gangs in the park.  The adults have to race with the kids, or else not ride.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I HATE racing.  I'd much rather go to the park with my friends, take my time, get something to eat on the way, and know what i'm riding and when.  This allows me to relax and enjoy the ride, rather than racing willy nilly to try and grab it and wind up riding it hungry and tired or worse, missing out on it altogether.  Riding rides hungry and tired is a sure way to fall off of rides more often, especially the newer rides.<br>
<br>
Think of the poor gangs that get to the park, don't get any dinner, and spend all night running from ride to ride and missing out on all of them.  At the end of the night, what kind of time do you think they had?  If this happens often, they will eventually give up on the fun rides or leave the park altogether.  Teenagers don't care about those people, yay less lag for me is their motto.  Adults do care about their peers. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">
