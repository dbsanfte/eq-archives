She hated this, her parents would scold her for always taking the work and letting them sit and rest, or sitting and playing with or talking with the servants. But to Cadani they were no differant than she was and it hurt her to watch them suffer.

All her years growing up she vowed to never enslave anyone and to free all good people. Having a very differant outlook on life than her family, she set out on her own, at a young age, she broke her ties with the money, she does still visit her family when she is near, but will not take the riches they to this day offer.

One of her servants was the grandson of a great wizard by the name of Zantos the great evoker of the land of Odus. Cadani would sit and listen to Raleno for hours telling stories of his great powers. This gave her the inspiration to be a powerful Wizard of good.

From that she wandered into the wizards guild and started talking with Tarker Blazetoss the leader of the wizards guild. Although she is a great daydreamer her study of wizardry took presidence over everything in her life.

While wandering about in Greater Faydwer she happened upon Rvarenn and Celyndria of the Legacy of the Nameless and after many meetings with them she became an officer in the Good and mighty guild. Now along with her desire to help the needy, uphold good, and diligently learn wizardry, she now has a new family that she is bound to and will protect to the death.

Cadani is the officer of public relations, this comes naturally to her, she talks incessently and believes that you cannot have too many friends. In her travels she has made more friends than she can list. She is also the representative of the wizards in her guild.

Cadani once saw a picture of, and has heard many tales of the Lady Vox, a powerful and evil Dragon in Permafrost, in the lands of Antonica. The moment she laid her eyes upon this picture she knew this was her goal, she must slay this dragon. If you ever look into her eyes and she seems far away, she is in battle with the Lady herself. Cadani is a master in daydreaming.

Cadani is kind natured, and loves to help those in need, if you see her, say hello and she will cast a smile upon you like no other. But be careful striking up a conversation, you may be there for hours.
