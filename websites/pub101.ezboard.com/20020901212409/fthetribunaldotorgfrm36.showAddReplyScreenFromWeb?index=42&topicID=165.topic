==============================================<br>
By Richard Sale, UPI Terrorism Correspondent<br>
June 18, 2002<br>
<br>
In the wake of a suicide bomb attack Tuesday on a crowded Jerusalem city bus that killed 19 people and wounded at least 70 more, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, took credit for the blast.<br>
<br>
Israeli officials called it the deadliest attack in Jerusalem in six years.<br>
<br>
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon immediately vowed to fight &quot;Palestinian terror&quot; and summoned his cabinet to decide on a military response to the organization that Sharon had once described as &quot;the deadliest terrorist group that we have ever had to face.&quot;<br>
<br>
Active in Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas wants to liberate all of Palestine and establish a radical Islamic state in place of Israel. It is has gained notoriety with its assassinations, car bombs and other acts of terrorism.<br>
<br>
But Sharon left something out.<br>
<br>
Israel and Hamas may currently be locked in deadly combat, but, according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials, beginning in the late 1970s, Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years.<br>
<br>
Israel &quot;aided Hamas directly -- the Israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization),&quot;said Tony Cordesman, Middle East analyst for the Center for Strategic Studies.<br>
<br>
Israel's support for Hamas &quot;was a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLO by using a competing religious alternative,&quot; said a former senior CIA official.<br>
<br>
According to documents United Press International obtained from the Israel-based Institute for Counter Terrorism, Hamas evolved from cells of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928. Islamic movements in Israel and Palestine were &quot;weak and dormant&quot; until after the 1967 Six Day War in which Israel scored a stunning victory over its Arab enemies.<br>
<br>
After 1967, a great part of the success of the Hamas/Muslim Brotherhood was due to their activities among the refugees of the Gaza Strip. The cornerstone of the Islamic movements success was an impressive social, religious, educational and cultural infrastructure, called Da'wah, that worked to ease the hardship of large numbers of Palestinian refugees, confined to camps, and many who were living on the edge.<br>
<br>
&quot;Social influence grew into political influence,&quot; first in the Gaza Strip, then on the West Bank, said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.<br>
<br>
According to ICT papers, Hamas was legally registered in Israel in 1978 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the movement's spiritual leader, as an Islamic Association by the name Al-Mujamma al Islami, which widened its base of supporters and sympathizers by religious propaganda and social work.<br>
<br>
According to U.S. administration officials, funds for the movement came from the oil-producing states and directly and indirectly from Israel. The PLO was secular and leftist and promoted Palestinian nationalism. Hamas wanted to set up a transnational state under the rule of Islam, much like Khomeini's Iran.<br>
<br>
What took Israeli leaders by surprise was the way the Islamic movements began to surge after the Iranian revolution, after armed resistance to Israel sprang up in southern Lebanon vis--vis the Hezbollah, backed by Iran, these sources said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing provides the energy for imitation as much as success,&quot; commented one administration expert.<br>
<br>
A further factor of Hamas' growth was the fact the PLO moved its base of operations to Beirut in the '80s, leaving the Islamic organization to grow in influence in the Occupied Territories &quot;as the court of last resort,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
When the intifada began, Israeli leadership was surprised when Islamic groups began to surge in membership and strength. Hamas immediately grew in numbers and violence. The group had always embraced the doctrine of armed struggle, but the doctrine had not been practiced and Islamic groups had not been subjected to suppression the way groups like Fatah had been, according to U.S. government officials.<br>
<br>
But with the triumph of the Khomeini revolution in Iran, with the birth of Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorism in Lebanon, Hamas began to gain in strength in Gaza and then in the West Bank, relying on terror to resist the Israeli occupation.<br>
<br>
Israel was certainly funding the group at that time. One U.S. intelligence source who asked not to be named said that not only was Hamas being funded as a &quot;counterweight&quot; to the PLO, Israeli aid had another purpose: &quot;To help identify and channel towards Israeli agents Hamas members who were dangerous terrorists.&quot;<br>
<br>
In addition, by infiltrating Hamas, Israeli informers could only listen to debates on policy and identify Hamas members who &quot;were dangerous hard-liners,&quot; the official said.<br>
<br>
In the end, as Hamas set up a very comprehensive counterintelligence system, many collaborators with Israel were weeded out and shot. Violent acts of terrorism became the central tenet, and Hamas, unlike the PLO, was unwilling to compromise in any way with Israel, refusing to acquiesce in its very existence.<br>
<br>
But even then, some in Israel saw some benefits to be had in trying to continue to give Hamas support: &quot;The thinking on the part of some of the right-wing Israeli establishment was that Hamas and the others, if they gained control, would refuse to have any part of the peace process and would torpedo any agreements put in place,&quot; said a U.S. government official who asked not to be named.<br>
<br>
&quot;Israel would still be the only democracy in the region for the United States to deal with,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
All of which disgusts some former U.S. intelligence officials.<br>
<br>
&quot;The thing wrong with so many Israeli operations is that they try to be too sexy,&quot; said former CIA official Vincent Cannestraro.<br>
<br>
According to former State Department counter-terrorism official Larry Johnson, &quot;the Israelis are their own worst enemies when it comes to fighting terrorism.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Israelis are like a guy who sets fire to his hair and then tries to put it out by hitting it with a hammer.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;They do more to incite and sustain terrorism than curb it,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Aid to Hamas may have looked clever, &quot;but it was hardly designed to help smooth the waters,&quot; he said. &quot;An operation like that gives weight to President George Bush's remark about there being a crisis in education.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cordesman said that a similar attempt by Egyptian intelligence to fund Egypt's fundamentalists had also come to grief because of &quot;misreading of the complexities.&quot;<br>
<br>
An Israeli defense official was asked if Israel had given aid to Hamas said, &quot;I am not able to answer that question. I was in Lebanon commanding a unit at the time, besides it is not my field of interest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Asked to confirm a report by U.S. officials that Brig. Gen. Yithaq Segev, the military governor of Gaza, had told U.S. officials he had helped fund &quot;Islamic movements as a counterweight to the PLO and communists,&quot; the official said he could confirm only that he believed Segev had served back in 1986.<br>
<br>
The Israeli Embassy press office referred UPI to its Web site when asked to comment.<br>

This Larry Johnson guy really said that? Man, that's awfully harsh. Think about that analogy. He's saying the Israelis are solely responsible for all their problems.  So, even if not for the Palestinian problem, they would somehow create a problem with someone and make it worse. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

<br>
Bush's One-Sided Plan for Peace<br>
Stephen Zunes,  June 27, 2002<br>
<br>
This week, Bush announced that Arafat must go. A reasonable statement face of it, Arafat is ineffectual at best, complicit in terror at worst. But, as Stephen Zunes writes, by focusing on the issue of Palestinian leadership at the expense of the more fundamental question of the occupation itself allows Israel to continue to avoid facing the destructiveness of its own policies, and it also may mean opening the door to a new, more radical Palestinian regime. Polls show Arafat's closest rival as the most trusted Palestinian leader is Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of Hamas. Also popular, Marwan Barghouti, currently sitting in an Israeli jail for masterminding terror attacks.<br>
<br>
President George W. Bush's Middle East speech this week represents a setback for peace.<br>
 <br>
On the one hand, it is reassuring that, after thirty years of rejecting the international consensus that peace requires the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel, an American president now formally recognizes that need. The bad news is that President Bush is simply perpetuating the unfair assumption that while Israel's right to exist is a given, Palestine's right to exist--even as a mini-state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip--is conditional.<br>
<br>
This comes despite the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has at least as much blood on his hands as does Palestinian President Yasir Arafat. Indeed, far more Palestinian civilians have died at the hands of Israeli occupation forces than have Israeli civilians died from terrorist attacks.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, despite Arafat's many faults, the Palestinian leader's positions on the outstanding issues of the peace process--the extent of the Israeli withdrawal, the fate of the settlements, the status of Jerusalem and the right of return for refugees- are far more moderate and far more consistent with international law and UN Security Council resolutions than are the positions of Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon. Despite that, President Bush insists that it is the Palestinians, not the Israelis, who must have new leadership in order for the peace process to move forward.<br>
<br>
The current administration's distorted priorities could not have been more apparent than in the fact that, in the course of his speech, the president mentioned terrorism eighteen times but did not mention human rights or international law even once. Nor did he mention the peace plan of Saudi Prince Abdullah--endorsed by the Palestinian Authority and every single Arab government--which offered Israel security guarantees and full normal relations in return for withdrawal from the occupied territories seized in the 1967 war. This is largely a reiteration of UN Security Council resolution 242 and 338, long considered to be the basis for Middle East peace. While President Bush mentioned these resolutions briefly in his speech, he failed to challenge Israel's false claim that it does not actually require them to withdraw from virtually all of the Arab lands they conquered 34 years ago.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians are only insisting on control of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is just 22% of Palestine. They have already recognized Israeli control of the remaining 78%. However, not only did President Bush fail to demand a total withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces, he called only for a freeze on additional Israeli settlements, when international law--reiterated in UN Security Council resolutions 446 and 465--requires Israel to abandon the existing settlements as well.<br>
<br>
The fact is that, as the occupying power, the onus for resolving the conflict rests upon Israel, not the Palestinians. Just as occupation and repression can never justify terrorism, neither can terrorism justify occupation and repression.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians have such a strong case, in fact, the Bush Administration has chosen to focus instead upon their weakest link: their corrupt and inept leadership and the terrorist reaction to the occupation.<br>
<br>
Even Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres was quoted saying &quot;Making the creation of a Palestinian state dependant upon a change in the Palestinian leadership is a fatal mistake. Arafat has led the Palestinians for 35 years, kept their head above the water in the international arena. No, no, you can't just brush him aside with one speech.&quot;<br>
<br>
While many if not most Palestinians would love to see Arafat go, President Bush's insistence that the United States has the right to say who the Palestinians choose as their leaders will likely breed enormous resentment. Indeed, Arafat--in his desperate attempt to hold on to power--can now use this American pressure as an excuse to label any reformist effort, even those led by sincere nationalists, as a form of collaboration with Israel and a tool of Western imperialism.<br>
<br>
It is remarkable how President Bush insists on democratic governance and an end to<br>
<br>
violence and corruption as a prerequisite for Palestinian independence when his administration, as well as administrations before him, has strongly supported a series of violent, corrupt and autocratic regimes throughout the Middle East and beyond. How can anyone take seriously his demand that the Palestinians create a political system based upon &quot;tolerance and liberty&quot; when President Bush arms and supports misogynist family dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, not to mention Israeli occupation forces that have engaged in brutal repression against Palestinian<br>
civilians?<br>
<br>
It should be apparent that Bush's criticisms of Arafat's regime, however valid, are not the reason for denying the Palestinians their right to self-determination. They are simply the excuse.<br>

Israel is a nation with a clearly defined army.  Israeli civilians don't shoot Palestinians, unless they are being threatened etc.  Palestinian civilians, on the other hand, just love doing absolutely moronic things like throwing rocks at IDF soldiers and shooting at IDF tanks.  The right and wrong of the fact that Palestine is NOT a nation and does NOT have a true standing army that can be classified as such is not the issue here... rather that the situation lends itself to extreme misrepresentation by people such as the author of the above article.<br>
<br>
When Palestinians fight Israeli soldiers, people die.  Unless they use booby-trap guerillia tactics, 99% of the time it's going to be the Palestinians.  Then the next day, everyone moans and wails about Israel slaughtering those poor Palestinian civilians... /boggle<br>
<br>
Oh, and just because Bush, due to political necessity, cooperates with governments who have less than stellar records doesn't mean that he is in any way wrong or unjustified in insisting that other nations rise above such practices. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

God that thing sucked.  It was full of nothing but propoganda, and spun tid bits of truths.<br>
<br>
If Arafat and the Palestinian people wanted to have their own nation, they could have gotten it 2 years ago.  Arafat turned it down, so as not to appear weak to his people.  If he had returned with a peace agreement, his people would have been up in arms.<br>
<br>
The Arabs of the Middle East's number one goal is to eradicate Israel.  They've tried it countless times, but each time they lost.  If they wanted peace, they could have had it 52 years ago. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ushehbahn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/27/02 12:37:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dusted.net/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silly Europeans</span><hr size=1> &gt;God that thing sucked.

Ok - now back this up with facts (no, links to student essays full of historical inaccuracies don't count). Afer all... you are challenging the opinion of an associate professor in politics who is working for a San Francisco based NGO with proclaimed objective of establishing politcal peace in the Middle East. <br>
<br>
Note : i am not backing up the views of this article in any way. I am prompting you to provide me with factual elements so I can see how you arrived at the conclusion that this is &quot;spun tid bits of truth&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;. Convince me...<br>

He said that for the peace process to move forward, they need to elect leadership that isn't involved with terrorism.  This is because one of the main road blocks to peace has been Arafat and his continued desire to remain in control of Palestine, even at the cost of peace.  Arafat's stance on peace can be shown, by reviewing how he reacted with Clinton 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
- It is not a &quot;set back&quot; to peace.  It's a request, that needs to be fulfilled if peace is to move forward.  Again, the past Palestinian leadership (not just Arafat, but his advisors as well) have been a continued roadblock to peace.<br>
<br>
- Bush wasn't the first president that recognized the need for a Palestinian state.  2 Years ago, at Camp David, Clinton was brokering a deal, which would have created a Palestinian state.<br>
<br>
- It is Conditional, as in the past, it's been shown that a peace agreement can not be reached with the current leadership of Palestine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Despite that, President Bush insists that it is the Palestinians, not the Israelis, who must have new leadership in order for the peace process to move forward.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
- Israel has active elections, their administration already changes.  How many administrations have come and gone, since Arafat was appointed leader of Palestine?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>
The fact is that, as the occupying power, the onus for resolving the conflict rests upon Israel, not the Palestinians. Just as occupation and repression can never justify terrorism, neither can terrorism justify occupation and repression.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
- That is not a fact, it's an opinion.  It takes BOTH sides of a war to want peace, for there to be peace.  One side can not force peace on the other.  As to &quot;terrorism (can not) justify occupation and repression&quot;, just how else are you going to fight terrorism effectively, when the base of operations is being run from terrority not in your control?<br>
<br>
- As to Bush not making demands for a complete withdraw of Israeli forces.  At the end of last year, during the first flare up, during this period, Bush's stance was first requesting Israel to withdraw.  Problem with this stance, is that to request such a thing, brings the entire Afghanistan Campaign and the entire Anti-Terrorism campaign into question, since Israel's occupation was in reaction to terrorist acts.  Since that time, the terrorist acts have stepped up, and by your last article, they suffered one of the worst attacks in a long time.  But back to my previous point, Israel's occupation is justified, IMO, since it is in reaction to terrorism.  (Note: I don't totally agree on how the IDF are handling the operation) Not many do, inside and outside of Israel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   While many if not most Palestinians would love to see Arafat go.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
- I love this, the Palestinians would &quot;love&quot; to see Arafat go.  Well then, we'll all be happy once the people of Palestine rise up and force their government to hold elections.  Unfortunately, all the other runner ups, are a bunch of terrorists as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>
, President Bush's insistence that the United States has the right to say who the Palestinians choose as their leaders will likely breed enormous resentment<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
- This is a spin.  Any country has the right to say anythign they want, but no country has the right to dictate what another must do.  This isn't what Bush said, nor what he was doing.  He said that if Palestine wants US support for a nation of Palestine, they need to elect new leaders, that aren't involved in terrorism.  The Palistians needn't listen to our request.  They can tell us to stuff it, and go to Israel on their own.  Only problem with that, it won't happen, because Israel doesn't trust Arafat to really pursue peace.<br>
<br>
- As to our support of other dictatorships and messed up regimes around the world.  It's called, picking your battles, while still having to deal with all the screwed up people in the world.  The US (corporate, public, political, and governmental) has economical ties with almost every country in the world.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   It should be apparent that Bush's criticisms of Arafat's regime, however valid, are not the reason for denying the Palestinians their right to self-determination. They are simply the excuse.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
- Bush can not deny Palestinian that right, and he isn't.  He can only deny the US' endorsement, which is our RIGHT to do so.<br>
<br>
Someone comes up to you and asked for you to be a reference that they'll write on a job application.  You look them up and down.  Replying, sure, but only if you brush your teeth, cut your hair, and buy some new clothes before you go to the interview.<br>
<br>
For that person to turn around and claim that you are denying them a living, is bullshit.  They could go right next door to your neighbor, and ask for him to be a reference.<br>
<br>
Palestine, could turn around and tell the US to screw off, and go to the French and request that they broker a peace agreement with the Israelis.<br>
<br>
PS: I didn't say the article was full of lies.  I said it was spun, with some good tid bits of truth.<br>

Here is an article for you guys from one of those 'silly european news channels&quot;  I dont know if they show this on CNN, if they didnt it would be suprising since i know US citizens love live and real footadge. Or are they just a bit one sided in the news they bring? <br>
<br>
Anyway i think Bush saying that Arafat should go is a stupid move. Whatever you may think of the guy, Arafat is still their &quot;democratically&quot; elected president. I never heard anyone say that the Shas party should leave the coalition in order for the peace process to move forward. Arafat has already issued new elections for coming January. Knowing the hate the general palestinian has against Israel and its loyal supporter i wouldn`t be suprised if the next guy that is democratically elected is far more radical then Arafat.  And what will Bush and Israel do then, replace him with someone they like? For any peace program to succeed they  need to negotiate  it with someone that represents the majority of the Palestinian people. And i am afraid the longer this conflict goes on and evens described in the above link take place the more militant that next leader will be <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucaledhontelrana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/02 6:46:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silly Europeans</span><hr size=1> I do not now, and never will feel any pity for the Palestinians.

Tell me what the Israeli civilians were doing when they were blown to pieces by teenage suicide bombers.  They *definitely* weren't busy buying chocolates after a long hard day helping daddy wire a booby trap in their office basement to kill people searching for terrorists.  Write a human interests story on every single one of them, their lives, their dreams.<br>
<br>
Write something about why Israeli soldiers feel threatened by even *children*, who are routinely used by Palestinians to deliver bombs or trigger traps... and then when their children are gunned down in the streets they cry foul and wonder why o why good Allah has done this to them.<br>
<br>
I could go on, but I won't... it wouldn't accomplish anything... and I'm not going to take a half hour to back up anything with reputable sources, so this all is and should be taken as opinion... I'm just sick to death of seeing idiot journalists like the one who wrote this article sing the sad song of Palestine and raising up photos of cute little Palestinian kids &quot;murdered&quot; by the Israelis, whom they usually label as neo-Nazi, as much sense as that makes. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

To put it simply......<br>
<br>
The Palestinians have a chance in January to elect a new leader, a leader that has a chance (just like Arafat did, but shit on it) to bring peace to Palestine.  If they choose to elect an even more radical leader, than Arafat, then that's what they choose.<br>
<br>
If they want peace, then they need to elect a leader that will bring it.  If they want to continue with their terrorism, than they'll elect a leader that will continue it. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ushehbahn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/8/02 12:07:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dusted.net/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silly Europeans</span><hr size=1> I have been following the thread for a while, just havent had the time to devote to articulated replies with details i disagree with.

<br>
And for the record : Noam Chomsky is probably one of the brightest people this side of last century and is the genius who formalised generative grammars and their optimisation algorithms. His work forms the mathematical foundation of modern computer language compilers (C springs to mind). His views are also what you would consider very &quot;liberal&quot;...<br>

I also stumbled across another piece of text written by Refusenik Israelis who refuse to accomplish their national service that was pretty interesting. I'll be damned if i can find the link again though.<br>
