He listened in where he could, as he wiped the surface of the bar until it shone again.  Every hint of a conversation, whether it be of a hunt in Karnors, or an epic battle in some dark forest far away, fascinated him, made him more and more curious about these people he saw every day.<br>
<br>
His brother had the mark.  Kaelan remembered it there, a small tear-shaped scar on the upper part of his brother's chest, toward the left.  Kaelan had always been curious about it, though he only discovered the Tears of Veeshan after his brother had been killed.  He felt like he belonged among them, he really did, and wanted so badly to avenge his brother and destroy the wurm that killed him, if it took hunting down every wurm in Velious to do it.<br>
<br>
But he did not belong among them, not as anything more than a servant, a barkeep.  He bore no such dragon's mark, and had only just begun to train to become anything more than a peasant.  He thought about telling people he was a bard, like his brother was, but that old fellow in Thurgadin convinced him of a slightly different path.  One of swords and daggers still, to be sure... but one that likewise showed every weakness of the enemy and how to exploit it.  He would need that.<br>
<br>
The crowds in the guild hall began to thin as the members filtered off to bed.  About time for him to head off as well, though he wasn't bound for the servant's quarters just yet this night.  He polished away a last few water stains on the bartop, gave a cheerful, unnoticed grin to any of the guild members who were nearby, and slipped outside through the kitchen's back door.<br>
<br>
He passed the stables, giving the couple of horses inside a suspicious look.  One snorted and stomped a foot, as though it felt his nervousness around the animals.  Well, it would be a faster way to get to Qeynos, but he didn't trust such beasts as a way to get around.  He started off on foot down the path.<br>
<br>
He'd gone maybe half a mile before he was nearly knocked over by someone coming by.  He dodged out of the way and looked about, half expecting the fleet-footed person to already be gone.  Usually when a druid or bard swept by with the powers of magic speeding their step, they didn't take much notice of those they passed.  He caught sight of a black wolf sitting there watching him, and jumped back.  But it wasn't a shadow wolf, about to leap at its prey, but a druid in lupine form.  It stood and chanted; he was surprised the voice was female.  He felt a strange spirit surround him as the spell took hold, and he grinned and bowed to the wolf.  &quot;Thank you, my lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
He could swear the wolf grinned at him, a trick of its strange animal features to imitate a human or elven expression.  &quot;You look like you've got a long way to go.&quot;  The wolf's tail wagged.  &quot;Take care!&quot; she said, and bolted off.<br>
<br>
Darn.  He wanted to see what she looked like when she wasn't a wolf.  It occurred to him that it might be Salvia, one of the guild Elders, but he couldn't tell from the wolf's voice.  Ah, well, it was getting later, and if he didn't hurry, his friend would beat him to Qeynos via those weird magic books.  He took off down the road, far faster than before.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Here, Kaelan, this'll work for you, I think,&quot; Gavielle handed him a small tinkered device.<br>
<br>
He looked it over curiously.  It had a handle and a trigger, then an l-shaped neck with an opening that pointed down.  There was a spot for the mana battery at the top.  He pressed the trigger and the thing came to life with a small whirring sound.  From the opening at the tip of it something small and metal came in and out rapidly.  When he took his finger from the trigger, he could see the small bundle of thin needles more clearly.<br>
<br>
He gave the little female gnome an uncertain look.  &quot;You're going to have to show me how this works.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, hun.  See, there are two different tips... one's a little thinner for the outline, this one has more needles, that's for inside so it goes a little faster.  You put ink in a little well, and dip the needles in.  You've got to do that a few times, but it'll hurt less and go a lot faster than how you were gonna do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The half-elf grinned.  &quot;You guys think of everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We going to do it tonight?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaelan nodded.  &quot;Might as well.  It'll take a little while to heal, won't it?  Best to get it done as fast as possible.  You're going to stay around Qeynos a couple weeks, aren't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gavielle grinned cheerfully.  &quot;Aye, since you're so eager to introduce me to these dragon-hunting friends of yours.  I've been learning the ways of the enchanters for far less time than you have been at your fighter training... but I hear the hunting around Qeynos is good, and there is an Enchanter guild here.  And, well...&quot;  The gnome glanced down at the tear-shape that marked one of her legs plainly.  &quot;If it's as you say, Kaelan, I should meet these 'Tears' you talk so much about.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled.  &quot;Well... I don't really need an excuse to look at your legs, but can I see it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gavielle smirked at him.  &quot;Go for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
He knelt and looked at the mark carefully.  Gavi's mark looked about the same as his brother's had, though the location was different.  He sketched it to get the size and the shape about right.  &quot;This look all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded.  &quot;Looks good to me.  Where do you want the tattoo?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaelan was quiet for a moment.  He unhooked the top few fasteners on his shirt, careful not to go too far down.  He exposed the top left part of his chest, pulling the bandages just below there down and hiding them with the folds of the shirt.  &quot;Here.&quot;  He knelt down, so the small gnome would be able to reach.<br>
<br>
Gavielle paused and regarded him carefully for a moment.  &quot;Kaelan, are you sure you want to do this?&quot;<br>
<br>
A small smile turned up the corners of the rogue's lips.  &quot;My brother died fighting the dragons.  I bear his name, now I'll bear his mark and fight in his place.&quot;<br>
<br>
