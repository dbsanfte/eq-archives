What yardline was this on? Simply put, you don't pray to the gods that you can get 3 points at the end of the half at the risk that you may very well end up down 10. Having an interception or fumble returned for a touchdown isn't the ideal way to end a half. Shut the fuck up. DG did only what every other professional coach on the planet would have done.<br>
<br>
And before you bring up the Patriots in the Super Bowl, that was a whole different scenario. First off, it was the end of the game, and, say what you will, the Rams were clearly the better team. The Pats D was worn down, their secondary was getting roasted. The Pats knew that if they let it go to OT there was a 50% chance the Rams would get the ball, which would be an automatic win. Even if the Pats got the ball, there was no such virtual guarantee that they would get it in field goal range. If they let it go to OT, there was maybe a 40% chance that they won. Probably way less.<br>

<br>
Who do you think put that team together? In no small part, him. You forget, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> most</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the cogs in that year's team were passed over by other teams.<br>
<br>
Cris Carter- Had drug problems early in his career, the Eagles ditched him. Vikings picked him up.<br>
<br>
Randy Moss- Picked like 26th overall, only 16 picks later than Kevin Fucking Dyson. That was 25 teams that passed him up.<br>
<br>
Randall Cunningham- Was widely regarded as a washed up stiff that nobody wanted. Even the Vikings only picked him up as a backup before Johnson went down.<br>
<br>
John Randle- 7thish round draft pick. Nobody saw anything in him except the vikings.<br>
<br>
Robert Griffith- Walkon from like some shit college like San Jose State. Was undrafted.<br>
<br>
Dunno what you see, but I see the 3 best offensive players and 2 best defensive players from that year only being there cause the scouting team and the coaching staff worked some magic. And I'm not even getting into the OL, which at the time was the best in the fucking business, Broncos included. You just couldn't beat Christy, Steussie, McDaniel, Stringer, and whoever else I'm forgetting.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Vikings went 15-1 that year, and came 3 points short of the superbowl. Call it what you want, but I call it a great year. And didn't they score the most points in NFL history too? (a record that the Rams have since broken I think) Yeah, almost forgot about that.<br>
<br>
Until last season, where things just went down the shitter with Moss dogging it, Stringer dying, Griffith breaking his leg, etc. etc- the Vikings had the longest consecutive playoff appearances in the NFL. Likewise, Denny Green had the longest standing coaching tenure, and I'm pretty sure Cowher was the only one even close to it.<br>
<br>
A lot of very good coaches have done less with more. Spouting off about how he might have choked in one game just shows you to be the ignorant, bitter, utterly clueless armchair quarterback that you are. So just shut the fuck up before you embarrass yourself even more. <p><center><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/P6020/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P6020CustomImage0091544.gif></center>

Moss was picked 18th overall because of some past drug problems, too.  Seems like excelling in the NFL and getting paid millions of dollars helps kick the habit, huh? <br>

I didn't hate Denny that bad, but the last year, when things were obviously not working, he didn't change a thing.  Just sat there fuck with no expression on his fat fuckin face. <p><img src="http://server17.hypermart.net/catacomb/sig.jpg">

And I don't give a shit if he's a druggy, I don't like him anyways. As long as he puts up numbers...<br>

And besides, Cris Carter had the same problems early in his career. Some guys mature, and Moss just might be one of them.<br>

Yeah, Green let things get way out of hand in his last year, but that shouldn't diminish what he did for like 10 years before it. <p><center><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/P6020/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P6020CustomImage0091544.gif></center>

And who you think wrote that playbook for the Randy Moss year? Try Billick my friend. So before you go off on his holy record and all, think what he didn't do. which ends up to be a whole hella alot.<br>

To win the super bowl is luck. One team does every year, and that team is the luckiest. That's just how it works. When every series is decided in a single game, too many flukes can have potentially huge ramifications for the Super Bowl to be the true measurement of a team's ability over the course of that entire year. For example, there is no way in hell that you can convince me that last year's Patriots team was better than the Rams. If you played that game 10 times, St. Louis would win 6 or 7.<br>
<br>
However, when a team is in contention year in and year out, that's the sign of good players, good coaching, and a good front office. <br>
<br>
The Vikings made the playoffs every single year from I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> think</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 1992 through 2001. I'm kinda iffy on the first year in that date. Either way, it was the longest streak in the NFL. They vikings were more consistently in contention than anyone else.<br>
<br>
Second, Mike Tice was the Offensive Line Coach, not the Defensive Coordinator. The D Coordinator is Emmitt something, I forgot his last name. Needless to say, he sucks.<br>
<br>
And the fact that Billick, Tice, and all the other coaches were there to do their good stuff is also a testament to Green, seeing as to how they were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> his</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> staff. A great staff is more the head coach's doing than anyone's. <p><center><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/P6020/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P6020CustomImage0091544.gif></center>
