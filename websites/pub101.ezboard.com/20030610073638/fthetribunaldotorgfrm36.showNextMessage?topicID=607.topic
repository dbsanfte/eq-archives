(not my comments, although I agree) Parse the morality here: I saw an unspeakably horrible kiddie torture house. I could tell you about it, but that might result in people trying to do something about it.

<br>
I use the 5 year number because I believe Saddam could have been taken out without a war in that amount of time if a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>serious</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> effort was put into it.<br>
<br>
I started thinking about it after seeing a news segment with a reporter on scene when some Marines shot up a vehicle and then refused to go check it out for survivors. Turns out there was a small girl in the car (6 years old iirc) who now owes her life to the reporters camerman who had the decency to go check. Don't know what happened to the mother.<br>
<br>
After this war is over, I am sure that the number of civilian dead will far outweigh the number of executions performed by Saddam and his cronies.<br>
<br>
And before you start, I am very happy to see this SOB of out power. But the way we are doing it is like blowing up an apartment complex to take one muderer off the streets. The people who survive are glad he's gone, but killing a few hundred along with the muderer is doing more damage than the muderer himself ever did.<br>
<br>
Seems to me like we are killing a 100 for every 10 we save. Maybe the other 100 don't think that's such a great trade off. <p><br><br><br>

How are you also going to tie in any possible actions he could have taken outside of Iraq in retaliation to the foreign supported rebellion?<br>
<br>
Well when you do come up with those numbers, be sure to remove all the Iraqi civilians that Saddam's forces killed and remove those that were Saddam's forces.<br>
<br>
Well I predict you will either pull these numbers out of your ass, or will clearly show just how much effort you are willing to put forth to show Bush was wrong.  LOL<br>

Why don't you start with looking at how many civilians were killed DURING Desert Storm?  Don't include those that Saddam killed afterwards to put down the revolt in sothern Iraq, and do not include those that died because of the sanctions.  We're talking direct military action.<br>
<br>
I've heard estimates of under 5000 civilians having died in Desert Storm.  I would be VERY surprised that this time around there were MORE deaths.<br>
<br>
So seeing as it's been &quot;said&quot; that on average 10,000 Iraqis would go missing because of Government actions, I'd love to see just how much bullshit you'll pull up to show that more than 50,000 civilians died in the last 3 weeks. =)  I don't even believe we've killed that many soldiers.

There are mass killings in prisons (prison cleansing) but there is no record (that I could find) of the crimes commited to land them in prison. If they were all political dissidents, then that makes the numbers huge, but like Afghanistan, Iraq had severe penalties for what we consider minor crimes (don't get caught drunk driving over there lol), so I can't really sort it out.<br>
<br>
Maybe the info is out there somewhere, but it would take a ton of research to put it together.<br>
<br>
As to the five year number, I thought it would make it fair to give 5 years worth of executions vs civilian deaths in the course of a few weeks due to this war. I think that is ample time to remove Saddam without a major military action, if he was indeed found to be in violation of UN sanctions and it was the only way to stop him.<br>
<br>
I still think it would be interesting to see how many executions it would have taken to equal the number of deaths from the war (excluding military deaths of course). <p><br><br><br>

We also could have used intelligence (like we did the first day of the war) and took him out with a cruise missile.

There are many ways to take out a few men. Once his regime toppled then the Iraqis could have settled the rest themselves, but despite the statements from our administration, I don't think that is or ever was the goal. We are going to put a US friendly government in there and then we will make sure it survives... otherwise this war would have never happened.<br>

As to telling Bush... he wouldn't listen to Colin Powell, so I am damn sure he wouldn't listen to some nobody from Maine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><br><br>

<br>
how many would be killed by saddam's security forces as he sought to root out the conspirators, once he gets wind of it, which he surely would, knowing the american medias penchant for spilling the beans...<br>
<br>
How many would be killed after an assisination attempt failed? <br>
<br>
Funny that a liberal would suggest assasination the leader of a sovereign nation. What about the right of self-determination?<br>
<br>
<br>
took him out with a cruise missle? you mean like we did to osama in after the african embassy bombings?<br>
<br>
Oh wait, you mean after saddam is assisnated the kurds, sunni, shiites and the iranians will all work it out amongs they selves. yeah that sounds like a humanitarian plan. <br>

Well if things would be that bad after he is gone... then maybe having him in there served a purpose?<br>
<br>
That's what's funny to me. You guys see them as warring barbarians anyway who are just going to kill each other without Saddam to stop them, so WTF are we doing there to begin with? <p><br><br><br>

I would put it to you, that a vicious civil war would erupt. <br>

your logic is faulty loegan, I am not even going to bother with it.<br>

I am not painting them as warring barbarians, I am merely describing what normally ensues when a power vaccum is created. see Zaire for reference.<br>

They all would just get together in a big conference and hash out a working and harmonious democracy. see Zaire for reference, or biafra or somalia perhaps.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/11/03 3:49:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3091<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/03 3:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=610.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> You missed the point - maybe it takes a ruthless dictator to keep these guys from killing each other. <br>

We keep saying that all they needed was to get rid of Saddam, but by your own admission they would have just as much killing, if not more without him. If I had made that argument, you guys would be all over me, but you can claim that they would in fact kill each other without his iron fist and it is somehow different.<br>
<br>
We'll see how good of a job we do at keeping them in line and preventing them warring between themselves, but if it is as you said, then expect to be there a few generations at least... hate doesn't die overnight. <p><br><br><br>

Helping someone by getting rid of Saddam is one thing, but hanging around and saving them from themselves is another. Do we have to stay and play policeman or do they really want freedom?<br>
<br>
If you look back through the posts I have made over the years on wars, you will find a theme - fight it and then get the fuck out. There is a difference between helping people and doing it for them. <p><br><br><br>

I could have sworn you made this exact same argument a few weeks ago... if we just get rid of Saddam and don't ensure a stable and hopefully democratic Iraqi-led regime, there's no point to it all anyway.  Sure, if all we wanted was Saddam dead, we could have sent in a team of assassins and gotten the job done.  But would that have removed the Baath apparatus from power?  Would that have prevented one of his sons, or another party leader if they were killed, from taking the reins?  We have seen how long the fanatical party core resisted and kept control of the country even in the face of an invasion; much less if all we did was knock off a few people.  How much more than this war moral would such an attempt have been, if all it did was trigger a new wave of violence and repression across Iraq as a new despotic leader consolidated his power? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 465<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/03 6:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=610.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My plans would rid them of Saddam.

<br>
And you would have blamed President Bush, personally, for every single Iraqi death that followed the assassination.  But of course if President Clinton took his dick out of Monica's mouth long enough to attend to this, it would have just been &quot;their own responsibility.&quot;<br>
