Its a free &quot;Semantic&quot; dip in the well.<br>
<br>
If the four of you individually schedule dragons and help each other, nothing much can be done about that, and more power to your cooperative efforts.  If you add in a scheduling hit as an Alliance, then you quite simply ARE double dipping.  We of CTA have decided to simply try to share the resources on the server and schedule as a unit, despite being individually capable.  You can call it what you will, but to do BOTH is something that shouldnt be allowed on the schedule.<br>

A guild with 10 dragon slayers should not be given the same weight as a guild with 30.<br>
<br>
Story time.  Long ago the planes were being subjected to a huge influx of people.  One of the guilds was KoT and we had scheduling for plains across all the guilds.  I'm sure some of you remember this.<br>
<br>
A few guilds felt it was unfair that so many smaller guilds that couldn't do the planes alone were scheduling separately, hence the 75 / 25 rule.<br>
<br>
But.. it was only after people asked themselves really what is fair and not just &quot;what is in my guild's best interest at this point in time&quot; that we were able to resolve to this.  <br>
<br>
Now I don't want a lot of rules under dragon scheduling.  I could really care less if you schedule as an alliance or as a guild.  I find rules cumbersome.<br>
<br>
I do think everyone should be reasonable and ask if they are double dipping.  If 70% of the dragon slayers are the SAME people EVERY time for however many raids .. you should be scheduling as a unit.<br>
<br>
WWC / KoT would schedule together if everyone would adhere in principle to the above guidline.  That's at least one less entity on the schedule.  <br>
<br>
It benefits everyone in terms of simplifying the schedule and the rotation just to be straight about it. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/rigadoon-gag.jpg"></img><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/rigadoon.jpg"></img></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utanjekindharte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanje Kindharte</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Dwarf Control</span><br>  Posts: 339<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/18/01 10:35:15 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ebonrose.hypermart.net/tanje.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alliance Scheduling</span><hr size=1> Then what the hell do you want me to do people!<br>

This is an age-old debate but I think we have some folks new to it.  I'll try one more time...<br>
<br>
If I have a guild of 12-15 dragon slayers and I host a dragon raid, I invite friends to this raid.  Suppose that 20 more people come, 10 each from 2 other guilds.  A little later, these two guilds begin scheduling.  Each raid between these 3 guilds is comprised of 10 or more dragon slayers from each guild.  Even tho there may be some variance and some outsiders, the primary raiding force is comprised of ALL 3 guilds almost all of the time.  THIS is what is known as a SHADOW alliance.  Meaning, you are an alliance in effect and operating as an alliance but not an OFFICIAL alliance.  This is also known as double dipping, these 3 guilds are getting 3 raids for the majority of their members PER rotation.<br>
<br>
To whoever wanted to know how to tell if a guild is dragon capable... if you don't have 20ish or more people on your roster between levels 46-52, then you aren't dragon capable.  It's hard to tell in some cases and blatantly obvious in others.  You can DEFINITELY tell who's not vox capable merely by roster.<br>
<br>
To whoever apologized for taking away from KoT twink dragon killing, please read the thread.  I am merely voicing the opposing side of an argument, I didn't bring this up and haven't complained.  I'm voicing my opinion.<br>
<br>
It's merely a question that everyone should answer.. do the majority of my guild's dragonslayers get the opportunity for more than one raid per rotation on a regular basis.  If the answer is Yes, then you are double dipping.<br>
<br>
Not much point in explaining anymore as the vote is already begun and people still don't seem to understand the objection.  shrug <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

Few quick points though. <br>
<br>
First, when I said people weren't discussing it Garumph i was refering to the people that started with the flame style posting accusing others of whining.<br>
<br>
Second, If an alliance stated we are capable of doing Naggy and Vox and the alliance is mainly for Planes and similar higher level zones then simply state that. <br>
<br>
Third, Every guild recruits for Naggy and Vox, bottom line. People out level the limit. So you recruit to fill in the blanks. If however, you have an alliance so you can do Naggy or Vox you should schedule as the alliance. Any way to enfoce that? No. Its a system based on honor and will only work if people are honorable. <br>
<br>
So I see both sides thanks again to those willing to discuss it and sit here weighing both sides.<br>

Sorry to disagree, but you CAN dictate who and how many people bring on their raids.  It's been done before, and was successful for the most part.<br>
<br>
Keg, every guild may need to recruit a few to fill holes, but if you have to recruit more than half the raid, you really shouldn't be scheduling.  Also, if you continually recruit from guilds that DO schedule then you should feel guilty. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

I think we are having a difference of semantics, let me see if I can state this.<br>
<br>
There is, at least to my mind, a major difference between *wanting* to invite people on a raid and *needing* to invite people on a raid.<br>
<br>
Should we as a guild not invite our friends on a raid just because we don't need them?  Seems kind of mercenary to me.  But this is what it seems people are saying.<br>

Rigadoon, you seem to suggest that we should go to FCFS.  In that scenario, all the lighter guilds will get screwed.  I don't see how the current system screws anyone, except for some guilds who don't make friends and want to go it alone.  And, frankly, if you are going it alone, it is going to be harder and more unfair.  Friends make life a lot better and easier.<br>

The current system isn't perfect, (what system is?) but I think it does allow for the greatest number of people on the server to have the opportunity to slay the dragon's.   <br>

I voted to day for scenario 1 due to the fact that it is the fairest and has the least amount of room for lengthy threads like this one.<br>
It is true that some ppl will complain about things like &quot;HEY they had a 45 person raid and only had 30 members show up THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD 32 members HANG THEM HIGH&quot;, but by this scenario the dragon rotation will move faster, guilds not capable of doing naggy/vox on their own will be forced to join alliances and still guilds that are capable of doing it solo will be more apt to sign up solo, and I think it will move the board along much faster. With less opportunity for ppl to to accuse others of taking advantage of the system.<br>
Tempest Rising has several members either in the military or in school but I have been taking a head count recently and think we will still be able to field an army of 40 members with resists over 80 in fire and cold and magic more than enough for naggy and pushing it a bit on vox. <br>
In truth I don't think either option is the best way to go I think there should be another option where every guild schedules individually and if you fail you must wait 3 months before you reschedule or something like that. So basically your turn comes up you have one shot within 24 and 72 hours Invite who ever you want and do your best to win if you win good if you loose NEXT!<br>
<br>
In closing I will abide by what ever is come up with as far as rules, and lets see some dragons getting stomped in to the dirt ppl!<br>
<br>
Oh yea almost forgot God bless America!<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Wolvar - The alliance was not going on for several months only in name. In EFFECT, it was.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
then in EFFECT...your talking about half the server...the little half..that actually has to TRY to kill Nag and Vox. Especially Vox. Everyone has been doing invites for a long time...with no slaps on the wrist...until a 4 guild alliance starts up...and yes...it just started up...this Allaince just became official...but we have always invited each other to many events as seperate guild raids...Nag/Vox being one of them...in EFFECT...most guilds do this...the Alliance will not be doing any scheduling as the alliance...the host guilds will schedule and then pull from friends list and such...as we have always done if we dont have enough there...as far as I see it...loot isnt the issue here...keeping Naggy dead is...isnt this why this schedule was created?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Rig - The question is if you can kill Vox or Nagi on your own. If not, you should be scheduling as your &quot;alliance&quot; for the sake of fairness.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is how the scheduling has been done for a while now...I JUST NOW started scheduling for Naggy and Vox now that Phalanx is up and running again (we have not killed Naggy or Vox since this some time before the creation of this board even)...we have not as a guild gone in and taken either one because we just didnt have the numbers due to the split that is now Phalanx and Banished Heroes. As far as scheduling I was operating on this premis of whether or not we could actually take them out. We can take them out now...so I started scheduling. This to me was the honorable thing to do...now I am being told I am a dragon whore. /rude to those who think so...we HAVE actually attended about 6 dragon raids in the times between nbow and our last scheduling...should we not have gone?<br>
<br>
As far as how the Alliance works, we only use it for &quot;Hard Zones, Planes, and Epics&quot; other then that...we are pretty much our own guilds...we DO have a board...for communication and such...but we do not schedule dragons on it as &quot;Alliance Functions&quot; We have been doing it as we always have, one guild will run a dragon raid...and invite a few friends...but having 4 guilds in there all 45-52 will be nuts and total over kill (2 of these guilds can hit near 60 ppl 45-52)...you think I am making this an &quot;Alliance Raid&quot; /boggle....just Phalanx and some others...in fact...the same others that has been doing it all along for about a year now...what changed?...YOUR view did...and Planes scheduling is dead...as well as the 75/25 ruling....why it was even applied to Dragons I dont know<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Rig - Your guild (Phalanx) has 8 members between the levels 45 to 52 according to your member roster. You beating dragons with 8?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Everyone - whine whine whine - defend defend defend <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Look...I know there is a principle here your trying to defend...but in my eyes...this is just a bunch of hoopla over a mob that drops 4-5 items...most of which are autioned off in EC tunnel all the time...get a grip...this isnt worth all this...everyone just schedule and go with what ever plan that is decided on in the little vote post. Schedule as an alliance...or as your own individual guilds...just keep Naggy dead.<br>
<br>
Naggy and Vox has 2 properties....<br>
<br>
Raiding exp and training<br>
<br>
Ragefire<br>
<br>
Loot is NOT one of them...which by the way..those 4 -5 items are going to be spread out over 30 ppl...it isnt likely you are going to get a CoF in EQ unless you got some HOT dice...or are such an inspiration to ppl...it is awarded to you...and that is the only loot of value off of Nag...and a RBB off of Vox...the rest is just a nice little bonus but mostly crap compared to the vellious stuff.<br>
<br>
The schedule was made to keep Naggy Dead for clerics...Vox is usually perma spawned...cus most just arent interested in her...I may be wrong on that...But everytime I visit perma...she is up<br>
<br>
anyways...too much talk over nothing of consequence, next thing you know....we will be talking about scheduling the pharming rights on the Frenzy camp for FBSS's for our twinks<br>

sorry if I sounded harsh Rig...just tired..yeah our member roster is way off...and has been neglected for a long time...in fact the site was down for about a month, and just came back up, we have more then tripled in size since then. I have been to busy to webmaster it, and have passed that to someone else...I have working on policy for the alliance, building a guild back up, playing the game, putting out fires that always develop in running guilds, TRYING to keep camping the same boards I have always camped, and just living life<br>

I disagree.  I think that MOST guilds do invite their friends, but the raids aren't significantly comprised of other guilds' members on the schedule. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">
