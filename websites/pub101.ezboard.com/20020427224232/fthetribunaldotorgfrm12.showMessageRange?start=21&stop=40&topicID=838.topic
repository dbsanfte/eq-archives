You leave Transcended with your &quot;supposed&quot; friends, they buy you a brand new trak BP cuz your a fucking pussy and you cant get your own. THEN you abandon them and join transcended again. Your definately a person of character. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out faggot. As for kulvinna, fuck you up your stupid newbie ass you dumbshit.

Even after members of that group told you she must be having problems and that she had been splittling loot and rolling for big loot all evening.

I am still waiting for a response as to why you felt it prudent to flame someone who did nothing wrong?&lt;&lt; and this has been proven by multiple accounts of the incident you brought forth to us(of course so has the fact that you unlike any of the rest of us actually yearn to live up to your name).

Kulvinna your a shiteating dirtbag. There was NEVER a level restriction for posting you dumbass. Like most, I refuse to take abuse from level 48 druids. What abuse you say? Much like the abuse daddy gave you when you were six Kulvinna. As a matter of fact, I find my namecalling to be quite effective. You drag your bitchy ass back here every 5 minutes to post drivel on the boards that no one cares about. You seem to have an opinion about everything that doesnt even concern you. Above, you may find why I felt it &quot;prudent&quot; to flame your secret gay partner who DID in fact take money I could have used. When you say &quot;multiple accounts of the incident brought forth to US&quot;, who is the US in that? Could it possibly be your bum chum Lanfearr? Your clearly biased in the matter and your opinion means nothing. As for an apology, I think maybe a simple sorry would do. I will leave the socially retarded and gimp part for you since I know you express yourself best in those areas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www228.pair.com/judygale/Gsmile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 742<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/02 8:40:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SydesJokes/files/Pictures/h/homer_simpson.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Slutvinna/Krickett</span><hr size=1> I hate a Liar worse than anything else in the world Moran.

Moran says &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The fact is, I simply needed money to buy stuff, and she LDed with it.

<br>
So here you lead us to believe that you were in fact merely posting to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> question</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the integrity of Lanfearr to see if perhaps she done this in the past. Also you state that you needed money to buy stuff and she LDed with it but you were in the group for only 20 minutes before she LDed so what was it you were needing to buy? a couple stacks of food???<br>
<br>
Lets look again at your original post<br>
Moran says &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Dunno if anyone else has had experiences with this Enchanter but she was in UD group for a good 4 hours MLing everything, she split once for about 10pp each and occasionally gave out a gem, other than that she got all the paws bangles scalps and spider fur then all of a sudden she ld's with all that stuff on her and never comes back, that's a good 5k i'd say with everything she got if not more~</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm in your original post you stated that you were grouped with her for 4 hours. It was proven that you only grouped with her for 20 minutes. You also stated that she was MLing everything but in fact the group was rolling on all major drops as they dropped. Also in your post you do not ask if anyone has had problems with her in the past. You state you dont know if anyone has had or not and proceed to call them a thief and now that the truth is known your entire post was a huge fucking lie. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  A HUGE FUCKING LIE!!!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

That's 300pp. Divided by 6 that's 50pp each person.<br>
<br>
Wtg mountain out of molehill, fucker.<br>
<br>
I agree wholeheartedly with Lejina. They're paws/bracelets/etc... so what you dumbfucks? In a few hours, they add up to a few thousand plat. No, it won't buy you a fungi tunic and people give away items worth 1k, but in straight plat item drops off mob drops? That's nice.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's been revealed that he was only grouped for 20 minutes, so it's a laughable loss.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Incidentally, how come every flame thread on the flameboard has a reply from Kulvinna telling the poster that they're wrong and that the person they're flaming is innocent? Apparently true here, but how does he know so many people? Did he meet them in the mercinary corps? <p><center><font size=2><font color=ashen><u><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101490>Pren, Human Master</u></a> on The Tribunal Server

I'm sensing a lot of animosity in you. This has anything to do with me putting your gimp ass on ignore due to the peace and quiet it brought me? You've been asking members of my guild to please tell me you just want to talk. I'm trying to make it clear to you that I don't really feel like talking your psycho ass. This has been going on for what, a week or two now?<br>
<br>

Hey dumbass, Trig, Aro, &amp; Terrik are my friends, &amp; I didn't take kindly to having them flamed. Friends, y'know? people who hang out with you and who you tend to have fun with?<br>
At no time did I hold ill will towards Trans, and Trig even tried to get me to stay because she knew it wasn't really something I wanted to do.<br>
<br>

<br>
How was I supposed to get a new one? solo trak? I've never had much in the way of plat because usually I have what I need and I let friends borrow items I don't. And just where the hell do you think this bp is going if/when I get a new one? back to them fuckface.  Chances are it'll go to Rishyr, a mutual friend of ours.<br>

Heh, at the moment they're doing better than your gimp unguilded ass is. Find out how many people can actually stand you. You'd be surprised how few fucking people can stomach the thought of grouping with your ass.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  PS Aeadiin.<br>

<br>
I'd bet if you clicked on most of the Magelo profiles here, instead of singling me out, you'd see most people have a wish list. i don't expect to get all that shit, but its just that, a wish list. I don't see siren's song on their or natures melody, which is right up their with what you were expecting from vags.<br>
<br>
Oh and you make it out like I stabbed them in the back by coming back to Trans. Go talk to them and see if they feel the same way. I know you're pissed because you can't spout off to me anymore about what you did or what you want, but learning to deal with it is the first step on your road to mental stability. <p><HR>

&quot;Normally I would agree with that statement Daeja but in this case we are dealing with a troglodyte that was seeking to damage the reputation of a solid player by means less than honorable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, just seekin cash from the MLer. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm still waiting for the apology myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Already told you it was a mistake an an apology would be in order.<br>
<br>
&quot;If she was gonna /q out she woulda done it when she had the more valuable loot.&quot; <br>
<br>
Or maybe you would just give half of it over to make yourself less suspect to ridicule.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you have the integrity to do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Moron what a fucking loser.&quot;<br>
<br>
Read the above Aeadiin/Oct/Kulvinna related posts. That's basically what I'd say to you but it would take me 10 minutes to think of stuff I shouldn't bother wasting my time saying. <br>
 <br>
&quot;None of the other people from that group seems to have had a problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe because they got gems or rares or quite possibly platinum.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were just trying to be an ass and ruin someones rep.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, checking the integrity of one.<br>
<br>
&quot;....suck it up you little puss.&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't need to know what you do in your spare time Lilum.<br>
<br>
&quot; knew with out even having to talk to her that she must have had computer problems and figured she had the right to defend herself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Great! We've got the long lost uncle of Ms. Cleo with us. What the fuck are the tarot cards reading today?<br>
<br>
Aeadiin's Post-----------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Im sensing a lot of animosity in you.&quot;<br>
<br>
You should become a jedi then.<br>
<br>
&quot;This has anything to do with me putting your gimp ass on ignore due to the peace and quiet it brought me?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I believe it has to do with something with is approx....17 posts above this, I could be wrong though.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've been asking members of my guild to please tell me you just want to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I was at good terms with you once. Most people talk to ex-guildies, ill etch your name off the list if youd like.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm trying to make it clear to you that I don't really feel like talking your psycho ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nor do I feel like talking to yours.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trig, Aro, &amp; Terrik are my friends&quot;<br>
<br>
Friends don't abandon each other. You did.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't take kindly to having them flamed.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didnt flame them, I enjoy their company too.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends, y'know? people who hang out with you and who you tend to have fun with?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I know all about em'.<br>
<br>
&quot;...she knew it wasn't really something I wanted to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Obviously it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;How was I supposed to get a new one? solo trak?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope you buy one with the plat you get from groups. When people like Lanfearr ML and have it all, it can become difficult.<br>
<br>
&quot;And just where the hell do you think this bp is going if/when I get a new one?&quot;<br>
<br>
One word. eBay.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh, at the moment they're doing better than your gimp unguilded ass is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Theres one point for you. However, its quality, not quantity.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'd be surprised how few fucking people can stomach the thought of grouping with your ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most people dont group with people's asses, I dont know what you do in your spare time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd bet if you clicked on most of the Magelo profiles here, instead of singling me out, you'd see most people have a wish list.&quot;<br>
<br>
10 points for me. YOUR fucking right. Most people have wishlists. So why exactly do single ME out for aspiring to get something I might never get. Food for thought you dumbass.<br>
<br>
&quot;what you were expecting from vags.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ive learned not to expect loot from guilds. Ive never looted anything besides shiverback bracer in my whole life. What I expect, is good times, and dragon killing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and you make it out like I stabbed them in the back by coming back to Trans.&quot;<br>
<br>
Friends don't abandon friends when they make a stand for something.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you're pissed because you can't spout off to me anymore about what you did or what you want...&quot;<br>
<br>
I bet you were typing that flame thinking it was the best thing you had ever written in your whole life. It doesn't matter what you write Aeadiin, I will take it apart word by word and mutilate you like a fucking cow in a meat locker. <br>
<br>
&quot;...learning to deal with it is the first step on your road to mental stability.&quot;<br>
<br>
There something you want to sell us about yourself??<br>
