Camthan, did you not have a clue that it might be fake? Friend or not, didnt it occur to you that ish might be a fucking flake and try something like this for the drama? If not i'm sorry, its sad and thats about all i can say aside from the fact that you were one of the few people i know from our server that had room left for a take down. And this bullshit was it.<br>
<br>
You aren the only one thats known suicide, i know it face first with a 357 and a sibling gone. I take this shit personal also, but the fact it made the drooling peeps from our FB actually make phone calls, and dredge up REAL life info and follow through made it push through the line of acceptable, in my eyes.  When the RL was pushed that far even i thought it was too much. The topic just added to it. <br>
<br>
I have a hard time thinking you had NO idea, and a harder time letting the idea that you are unacountable for it go.<br>
<br>
And if you still call that fucking piece of shit a friend well all is lost after this. My opinion means nothing to most people and i can live with that.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/LAatlaar.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=camthan>camthan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Cleric of Love</span><br>  Posts: 578<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 5:23:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A loss</span><hr size=1> I'm very trusting and loyal, which makes me rather gullible. <br>

<br>
Ask my brother who fucked me out of about 10 grand last year, who needed all the money to pay the bills so he could see his kids, but oddly enough his bills never got paid in the 10 months I was there. . . . .<br>
<br>
Ask the the bitches who I agreed to let borrow 200 bucks if they gave me a ride home from work, who bought pot and coke, and left me stranded for about 10 hours. . . .<br>
<br>
Ask all the various fuckers who saw me as an easy target in my life and fucked me out of every fucking thing I wanted, loved, held sacred in this god damned world. . . .<br>
<br>
Ask them if I would do something as stupid as this. They would all tell you, without thinking, yes he would. <br>

I am a gullible fucker, I never said I wasn't. I do shit all the time, whereas if I thought about it a bit I would realize what was happening and probably not do it. I AM A STUPID FUCK. I AM A DUMBASS. Jesus how many times do I have to say it.<br>

Yeah I am a victim. A victim of my own stupidity. My friends know how often I fall for shit. My friends know what is going on, because they have gone through it happening to me before. <br>

Not true at all, most of the people crying foul are doing so cuz they think it's dispicable.  I doubt there are any, much less &quot;a lot&quot; of people here that would do something stupid like this.  Do you feel betrayed?  Do you think &quot;a lot&quot; of people would alienate all of their eq friendships for some kind of prank??  and a lame one at that?  If you do, then yer not only a professional victim but a lame judge of character as well.<br>

Not sure where you heard this gem, but skepticism doesn't mean someone is a liar.  Gullibility doesn't make you somehow better than those that knew better than to believe this.  Yes it's true that habitual liars naturally distrust anything they hear, however it doesn't follow that someone exhibiting distrust or skepticism is a liar.  It's a pretty childish though process that thinks someone who disbelieves something is &quot;often a liar themselves&quot;.<br>
<br>
IF you weren't in on it, then you shouldn't be apologizing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>at all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for believing him.  The fact that you ARE apologizing means that you are guilty in some way.  Is it perhaps the fabrication about speaking to an hysterical woman when confronted on the FB with disbelievers?  ...because you wanted to shut them up?

I would still have all the friends I have left if I was lying and admitted it. <br>
<br>
Do you honestly think I give a fuck about an online reputation in an online game? Do you think I would care to lose face in front of faceless people, people I never deal with? I rarely buy/sell, I rarely group outside of my guild, so any way my in game reputation here would be affected has zero impact. I rarely post on general board, I post on and off on the flameboard, but no one listens to me anyway, so why would I care about my rep here? People hate me here because I am gay, do I hide that? People hate me here because I'm in comps, do I hide that? I really have no reason to lie. <br>
<br>
The only reason I even came back here to say anything was because I had friends here defending me and I didn't want it to seem like I was hiding behind them. I don't care what you think, and nothing I say would make you believe otherwise.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1902<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 11:09:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=91>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A loss</span><hr size=1> Who knows what your motive was, what was Ish's motive?? /shrug  <br>

Its worth a try, anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=camthan>camthan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Cleric of Love</span><br>  Posts: 580<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 11:27:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A loss</span><hr size=1> Neutering myself will have no effect on my sexuality.

So its a choice you make to suck dicks..I think you should still follow Arleana's advice and neuter yourself.<br>
<br>
I agree with most people noone is that dumb to believe you weren't in on it.<br>

He  obviously lied.  His story (what there is of it) just doesn't pass the giggle test.  If there was some explaination for the call to ish's mom, he would have given it.  I like to think I'm a pretty smart guy, and I can't even dream up a scenario where that could be explained without camthan's involvement in the scheme.  It's actually kinda fun to see him sticking to his guns in the face of EVERYONE knowing he's full of shit.  I wonder how long he'll keep it up?<br>
<br>
By the way, nobody gives a flying fuck if you're gay, and nobody hates people for being in comps; they're a stand up guild with a solid reputation.  I think it's pretty safe to say nobody hates you here period, we just think you're a lying sack of fag, which isn't the same thing.<br>

Its Who you trust, and how far you will take that trust. Ish may be a great guy irl, but what hes said, done and all here and in game has lead to a lot of people that, i'm pretty solid in believeing this next part, know hes a fucking useless waste of space.<br>
<br>
The people that i have made friends with, and made room for in my real life are people that i knew from actions in game and out. A combo so to speak. Mabey i was lucky, but these people dont come here and go out of thier way to offend, and piss people off. These people are themselves in irl and out, and i know that.  I didnt seek them out, i just found that i had a friend and took advantage of that, by building a real realtionship with them. Ask Majamet, Eyeacane, oneton, Xara, Krom, Cicero, and a few others. This game has a lot of downfalls, but the potential for real life connections go beyond sex, the potential for sex,  lapdog friends, and empty faceless affermations. And yes ive been fucked over, used, and flat our mistreated because i'm loyal and trusting. but i dont use it as a defense when shit gets thick. Its a weak cop out i dont bye into.<br>
<br>
Rant over: it comes down to this. Your sexuality means exactly nothing to a lot of people. Using that as a reason, indirect, or direct for you being a fucking idiot in this situation is a bottomless cop out we dont wanna take. I STILL cant believe you didnt see it comming...I bet you did, but some kind of pride keeps you from saying it. Admitting that would be beter than the &quot;I'm a  victim&quot; bullshit youve been using. <br>
<br>
Actually, to me, its never been about the fact you thought he died and went apeshit letting us know about it, and defending yourself int he weak way you have. I think it sucked, but still...I think, KNOW, you had an idea it wasnt true...and you still sat back and watched people dig up info, make calls and otherwise invade his real life to find out what was going on. They did it because no one belived it, and as a regular reader of the fb you didnt get it and returned time and time again to defend your post. FOrget the fact you posted it in the fucking FB, i can let that go, the rest of your posts beg the question still.....Did camthan not have a clue? Did he not care? Did camthan laugh at all the invasive shit that went down? <br>
<br>
Fuck it, you fucked up. Ish is still a voice with no breath, and the fb will continue. The world moves on....but a lot of us know a little bit more about people we thought we knew. <br>
<br>
Oh and Ladmo is in fact a redneck, racist motherfucker irl. He wouldnt come to my restraunt cause we have wetbacks in the kitchen. Fucking asshole. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/LAatlaar.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3169<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 10:54:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1668.topic&index=98>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A loss</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That's a typical cop out of a liar.
