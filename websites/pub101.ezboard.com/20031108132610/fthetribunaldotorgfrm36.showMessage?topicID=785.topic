<br>
I am honestly surprised at the SS on this.  If this wasn't so clearly a symbol of an abstract thing then I could see where they were coming from, but I am just not following on this one.<br>
<br>
I have never known the SS to be political, so I must assume their concern is sincere, but I can't see how it's legitimate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1499<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/20/03 11:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> The Secret Service has always reacted like this to these sorts of situations. They have to. I wonder if you remember the time the Secret Service searched a Berkely student columnist's apartment because, in a piece of 'satire' he wrote before a football game against Stanford, he told people to &quot;show your spirit on Chelsea Clinton's bloodied carcass&quot; during the game.<br>
<br>
The Secret Service's thoughts on this does not matter much to me though. I added the link in a couple minutes later after I noticed Drudge had some news on it. The fact that an image of a gun being held to the president's head- hands tied behind his back, trigger about to be pulled, president seconds away from execution- made it into this nation's most locally successful newspaper is what concerns me. The &quot;politics&quot; label is irrelevant. As Drudge showed, it's an obvious 'recreation' of the Vietnam era execution photo. The White House reporter's comment in the article is dead on. It's terribly vicious and completely ignores the world's atmosphere and the nation's mood.<br>
<br>
I expect to see that sort of thing in the Arab press, with a cute little cartoon of Sharon blowing himself up in a crowded Israeli cafe to get the point across that it's really him that's responsible for the suicide bombings. I didn't expect to see that sort of thing in a major US newspaper. But the standards continue to be lowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 864<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/21/03 8:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's terribly vicious and completely ignores the world's atmosphere and the nation's mood.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I disagree strongly.

This type of &quot;shock&quot; cartoon has been a staple of american political commentary since the 1800s, where it often caused great uproar.  I sure as hell hope that people aren't up in arms about this just because it's the president... if your issue is with using an image of an assassination to make a point, I'd see where you were coming from (a political cartoon showing a child being raped or something would really upset me, and I can certainly see where somehting like this could have similar effect).  But if its just &quot;oooh you don't joke about harming the president&quot;, this better blow over mighty fast.  There's absolutely zero reason that type of image shouldn't be allowed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2128<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/21/03 8:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I agree with tuwene.  <br>

The point of the cartoon is that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>politics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> surrounding Iraq is killing the president. It could even be interpreted to be supportive of the President if you believe that this is all just politics over Iraq with no substance.<br>
<br>
What if he had put &quot;the economy&quot; label on the guy? It is still an abstract representing the economy killing the Presidents chances at re-election.<br>
<br>
Now if the guy holding the gun were Saddam, a democratic candidate, a football team... anything that represents something solid and real... then I agree that it is way out of line as it represents real violence. But saying that politics is killing the President doesn't mean he is really being killed - it is a metaphor and puts it in another category imo. Just like saying someone shot themselves in the foot when they did something stupid is not a violent statement, I don't believe this is.<br>
<br>
I am not sure what he is trying to say with the execution style position the President is in, but that could be trying to link Iraq to Vietnam and how that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>killed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> LBJ's Presidency.<br>
<br>
I know I am repeating myself, but to say this cartoon inspires or represents violence would be the same as saying the age old representation of falling in love by being shot with Cupids arrow represents violence. It's just ridiculous imo.<br>

Quite untrue. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I sure as hell hope that people aren't up in arms about this just because it's the president...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'm not. I don't care if it's the current or a former president or Martha Stewart that's the target of the cartoon. It could be Robert Byrd, it could be Kobe Bryant. My reaction would still be the same.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This type of &quot;shock&quot; cartoon has been a staple of american political commentary since the 1800s, where it often caused great uproar.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Never do I recall a public figure being the target of an execution in a respected paper's editorial cartoon. I recall Steve Bell showing Bush throwing monkey shit all over bathroom walls and smearing it all over UN toilet paper, Bill Clinton wading through a sea of condoms, Janet Reno flirting with little girls. This particular cartoon has in my opinion reached a new level that, to the best of my knowledge, we've not seen since the early more vicious days of American journalism.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There's absolutely zero reason that type of image shouldn't be allowed.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I do not suggest that it shouldn't be allowed. The LA Times can do what it wants and choose to be as extreme or as Mr. Rogerish as it sees fit. I simply point out that I believe choosing to print this cartoon is a mistake that severely lowers their credibility and threatens the respect that they have rightfully gained throughout the years.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>.The point of the cartoon is that the politics surrounding Iraq is killing the president.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As I said, the &quot;politics&quot; label is irrelevant, as would be an &quot;economy&quot; label. The imagery is still crystal clear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>to say this cartoon inspires or represents violence would be the same as saying the age old representation of falling in love by being shot with Cupids arrow represents violence.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The man holding the gun is not Cupid, and the gun does not contain arrows of love. The cartoon is not based off of cuteness. It is based off of a graphic image of execution. He may as well have put Bush in a '61 Lincoln Continental, riding down a Texas street with his wife, shady character in the top floor of a building nearby with a sniper rifle and a bullet headed towards Bush's head. That would spark more attention in the media than this particular cartoon. But they're exactly the same.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I'm overreacting.<br>
<br>
But I doubt it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 7/21/03 12:18 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=785.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=785.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=785.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=785.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=785.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=785.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
