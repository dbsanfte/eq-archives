Lilum it would seem to me that you are just falling apart because you can't comprehend the fact that I'm a member of a group of individuals that is accomplished and disciplined unlike you.

Maybe you could kill a few harder mobs if you had some 60s.....oh wait....you aren't level 60 yet.

Your stupidity is never amazing to me, but it is shocking how you can contradict yourself. By trying to say im and idiot and unskilled and then relating it to my level was truly foolish of you. Of course you are unaware of how I got to level 60, you have never been able to achieve the level yourself in all your playtime. Maybe it was all those wipes in arena right Lilum? Xp must be taking a toll on ya by now huh? You are too stupid to understand the fact that I am simply a better character than you and I sat down and spent a few days hunting. If you consider that skilled, god help you. You appear to be seething in fury that people actually come here to stick up for themselves besides me. You simply can't stand the fact that I am in such an impossibly better position than you right now that it would be comparable to me being in a utopia while you are fucking left in the dust.

By now everyone knows your struggling for words, because just about everyone on the server hates you with some sort of passion. That paragraph was written to better illustrate the fact that you are a guy (so i've heard) yet you are always on a women's moon flow (which is hard to accomplish). All you do is bitch about rights, policies, laws and various things no one could give a flying fuck about. You are the modern white version of Martin Luther King Loegan. You should lead your own fucking abortion marches through McDonalds and have a time of it Loegan. Don't bring your fucking gospel on these boards where no one gives a rats ass. We don't care what your opinion is, at all. I know you've been told that many times but im trying to get it to stuck in your puny dense head. You should at least be able to identify the gist of that paragraph but you lack the common intelligence to. However, I am not suprised and with a little time and help, I may be able to catch you back up to first grade Loegan. The paragraph, in its entirety, was created to show how much you bitch about things we don't care about. Do you want me to put a fucking disclaimer on every insult and every flame saying it *may* be exaggerated, or the facts in this thread *may* be altered or somehow untrue. Well, ive had some time to think, and no, im not going to do that you little fucking cuntrag crybaby. Now its obvious you didn't find it amusing since you are doing the closest thing to crying (whining on an internet message board). I will try to lighten my flames on you a little since you get the shit pounded out of ya every time you post, and I am just another person on your list from whom you receieve a justified thrashing from daily. You may now proceed to weep.<br>

I honestly can't think of much higher praise than that. I wish to fuck I was deserving of it, but I am not. While I may talk about issues, there are few that I actually do anything about.

If this is indicative of the attitude of Transcended in general, or the Transcended officers in particular (which I still do not believe is true), then there will have to be a re-evaluation of attitudes towards what appears to be a guild that resorts to low tactics in-game. If Merton is just being a jackass (which I know is true, but don't know if it is the whole story or not), then perhaps the craven people who can only sit and fling insults at people recruited into guilds should follow Merton's guild tag for a while.

If reputation means something, having Moron guilded really shines a divine light on Phalanx! I believe he's the proverbial black sheep for lying, making an ass of himself, and flaming people for 20pp. Yeah, Trans is such a shithole, since we have people like Xanta who rez the dead caused by your little fiasco in KC, and people like dooks who tank Wuoshi for your guild at 6am!<br>
<br>
I find it funny you flail about and try to pin the blame on Merton/Trans for VS, considering he zoned into it. Trans wasn't gunning for VS. All of our wizards have, except Laerkai, who wasn't online at the time. Someone said he was up in guild, we shrugged, and continued what we were doing.<br>

All I'm gonna say is that I've been in Phalanx for over 2 years and I've met few people better in-game, period.<br>

As for our battle cry annoying others, well, maybe it does, but there are far more annoying things I see in the various channels FAR more often than Phalanx announcing their presence in a zone.<br>

Get on with your game, get on with your lives.  I don't think there's guild (or a character, likely) in this game that everyone likes - that's just life.<br>
<br>
PS:  Whomever got the impression we excluded AoS members based on level was mis-informed.  We suspended our level requirement for the 'absorbtion' and dealt with the level disparities OUR way (by equipping and training them to hunt the big critters).  If anyone was given the excuse that they were 'too low' it was a nice way of saying that they didn't fit in..<br>

Now, as to this Venril Sathir run. Merton, firsthand, should be ashamed of himself for making a mistake and not being able to own up to it or apologize to those that were hurt. Even more severely, he placed this blame on people that were set up for a legitimate try. All in an effort for Transcended to get a shot at it. If this is indicative of the attitude of Transcended in general, or the Transcended officers in particular (which I still do not believe is true), then there will have to be a re-evaluation of attitudes towards what appears to be a guild that resorts to low tactics in-game. If Merton is just being a jackass (which I know is true, but don't know if it is the whole story or not), then perhaps the craven people who can only sit and fling insults at people recruited into guilds should follow Merton's guild tag for a while. If reputation means something, which many people are expressing here, then Merton should be the proverbial black sheep for training and lying, especially with a guild tag.<br>

No, I was headed with like 3-4 other people in my group to the sewers.  So we hug the right wall out from zone in, and get to the far right corner of zone where the underwater tunnel that leads to sewers is.  I'm finishing off a spectral caller that I fished out of the moat there on the edge right before I was planning on diving into the tunnel and pulling that trash back to the ledge.  Suddenly, while still fighting a spectral caller, I get smacked by about 6 mobs and Venril Sathir warps on top of me.  4 melee hits and a lifetap and I'm dead.<br>
<br>
So we get rezzed, rez your victims at zone and say &quot;Well fuck, if they cant even pull Venril Sathir right or kill him, lets go in there and kill it&quot;.  So 8 of us assembled on the second tier in prep room waiting to see what would happen.  If you were to wipe.  We would just pulled him, killed him, rezzed you and went about our business.  But your next pull was successful, so we went homne.<br>
<br>
I'm not quite sure where you see where I made a mistake.<br>
<br>
I didnt do anything underhanded to try and get Venril Sathir for my party because he drops absolutely nothing of significance to us.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you dont believe me, ask Terrik or Xanta or any of the other people that were with me - I'm sure they will be happy to recount the events of that day to you.<br>

You do now that you have Moran in your guild.  As has been proven by not just myself he's a trainer from way back.  Hell just recently AFTER being guilded by you he trained some lowbies in LoIO because of his stupidity, and not fighting the mob on the platform.<br>
<br>
Moran I don't know what your fascination is with my guild and Velks but the truth is I see  your ass in there just as much as any memember of my guild.  I know how you got to be 60, you took the idiot route that is easy to see.  It takes no skill to level in VL anyone with half a brain can tell you that.  In a zone where nearly every spawn is contested and you can run around during prime time with no worry of causing a huge train you don't need skill.  There are hundreds of level 60 idiots who don't know how to play their character why should you be any different.  Contrary to what  your tiny brain may think but 60 does NOT equal a quality player.  <br>
<br>
I find it funny that you speak of Phalanxs accomplishments like they're yours.  You have been in that guild what four weeks? You have nothing to do with those accomplishments, you are riding on the coat tails of a guild that has worked it's way up.  So please stop trying to take credit for something you have nothing to do with.  Please stop talking about honor too, since you don't know anything about it.  Don't talk about respect either because that is something else you know nothing about.  <br>
<br>
From everything I have seen Phalanx is a great guild.  I don't see how you fit into it.  You are a trainer, a liar, and quite few other less than savory things.  I am just curious why they invited your dumb noskill ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1012<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/29/02 9:49:54 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Phalanx</span><hr size=1> While I kinda agree that Velk's is a lame way to level to 60, dunno whether to laugh or be disgusted at you flaming someone for something that you and your guild are admitedlly currently doing. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> <BR> <img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Iadas_Mistwalker/fullsize/Cyborz.jpg
