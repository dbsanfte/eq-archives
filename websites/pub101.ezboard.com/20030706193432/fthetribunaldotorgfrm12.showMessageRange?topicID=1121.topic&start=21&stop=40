<br>
<br>
   So for the record, I went after you, and tossed in a very small flame about your wife, to which your wife responded to, once she responded, she was fair game. ( and I did let loose on her full barrel, if she didnt want to get flamed she should of kept yer triple chinned jaw shut ).<br>
<br>
  As for your kids, how are they any less fair game then any other family member? Do I know your kids? Will your kids be scared by my postings? and if so why kind of fuckwad of a parent you to let them read the flameboard? <br>
<br>
   Seriously, you are full of excuses you coward. I am still here, still flaming you. Why dont you try fighting your own battles, and no if you think you owned me in a debate, you are fucking on crack too, I went after you, your wife, some moron named Selinore or something. Anyone who posted is fair game, so fuck off. If your wife is that sensitive you should of kept her ass off the flameboard, but I guess it gave ya two something to talk about. I am glad I could help your marriage.<br>
<br>
So from now, remember, special rules apply to Revolution members, they are the special olympic players of flames, as they have their own set of rules. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
You cannot flame women<br>
You cannot flame nice people<br>
You cannot flame personal lives<br>
You cannot flame incentious relationship<br>
You cannot hint at any possible sex between any of their family members<br>
You cannot flame anyone who ports, heals or feeds people<br>
You cannot flame anyone's weight<br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You do any of these to a Revolution poster, expect an email from ezboard, but please understand they are allowed to flame anything, including the above flames which cannot be made against them.<br>
<br>
Seriously, you guys are so sad and pathetic. <p><center>

(I) Is there anything so bold
   as an honest person?
think on this....
when your body is pierced
and the draining blood
makes your fingers numb
is it easier to be honest
and face that,
or hide away for a few more minutes...? <>

(II) she stroked the white mane
traced the sacred horn
with her fingertips...
she lightly licked the red smears
from her fingers...
it burned like it was supposed to.
she smiled sadly at the glazed eyes...
a touch less beauty in the world <>

(III) He knew it was time
and hence, he knelt...
pain in arms
and pain in head
he bent his mind in circles
as the blood dript
in circles...
and set his life
upon his lips... <>

(IV) it didn't take a lot
he thought
to fill it up...
and dipping finger
baptised one and all
making sure to save
the rest
till he turned them all
away... <>

(V) She slipped further...
into
the lake...
and the wetness
was mostly from her eyes.
what she thought was best
was being afraid
and in that
she turned away
her every wish... <>

you are a PUSSY.. <br>
<br>
who attacked a woman..  because her husband made you look like the slapnutz you are... You have no balls.. OR Class ..  <br>
<br>
<br>
funny you  should mention lying..  while coming here trying to pretend like I had anything to do with your getting a warning.. you know damn well it wasn't me,  but you figure you can divert attention from you blatant COWARDICE and the fact that you are a pussy who attacks women who were not even involved in the conversation, as soon as you start to lose an argument.. <br>
<br>
<br>
You can posture and pose and try and pretend like someone came here sporting for a fight,  then ran to the police as soon as you gave it to them..  I expect a PUSSY like you to lie and try to deny the fact that you are a lowlife..  Rifkind has maybe 4 posts ever in this forum before you attacked her..  NONE of them a flame on anyone ever..  She is a regular poster in the other areas of this board ..  She comes over to the flame section to see what kind of trouble I am getting in for the day.. and there you are like a PUSSY insulting her..You and your fuck brigage of buddies can try and deny what happened all you want,  you cant alter the FACTS.. <br>
<br>
You didn't run down into the mosh pit and then get reported for hitting someone down there with you..  You ran over to the ladies bathroom and started slugging girls who were standing outside waiting in line..  you are a PUSSY Darkmask..  you couldn't handle a fight with a MAN.. so you turned and attacked my wife,  then my children..  Then you come here and try and pretend like I had someting to do with your warning when you know damn well I didn't..<br>
<br>
you better PRAY I get banned from here Darkmask..  God knows you cant handle a straignt argument with me.. and it looks like Ezboard doesn't want you attacking innocent women and children when I start to make you look like the fuckwad you are..  So you now have to lobby for me to get banned so that you dont have to suffer anymore humiliation at my hands..  PUSSY .. <br>

<br>
Im a little dense.. so please quote me out the part of that where I was claiming responsibility..   dipshit.. <br>
<br>
<br>
I will agree with your assessment that there is no way in hell that the MANAGEMENT here saw Darkmask assaulting one of their non flame board members and did something about it..   It also seems unlikely that any of the &quot;citizens&quot; of this area saw an injustice and reported it..   So I will agree with your theory that it had to be Xaviera who did it..  However you are incorrect.. I had ZERO to do with it..   Since we can rule out the MANAGEMENT (moderator) of this thread doing the right thing,  It looks like at least one other person who comes to this board has a sense of decency and brought darkmask's uncalled for attack of an innocent bystander to the attention of the OWNER of the establishment.. <br>
<br>
This thread has a high potential to be another thread where that idiot Xaviera comes and posts the same thing over and over.. Much like the Danger thread..  so I will state clearly one more time my position.. and it will have to suffice.. <br>
<br>
Darkmask is a PUSSY.. <br>
<br>
Here is the best Analogy I can draw up..<br>
<br>
Darkmask actually has a life and by some  miracle he leaves his computer and goes out to a club.. During an alcohol induced delusional episode,  he thinks he is a man and jumps into the fray down in the mosh pit.  While in the pit Xaviera proceeds to toss him around like a rag doll.  Frustrated with his emasculation at the hands of Xaviera out in the mosh pit..  Darkmask retreats to the restaraunt area of the club and proceeds to assault Xaviera's wife who is sitting at a table minding her own business..  <br>
<br>
try and spin it any way you want Darkmask.  bottom line.. you are a PUSSY.. who couldn't fight with a man..  so you attacked his wife..   you cant change the FACTS .. <br>

Dunno how many times Xaviera has to post that he didn't report Darkmask before people actually comprehend that.  Also dunno why anyone would think that he did report DM.  Anyone reading these posts will see that Xaviera is every bit as insulting to DM as DM was to Riffy.  So if Xaviera reported DM, then he'd have to be pretty stupid to think he wouldn't get in as much trouble as DM.  Regardless of how much you hate Xaviera, he's not stupid.<br>
<br>
Much more likely that this was reported by either Rifkind or a sympathetic Revo member that was offended for her.  I can't really blame them for reporting him to be honest with ya.  Yes, this is the flameboard but what some of you seem to forget is that it's a public forum.  For DM to slander someone who doesn't take part in this FFA slugfest and allow all tribunal lurkers to see it is extremely offensive.  I know that if I were not a regular here and someone said something like that about me where everyone could read it, I would be pretty pissed off.  So the choices are, compete in the slugfest and defend yourself or eliminate the slander about you by &quot;tattling&quot;.  Since no one really wins in this forum, I can definitely see the logic behind getting the posts deleted.<br>
<br>
You can flame a participator for going to the cops, but not an innocent bystander that does not sling mud like the rest of us and takes offense to the mud slung at them when they weren't even here.   So whoever did it, Gratz... ya found just about the only way to win in this forum. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 1294<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 8:27 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> wolvar 1188 posts and still gay <p>retired poo slinger</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1189<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 8:32 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a</span><hr size=1> You guys are gonna desensitize my homophobia yet.
