<br>
It is more turn based than EQ.  Taking turns with the mob in melee is a heck of alot more obvious when playing daoc or I wouldn't have mentioned it.  I really thought about this to give you a benefit of the doubt, but I can't see any reason to support your statement.  In EQ it seems me and the mob are hitting in relation to our weapon delay, independantly.  In Daoc, I hit, the mob hits, I hit, the mob hits.  It's really really obvious.<br>
<br>
First person view is almost useless in daoc.  They said that when the game came out, that Daoc is based on 3rd person view and that people should get used to it.  You can't see your arms, can't look at your feet, and can't even tell you're fighting if it wasn't for the text.  It's not fun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Where as in EQ I could walk up to a mob, hit auto-attack, go take a piss, come back, and still be fighting the same sarnak janissary. Zero risk. EQ doesn't force multiple adds on you, so of course it human nature to take the most efficient and safest route: single pulling with a 6 man group.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Zero risk ?  I had a hotkey saying ADD INC !  They do force multiples on you in EQ, in dungeons at least.  I could see a condensed spawn in an open area where you can single pull, but you have to be carfeul and have to use harmony/calm.  And besides, in Daoc you know exactly how many are going to come based on group size, whether in a dungeon or not, so what's the diff ?  BAF is an insult to gaming, and it makes soloing far to easy.<br>
<br>
As far as me saying EQ was far more fast and furious, I will chalk that up to first person view.  It can get hectic in Daoc, but i'm not really in the fight there, I'm controlling from above and can see the whole area.  In EQ I rarely switch from first person because I like to think I AM the charachter and I am IN the fight.  Plus mobs can cast on you in EQ during a fight, whether that is good or not it sure makes it more hectic.  Daoc casters ARE pure melee once in melee range.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as only 3 necessary classes, My Daoc Druid and a Champion can take any mob or camp in Hibernia near our level with ease, thanks to Baf.<br>
<br>
 Near our level is also alot more defined in Daoc as the ratio is alot tighter due to levels meaning so much more.  You can fully buff a noobie warrior and he can take reds, a fully buffed hero has no chance against the equivalent purple.  This might be a good thing to stop powerlevelling, but it takes away alot of options too.<br>
<br>
In fact, alot of the things I screamed about in EQ make sense in the bigger picture.  For exapmle; If Enzo at 58 could solo a level 48 pure melee mob like he *should* be able to, the entire balance of the game would be destroyed.<br>
<br>
Daoc seems to have bee made by people who have played alot of UO/EQ/AC and tried to make a more user friendly combination of them,  not realizing that user friendly has it's limits if you want people to continue playing it.  This is something EQ seemed to know at the start.<br>
<br>
I will play EQ and wait for SWG.  Not only does SWG look amazing, it's being made by people who know what it takes to keep their player base. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uprenn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 2:57:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Age of Camelot R.I.P.  : P</span><hr size=1> Heh, thats what I always tell people who play games using the cheesiest strategies, the best build order, or god forbid cheat.<br>

What fun is the game if there's no challenge?<br>
<br>
Too much challenge is bad. Too little is worse.<br>
<br>
But, EQ's challenge is set up so that even if you powergame, mini/max, use all of the 'best strategies' (which usually involves A.I. manipulation) and so on, it's still a challenge for most people.<br>

True, the game should have been more finished considering the target gamer audiance, and hibernia sure could use a bit more oomp, but pound for pound, I still don't regret not having logged into EQ for the last 2 months.<br>
<br>
The biggest reason people get disapointed in camelot, I think, is that they try to compare it with EQ. Conversly, everyone that I know that left AC prefers camelot.<br>
<br>
I admit to a certain pride when I look at my characters in eq and think back on the effort it took to get them where they are now. I am proud of the names Wittles and Vaseel, and the characters that have been such. Their current incarnations are anticipated to be just as long lived, and I enjoy them just as much as I enjoy their EQ counterparts. <p><IMG SRC="http://home.sc.rr.com/guardians/Vaseelsig.jpg"WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urygor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rygor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33zard</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 7:47:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Age of Camelot R.I.P.  : P</span><hr size=1> Whittles, I agree completely. That is the point I try to make and of course not as good when I compare the two. Really nether should be compared to each other. They are different games. DAoC's numbers could be the same numbers in 2 1/2 years that EQ has today. Just because EQ had 400k accounts does not make it impossible to match given the amount of time. My only gripe is when people compare the two when one has been out for 2 1/2 years and the other for 2 months. It's not a fair comparison. From my experiences the majority of players are enjoying the game and have no inclination to go back to EQ, AC, UO or anywhere else they came from. From what I was reading the retention rate is currently 82% of customers renewing accounts. That number is a high number compared to the industry standard. As I said in 6 months I will come back and admit to being wrong &quot;if&quot; I am. Will others that bash it do the same? <br>

<br>
The thing is, EQ is the game to beat because EQ is The MMRPG out there. Not comparing DAoC to other games because it's a new game while others are established doesn't work. If anything, it should excel, not be lagging behind. <br>
<br>
Furthermore it has all the symptoms ever EQ had; Unfinished release, lots (and I mean lots) of bugs, sloppy customer support, grossly imbalanced classes, lack of content, unfinished dungeons, realms not balanced vs. each others, you name it, DAoC has the bug.<br>
<br>
No, I don't say DAoC sucks. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

The getting interupted when the NPC isn't even hitting is annoying though. But it makes the game challenging heh, especially soloing as a pet class.

But after that free month was up, I just didn't feel like paying peso's a month to run around looking for a group all day.<br>
<br>
Cause that's what it boiled down to. Ultimately, that's what every MMORPG will end up as. SoL does look like fun, but MMORPGS just aren't my thing anymore I guess. I've got two half naked 58+ characters just lingering in limbo on my EQ account, and I'm always in a constant debate on whether or not to start playing them again.

I haven't played either in about 3 weeks. Haven't played EQ except maybe 3 times in over 4 months now. Really haven't played in about a year, except maybe once a week average. Think I'm just burnt out on MMORP's as I've played EQ for over 2 years (since start of Tribunal). Basically same thing kill mob A to get to kill look alike mob B only bigger/different color/different name. Yes there are different mobs just seem the same after awhile. How many orcs/giants/kobolds in EQ can there be. How many Siabras/wolves/etc at different levels can there be.<br>

I agree though that if EQ got off their butts they would have the game hands down. I've had more fun replaying SoF or playing Max Payne, Undying, Playstation, Xbox, AoE, Stars Wars Battlegrounds, etc then either of those games right now. <p><b>Darnanin Stormheart</b> -

<br>
For DAoC being easy and too fast, I haven't seen any level 50 yet, although there are prolly some on other servers...though I think EQ had more level 50's after 3 months then DAoC will have...as for tradeskills, yup, you can get to bout 300 in one day if you have the cash, now try to get to 700-800 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I kinda compare the EQ/Daoc discussion with that married couple...they kinda hate eachother, but wont split cause they have been together for so long already <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Most people who are trying DaoC and posting on this board have at least 1 years EQ behind them, are probably in a well organised guild, that plans events and have a large group of friends to do things with. Maybe a lot of these ppl now find themselves LFG in DaoC, and so they are comparing the experience of playing one game to the experience of playing another. Going back to EQ is comfortable, events are organised, strategies are known.<br>
<br>
That being said, there are some valid points here and DaoC was not released as a finished product which is disappointing, however, IMO the combat system is a LOT better, tanks really tank.. a defensive tank blocks parries and doesnt do as much damage but they hold up in combat as they should do. Styles are a great idea and on the whole work. Cities are alive and have atmosphere (eq cities are just plain dead). PvP has been handled extremely well, theres no real loss which i think is great, (in terms of xp and items) so you can gome home when u like not get stuck their for hours like in the early days of eq. If you are looking for a product to rival eq, which has 2 and a half years of development behind it, you have to give it time, im still enjoying it, but maybe thats because i have friends and always a group, both for xp and PvP. Sure i switched when i reached 35 tho, although im enjoying albion far more than i did Hib, and with the barrows now itemised its more fun xping.<br>

<br>
I like DAoC still.  Its funny because I had never paid attention to it at all before it was released and Fandolas got me to try it.  I hated PvP in EQ, and I only dueled like 2 times ever before the Necro BoTB.  There may not be much of a point to RvR, but its fun.  Really fun.  Except for the huge 400 person keep battles, then I get about .2 FPS.  Funny how they even try to fix that, or even acknowledge the problem.<br>
<br>
I already hate Mythic every bit as much as Verant though.<br>

<br>
PvP didn't appeal to me with EQ... but, RvR is an entirely different matter.  We took our first Keep in Albion the other night and it was fast paced &amp; Exciting.  Shoot, we did so well, we headed off to another Keep to try to take that one, too! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Heh, we failed at that, but the fun was worth every minute.  <br>
<br>
The night before that, we retook one of our own keeps and defended the Milegates that the Midguards and Albions *must* pass through to leave their portal Keep areas.  (the keeps that port them into our lands)<br>
<br>
So... we go back and forth, Fighting BOTH realms that night.  The fights were furious.  As soon and we had fended off the Midguards at one gate, Someone was yelling over alliance chat that the Albions were coming on in full force at the other gate.  Off we would run to defend at yet another location, with entirely different styles.<br>
<br>
What a RUSH!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   All the while, when one gate was left unattended, enemies snuck in, to Spread Havoc in our lands.  Hahaha we just kept running back and forth, fighting constantly.  Even when we WERE up in a Gate, defending it with Ranged classes, there were cloacked rogue type enemies sneaking amongst our ranks, backstabbing our people and Taking them out with one Strike.<br>
<br>
Finally it gets to be very late.  Many people have to log for the night.  All 3 forces have dwindled.  Albions come through the Gate and wipe out Our small but defiant Hibernian Forces.<br>
<br>
I lay there, face planted in the battleworn mud and watch the albions rest up, med, rez, rebuff, etc.  (YES - when you're dead, you can STILL watch what's going on at your body until you /release) <br>
<br>
<br>
So there sit the lazy Albions.  Relaxed and satisfied that they won this battle.  when all of a sudden   ===WHAM!===  The Midguard Came in STUNNING them (litterally as well as figuratively) and Kicked their Butts!! hahahaha!  They had NO CLUE the Mids were out and about, spilling blood in our lands as well! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I was watching all of this from my corpse, mind you.   While laughing my ass off!  To top it off, there the Mids sit.  They had no idea the Albions had been coming in waves to the Gate and probably figured it was a small RvR party they happened across.  So what comes next?  Yep.   =:+:=WHOOOSH!!=:+:=  The Albions show up and AE their Parties to smitherines!  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YEEEEHAWWW!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
I honestly can't see myself getting bored with this.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Will taking keeps get old?  Probably.  Will taking 3 keeps in one fell swoop get old?  Eventually.  Will Taking an entire realm's frontier and Defending it while defending our own get old?  HA!  Not likely.<br>
<br>
The *only* complaint i really have against the game, at this point, is Better Dungeons.  I'd like to see more of them and I'd like to see them better designed. <br>
