<br>
&quot;The Tears of Veeshan&quot;<br>
<br>
Long ago occurred the tale I tell,<br>
Yet Dragons' power in Norrath still is strong.<br>
Inspire me, Tunare's blessed Muse<br>
That mortal lips might tell the tale anew,<br>
And more might hear the call against the Foe.<br>
<br>
Veeshan gave birth. Her First, a female child,<br>
Received the mighty favor of Veeshan.<br>
This Child became the cruel and wicked Queen<br>
Of Dragonkind, a fearsome Matron, who<br>
Made Norrath's lands the playground for her brood.<br>
<br>
In elder Age a Champion was born,<br>
One of whom the Prophets had foretold.<br>
Behold! He saw the terror on the land<br>
All caused by Veeshan and her evil Brood.<br>
His heart was moved to cleanse the world and so<br>
He sought enchanted armor and a blade<br>
To arm himself to vanquish Veeshan's spawn.<br>
Thus girded, to her lair he went to seek<br>
The Queen, the firstborn Child of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
The battle joined and metal clashed with Fang.<br>
Blade and claw drew blood, but both were strong,<br>
Both believed the other's end had come.<br>
Battle raged on for a day and night,<br>
Wyrm's and Warrior's blood flowed intermix'd,<br>
And still they fought upon the Dragon's Mount.<br>
<br>
The Warrior thought perhaps his end was near,<br>
That he, too, was to fall to Dragon's power.<br>
His muscles burned, and sweat poured o'er his brow.<br>
Who could keep up such a fearsome fight?<br>
And yet he knew the Dragon must not win,<br>
And that his fate must be to slay the foe,<br>
Wyrm tyrany o'erthrown by stronger Power!<br>
<br>
And with this thought impressed upon his mind,<br>
He thrust his sword once more and struck his mark!<br>
Through her eye, into her brain he pierced,<br>
And thus the Queen of Dragons lived no more.<br>
<br>
But then the world was filled with such a shriek!<br>
The mountain shook, and lightning filled the air,<br>
Veeshan felt the passing of her child,<br>
And looked to see who dared to harm the Queen.<br>
When Veeshan saw her dead upon the ground,<br>
Tears fell from Veeshan's eyes and made a Mark<br>
Upon the One who dared to slay her child,<br>
To warn her other Children to beware.<br>
<br>
And thus the ones who stand against Veeshan<br>
Are to this day marked with a Tear-shaped sign<br>
Of causes that are noble and are just,<br>
And fight the evil blight of Tyrany.<br>
<br>
 <p>Tigonie Silvanstar<br>
Warrior of the 36th Season<br>

Gnomes and koa'dal, Humand and Erudites stand shoulder to shoulder listening and drinking within the rough wood confines of this outpost far from Antonica.<br>
<br>
'To the TEARS!' cry some, 'Death to the Dragons!' cry others, while some faintly caress such items as they have taken from those dragons slaughtered.<br>
<br>
Aseop stands grinning near the back of the crowd, his pockets fluch with the coin, a dwarf and a barbarian passed out out at the table behind him covered with empty bottles and tankards.<br>
<br>
Aseop raises a glass, 'To the Tears and my friends among them!  May we never find our differences so great as to lead us to conflict!'<br>
<br>
With that Aseop downs the tankard and begins to move towards the exit, tossing some platninum to the young bard performing here in Fironie Vie.<br>
<br>
Aseop laughs and places a hand over his shoulder, 'Now if only I knew what my Mark meant..'<br>

She has prepared several dishes for many palletes, at least she hopes so...<br>
<br>
There is warm Honey berry pie, sweet cinammon rolls, a few omelettes made with one griffenne egg and several various meats(the rabbit meat one is her personal meal).  She sets the plates down and returns to the kitchen for the rest.  After all is served there are pancakes, and warm, freshly churned butter, and a tall tankard of refreshing Surefall sap..in addition to the previously served items.<br>
<br>
Salvia sits at the table with her omelette and listens intently to the tales of her guildmates.  She sits fascinated and remembers Drizle the young Vah Shir who sat here not long ago, she had wished to tell her story to Drizle, in hopes of helping her find meaning of the mark, but she is not here..so Salvia sits content listening and contemplating.<br>
<br>
&quot;Solarianne,&quot; she speaks turning to her well respected leader,&quot; I do not believe I have ever heard your story, would you be so kind as to grace us with it? There are many stories I have not heard yet...I would be so intrigued to hear them&quot;<br>
<br>
'To the Tears and our friends among them!&quot; comes the shout of Aseop the bard,&quot;May we never find our differences so great as to lead us to conflict!&quot;<br>
<br>
Salvia raises her glass and salutes the esteemed bard with a smile.  She then turns back to her guildies and awaits another story.<br>
<br>

Her goal is to get to her room and cleaned up.  Her fur is matted with blood and dirt, in short she is a mess.  She softly pads through the hall, trying to go unnoticed.  As she passes the kitchen she hears much laughter and cheers dedicated to the Tears roaring.  Her chest swells with pride, she is glad to be back home.<br>
<br>
After her bath she dons her armor on once again and heads downstairs, just as a wood elf bard walks out of the kitchen.  Drizles natural shyness of strangers kicks in and she stops to let him go on ahead, his back turned towards her.  She walks slowly and quietly behind him, til she reaches the kitchen door.  She slips in as quietly as possible,and surveys the room.  Salvia, Solarianne and several others sit arouond a table eating breakfast.  The scent of Honeyberry pie wafts across the room.  <br>
<br>
Drizles stomach growls in response to the scent.  She licks her lips and approaches the table cautiosly.  She taps Salvia on the shoulder softly.  Salvia turns her green elven eyes toward the Vah Shir, &quot;Drizle! I was just thinking of you dear, please sit and have some food.  We are telling stories about the mark.  You are most welcome to sit and listen, or maybe tell your own tale.&quot;<br>
<br>
Drizle nods appreciatevly towards the fair druid and cuts herself a big slice of Honeyberry pie.  With a glass of Surefall sap in front of her and the warm pie in her mouth she feels the pain in her paw subside and turn into the warm pulse she feels around these people who share the mark as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/btearsofveeshan25764.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ceggwin>Ceggwin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 6:23:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The story of the mark</span><hr size=1> A young, mischevious-looking halfling ambles in with a loose beltpouch in his palm.<br>

&quot;Silks!&quot;  the rogue mutters in a lilting Irish brogue.  &quot;Why must it always be silks they put in their pouches?  I could use a good platinum peice once in a while...&quot;<br>
<br>
The hobbit looks up to see his friend all laughing and cheering as a wood elf bows.  Eyeing a burgening purse filled with hard circular lumps, a telltale sign of coin, he creeps over to Aseop and slowly draws out a long, serrated blade to cut loose the pouch.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the halfling feels a quick jerk as he is lifted into the air by a surprisingly strong High Elven paladin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ceggwin Slyfoot!&quot; says Jalyna, slightly amused.  &quot;I should have known.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, hello thar, ma'am!&quot;  answers a rather frightened halfling, dangling in the air.  &quot;  I was, uh... er...  just collectin' a debt from me ol' friend Aseop here, ain't that right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jalyna sighs.  &quot;Ceggwin, it's a wonder there's still skin on your back.  You may be the greatest thief in the world, but you sure aren't a good liar.&quot;<br>
