I mean really the trial period is not just for the guild to size up the member but for the member to try on the guild for size as well.  <br>
<br>
I mean the guild I join isn't paying me, you aren't putting food in my mouth or the mouth of my kids so if I want to be choosy and do a trial run with all guilds, why shouldn't I?  Who knows,  maybe I join the companions and find out that they are too serious a raiding guild for me, so then I join RNG and find out they aren't raiding the content I want, then I join lego and find out that their guild chat is too harsh for my virgin ears.  I just recieved a reputaiton as a guild jumper, and why? Personally I think all those reasons are good ones to leave a guild (especially if you do it right away) and yet we have no guild-wide system in place because &quot;the way we run the guild&quot; is sooooo top secret and heaven forbid if we were to publically post our raid schedule, or actually be up front with the server population as to what we need (class-wise) and what we are looking for (personallity and/or commitment wise) from perspective guildies. <br>
<br>
I mean - think about it........ lvl 65 cleric #2493 (Sally) posts what shes looking for and what she won't do or tolerate and then shes contacted by 3 guilds, so she raids with each one a couple times - she says to herself boy guld 1 is just too damn hardcore for me, GUild 2s schedule doesn't quite fit mine and guild 3 doesn't appear to raid theplaces I want to raid.  which one do I want? Or do I want to wait, and try some more. eventually the cleric will find the right fit and make an educated decision, you know that as a player, being able to make a nice relaxed decision like that - that she/he will stay as a member of that guild, as she is aware already of what the other guilds out there have to offer and has already chosen this one.  <br>
<br>
THis would create stabler guilds, less friction between them and hey who knows maybe even (god forbid) friendships and co-operation between guilds, as you would always be trying to stab each other in the back by swaying key players to bounce from guild to guild.<br>
<br>
anyways just a thought - but I think it would have a chance. <p>Kulvinna of the nexus - Oracle - Tribunal</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kulvinnawazzentme>Kulvinna Wazzentme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Respect, Honour and Above <br>All Else Don't Steal My<br>Captain's Camp</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/03 3:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> EDIT above <br>

I'm the leader of a small guild, and we're finding it difficult to add players since we don't want to do the /ooc recruitment thing.  We want to get to know people first and all that.  Just relying on one of us to be in the right zone at the right time to group with an unguilded person makes for slow growth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And I think it would be up to the different guilds to respond or post on this imaginary forum whatever info they wanted public.  If they wanted to post some recruitment info that listed what they were about and maybe some raid times so people could check them out, then that's cool.  If they'd rather just sit back and watch for LFGers to post and then contact them privately, that's cool, too.  Either way, I think that a central place for this would be a good idea.<br>

<br>
Some guilds invite you if they accept your application, then give you, and them a trial period. In this period you can leave, or they can decide against you, and both parties seperate without ill will... However if you finish their trial period, then decide on another guild, most tend to see that as disloyal. I believe they feel this way anyway, DV doesn't have a trial period, so im just assuming on this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the best way to judge a guild is on it's rules, and members personality. So check their webpage, get some pickup groups with their members, and judge them off that.<br>
<br>
And to repeat what the other posters have said... definitely get 65. Turn that normal experience to 100%, put your head down and grind it for a week or two. You'll be very happy you did, and there aren't too many guilds who would turn down a 65 shaman who plays as much as you, and wants to raid as much as you do. The shaman burn out rate at high levels is high, so theres always a need. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=451880">Kedaek Shadowelm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Forest Stalker of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.darkvirtue.org">Dark Virtue</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sashanna>Sashanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 3:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I mean the guild I join isn't paying me, you aren't putting food in my mouth or the mouth of my kids so if I want to be choosy and do a trial run with all guilds, why shouldn't I?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well actually a guild is... at least the EQ equivalent.  If you have 10 recruits needing flagging from tier 1 to the elemental planes thats something like 27 encounters with an average lenght of two hours each - with a raid force of 60 people thats 60 x 27 x 2 = 3240 man hours.  Divide that by ten and you are looking at putting 324 man hours into every recruit as a guild just to get them flagged for the elemental planes - nevermind getting them spells and equipment (and this is a *conservative* estimate).<br>
<br>
If you join a guild they *want* you to be happy and they *want* you to be committed - theres far too many people that suck up those 324 man hours and drift away to something else.  Its a pretty heavy commitment on both sides for someone joining a serious raiding guild.  <br>
<br>
That being said more casual guilds probably have a more casual approach.  Raiding guilds just cant afford the manhours unfortunately =/.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=conjem>Conjem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/03 3:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> Requiem is always interested in active players who want to raid.  <br>

If you are forward with it and make the recruiters aware, i doubt they would fault you for it. Most often though the multiple applications are discovered by random guildmate browsing a guild board and forwarding the information back to the recruiters. You can see in that case why they aren't too  pleased about it. <br>

<br>
What's a level 65 shaman with level 62 spells...<br>
<br>
a shaman who can scribe all the spells a guild gives them.<br>
<br>
65 first. It makes all teh difference. After that, AAs. If VT is important to you, then get all of your shards and as many pieces of the emp key as possible. Taking initiative and doing stuff like that really makes a guild willing to guild you, especiallyi fhtat is an area they raid often. The shards are fairly easy to solo with only a few exceptions.<br>
<br>
Spells can be purchased or farmed, either way, they aren't that hard to come by.<br>
<br>
In terms of specific guilds:<br>
<br>
Comps (they will require 65 though if they need shamans)<br>
Legendary<br>
RNG (they are more US time zone based)<br>
<br>
would be good guilds to investigate. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3893">Draelon Stormsong</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
