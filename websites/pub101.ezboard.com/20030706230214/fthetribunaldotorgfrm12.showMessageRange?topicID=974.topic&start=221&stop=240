What proves the Bible isn't a compiled book of stories written by some ancient Steven King who did not wish to use his real name? How proves the Bible isn't indeed fiction?<br>
<br>
The only difference is faith. You believe it is not fiction without needing prove. You believe it was written by God without prove. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That is what I argue that the 24000 historical copies of the bible present.

<br>
The only thing this proves is either people did a good job at translation or memorization, or you are glossing over the vast inconsistancies by claiming the language barriers prevented direct translations.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how you can possibly draw the conclusions that simply because a book existed 2000 years ago, whatever inside is true. The reason you gave, as I understand them, is that since people did a good job at translating the contents, then the contents must be true.<br>
<br>
The quality of translation and the number of surviving old texts proves one thing--this book was pretty popular through the European region and any region under their influence. It says not one thing about the validity of the contents of this book.<br>

<br>
Your example was flawed to begin with. The correct example of your 24000 copies of old versions of Bibles should be &quot;If one person tells you you smell 10000 times, then he is likely to be corret&quot; which, is entirely false.<br>
<br>
The only thing you can prove with 24000 surviving copies of the Bible is that the Bible indeed existed, and the Bible was fairly wide spread. It offers zero prove as to whether the content of the Bible is true, nor does it offer any prove regarding whether the Bible is the holy text you claim, or maybe a collection of stories written by a historian, or indeed the mad ramblings of someone who lived 1900 years ago.<br>

There is *massive* archaeological evidence to support the rough accounts of the Old Testament... do the degree that when the bible describes a city, it probably really existed; same with major battles.<br>
<br>
The details (especially the individuals) are most likely folklore.<br>
<br>
The New Testament isn't really a &quot;historical&quot; text per se - rather, its the teachings of a guy named Jesus, and a few of his followers telling their own accounts of the tale.  It doesn't really recount 100s of years of history of a people, etc.<br>
<br>
Did Jesus exist?  Oh, most definitely.  Not only do we have lots and lots of Christians (even at the time) to back that up, we have Roman evidence as well.  Did he preach a new version of Jewish religion?  Well - yeah - sorta.  Maybe a clarification, or a re-interpretation.  Of course, if you accept that he was also the son of God, he wasn't just a philosopher.<br>
<br>
The age or &quot;wide-spreadness&quot; of the bible doesn't make it any more or less valid; Plato is older and, while not nearly as &quot;widespread&quot; today, has certainly been read enough times.  Yet much of what he said is known to be parable or outright storytelling in order to illustrate his philosophies -- and I'd argue that the bible (old and new testaments) are much the same.  That doesn't even remotely invalidate them - the message is there, I just don't buy the literal facts in many cases :)<br>
<br>
Historical texts are, by definition, flawed, because they're always told by someone who is biased.  Even the Roman historical texts (including those of Josephus, who is where we have most of our &quot;documentation&quot; on the people of ancient palestine, other than the Old Testament) can be widely backed up by physical evidence (archaeology, etc), but are hardly considered &quot;cannonical&quot;.  Indeed, the Romans were FAMOUS for writing their histories in grand fashion, glorifying themselves and massively exaggerating their battles.  Doesn't mean the battle didn't happen.<br>
<br>
So, back to Holdan's point - is the Bible a useful reference to ancient history?  Oh, absolutely.  Should it be taken literally?  Well... the historical aspects... in many cases, no.  The philosophical aspects, of course, are open to whether or not you choose to accept the philosophy :)<br>
<br>
As a side note, the Dead Sea scrolls pretty much confirmed that the texts of the old testament really are basically intact from their original forms... so these &quot;tales&quot; are at least as old as the writings of the ancient greeks and romans, and should be taken with as much validity.  Only difference is, the Greeks/Romans made a clear distinction between their mythology and history; the Jews combined them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uadolenandmurray.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adolen and Murray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/7/02 5:47 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://sayree.homestead.com/files/HANKPIC.jpg height=102 width=78></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: With all of the topics sharing this theme:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What proves the Bible isn't a compiled book of stories written by some ancient Steven King who did not wish to use his real name?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You deny the existence of God because you have no proof, while at the same time you discount the truth of the bible without any proof.  So do you folks need proof to believe something, or don't you?<br>

<br>
I think you are confused on a fundamental level.<br>
<br>
We *talk about* the works of scientists. We *discuss* the validity of their theories and claims. We do not blindly except what they say for truth, and we certainly don't expect them to effect our afterlife, if there is one.<br>
<br>
That is the difference between science and religion. One is constantly questioned and changed, proven, overthrown, and proven again. The other one is accepted without question. Yes, yes, you can question the details of the Bible all you want, but I doubt any of the Christian believe questions the core of their religion. If they did, they wouldn't be Christians, would they?<br>
<br>
You claim the contents of the Bible (not the historical references unless you want to pass the Bible as an incomplete history book. I'm talking about the religious and mystical references of the Bible) true, and honestly it is your right to believe in whatever you do. However, what makes you believe other than your faith?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You deny the existence of God because you have no proof, while at the same time you discount the truth of the bible without any proof. So do you folks need proof to believe something, or don't you? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nice twist of words there, but I suppose nothing else denotes your confusion in a clearer manner.<br>
<br>
In order for many people who do not have blind faith to believe in something, it must have prove. The premise is: Without prove, everything is invalid. Everything begins as invalid until you can prove its validity. So, unless you *can* prove the contents of the Bible is valid, it begins as invalid.<br>
<br>
Sure, you can argue &quot;why don't we just say everything's valid until proven invalid?&quot; Well, that's fine, but then you must prepare to believe the validity of a *hell* of a lot of things since they are difficult to prove it otherwise. This is so because under this premise, you have to assume everything everyone says is true unless you can prove it otherwise. I'm sure you can see the problems that could be generated from this system.<br>
<br>
Trying to convince to a Christian that their God does not exist is a futile excercise as long as he has faith. It is the same with any member of any religion. A strong faith is all you need to accept whatever you believe in. Only those of weak faith tries to invalidate the faith of others, thinking this somehow strengthens themselves. <br>
<br>
I guess the most amusing thing of them all is some of the faithful (in any belief) is apparently weak enough in their faith that they try to use reason and logic to prove the validity of their faith. Logic and reasons only deals with facts, with things that can be explained. By definition, they would exclude the mystical nature of ANY religion. <br>
<br>
I doubt anyone can prove gods exist, and equally I doubt anyone can prove that gods do not exist. Either way is fultile, since we do not have enough of the facts that logic and reason depends so heavily upon. It all comes down to faith, whether you have it, or not. <p><BR>

Just because someone existed does not make every word others wrote about him true. They wrote what they believed, what they wanted to believe and sometimes what they actually witnessed.<br>
Even people who profess to be historians have skewed the truth. Do you really think a &quot;disciple&quot; would be less prone to do so?<br>
And for the person (forget who it was and I'm not looking back again) who thinks my views are simplistic, make a point please, you refuted nothing I said, merely criticized that I said it in terms most people can understand.<br>
The fact is that religion is propagated by believers, NOT by documents. Documents are merely used to support the believers. Tell a person nothing about religion and turn them loose in a library with all the religious texts in the world. I seriously doubt they would have an easy time believing any of them.<br>
I'm sure the christians have faith that christian texts would glow or something to guide this uneducated lamb to the only true religion.<br>
And if you think the bible exists today exactly as it was written way back when, think again.<br>
The bible has been edited many times over the last millenia to conform to whatever the current oligarchy of organized religions wishes the masses to believe. Does this mean nothing from the original bible exists? Of course much of it does, it's more what has been taken out over the years.<br>
I don't personally know this for a fact, but consider this:<br>
The christian religion dates back in it's most organized form to Roman times. At the time christainity was coming into it's own, it's major competitor if you will was Mithraism.<br>
Many of the basic beliefs of Mithraism were rolled into the christian religion to make it more palatable to those who were undecided.<br>
<br>
According to Persian mythology, Mithras was born of a virgin given the title 'Mother of God'. The God remained celibate throughout his life, and valued self-control, renunciation and resistance to sensuality among his worshippers. Mithras represented a system of ethics in which brotherhood was encouraged in order to unify against the forces of evil.<br>
Mithras was also sealed in cave and &quot;reborn&quot; once a year.<br>
And oh, funny, Mithra ascended into heaven to be with his father.<br>
<br>
Gee folks, see any similarities here? These similarities in and of themselves would mean less if it were not for the fact that Mithraism was christianity's main competitor at the same time.<br>
<br>
Now you can call these thoughts simplistic if you like, but what's really simple is the fact that religion is more a way to manipulate and control people. <br>

The second coming of Jesus Christ. He said he was, so I bet it's true. Besides, if he wasn't would the ATF firebomb his ranch into oblivion? I think not! The ATF is the modern day Romans, and Janet Reno is Pontius Pilate. <br>
<br>
Someone write a new New Testement for David Koresh, I have a feeling 2000 years from now he'll have a huge following. You could call it the Newest Testement and only Koreshians will follow it. It'll have the four main books of Bob, Ralph, Ed, and Mike and then we'll have a couple letters from some of Koresh's followers to the FBI and ATF. We'll call those letters a book also. We could close this Testement out with the prophet Steven King. He'll write a whole chapter about what happens to Koreshians that don't follow the new new rules. We'll call it the Book of Irrevelations. We will need some disciples to go run around spreading the good word of David Koresh and dunking people in water, of course. This could work, you know. The morons had alot less to work with and they are Gajillionaires already out there in Salt Lake City.<br>
<br>
Sure, it's a stretch, but hey, if enough Koreshians kill... I mean, convert... enough Christians and Jews they could one day rule the civilized world! Although, I wonder if they will debate the existence of Koresh or will they just rent the Waco video from Blockbuster? That reminds me, I need to watch Ben Hur again, I'm pretty sure Jesus is in that one. He should be easy to spot. White male, thirties, long blond hair and blue eyes. Yep, that's my savior right there! He even looks like a WASP! <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

The God remained celibate throughout his life, and valued self-control, renunciation and resistance to sensuality among his worshippers. Mithras represented a system of ethics in which brotherhood was encouraged in order to unify against the forces of evil.<br>
Mithras was also sealed in cave and &quot;reborn&quot; once a year.<br>
And oh, funny, Mithra ascended into heaven to be with his father.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Good to know that this religion obviously is what Christianity was based from.<br>
<br>
There is only one problem with this.<br>
<br>
All of the points you mentioned are prophecies of the Old Testament, and are at the core of Judiasm, which predates Mithraism by several centruries.  Aside from that, there is an astounding lack of proof revealing that Mithras was even worshipped solely as a God, and instead was a fringe god of the Pantheons.  The idea that he was worshipped uniquely as a God and not a part of a Pantheon is hotly disputed, as well as his origins.  Just a side note - I've read the essay you quoted the description of Mithras from, it's not very good and is full of holes.  One of the large things it fails to address is the fact that the Persians usually came across cultures with Dieties that were intresting to them.  They were assimilated into their culture.  In fact, they had to have several reforms to their religion because of the sheer number of dieties included.  It was interesting how the Persian religions often had sudden widespread mention of a diety with no previous mention of it.  In short, they practiced plagurism.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And if you think the bible exists today exactly as it was written way back when, think again.<br>
The bible has been edited many times over the last millenia to conform to whatever the current oligarchy of organized religions wishes the masses to believe. Does this mean nothing from the original bible exists? Of course much of it does, it's more what has been taken out over the years.<br>
I don't personally know this for a fact, but consider this:<br>
The christian religion dates back in it's most organized form to Roman times. At the time christainity was coming into it's own, it's major competitor if you will was Mithraism.<br>
Many of the basic beliefs of Mithraism were rolled into the christian religion to make it more palatable to those who were undecided.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Please list any sort of proof you have that the bible was influenced by agendas.  If you are referring to the 4 &quot;gospels&quot; left out of the bible, I can address each one as you bring them forth.  But Mithraism was never a seriously widespread religion.  The place where Christianity intended to draw most of it's followers was from the Jewish populace, but ended up drawing more from the Gentiles.<br>

I can't believe I even complared an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> obvious</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fraud like Koresh to Jesus Christ. What was I thinking? He can't possible be a prophet of the lord; he had such a small following. You know, back in the day all you needed was 13 guys to believe in you and you were off and running with your own religion. Now days it takes millions of followers for anyone to notice you. Hell, Islam is rapidly becoming the worlds largest religion and nobody notices them until they blow up a building. What they need is a good propaganda machine, like dunking people in water, making them eat tiny pieces of bread, or slicing off thier foreskin. That's the way to fill the pews.... oh, and collection trays, of course. Can't forget those collection trays. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

I mean, beside the fact that she's trying to recreate the origins of a popular religion, and the fact that she is interpreting possible reasons for the changes in the said religion, and the fact she's giving a plausible explination to the Bible, she's got nothing on questioning the validity of the contents of the Bible!<br>
