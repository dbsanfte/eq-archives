<br>
If you're shooting a firearm recklessly, that's one thing-- reckless conduct with a lethal weapon. If you're playing around, with something not likely to cause harm, and an accident happens-- well, shit, that's why it's called an accident. I mean, if you're running along playing with your friends, and your shoe throws up a rock and someone trips and breaks their arm, are you responsible?<br>
<br>
I'd say no.<br>
<br>
I'm not one who buys into the victim mentality of America where &quot;nothing's my fault&quot;, and &quot;XYZ caused this to happen, not me!&quot;, but at the same point, there's got to be a fuckin' line somewhere where sometimes, it isn't someone's fault-- shit happens, and there isn't someone that needs to be blamed each time.<br>
<br>
Assault and battery do not match without malicious intent. That's like saying if you trip and fall on someone and break their leg that you assaulted them-- it doesn't fit the bill.<br>

Its not like he accidently shot that spitball.  He intentionally did it and as a result someone was hurt.  He shot a projectile at another person(s).  This is a dangerous act.  A lot of us may all have done it when we were younger, but that does not excuse it. We were all alos told NOT to do it, often with the warning we could put someones eye out and if you got caught you got in trouble.  There is no need to bring charges IF no one is harmed, but here someone DID get injuried, seriously.<br>
<br>
Those other examples you are useing aren't the same.  They involve true accidents, not unintentional consequences of a intentional act.  <br>
<br>
One thing that I question, is the seriousness of the charges but some of the details are missing.  There isn't a lot of detail about the &quot;spitball&quot;  Was it the foil part of the gum wrapper?, the paper part?  This does make a difference in my eyes because a small metal projectile is inherently dnagerous, while a paper one is only dangerous if it hit the wrong place.   <br>
<br>
Here you have an act that was NOT an accident that unintentionally caused an injury.  I do think that the charges went overboard, but the kid DID deserve some form of punishment.    Wreckless endangerment, or whatever IS perfectly acceptable.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

He told his friend he wondered how far the foil gum wrapper could fly, blew it up in the air (The spitball title given in the news reports are misleading if what he says is true... his lawyer was there beside him, so I am sure this was his account through the hearing anyway) and somehow it came in contact with the victims eye.<br>
<br>
They didn't say how he got the gum wrapper to fly, but he did make it clear that he wasn't aiming at anyone. This is not like shooting a spitball from his account... it's more like throwing a paper airplane. The idea was to get distance, not hit a target.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the real question is, was there intent? If yes, then punishment is in order, but if there is no intent, then you have to ask, was his actions reckless? If you consider throwing a paper airplane in a crowded gym reckless, then I guess the answer is yes.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, the way this case was judged, a paper airplne is considered a dangerous weapon, because it too can put your eye out. But, if you blow dust off the sleeve of your jacket and some of it gets in another students eye, that can put an eye out as well (not likely, but then neither is losing an eye from a gum wrapper).<br>
<br>
I dunno, I just can't help but feel there was some flawed logic in this decision. <p><br>

But if you are the cuase of the accident, as in the accident wouldnt have happened but for your actions, then sometime you are responsible for them. That chair breaking example you gave wasnt quite accurate. It would be more like a 500 lb man sits in a chair clearly marked for children only, the chair breaks, hits you in the leg and breaks it, he is convicted of battery and mayham. That's more accurate.<br>
<br>
Imagine you are the person that just got his leg broken. Will you say, &quot;oh well, it was an accident&quot;? Then watch him do it again because he can. Because if you rule it some kind of act of nature and hold him blameless once, you have to EVERY TIME. And that's what the criminal system is there for isn't it? To hold people accountable for their actions and rehabilitate them. How many time does a 500 lb man have to sit in a childs chair and break it cuasing others harm before you finally will say, &quot;OK, that was no accident!&quot;?<br>
<br>
Now lets apply that line of thinking to this case. You are the victims parents. Was it just at total accident? If you say yes then you have to stand idly by while he does it again and some other kid has to go to eye surgery. You can't selectively enforce the law. Battery is battery. This is pretty cut and dry, no accident here, the kid fucked up.<br>
<br>
Now, is the punishment appropriate? We don't know sice he hasn't been sentenced. If the kid fries then you can bitch all you want about our fucked up legal system, but I imagine not much wil happen to him. Yeah, it's fucked up that battery is a felony, but he did do it. You can argue this is battery and that isn't all day long but when it comes down to it, would you want your own child to be sitting near this kid as he &quot;accidently&quot; throws things into the air in a crowded auditorium. If you do, the I believe I'm not the only half-wit posting here.<br>
<br>
The real injustice will be when the kids parents sue the school for not supervising their child better, and then the school counter sues the bleacher manufactuer for not designing the bleachers better, then the bleacher company raises prices, and your taxes go up as the school district is forced to buy a new bleacher to replaced the one that was deemed unsafe by the federal goverment after some kid poked another kids eye out with a spitwad... and around we go. Civil cases are way fucked up.<br>
<br>
The system isn't perfect, but at some point you have to claim responsibility for your fucked up actions. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

Wow Dumai, you really believe it was you that made me stop posting on the flameboard? How egotisical of you, you fit right in with Loegan. I didnt like what the flameboard brought out of me, because it often interferred with relationships, often using a flameboard attitude on someone in a post where it was unwarranted, I took some time, tried to see how I could prevent this from happening so as to not flame people who didnt truely deserve it. I dont see how that is a flip flop, I dont post on the flameboard as much as I used, and in fact I only post on subjects where I am quite familar with the person who the flame is about and then only to add my two cents, you can feel free to check. Sorry but act like I said I was never coming back to flameboard, I never said that, I did try to avoid it, and avoid being drenched in it, so it wasnt a flip flop. Try again, and sorry if you really think you owned me, it only goes to show how much of a moron SI people are, if you think that was owning something. Please check your timeline, I didnt stop because of you as much as you wish to believe I did. You SI people are so desperate for a victory you will make up anything I suppose to help foster those egos.<br>
<br>
I dont really understand this pattern you speak of with Anyane/Razzine, how does my relationship with her and her fucking over guildmembers make me a hypocrite, you are gonna have to explain that as that really doesnt make any sense.<br>
<br>
Yes I bought my way into my guild's good graces with drawings, yes by god that has to be true because that is what you think, or maybe perhaps I was already in the guild for almost 5 months before I drew anyone. Oh god that would really fit in with your scenario, but alas you are grasping at straws. I pulled my own weight in my guild, thank you very much, sorry though you act like you have intimate knowledge of what was going down, but you dont. Try again Dumai and this time actually use some facts.<br>
<br>
And considering 90% of all my drawings are commision only I dont believe I did it to get into anyone's good graces as much as I did it because I enjoyed it, and saw a chance to get payed for something I enjoy doing....if you dont understand that concept, talk to Rynnia she will explain it.<br>

I dont know if it was a month ago, but yes I was under the impression because of said new job you didnt play anymore, then came the revalation that you did in fact play and according to you, up to 8hours a day, which is much more then you used to commit to the guild. I was under the impression you had quit, and only lurked on the boards, as you had told us you didnt have the time to play anymore, but all that was a lie as it came out you actually played more when you left the guild.

You dont have the desire to deal with me because I called you on these issues and you still havent rebuked my accusations, only tried to point out my flaws in an sad attempt to mask your own lies. Your stories are full of holes and lies and backpedalling, and no one takes you seriously dear delluded Loegan. You left this board because you felt opressed and issued a warning about how we were all blind to what you saw, so tell me, the board hasnt changed, what has prompted you to return oh glorious Loegan? Did you flip flop on your stand? How long did your strike of the board last? Till you stopped getting the attention you want? Till you realized how stupid you had been? When you realized no one really followed you? Has it sunk in yet how little you are, how your leaving and rants have had no impact on this board. Not as big you thought you were Loegan now are you...<br>
<br>
I do however love your little break down of posts, how funny and humorous you must believe you are, what a chuckle you have given yourself. I can understand things changing, but in some respects, you made statements and quickly changed said statement, not because you feel you might be wrong, but you felt your opinion was unpopular and you didnt like being raked over the coals.<br>
<br>
Your example of using the sky is quite nice, but it doesnt match up to your statements of how racism is wrong but homophobia is okay, how racist jokes are not to be tolerated but jokes about homosexuals are okay, and why is it, um...we watch Loegan pull this one out of his ass....because he has gay friends...in fact his wife and sister are lovers....so its okay for him to make gay jokes, but remember anyone making a racist joke is subject to his disrespect and a flame from him, but please dont yell at him for making homosexual jokes about flaming homosexuals and how funny they are...so eventually it comes to its okay to make jokes about anything as long as you have friends to whom the joke refers to, make a gay slam, its okay if you got the gay friend, make a racist joke, its okley dokely if you have a friend of that race, of course this didnt really match up and most of the flameboard called you on it Loegan the Limpwristed.<br>
<br>
You also need to point out how you said you were leaving the Tribunal Board and you meant it, but you have returned...and you didnt even try to explain the change in you that made it possible, see, you can say how a month has passed in your little example of a back and forth between us, but that gives an explaination and thusly I would of course look stupid for not realizing that, and your joke makes sense if that was the case, but it is not, you never gave an explaination for all your sudden changes of heart dear man of principle, man of convinction. <br>
<br>
Your opinion changes like the wind, but you refuse to acknowledge that and that would be fine if you didnt build yourself up to be such a man of conviction, or principle, of truth, honor and loyalty. You pretend to be one thing and in reality are a very differnt then what you pretend to be.<br>
<br>
I ask for you to rebuke what I have said not to attack my character and how crazy I have become according to you, but you still havent. What has changed to bring you back to the board you told to fuck off and hated so much...was it a flip flop or would you grace us with your thinking process, but you sneaking in under the wire like you did seems to follow your pattern of flip flopping and praying to get away with it, you hate being called out.<br>

Very True, I am waiting for Loegan to claim responsiblity for all his fucked up actions and posts.

If I am on a raid and healing for the wizzie group and get a call and all the other druids are taken, it is a pain for the wizzies (or I believe it to be at least).<br>
<br>
But yes, you were correct when you said it had more to do with how older members were being treated. I was told up front that I would be not kicked. But, that doesn't mean that the rest of the guild would have liked it any better having one standard being used for some members and another standard being used for the rest. In the end, people would have just ended up disliking me and whoever else got a pass. don't ya think?<br>
<br>
Besides, after the comments about the guild being a purely raiding guild, not a family or a &quot;welfare&quot; guild, I figured I wasn't wanted because I strongly disagreed with that thinking and seemed to be in the minority.<br>
<br>
I always figure you change what you can and either accept or walk away from what you can't change. At the time it seemed obvious to me that the guild attitude wasn't going to change. I won't air dirty laundry, but you know the events that took place  and the people who left before I did. What indication was there that my assumption was wrong?<br>
<br>
Was I wrong? If what you say is factual, then yes, I guess I was. But the change happened after I left and I saw no signs of it while was there, so I am not going to beat myself up over it. I decided based on what I saw and knew at the time.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Wow, sounds like you could be talking about yourself Loegan, you often twist the truth to place yourself in a favorable light.

Give me specifics that I can disprove. How did I distort anything about my moved posts? What did I say that was a lie about either Muse or Jas?<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I dont know if it was a month ago, but yes I was under the impression because of said new job you didnt play anymore, then came the revalation that you did in fact play and according to you, up to 8hours a day, which is much more then you used to commit to the guild. I was under the impression you had quit, and only lurked on the boards, as you had told us you didnt have the time to play anymore, but all that was a lie as it came out you actually played more when you left the guild. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This is why I get so fuckin pissed with you. I copy and pasted directly from my goodbye post. It clearly shows I said I would have more free time and could show to almost every raid. Yet, here you are saying once again that I said I couldn't play as much.<br>
<br>
I have explained over and over again about being on call and how it effects my playtime. If you don't understand it by now, you never will. But let's get one thing straight - just because you are too fuckin dense to understand a message, explained in your native tongue, in as simple of a way as anyone could put it, that doesn't mean that I am a lair or a hypocrite. Don't take your inability to read and comprehend out on me. I made it as clear as humanly possible... I did my part.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  You dont have the desire to deal with me because I called you on these issues and you still havent rebuked my accusations, only tried to point out my flaws in an sad attempt to mask your own lies.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
No, I don't want to deal with you for the reasons stated. And even moreso because until this last post, you make little to no sense, quote non-existent messages, pull crazy ideas out of thin air that have no basis in reality... and yet because your posts are 5 pages long and well written, you think it somehow masks the fact there is no factual content. Maybe it fools people who don't have the attention span to read the whole post or the desire to check past posts against the shit you put forth. If that is the case, then you can smear me pretty well. But for anyone with a good memory or knows how to read back posts and understand english, then it's bullshit.<br>
<br>
I don't mind refuting actual quotes, facts and opinions based on reality. I can't stand debating someone who quotes posts that never existed, presents fantasy as facts and whose opinions have no reasonable basis.<br>
<br>
I like to make people look bad who attack me as much as the next guy, but the difference between you and I is, I will use his/her own words and facts to do it. You used to do the same, but now you use distorted facts and outright fabrications. It's no fun  just saying you are lair or arguing a fact again that I  already posted proof of.<br>
<br>
How long do you think I'll fuck around proving the same thing over and over again, only to have you keep talking like you didn't even see it? It's like arguing with a madman, you couldn't convince him with a lightening bolt and a booming voice from the sky FFS.<br>
<br>
The rest of your post just breaks down to your tired old tactics you use on everyone that you can't fight with facts. You accuse them of having big egos or being idiots or some other attack on their personality. I guess you believe this hides the fact that your posts have little to no true substance. Grant it, it's entertaining and almost looks real, but if you get past the pretty window dressing and the thrill of the flame, it's just like the posts on the FB that say a guild is breaking up when it's obvious they aren't. It's an easy way to get attention but it's still bullshit.<br>
<br>
If it wasn't for my self respect I would use your own tactics against you. After all, in the words of Eric Hoffer:<br>
<br>
 &quot;You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you&quot;<br>
<br>
Course you don't frighten me much, but you sure as hell irk me. I would settle for being able to return the favor.<br>

<br>
I have been thinking about this Arle, and I have to disagree. When it happens the first time, there is no negligence because the person (in this case) could not reasonably be expected to forsee the outcome.<br>
<br>
If it happened again however, you can than argue that the person could reasonably be expected to know the possible result of his actions. That would make it negligence.<br>
<br>
For instance, a man drives a car whose brakes are making a funny noise. He figures it is just brake dust and continues driving only to have an accident and injure someone. In this case, you could argue the man had no way of knowing that noise meant his brakes were faulty.<br>
<br>
However, if the situation were to repeat itself and he acted in the same way the next time, then he could be held accountable because it can be proven he had reason to know what the possible results of his actions would be.<br>
<br>
Really, is it reasonable to expect a child to be aware of the risk of blowing a gum wrapper in the air? Hell, I am an adult, work in the medical field and am known to be way more cautious than the average person, yet I would have never forseen that one coming.<br>
<br>
Shooting paper clips with rubber bands is something you can expect kids to know is dangerous. Expecting them to think shooting spitballs or gum wrappers is dangerous is expecting a little much imo.<br>
<br>
Then again, if it happened to my daughter... who knows. I like to think of myself as reasonable, but when it comes to my own kid... maybe I would act the same way. <p><br>

I will freely admit to no knowing anything at all about what happened between Loegan/Anyane and EV.<br>

But, it sounds like Loegan may have been in some kind of relationship with her and spoke up for her with EV.  Now you are attempting to flame him because he was hoodwinked by her -- just as you were before.<br>

I had mentioned the fact that I thought Anyane was actually Razzine when she first joined. It was denied by both her and Bowynn though and I can't remember how that situation turned out to be honest. I don't remember any real problems concerning her, but I seemed to be unaware of alot of side issues in the guild back then. Sublimanal filtering I guess. <br>
<br>
Anyway, other than that, I have had no contact or dealings with Razzine/Anyane at all. DM would have no reason to flame me about be taken by her, since I pretty much avoided her due to concerns of my own. <p><br>

*spelling corrected*<br>
<br>
<br>
Well that little snippet sums it up quite nicely.<br>
<br>
What you know and what you think you know are vastly different, why would I fill you on a private guild matter that was between me and the guild to which Loegan made reference to and I rebuked.<br>
<br>
It had nothing to do with Loegan being involved with Razzine/Anyane, so please stop making assumptions, you tend to do that alot.<br>
<br>
You do however find alot of joy in attempting to make my relationship with Razzine/Anyane a source of an embarassment to me, you tend to fall to it hoping it is my weak point, much like many of your fold attack my artwork and related issues to that.<br>
<br>
My honesty to the Razzine/Anyane issue helped people, I know this because they communicated to me afterwards, saying they had fallen into the same trap. See I had a relationship with her, I do not hide that fact, and me having relations in a relationship isnt really a source of embarassement as I cared for her. I am sorry if you find this such a hard concept to master, to care for someone. I also had a relationship with her before I saw the truth of the matter, and made it public knowledge which helped stop her from using more people. Yes it was embarassing to reveal intimate details of my life on a flameboard, but I felt it was neccessary as many of her victims were too embarassed to speak of it, because assholes like yourself so quickly leap on them and mock their openness and honesty.<br>
<br>
My relationship with Razzine/Anyane is not a source of embarassment, but my being fooled by her was, and I told my story to stop someone else from getting sucked in and hurt, and I know I made a difference. So please, sit behind your computer, pretending to have the morale authority to judge others, if you believe you are so much better then the rest of us, please, feel free to cast your judgements on things you dont even know about, you only shows how vastly moronic you are.<br>
<br>
Stop pretending you know what went down, and stop trying to figure it out, for someone who claims to be too smart to put his personal relationship details on a public board, you are quite intrested in others...perhaps it is because you have no life and you need to hear about others to live through them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 773<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/02 11:11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Spitball Could Land Boy in Prison</span><hr size=1> what a crock of shit <p>retired poo slinger</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufilanfyretracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/auction WTB a clue! </span><br>  Posts: 567<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/22/02 9:01:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/wtcsmall.jpg Width=110 height=141></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Spitball Could Land Boy in Prison</span><hr size=1> HAHAHA Jailtime for an paper airplane or spitball what is F'ed justice system coming to first serial killers out and killing again after 5yrs when they deserved the chair and now they want to send a kid to kiddie prison for a standard school prank.
