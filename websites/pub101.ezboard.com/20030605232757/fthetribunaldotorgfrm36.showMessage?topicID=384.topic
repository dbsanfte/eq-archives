This is an example of unregulated government at it worst. You can read the story at the PBS website (this story is very disturbing, and I am not easily disturbed):<br>

<br>
The next two weeks Frontline continues their investigation into the Maine DHS. I really can't wait to see what they have found. I hope no more stories like this one, but I doubt they would continue the investigation if everything is OK.<br>
<br>
Any comments Loegan? I know you live there and maybe have first hand experience with Maine DHS. Not saying you personally, of course, I'm sure you're a great parent, but maybe someone you know.<br>
<br>
P.S. The thing that upsets me the most is the fact that the girl told DHS case workers on camera that she was being abused by her foster mother and they never looked into it. Why do my taxes help pay these people? So they can take little girls from loving homes and give them to foster parents that can tape them up and kill them over a behavioral problem? I hope Frontline is telling the whole story here, because I am so pissed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2239<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/03 8:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Failure to protect</span><hr size=1> Well, first off I have experience with DHS in two ways.<br>
<br>
One - My father worked for Maine DHS in Bangor for 3 or 4 years after he retired from the police force. He now works for California DHS in LA. I never talked to him much about it, but I know most of the people he worked with here were miserable SOBs that hated their job and were only in it for the money/benefits (working for the state is a big deal here in Maine).<br>
<br>
Two - My first ex-wife filed about 22 protection from abuse orders against me in a 6 year period. Here in Maine, all you have to do is write down a plausible story, stand before a judge and you'll get temporary custody until a hearing can be had (usually 2-3 weeks). She lost all 22 of the cases and the sad part is, even though the judges, lawyers, DA and DHS knew she was abusing the system, they couldn't stop her from filing them. Well, the DA did put out the word in my county that she was using the system and not to grant temporary custody, but she would wait until a judge wasn't availible in this county and then go to a neighbouring county to get the order, which is allowed by law. (BTW - My father wasn't working for DHS during this time, so I went through the system on my own steam.)<br>
<br>
Maine DHS is very inconsistant. In the town I live in, I have seen kids taken out of their homes due to having a scratch on their arm, but then I have seen kids with black eyes and fat lips who were not taken. I have seen a decent parent with a stable home who lost their temper one night and smashed a dish in the front of their kid have to attend years of couseling and parenting classes, while a parent with a chaotic home who got drunk and slapped their child in the face got off with a fine and two visits from DHS.<br>
<br>
To survive the system, you have to be able to navigate the red tape, know the bluffs and most of all, know how to CYA. Everytime I was accused by my ex of abusing my son and DHS would not investigate (they got tired of her BS after awhile), I had him examined by a doctor at the local hospital so I would have proof that no abuse was evident. Why? Because if an audit was done months or years later and they found out that the caseworker didn't investigate, they could re-open the case and claim abuse had happened even without proof. With a Dr.'s examination I had some cover in case that happened.<br>
<br>
I haven't had contact with them in about 7 years now, so I really can't say fro personal experience what they are like today. But if they haven't changed much (and it doesn't sound like they have) I would say it's a crap shoot as to what kind of treatment you'll get from them. It varies from case worker to case worker and even with a case worker I have seen it vary from case to case. I have seen both extremes and the only consistancy I have seen is them backing off from people who know the system and how to navigate it. If you are easily shaken though, they will tear you apart and make your life a living hell.<br>
<br>
As to this story, it shows the total ignorance of some who work for DHS. When young children are depressed or under stress, they don't show it like adults do. A depressed child is likely to have temper tantrums and break the rules in an attempt to vent their feelings and get attention. I don't know enough about it to explain why their brains work that way, but it is fact that bad behaviour for kids is often the same as adults losing their appetite or becoming lathrargic, it points towards depression and anxiety. Kids just show it differntly. This case worker should have been feeling bad for the child, realizing that she was torn between her and her mother, and had been offering support and comfort to the kid instead of getting angry and feeling like she was being wronged.<br>
<br>
Seems to me this case worker had some self esteem issues and felt like she was being rejected due to the kids behaviour after the mothers visits. I can see why a parent who is untrained in child behaviour would feel this way, but a trained case worker should have known better and handled it the right way.<br>
<br>
Fuckin sad.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Maine DHS is any better or worse than other states, but I have heard horror stories from all around the US. Either way, Maine DHS is in definate need of an overhaul.<br>
