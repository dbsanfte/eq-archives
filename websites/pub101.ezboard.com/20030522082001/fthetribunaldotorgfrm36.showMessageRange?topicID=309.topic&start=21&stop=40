Now here you are moaning with Dumai about &quot;liberals&quot; and supporting every warmongering movement of the Bush administration. Whether you accept it or not, you are a very right-wing person. You even start threads like this.<br>
<br>
South Korea and Japan are the countries most threatened by North Korea. But South Koreans are protesting in the streets against Bush. In South Korea's recent presidential elections, the people rejected the pro-Washington candidate.<br>
<br>
South Korea (and to an extent Japan) have been pursuing better relations with North Korea, in what's called the &quot;sunshine policy&quot;. Basically they have extended the hand of friendship in the hope of helping the North Korean people. This is contrary to what Bush and his Nixon-era hawks want. Therefore they have thrown a spanner in the works and brought the sunshine policy to a halt. The end result is seething anti-US anger from everyday South Koreans. Japan isn't too happy either.<br>
<br>
There was a US war in Korea before, which resulted in today's permanent stand-off between north and south. There was a US war for similar reasons in Vietnam, and that didn't exactly work out. The US itself supplied North Korea with plans and materials to build light-water reactors (LWRs). Why?<br>
<br>
Tension is something to defuse, not build up. War is something to avoid, not a solution. Yet aggressive, pre-emptive strikes are the only &quot;solution&quot; we are currently being given for any international tension. And the tension itself appears to be manufactured by the Bush administration.<br>
<br>
I find it hard to believe that the American people would support this kind of thing. So don't label me anti-US -- I am anti-Bush. <p>--<br>

First of all, lets get something straight:  I can't recall North Korea being involved in armed conflict since 1953.  If you can, feel free to illuminate me.  For all the accusations being levied against the Koreans, I dont see them trotting the globe and saber rattling, unlike the U.S. <br>

In the mean time, you keep looking at it from your side only.  My question to you is this: what you are accusing North Korea of... can the same be said about U.S. itself?<br>

I believe in that quote is America summarized in the nutshell, not North Korea. Yet, it is ok for America to wage war everywhere they please and against whom they please for whatever absurd reasons they concoct, but when North Korea begins to build an arsenal to defend themselves, you immediately come down on them.<br>

How many lands has exactly North Korea attempted or taken over and how many lands has U.S. attempted or taken over?<br>

<br>
Would you prefer that the whole of Korea be ruled by oppressive dictatorial communists who starve their own people to build weapons?<br>
<br>
&quot;The US itself supplied North Korea with plans and materials to build light-water reactors (LWRs). Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
That's an excellent question.  Ask Clinton... the answer is, we were attempting to appease them.  They said, &quot;If you don't want us to build nuclear weapons, help us out with our power supply and give us the ability to build nuclear power plants!&quot;  Democrat administration says, &quot;Sounds good!&quot;  So we hand over plans and materials that have now allowed them to build nuclear weapons.  Smart move... now Bush has to clean up their mess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tension is something to defuse, not build up. War is something to avoid, not a solution. Yet aggressive, pre-emptive strikes are the only &quot;solution&quot; we are currently being given for any international tension.&quot;<br>
<br>
When appeasement fails, when nations like Iraq prove themselves completely untrustworthy, when they fudge and lie and trick weapons inspectors for an entire decade while we patiently wait and say, &quot;Be nice now...&quot;, then it becomes clear that only the threat of war, as odious as war is, will be sufficient to cause dictators like Saddaam to back down from their megalomaniacal schemes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;And the tension itself appears to be manufactured by the Bush administration.&quot;<br>
<br>
What I find amazingly hard to believe is that you believe Bush is scheming to take over the world, while Saddaam and Kim Jong Il are merely trying to better their country and live happy little dictatorial lives in peace.  You can't comprehend the basic fact that its the other way around.  It's mindblowing.  The tension was manufactured by 10 years of Iraq building exactly the sort of weapons that were prohibited not just by the U.S., but by the entire U.N.  National sovereignty is great, on the other hand, nations have responsibilities.  When they threaten not only their own people through massive human rights violations of the sort in Iraq, but other peoples in other countries as well (by building WMDs), it is time to put a stop to them.<br>
<br>
P.S. - there is a difference between nuclear weapons in the hands of a representative democracy, and nuclear weapons in the hands of an autocratic Soviet-style regime.

Those are just some of the examples of globe trotting that the American government has perpetrated.  I know that you right wingers figure yourselves as angels who could possibly do no wrong, but the fact remains that the American government has relentlessly, repeatedly and recklessly violated the sovereignity of multiple nations in the past 50 years.<br>

It's funny how you claim that Iraq and North Korea are bent on world domination and yet it is the American government that is always trying to topple governments that it doesn't like, train commandos to murder civilians (hello, SoA!), sponsor various extremist factions and supply them with weapons only to be forced to deal with them a decade later, as an enemy.  American foreign policy is an endless exercise in short-sightedness, a careless attitude towards the rest of the global community.<br>

The NVA marched into south Vitenam, North Korea into south, India into Kashmir, Syria and Egypt into Isral, Iraq into Kuwait and Iran, Yugoslavia into Bosnia, I could go on for several paragraphs about real agression.<br>
<br>
On the other hand the US gave Cuba, the Phillipines, and many pacific island nations their soverienty. We gave one of the most important canals in the world, that we built with US tax dollars, to Panama. We were instrumental in keeping a democratic Germany free of occupation by France and England, not so sucessful against Russia though. We give more money to more nations than just about all others combined. When we invaded Grenada to protect Americans we didn't plant the US flag. When we helped the UN led collilition against Iraq we didn't removed the Baath party from power and we didn't occupy the country. I don't see how the US is an agressive nation.<br>
<br>
I know you want everyone to fear the US as some kind of Empirialist monster and I'm not really sure why. But your theories are just a bit hard to swallow. If you want to say that the US uses the UN in order to invade these countries I guess I could see your arguement, but it's a little too conspiratorial for me to buy into. And besides, there really isnt any occupation happening. It's been a while since Hawaii became the 50th state and I don't see anymore on the horizon. I'm really trying to understand how the US can be considered an agressor nation, all I see is a nation that wants world peace, even if the means to that end require force. Throughout all of history force has been needed to stop the real agressors. This is easy to understand for anyone who thinks the allied powers were justified in wanting to stop the agressiveness of the axis during the last world war. The Hitler appologists want us to sound like he was justified in needing more room and materials for his master race and call England and France the agressor. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the people who have posted on this thread think this. But there's always someone who roots for the underdog, I guess.<br>
<br>
Wanting peace is a noble goal, but at what cost are you willing to continue your pacifism? How long do we wait until we are justified with action? How close does the threat need to be? The world grows smaller by the day. A hundred years ago the actions of one arabian country against another meant very little, but today the stability of all world markets hinge on neighbors getting along.<br>
<br>
No one knows the future and most people are content to sit back and do nothing until their way of life becomes threatened. The status quo may not be the best way to do something but it's less scarey than change. The masses that you speak of that hate the US probably don't &quot;hate&quot; us at all, they hate the idea that things might change. What they don't realize is that they can't sit back and wish their problems away. The US learned that inaction comes at a terrible price last year. So while our leaders may not be perfect they are at least not afraid to act.<br>
<br>
I think some of you are mistaking the current US leadership's agressiveness for action. You are afraid of the change that may come. Everything else is just rhetoric to justify your fear. And that's a natural human reaction. For me, inaction against the real agressors is something worthy of being scared.<br>

A 5MW reactor with a carnot efficency of 25% (which is generous) will produce about 2MW of electrical power. Enough to light one small town or maybe a factory. For comparison most comerical power plants (designed to actualy produce electrical power) operate at 3000MW or above.<br>
<br>
There's only one reason to turn that reactor on. The US knows, the UN knows it, and the North Koreans know it. They need a thermal neutron field in order to turn spent uranium fuel rods into Plutonium. And unless they have any boiling water reactors in that country, which I highly doubt, there's only one use for Plutonium.<br>

No, you don't.  Mainly because as the self-proclaimed beacon of democracy and freedom in this world, that kind of action would be gravely condemned and U.S. could never afford such a blow in the arena of foreign policy.<br>
<br>
That is why U.S. fosters conflict.  To topple regimes and install pro-american governments, supplying warring countries with weapons to propgatae war and using any excuse possible to deploy military forces abroad.  I don't need to be reciting this again.  We are all aware of these reasons and incidents.  Vietnam, Kuwait, Iran-Contra, troops in Lebanon, troops in Panama, troops in Grenada, the list goes on and on.<br>

<br>
Hey, thanks for granting those countries their sovereignity.  Wait, aren't they entitled to that sovereignity to begin with?  Hey, thanks for generously giving them back what was already rightfully theirs!<br>
<br>
Panama Canal?  if my memory serves me correctly...  Teddy Roosevelt negotiated a 99 year lease on the Canal with Panama's government and one of the stipulations of that agreement in 1901(?) was that the canal would be handed over to Panama after the lease expired.  So you want them to thank you for actually upholding your end of the bargain like you were supposed to?  I'm sure their thank-you card is in the mail...  <br>
<br>
Really, you were instrumental in keeping Germany from being occupied by France and England??  If I recall correctly, West Berlin was split into 3 equal parts and devidied between the Americans and... French and British!<br>
<br>
Besides, Churchill and De Gaulle amde it clear before that they never had any intention of annexing Germany.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
Anyways, I do agree with a lot of your points.  You want to ensure peace by sticking guns at people's heads and forcing them to peace and I want peace by being, you know, peaceful and stuff.  I think being peaceful is an underrated approach.<br>
<br>
As for U.N., dont misconstrue my early criticism at U.N. in the way that U.S. strictly uses U.N. to pursue its goals.  Its more like whatever U.S. wishes, it will do regardless of U.N.'s approval or not and the only reason it even bother's with UN is to just have American whims rubber stamped so the backlash in the rest of the world is minimized.<br>
<br>
Can you seriously say that if U.N. disagreed with American policy towards Iraq that America would stop pressuring Iraq?

What complete and utter bullshit. There were few problems when Clinton was in office because he was intelligent enough to handle problems without a gun to someones head. He was knowledgable in foreign affairs (unlike Bush who before becoming president went to.. what... 2 countries?) and was well liked by the global community. Bush on the other hand is always talking war and agression, always looking for trouble and stirring up shit, like with his assclown &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech. He has squandered all the goodwill from 9/11 and continues to make once friedly faces into enemies.<br>
<br>
We had 8 years of progress under Clinton with very little conflict, so the only resort left to right wing bullshit artists is to blame everything that is happening under the Bush administration on Clinton. Funny how it took 8 fuckin years for all these &quot;Clinton&quot; mistakes to have effect.<br>
<br>
Face the facts - Clinton gave us 8 years of prosperity and near total peace. It only took Bush 8 months to start unraveling all that and by the time his term is up we'll see what kind of shape we're in.<br>

That's giving him far too much credit. He isn't smart enough to run the US, much less the world. The only thing this moron has going for him is being the luckiest SOB I have ever seen and somehow being able to tell American citizens stupid ass theories and having them eat it up like it was the word of a prophet.<br>
<br>
Two years of a shitty economy with record setting lows and everyone is still following this assclown like he knows what he's doing.<br>
<br>
One year after 9/11 and we are no more secure than we started, yet are dealing with longer lines (which would be fine if they actually accomplished anything) and less freedom with no tangible results in protecting us. And people are still buying into his bullshit.<br>

<br>
 So your saying 9-11 happened because of Bush?  I think that is when things started to unravel so to speak.  And Bush did not go in and play cowboy.  He worked with the U.N. and is still working with them.  He has yet to make a move without the U.N. approval.  Apparently it does matter to him what they say or he wouldn't bother to ask.  It also appears the other country's leaders agree so far with what we are doing (minus the ones hosting terrorists and powering up nuclear weapons they don't want us to know about).  <br>

The problems began towards the end of the Clinton administration.  Clinton inherited an economy on the rise, and left an economy falling (though the effect the president has on the economy is very small).  He fucked up with Korea.

I agree with you here.  We need to close our borders and profile terrorists.  We need to do away with the sick joke of airport security.  Bush isn't perfect, in fact, i disagree with his policies on the steel tarrifs and the farm bill, among others.  However, he is much better than the alternative.<br>
