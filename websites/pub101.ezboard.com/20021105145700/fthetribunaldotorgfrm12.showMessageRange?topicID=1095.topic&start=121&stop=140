I believe this deragatory comment has no place in someone's signature, no less the world of norrath.

Pulluwen (of the Transcended group):  &quot;I repeat AFTER we saw the chain heals in ooc and auc did we go in and get a hit on AOW ... there was no way in hell our group trained anyone, because the fight was well underway by the time we got there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Serpento (of The Companions):  &quot;I don't remember seeing any trans people.  I saw 1 legendary who died and several COP who died.&quot;  <br>

<br>
Like I said I'm sick and tired of listening to all the BS I hear from EV trying to explain why they killed AOW.  What's the new story? That it was that one legendary and COP who trained you guys and not trans?  The guides might have bought your stories, (cuz lets face it they are lazy)  but I don't.<br>

From what I was told by a guildmate who was there is that she was standing just past the see invis arch and saw 3 human male monks running up the stairs into the Arena.  And a few seconds later she got steamrolled by AoW.<br>
<br>
Now if AoW's aggro is infinite LoZ frenzy aggro, then she couldnt have possibly gotten AoW's aggro by standing just past the see invis arch unless someone intentionally went into the Arena &quot;bleachers&quot; and aggroed him and pulled him out of the Arena.<br>
<br>
That would explain a dead Trans member by the arena stairs who would later have the training accusation conveniently dumped on them, and explain how AoW was yoinked out of the Arena.<br>
<br>
BYW, I dont think SI even has 3 human male monks on its roster.  Make your own guesses as to who they were. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131483>Merton Rtehsuq</a><BR>

<br>
The trans monk also said some of his members went LD, this might of been during the hiccup, if this is so, we were mid fight, also, since, we were the ones engaging, he was trying get faction while we were killing it, along with SI members who decided to run down and bring a few friends. Mussha I believe a warrior tried to train us with some gimp giant and then camped out when we handled it, some fucking barb warrior, HA, nice try though.<br>
<br>
Now if he is saying he hit the AOW in the arena and then feigned, he might learn that the AOW can see through most feigns, especially if you are on the hate list, feigning on the AOW gives you like a 20 percent shot of suceeding, and even indifferent he can still hit you. So he hit the mob, ran off the feigned, when did he hit the mob? were you guys engaged? and if you were engaged how did the AOW come to us? The Trans monk is talking about hitting AOW while it was engaged on us. <br>
<br>
If we had pulled it, the guides would of slapped our guild silly as Mojak was being summoned because of countless SI petitions just because entered the zone. We couldnt do anything but wait and we did, patiently. <br>
<br>
No offense it takes you 25 minutes to recover three deaths? Thats worse then 25 minutes for a wipeout, thats fucking pathetic. Seriously. But if you could of taken the AOW down is different topic, personally, you would of been toast and we would of killed him on top of your corpses.<br>
<br>
I saw Serpento, and he came when we were engaged, like I said, a nice train of SI peeps came jogging down to get a few whacks in for faction so your HoT farming can keep going off without a hitch. BoBs for everyone!!!<br>
<br>
Gold, look at the situation.<br>
<br>
1)We were set below the left lower ramp<br>
2)We were cohing people, wizards were at the zone ins getting clerics/mages who came late<br>
3)Several Members were sitting down<br>
4)Several Members were afk<br>
5)We had Blaaze staring at us<br>
<br>
This is not the way to prepare for a pull, so there was no pull, no intentional taking of the spawn. If we wanted to fuck you over, we could of, we would of been in the arena and engaged first and called first to hit, gets rights bullshit, but we didnt, we sat on our hands giving you your shot. Your shot was going on, and the pull, your pull got fucked up somehow ( group in arena, most of us figured it was the trans people as we saw a trans monk near us when AOW came to us )and AOW came to us, he started killing the sitting people, the afk bards, Mojak who was in tells, Crush who was afk like normal looking at the stats on his sword, some clerics, some people we just cohed.<br>
<br>
Fighting the AOW there is not ideal place, its laggy, it has adds, its close to cleric mobs, yet in your fucked up little dwarven brain you want to believe this was our plan? Try again.<br>
<br>
The statue incident we handled without a guide, as we were also in the clear to the take the loot and laugh at you, but Mojak figured you guys needed something better then that POG armor and HOT armor you guys spend all day farming. <br>
<br>
Putting aside the fact you would of died to AOW, its very clear, EV was in its right to be there, a deal had been struck not to waste AOW, personally I believe you were trying to waste the clock to allow only one try and then depop, as you would rather waste the AOW then allow EV to get it. Thats greed, pure and simple, and its a cornerstone of your guild. If you dont believe me, take the Rynnia/Hopkins versus Talamay fight in the other thread for a real clue inside SI way of thinking. <br>
<br>
We were also not in the arena, we were out of sight, just in the zone, as other guilds have been in zones we have been in while we are fighting a large boss mob. Revolution decided to spam OOC while we dispensed the Emp last night, so its no big thing. We gave ya few shouts/oocs, but less then more. We were told to hold back after a few ooc/shouts and we did. God forbid we say you suck and it affect your gameplay to the point where you come to the flameboard and say it rattled you so. Oh wait you are doing that.<br>
<br>
The sweetest thing was the spam SI launched, cutting off friendships, cursing in tells, spamming Mojak with level one noobs. You can come here and question our maturity, but in game, you were the ones acting like spoiled children with deep seeded anger issues. <br>
<br>
Maybe you should team up with RNG like you did to learn TOVN to do AOW. You guys need help, seriously, 25 minutes to recover from 3 deaths if you say, is just so lame.<br>

<br>
There is no such thing as zero chance unless you are sitting outside the zone. Also considering where we set up, we gave you a very clean shot, we didnt feel like running from the ew/wl to arena when you died. We set up far enough away from the arena to stop any ev member from aggroing. You had a clean shot, someone else fucked you over, not us. Get that through your farming skulls. <p><center>

I am not trying to be wordy.  If you are looking for wordy, look at Rynnia's posts.<br>
<br>
The trans people being accused of training AOW are saying they never trained.  If you have aggro from AOW you would probably know it, or are dead.  End of story.<br>
<br>
Look, if you guys want to be the jerks of the server, you should be proud of it and not hide it.  That way you get more respect.  Say something like &quot;Yah, we threatened to pull AOW.  And we did it in 5 min just like we shouted to the zone.  It was not an empty threat.  And you know what, the guides bought our story.  If fact, we can do anything we want, cuz we own this server.  And the guides wont do jack and you know it.  So go along and kill your mobs.  If we want whatever you are fighting, we'll just take it.&quot;  Enough of the BS please.<br>

Your opinion is yours but it's clouded.  Just try to remember that of all of EV, there's only a couple assholes, and even they haven't done a fucking thing to you.  For the last few months it's been EV or Comps killing the AoW ON A ROTATION, and for some reason you expect this to be different because it was YOUR guild involved.<br>

Want more respect?  Take this situation like a man, find out what needs to be done to do it right next time you guys get lucky enough to try AoW.<br>

Looks like alot here.  Just skimmed it so forgive me if I missed some points.<br>
<br>
I tried to think about what happened before I went and posted here, rather than blow up or throw out some wild accusations that could not be supported.<br>
<br>
Number one.  Do I think EV pulled AOW on purpose?  I dunno.  I'm not in EV.  I was not near EV.  I have no idea what happened.<br>
<br>
Number two.  Do I think it was someone in EV that aggroed the spawn?  I do, at the very least it was someone who was with them or within their camp.  AOW popped through the wall to them or near them, as it never ran up into the arena.  There were several EV up in the arena.  Ablazarian / Ablazia or one of the derivative names was up with SI.  There was an EV monk in the center of the arena whose name started with K... I forget the name (not the pvp area, the arena where the giants roam).  And off and on an EV would poke up into the arena a bit.   Purposeful?  Who the hell knows.   It was said in this thread that the AOW popped on top of the EV camp.  Is this correct?  Or did he run at EV from ramp ?<br>
The spawn is a bit buggy.  You can aggro both the AOW and the idol by fighting giants in their general proximity.  Given the proximity of EV, if they had a giant aggro them there then the AOW could certainly have aggroed and dropped in on their heads.  We had it happen with the idol.  I've seen it happen with various other giants in the arena that are part of the Vindi / Statue / Idol / AOW spawn.  It's &quot;buggy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Benefit of the doubt.  For what it's worth.  From me, you have it.  I did receive several apologetic tells from members of EV I am on fairly good terms with, and I don't think they'd be shooting me such tells if it had been deliberate to their knowledge.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as a rotation on the Avatar of War, I was told by The Companions that the rotation on the AOW had ended around 1 month ago, and that he was treated as a FFA spawn.  Was I lied to by Companions leadership on this? I do fail to see how this has any likeness to the NTOV / Legendary situation either, who finally shot me a tell last night during the whole AOW situation, and were given their timeframe in which they'd have their shot.  No hassles.  No grief.  No other guilds waiting at the zone in for them to fail.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was shitty deal for my guild, who would have liked an attempt at the Avatar of War which we spent a few hours that evening talking about tactics and learning how to pull the idol.  He'll be up again, I am sure.<br>
<br>
I did confirm with a leader of The Companions this afternoon that there is no current rotation on the AOW.  If there is one, then I'll send tells to the necessary individual(s) and schedule a shot for an unhindered attempt.<br>
<br>
If the spawn is indeed FCFS then I ask that it be treated as such.   Understandably the spawn depops in 30 minutes, and another guild may not want the spawn to be wasted.  My suggestion, (and everyone pays their $XXX a month so you can do whatever that fuck ya like  : ) but my suggestion would be for the guild who is &quot;Waiting for the other guild to fail&quot; to wait at the intersection / ice stairs / bank area.  A well prepared AOW force could rip right up to the arena from that point in less than 2 minutes.  Given the buggy / odd aggro nature of the spawn, this may reduce or eliminate &quot;accidents.&quot;  It would be a shame to &quot;Waste&quot; the spawn.  I do agree with that.<br>
<br>
<br>
The GM(s) was / were a bit... odd.<br>
<br>
This was what I received from Blaaze after &quot;hello.&quot; And before I said another word to her other than &quot;hello.&quot;<br>
<br>
[Tue Jul 16 23:51:55 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'Ok I have already spoken with Mojak'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 23:53:04 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'and as I explained to him - In discussions with the GM and another Guide who was present - And in light of what we witnessed - It was decided that the AOW was to be the Kill of EV after SI failed in its pull of him'<br>
<br>
later in the conversation<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:06:03 2002] You told Blaaze, 'was there a GM here to witness what happened?  '<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:06:18 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'No GMs were present at the time of the pull '<br>
<br>
later<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:09:51 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'Was transcended with you?  Or just here?'<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:10:08 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'I am thinking they perhaps could have pulled it'<br>
<br>
I'm extremely curious why Blaaze was accusing or insinuating that Transcended trained the AOW onto EV.   Earlier whe she first contacted me she said EV ended up with AOW from SI's failed pull.  We never aggroed the spawn.<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:10:44 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'EV was trained ... Someone did it and if Mindee was FD and didnt move then perhaps it wasnt your people - Hard to tell'<br>
<br>
<br>
Blaaze has stated above that she was not present for the pull / engage or train / engage, whicever the case, and that no GMs were present.  Yet she states that &quot;EV was trained ... someone did it.&quot;  Given that she was not there to witness anything I am curious how she arrived at this.<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:12:05 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'We know you didnt pull and we know EV didnt pull/// Someone did and EV killed it after it was dumped on their lap'<br>
<br>
<br>
She said above that THEY WERE NOT THERE FOR THE PULL.  How do they &quot;know&quot; SI didn't pull and &quot;know&quot; EV didn't pull?<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:14:15 2002] You told Blaaze, 'We did not fail.  We did not even get a chance to pull.'<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:14:53 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'OK so if a transcended tried to pull, failed and trained SI - what would SI do?'<br>
<br>
Again, Transcended is blamed for the train in a hypothetical question.<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:15:29 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'Bottom line is - AOW was trained on EV'<br>
<br>
I must be missing something, but since no GMs were present, how does she know this?  How does she know that somehow EV didnt accidentally aggro AOW through wall?  How does she know that EV did not pull AOW on purpose? (I am not accusing of that, I wanna know how she KNOWS it)<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 17 00:16:08 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'Have Mojak and Alric sort out the details soon - There is no more I can do - I'm sorry'<br>
<br>
<br>
She logged immediately after saying this to me.  During this conversation she also refused to look at a report which I sent, saying that if she did that, she'd have to look at everyone's reports from both EV and SI and that would &quot;take all night and end up with alot of language warnings.&quot;  I had reported the text before EV had AOW in camp.  There were a few individuals talking about AOW this and FD that and I figured it may help, yet she refused to even look at them.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not pissed at EV.   It's a shitty situation.  Next time lets keep a bit more distance from eachother or work something out so this doesn't happen again.  We've had 2 problems in that same area now with strange aggro that has caused issues between the two guilds.  Don't want the spawn &quot;wasted&quot; but also don't want the same &quot;accident&quot; to happen a third time in the same general area.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm annoyed at the GM at this point.  That's about it  : P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 550<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/02 3:24:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV's Immaturity</span><hr size=1> I imagine would Goldy is trying to say that he expects good, clean fights between the mob and his people.

I mean, if a mob &quot;poofs&quot;--it was theirs to &quot;poof&quot;. It would be their fault and their fault alone. Rather than having the judge and jury out on them for playing the game.

Many of you have said Blaaze was watching and present when the AOW dropped on you.<br>
<br>
No, she was not.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the statue pull that day, he pathed on top of you on the simple fact that memebers of your guild still held aggression with him.<br>
<br>
The aggro on the statue can be lost by outdistancing it.   If the statue has aggro on someone in zone he WILL come when pulling the GOZ's.   This happened to me several times.  Someone in your camp, likely a monk or bard, had minor statue aggro, so that when he was pulled thru the main arena area he pathed to you instead of me (puller).   Doubt it was done on purpose on your end, but it certainly was not trained on you nor were any monks involved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utyreeceeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TyreeceEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/02 4:15:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV's Immaturity</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> [Wed Jul 17 00:15:29 2002] Blaaze tells you, 'Bottom line is - AOW was trained on EV'<br>

You know how she knows AoW was trained on EV? Because we have better things to do than lie about shit like this. We did not pull AoW. Therefore the only logical conclusion we can get from this bit of information is someone else Agroed AoW. <p><center><img SRC="http://home.houston.rr.com/eqpichost/Tyreece.jpg" height=394 width=280></center>

I'm not saying who trained who, that's just what I got in tells.<br>
<br>
Knowing these people, I would say it's fair to say they didn't pull the AoW.  EV has rarely ever been shy about their ganks, whether it was Klandicar, CT or anything else.  It's out of character for them to deny it.<br>
<br>
Were they intending to jump the spawn on a SI failure?  Absolutely.  A mob like AoW with such a short despawn time should have special consideration.<br>
<br>
The key difference between mobs like AoW and NToV is that in NToV, all you lose is time if a guild takes a run on Roy and dies.  With AoW, the spawn is gone.  No try and come back tomorrow, the mob and it's loot table is off the server.  Much like the RF spawn, the idea is get as much AoW loot onto the server as possible and not waste spawns.<br>
<br>
That being said, I think while everyone has agreed that Roy should be treated as a Gateway mob regarding NToV for AoW the Idol should NOT be treated as a gateway mob.  Killing Idol is no measurement of competence in an AoW fight.<br>
<br>
I think RNG's position is probably the most reasonable, IE, If you can kill Idol WITHOUT SLOWING IT, then you've earned a clean shot at AoW.  If you gotta slow Idol to beat it, you should in NO way be considering AoW.<br>
<br>
If guilds who want to attempt AoW did this, attempted Unslowed Idol first, then there would be no AoW spawned and there would be a much smaller chance of lost spawns.  Unslowed Idol killers would have a much higher success rate no doubt.  Additionally, even though there's no formal rotation on AoW, I think given that currently there are only 2 guilds that are AoW capable atm, it would not be a bad thing to at least try to give them a heads up as Failure on AoW is a very high possibility.<br>
<br>
In fact, I expect when we attempt AoW, we'll do Idol Unslowed, and try to get either a Comps or EV force into the zone with some agreed upon backout time should we get through Idol.  Wasting spawns helps nobody.<br>

<br>
What they need to do is make it like the Cursed cycle, though (and I don't mean glyphed and runed popping up at the same time, heh). If someone fails the AOW and it despawns, the Idol should respawn 8 hours later.<br>
<br>
Then neither of us would really have to care... if someone wanted a shot, and wasted it, we'd still be able to come back later and kill it.<br>
<br>
Anyone else feel like petitioning this to VI or is it just another decent idea that will get lost in the clutter? Heh.<br>
