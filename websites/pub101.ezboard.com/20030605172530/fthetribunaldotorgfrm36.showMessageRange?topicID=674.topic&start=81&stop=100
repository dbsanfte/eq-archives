Dress it up all you want, but ever since 9/11, Bush has used WTC as an ecuse to go after Iraq.<br>

But just like you gloss over our lack of evidence to this day, I am sure you will gloss over the deception used by Bush to further his agenda.<br>

I'm sure you could even get one of those Cochlear implants for the times you missed the government specifically and clearly stating that Saddam was NOT directly involved with 9/11.<br>
<br>
As for which war he was talking about, you do recall the &quot;war on terrorism&quot;?  Or is your mind's field of vision that limited?<br>
<br>
EDIT: I'll let the statements  stand as they are, I find no need to dress them up.  But I won't let your statement stand, for Bush didn't use 9/11 as an excuse for war on Iraq, he used the War on Terrorism as the reason for the War on Iraq.  He used WTC, to pull at the heart strings of America. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You're holding onto that very fine thread because it's the only thing that even remotely supports the pro-war view.<br>
<br>
The fact is, in the eyes of US justice, the US could ACCUSE Iraq of having WMDs, but then has to *prove that accusation is true* before &quot;sentencing&quot; can take place.<br>
<br>
THE BURDEN IS ON THE US TO PROVE IRAQ HAD WMDs, THE BURDEN IS NOT ON IRAQ TO PROVE THEY DON'T.<br>
<br>
That is how we do things in the US - now, if you are going to say that we don't have to hold other nations to the same standards we preach... say so.  Give me something to pick at - you keep deflecting the core question, which is &quot;was this war justified on an assumption?&quot; because the fact of the matter is, you and I both KNOW this was done 100% on the pretense of WMDs.<br>
<br>
Now that WMDs are looking less and less likely, you're going back and claiming that it was because of terrorist ties, humanitarian reasons, whatever - but that doesn't change that this was done as part of the War on Terrorism, and Saddam's supposed part was as a supplier of WMDs to terrorists.  The US never proved to the world &quot;court&quot; that Iraq had terrorist ties, nor did they have proof there were WMDs.  There was a lot of &quot;trust us, we're right...&quot; and &quot;we have proof, but we can't share it...&quot;<br>
<br>
Now that it's looking like this was all done on nothing more than ASSUMPTIONS - tell me *WHY* you think this war was justified (hey, I'll throw you a bone and even accept &quot;because I still think Saddam had WMDs&quot; as a valid reason - it is!  doesn't mean you're right, but it does serve as a justification), and tell me also IF it turns out that there were no terrorist ties or WMDs, *WHY* shouldn't Bush and Co. be held accountable for the deception?<br>
<br>
If they had been saying from the start &quot;we really suspect there are terrorist ties and WMDs, and here's all the circumstantial evidence to lead us to that conclusion&quot;, then I wouldn't be asking for an Impeachment hearing.  They would not have been lying to us.  However, you and I both know they also never would have gotten support for this if they had said that - that's the EXACT reason the rest of the world didn't support us.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
I don't mean to single out Wenin in this - I admire that he's defending his views, even if he continues to dodge the core question <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There were quite a few other hawkish views on this board previously, and your silence is deafening.  I'm not trying to &quot;call anyone out&quot; but I didn't want this to look like it was an attack on Wenin's views.  For what it's worth, I thought leading up to the war that of the pro-war people, his views were the most moderate, or at least the most open to an opposing viewpoint. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A> at: 5/14/03 8:53:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makino>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 10:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://roforums.dhs.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/Avatars/mage-female.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Because, again, if I can't produce the car as evidence, I am in big trouble.&quot;<br>

I believe the country you are talking about is China and not Japan.  I also believe that the government does not condone the killing of female newborns, as the world would hang any country whose government would condone such a thing. So to answer your request, sorry Japan doesn't do this.<br>

No Wenin, you used a flawed analogy.  Because in the car example, you can prove through a photograph that you have a car.  You can't prove where that car is going from a photograph.  If you want to prove that, you have people watch where that damn car ends up, just like, you guessed it, WMD.  Bush waved photos to everyone in the world of the proof of WMD facilities.  We also had proof that couldn't be revealed that WMD existed.  What was this proof?  I would assume they would know EXACTLY where those WMD were if they had such concrete proof as to INVADE ANOTHER COUNTRY and spend 100B DOLLARS on it.<br>
<br>
Apparently you really don't understand this issue at all and you keep bleating like the sheep Tuwy claims you are.<br>

So, are you denying that if the US had proof that Iraq had WMD, that they wouldn't be watching those sites like hawks so they would have proof in the end?  Are you saying that the US is so stupid as to not be doing this?   <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

The Resolution put the burden on Iraq to present evidence, that is why there was such a big stink about Iraq not complying with the Resolution.  The non-compliance was in regards to Iraq not providing proof that they destroyed the WMDs.  <br>
<br>
No wonder you are so confused.<br>
<br>
Iraq wasn't on trial, Iraq was on notice to deliver up proof they had destroyed items that the UN knew they had at one time.  Either they have them, or they destroyed them. If they had them, they were to deliver the agents.  If they destroyed them, they were to provide proof.<br>
<br>
They did neither.  Hence, why they were in violation of the resolution.<br>
<br>
The US didn't have to prove anything, in order to show Iraq to be in violation.  The only pressure on the US to prove anything, was to sway public opinion.  That is all.<br>
<br>
There isn't a country besides Syria that believes Iraq was in complete compliance with the last UN Resolution.  Look at Hans Blix, in all his reports to the UN, not a single one said that Iraq was in compliance.  They were all about the issues that Iraq would give, piece by piece.  He continually said that they needed to make more of an effort to come into compliance.<br>
<br>
Look it up for yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

- I'm not backing down from anything.  I have stated several times that this war was faught for MANY reasons.  I have NEVER said there was a single reason that the war was faught.  I may discuss each reason in detail in various threads, but at no time did that mean that the detail we were discussing was the ONLY reason for the war.<br>
<br>
READ CLOSELY<br>
When you are trying to build a group of people to support an action, it is not always possible to bring them all under one banner... one reason.  You need to attempt to answer as many of their desires as possible, in order to bring them under your cause.<br>
<br>
So while one person doesn't care, or doesn't beleive that there are WMD in Iraq, that person may care about the human rights violations.  While the next person doesn't give a crap about human rights, he is in it for the money, and wants a little buy out from the government.  Or the next person may care about WMD and human rights, and all the other stuff, but just not enough to go to war, so you offer them a prize... perhaps favorable trade relations...  This is to the core, why politics is so ugly, disgusting, and dirty.  Everyone is in it for themselves.  &quot;What can I get from it?&quot;  The Congress does it ALL THE TIME.  Ever heard of Government PORK?  No I'm not talking about spam.<br>

- They didn't have to prove that Iraq had terrorist ties!  Saddam provided that proof.  He openly supported terrorist organizations and families of terrorists.  He wrote out checks to these people.  What you are getting confused about, is that the US never provided solid evidence that Iraq had Al-Qaeda ties!  Not all terrorists belong to Al-Qaeda!!<br>
<br>
- As for WMD, the UN had already proven that Iraq had WMD when the inspectors left Iraq in ~1995.  The last UN resolution was about proving that Iraq still had them!  The last UN resolution was about Iraq proving that they no longer had the WMDs that were proven to have existed!<br>
<br>
As for the war being waged based on Assumptions, I already went over this.  Your &quot;core&quot; question was already answered.<br>
You have no idea how many decisions are made in the world, based mainly on assumptions.  When you have the security of a nation in your hands, you best error on the side of caution for YOUR citizens.

You've been asking question and question to me, and I've been answering them.<br>
<br>
So I'll ask you one.....<br>
<br>
What happened to all those chemical and biological weapons that the UN KNOWS Iraq had in 1995?<br>
<br>
If they were destroyed, why can't Iraq PROVE that they were destroyed?  (Note, these agents aren't simple to destroy, they leave behind residual traces.)<br>

I believe that to be the case, and frankly, so did most of our allies.<br>
<br>
The issue was more one of PROOF.  You don't go to war without it, not when you're playing Policeman (which we very clearly were).  If they didn't have it, keep dogging Iraq until they find it... end of story.  If the UN chose to play that game with Saddam forever... SO BE IT.  Saddam would have either eventually tired of the game and given up, or been caught.. those are the only two outcomes.  It's rediculous to assert that he would have someone continued to build his WMD arsenal with massive UN pressure on it, and if he threw out the inspectors again, that'd trigger the UN to take military action.<br>
<br>
As for the other bit, I agree Saddam violated the UN resolution.  That means it was the UN's jurisdiction to handle that violation.. not the USA's.  You didn't like my &quot;why should the US be enforcing Canada's laws?&quot; analogy, so I'll spare us all another one, and just simply say, how does a UN resolution give the US rights to act?<br>
<br>
It'd be different if there was a US resolution, and we acted on it (which, effectively, WAS the case).  This meant, however, that we were acting with impunity and without regard to the international body of law (UN)... and again, I'm fine with this, but now we pay the consequences  for acting on our own and scaring Europe into pulling back diplomatic ties and potentially even arming itself against us.   But call a spade a spade... don't hide behind &quot;we were only following the UN resolution!&quot; because that's utter bull - only the UN can enforce UN resolutions.<br>
<br>
You've fully deflected this from my original point, though, and I'm not letting go so easily - you turned this into a &quot;was the war justified/legal?&quot; discussion, and I am not prepared to say one way or another at this point.  I need to see how Iraq progresses over the next few years.<br>
<br>
My point was - Bush and Company made their play on this using the Al Qaeda and WMD ties.  They told Congress and the US People they had proof, and this was sufficient to get support.  It is now pretty clear they lied to (or at the VERY least grossly misled) Congress and the people; where is the accountability for that?<br>
<br>
Are you going to deny that Congress and the people were told that Saddam had undeniable Al Qaeda ties and WMDs, which we had proof of (that we of course couldn't reveal for security reasons)?  And if you agree that they were told that, and it's now painfully clear that NO such evidence existed (it was an assumption at best, and any left-winger will just call it a lie or a PR move), should he/they be held accountable?<br>
<br>
If not, why not?  Do the ends (removal of Saddam) justify the means (lying to congress)? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3290<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 2:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=92>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> From World News:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For the moment, the warhawks' invasion plans have been stalled by Saddam's acceptance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441. <br>

<br>
But apparently he is. <br>

But apparently he has. <br>
<br>
The warhawks have reviewed Saddam's list and they are outraged. They didn't believe it back in 1999 when the U.N. inspectors concluded in their final reports that Iraq had been substantively disarmed, and they don't believe it now. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, Saddam apparently claims that those weapons programs have not been resumed in the intervening years. To the warhawks, Saddam's list is a 12,000-page pack of lies. <br>

From an interview with Scott Ritter<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PITT: Does Iraq have weapons of mass destruction?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
RITTER: It's not black-and-white, as some in the Bush administration make it appear. There's no doubt Iraq hasn't fully complied with its disarmament obligations as set forth by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability has been verifiably eliminated. This includes all of the factories used to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and long-range ballistic missiles; the associated equipment of these factories; and the vast majority of the products coming out of these factories.<br>
<br>
Iraq was supposed to turn everything over to the United Nations, which would supervise its destruction and removal. Iraq instead chose to destroy - uni laterally, without UN. supervision - a great deal of this equipment. We were later able to verify this. But the problem is that this destruction took place with out documentation, which means the question of verification gets messy very quickly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
PITT: Why did Iraq destroy the weapons instead of turning them over?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
RITTER: In many cases the Iraqis were trying to conceal the weapons' existence. And the unilateral destruction could have been a ruse to maintain a cache of weapons of mass destruction by claiming they'd been destroyed.<br>
<br>
It's important to not give Iraq the benefit of the doubt. Iraq has lied to the international community. It has lied to inspectors. There are many people who believe Iraq still seeks to retain the capability to produce these weapons. <br>
<br>
That said, we have no evidence Iraq retains either the capability or material. In fact, a considerable amount of evidence suggests Iraq doesn't retain the necessary material.<br>
<br>
I believe the primary problem at this point is one of accounting. Iraq has destroyed 90-95% of its weapons of mass destruction. Okay. We have to remember that this missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat. It doesn't even constitute a weapons program. It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't amount to much, but which is still prohibited. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Likewise, just because we can't account for it doesn't mean Iraq retains it. There's no evidence Iraq retains this material. That's the quandary we're in. We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capability worthy of war.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
How do we deal with this uncertainty? There are those who say that because there are no weapons inspectors in Iraq today, because Iraq has shown a proclivity to acquire these weapons in the past and use these weapons against their neighbors and their own people, and because Iraq has lied to weapons inspectors in the past, we have to assume the worst. Under this rubric, a pre-emptive strike is justified.<br>
<br>
If this were argued in a court of law, the weight of evidence would go the other way. Iraq has, in fact, demonstrated over and over a willingness to cooperate with weapons inspectors. Mitigating circumstances surround the demise of inspections and the inconclusive or incomplete nature of the mission, by which I mean Iraq's failure to be certified as fully disarmed. Those seeking to implement these resolutions - for example, the United States - actually violated the terms of the resolutions by using their unique access to operate inside Iraq in a manner incompatible with Security Council resolutions, for example, by spying on Iraq.<br>

And that is where we greatly differ.  I was not comfortable with that, nor was I comfortable to have the UN and Saddam pick up their 6 year old dance.  I wasn't willing to wait, to see Iraq slip up.  They've had 12 years to perfect their hide and evade tactics.  Every inspector, Scott Ritter included, has stated how good Iraq was at hiding the things they didn't want us to see.  Giving them more time, to only get better at hiding it, was not something I found productive.<br>

Turns out it really was all a big joke after all. The war, that is. All a big fat nasty murderous oil-licking lie, a sneaky little power-mad game with you as the sucker and the world as the pawn and BushCo as the slithery war thug, the dungeon master, the prison daddy. You really have to laugh. Because it's just so wonderfully ridiculous. In a rather disgusting, soul-draining sort of way. <br>

See, there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. No WMDs at all. Isn't that great? What's more: There never were. Ha-ha-ha. Gotcha! <br>
<br>
No warehouses teeming with nuclear warheads, no underground bunkers packed with vats of boiling biotoxins, no drums of crazy-ass chemical agents that will melt your skin and turn us all into drooling flesh-eating zombies -- unless, of course, you count the sneering vat of conservative biotoxin that is, say, Fox News, in which case, hell yeah baby, we gotcher WMDs right here beeyatch. <br>
<br>
Go figure. Those lowly U.N. inspectors were right after all. Who knew? It was all a ruse. We've been sucker-punched and ideologically molested and patriotically sodomized and hey, what the hell, who cares anyway, we &quot;liberated&quot; an oppressed people most Americans secretly loathe and fear and don't understand in the slightest, even though that was never the point, or the justification, or the goal. Go team. <br>
<br>
But wait, is liberation of a brutalized and tormented people now the reason? The justification for our thuggery? That is so cool! So that means we're going to blow the living crap out of Sri Lanka and Sudan and Tibet and North Korea and about 47 others, right? Right? Maybe Saudi Arabia, too, second only to the Talilban itself in its abuse of women? Cool! As if. <br>

Ah, but screw the liberal whiny peacenik U.N. inspectors, right?

<br>
Surely they've found something, right? Surely we can now prove that Saddam was fully intending to fillet our babies and annihilate Florida and poke the eyes out of really cute kittens on national TV for sadistic pleasure, right? Gimme a hell yeah! <br>
<br>
Whoops. Bad news. As The Washington Post reports, the 75th Exploitation Task Force, the very serious-minded group heading up all U.S. inspections in Iraq, the group absolutely certain it would immediately find steaming neon-lit stockpiles of WMDs piled right next to Saddam's personal stash of gay porn and Britney Spears posters and opium pipes, is coming home with its tail between its legs. Found nothing. Nada. <br>

We have done this ghastly horrible inane hate-filled entirely unprovoked thing in the name of power and petroleum and military contracts and strategic empire building, our nation is numb and more bitterly divisive than ever and our leaders are not the slightest bit ashamed. <br>
<br>
But of course you're not the slightest bit shocked. You knew it all along. The WMD line was just a ploy that, tragically, much of the nation bought into like a sucker pyramid scheme after being pounded into submission with hammers of fear and Ashcroftian threats and bogus Orange Alerts and having their tweezers confiscated at the airport. <br>
<br>
And of course the capacity to be outraged and appalled has been entirely drained out of you, out of this nation, replaced by raging ennui and sad resentment and the new fall season on NBC. This is what they're counting on. Your short attention span. WMDs? That's so, like, last February. Hey look, the swimsuit model won &quot;Survivor&quot;! <br>
<br>
Because now it's all done. Like a bad trip to the dentist where your routine cleaning turned out to be a bloody excruciating root canal and 50 hours of high-pitched drilling and $100 billion in god-awful cosmetic surgery, now the bandages come off. Smile, sucker. We're at peace once again. Sort of. But not really. Don't you feel better now? No? Too bad. No one cares what you think. <br>
<br>
It's all over but the shouting. And the screaming. And the endless years of U.S. occupation in the Middle East, the quiet building of U.S. military bases in Iraq so we can keep those uppity bitches Syria and Egypt and Lebanon in line, forge ahead with the long-standing plan to strong-arm those damn Islamic nuts into brutal compliance with Bushco's bleak blueprint for World Inc. What, too bitter? Hardly. <br>
<br>
Should we care that Osama, the actual perp of 9/11, is still running around free? That terrorism hasn't been quelled in the slightest? That the Mideast is more of a U.S.-hating powder keg than ever, thanks to BushCo? That the economy is in the worst shape it's been in decades? <br>
<br>
Should we care that we just massacred tens of thousands of Iraqi (and Afghani) civilians and soldiers and suffered a little more than 100 U.S. casualties and have absolutely nothing to show for it except bogus force-fed pride and this weird, sickening sense that we just executed something irreparable and ungodly and karmically poisonous? <br>
<br>
Nah. Just laugh it off. Have a glass of wine, make love, go play Frisbee with the dog. Breathe deep and focus on what's truly important and try to assimilate this latest atrocity into your backstabbed worldview, add it to the list of this lifetime's spiritual humiliations, as you wait for the next barrage, the imminent announcement that we're about to do it all again. <br>
<br>
Steel yourself. Protect your soul. Because man, they reamed us good. Slammed this nation like a bad joke. Gotcha! Ha-ha-ha. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3291<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 4:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=96>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dates ?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
I will admit I have read your posts and was mistaken to reduce it to blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
Sporena, sorry you find my &quot;radical&quot; ideas frightening or &quot;socialistic&quot;.  You claim to know more about American culture and Constitutionality but you haven't placed forth anything to prove so and you just resort to flameboard namecalling as a basis of your arguments.  For example, you don't agree with my idea about schools because 'socialism is bad'.  You say 'Oh you know nothing about American culture' Well how about this;  Prove it.  <br>
<br>
You also seem to think I am frothing at the mouth with anger when I type this stuff, which is hardly the case.  Also, I guess you didn't really want to know why China does that stuff.  Nice little backtrack in your goofup of the facts.  Oh, Japan doesn't do that? Erm, I was just kidding!  Please. <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

<br>
Makino, your posts are a bit hard to read.  They are missing a certain flow or something.  /shrugs.  Almost as if we are having two different conversations, or that you are not picking up on things that I've said.... something... like I said... I can't put my finger on it.  Anyhow, my point is, perhaps this is why you come off as a frothing at the mouth at times?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
So, are you denying that if the US had proof that Iraq had WMD, that they wouldn't be watching those sites like hawks so they would have proof in the end? Are you saying that the US is so stupid as to not be doing this? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, there isn't any denying of anything here... that's where your question becomes disjointed.  It isn't that I believe the US government wouldn't watch such places like a hawk, it is that they can't.  Like I said before, you have this movie based belief, that the government can be all knowing and all seeing when it chooses to do so.  This just simply isn't the truth.  Yes, we have wonderful technology in satelites, and listening devices... but those are just glimpses, and aren't all empowering.  They have limitations.<br>
<br>
The government intel agencies rarely work off of real time intel.  Not to say, that when they can, they avoid doing so.  What I'm saying is that the intel services gathers so much information, it takes them time to process that information.  Those satelite photos that are portrayed, they are not beamed live, directly into a white house situation room as seen on the movies.  They are placed on a hard drive someplace, cataloged, and placed in line to be examined... nearly frame by frame... by hundreds, maybe even thousands of experts.  Then you have the disconnect between all the different intel agencies.<br>
<br>
In the end, hate to brake it to you, we don't have hundreds of James Bond type agents following trucks around in the deserts of Iraq.....<br>
<br>
So no... I am not saying that the US is so dumb that they don't do this.  I'm saying that they are not capable of doing what you want them to do......<br>
<br>
The US government is not ALL POWERFUL.  That is your paranoia speaking.  You are buying into the &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; type mythos.<br>
<br>
So why you say that I side stepped your question again... when I had answered it before... I have no idea.  Again, there is that disconnect... /shrugs<br>
<br>
<br>
So just to make things very clear..... your position is fatally flawed Makino.  You have based it on the existance of an ability that the US Government just does not have.<br>

Yes, it beyond our ability.  Care to come up with another fact of US ability? <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>
