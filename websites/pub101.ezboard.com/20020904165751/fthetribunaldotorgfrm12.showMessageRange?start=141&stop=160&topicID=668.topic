<br>
Although i heard they kicked the mage out of leg for it...<br>
<br>
I knew of a smaller guild camping lodizal.  They had like 15 people in IC, my roommate was there with them, going to help them kill for some lvl 59 ranger who was a real nice guy.  Well, lod popped, and AMAZINGLY, within seconds, Domination, Freizagn, Bigeasie, some warrior, ranger, and a druid, show up.  Let me add this up for you...warrior, 2 60 rog, Mage epic, 60 ranger, Druid nuke (not like they can heal well enough to keep a tank alive on lod).  Needless to say, this highly skilled group of legendary KS&quot;d the 20 55ish small guild (not sure how, but hey).  Legendary's defense...we engaged first...RIGHT!  With only a druid to heal, you did Lodizal..<br>
<br>
Truth is, the other guilds tank took all the damage, while the 2 rogues duelist etc etc.  The funny part is, i watched this all go down on my roomies PC (he was playin his like 50ish ranger at the time), and i got the pleasure of watching the really cool group of KS'ers port into GD and roll on the phatlewt.  <br>

I was there we had a full raid force in and killing in the zone before you had even gotten there or before you had appeared at the zone in.<br>
<br>
Rynnia said that he chose to come into the zone because he could not respect us on account of some of our members having camped in fear on the night previously. I was in tells with him for the entire time and he was well aware it was me.<br>
<br>
Javelyn had given me his second account on which I played Guddyear a few levels with some help from friends, but I've always hated the exp grind and Acnee had offered me his account as he no longer wished to play. I took it.<br>
<br>
This was before I took up Acnees account, he was neither level 60 nor had he completed his epic. He had the odd bit but certainly none of the major pieces.<br>
<br>
I have never been ashamed of my account or that I started playing a warrior that I did not level to 58 myself. I really don't see it as a big deal. I have never hidden that fact and this is the second time I have posted this. Until fairly recently I made a substantial contribution to my guild at the time and learned to play the class fairly well, it really isn't very complicated. Neither was being a cleric. It's not a rocket science game.<br>
<br>
I have attempted on several occaisions to get my account back and unfortunately none of those have worked. I could still call VI tech support but to be honest I am not paying for a one hour call to the US along with all the others I would need to pay. I have tried getting the account back by emailing VI tech support with my SoV CD key (the only one I have left) without joy. I have tried to talk to the person that now plays Boab, though I'm not sure who it is these days. The person that aqcuired, it sold it, I have no idea who has it now, only that they are in Vis Veres and any attempt I have made at contacting this person has failed. I would still like to have Boab back but I have no interest in actively persuing it any further as it's more energy than it's worth.<br>
<br>
All that said I have to admit, some of you are quite right, I realised that this board is pointless, after a while it just becomes second nature to call someone a festering twat. Especially if you are in a job you hate that requires being nice to pricks all day. So to those I have offended, my apologies I mean none of it and realise that I've been a dick.<br>
<br>
VS was a long time ago and I'm glad to see many people have grown beyond that, I was a dick for bringing it up and just wanted to taunt Hopkins more. You are quite right, it was a bad day for all of us. But certainly very interesting.<br>
<br>
I will not be surprised if Hopkins sees this as some kind of victory, frankly I don't really care.<br>
<br>
I'm going to try very hard to avoid this board, I realise it doesn't bring out the best in me. I'm not like this in day to day life so looking back - at this thread in particular - it saddens me that I could have gotten that bad without realising it.<br>
<br>
As for flaming Legendary for trying to jump our Eashan, well they didn't kill it so there is no big deal. Although to be honest, I'm sure there are better ways to deal with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhopkinsohenry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hopkins OHenry</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/5/02 10:52:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legendary....</span><hr size=1> lame, must be something with my work's webspace<br>

Thank you for proving my point.  I was under the impression you were from GB (scotland or something), and thus assumed english was you first language.  Perhaps i was mistaken.  In any case, my original point was that SI did not, in fact, LIE about our target to leapfrog anyone.  Read the whole sentence, marvel at how the words form a complete thought. Crossreference that statement with what Aauminki said and how i replied.  Now that you have been enlightened, i can only hope you will realize that, once again, I am correct and you are wrong.  Thanks.<br>
