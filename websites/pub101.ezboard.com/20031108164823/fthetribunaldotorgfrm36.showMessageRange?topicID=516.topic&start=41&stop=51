Both professors have spent their entire lives studying primarily Russia, though, and they had a lot of interesting things to say about that issue in particular, corresponding exactly with what Merton just said.<br>
<br>
It would really take a long time to explain, but it goes all the way back to Ivan the Terrible, and the Russian Czar's rule of Russia with a brutal iron fist.  Being under a certain type of government for centuries changes people and cultures, not to mention the myraid of other factors like the heavily conservative Orthodox Church, which by Medieval times was an organ of the Byzantine Empire, functioning to ensure the obedience of its citizens as well as the salvation of their souls.<br>
<br>
It also has to do with the enormous cynicism which Communist rule bred.  It's bad enough, after all, to be ruled by a Czar who clearly is out for himself, but when you've got the sort of astoundingly self-contradictory propoganda that the Communists put out, and it goes on for decades and decades, people change.  It breeds a certain political culture, one in which nobody trusts the government and nobody trust one another.  Remember the informers, the constant suspicions, the mock trials?  The very basis of democracy is that it is government by the people - but if the people don't trust the government that they elect, how can it function?  After all, even politicians in places like the U.S. are hardly paragons of civic virtue.  Attitude's like Elche's are fairly common here; imagine how common they must be in Russia?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I've probably managed to say a lot without much to back it up, but I'll let Merton evaluate and criticize if I'm too far off base. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thiazharbinger>Thiaz Harbinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=516.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/avatarthiaz83.jpg height=191 width=102></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Putin Demands Swift End to War With Iraq</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.strategypage.com/fyeo/howtomakewar/default.asp?target=HTMURPH.HTM">www.strategypage.com/fyeo...TMURPH.HTM</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/thiaz.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It seems that chickens spend most of their time pecking at the ground for stray bits of food. But these American chickens had never been in the desert before and their encounter with the Kuwaiti sand led to them gobbling up enough of the sand to kill them. Birds are not very bright.

Let's just say that Russians for the most part want a one man rule, yet they want the privileges that come with being in a western democracy: freedom of spech, freedom of religion, the right to own property, etc.  They have a hard time coming to grips with the fact that the two things basically cannot exist together.  They WANT to be westernized.  The vast majority love all things American and they embrace the western culture.  But they have a hard time letting go of the Soviet regime as well because the Soviet regime for the first time in Russian history provided them with universal  free healthcare, universal free education, guaranteed jobs, equality between men and women and raised the standard of living in Russia to its highest point ever in Russian history.  And as we all know, those things came at a heavy price - a price that a lot of Russians were willing to pay back in 1920's-1930's, and a price that a lot of Russians are willing to pay yet again in the 21st century to be able to have that security again.<br>

Haha, what separates American and Russian political culture is that Russians are not activists for the most part - they will take shit from the government for a long time before acting whereas Americans will get incensed over a Stamp Tax and start a revolution, or picket a restaraunt if it doesn't conform to health safety codes or other things that are not major most of the time.  If you look at Russian history, there has been basically only one civil war (1918-1921) since Ivan the Terrbile.  There have been major peasant revolts every 50-70 years or so during Tsarism, but they were primarily local and were usually quickly squashed.  Russians will put up with a lot of crap from their government before they get incensed enough to pick up a weapon.  It is interesting to note that often times the breaking point has been when sales of alcohol were outlawed or the tax on alcohol has been raised greatly.  Thats just fucking pisses them off to no end.  They can be morally fine with wars and exterminations and mass murders but god forbid someone cuts off their booze.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This may sound like an exagerration, but its really not.

After World War II ended and USSR was forced out of necessity to cooperate with U.S. whom the communists relentlessly painted as their #1 enemy, there was a lot of hope in the post war period that due to this collaboration between the West and Russia, that things would liberalize a bit.  Stalin didn't allow that to happen and put the USSR back into &quot;Us vs. them&quot; boat.  When Khruschev came to power, there was hope for reform and there was some as Khruschev called attention to Stalin's atrocities and exposed them to the Soviet public and also relaxed the censorship laws.  Soon, the Russians became disillusioned with him and ever since Khruschev there would be this pervading attitude to the government:  <br>

There was zero faith in the government.  The government held zero credibility in the eyes of the Russian people and their political culture reflects that.
