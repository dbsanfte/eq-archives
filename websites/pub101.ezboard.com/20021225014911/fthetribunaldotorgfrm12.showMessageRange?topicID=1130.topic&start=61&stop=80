If the 30 or so can kill the mob then they deserve the loot.  If not well...<br>

  This is actually a pretty simple situation, if you look at it from past experience.<br>
<br>
  Everyone is hanging out in oasis, Lockjaw spawns, everyone up and down the beach runs and jumps in ( anyone who wasn't PL'd to 50 knows the scenario). One group gets the kill, now, the question is, for the last 3 years, what has been done with the loot ? Does everyone stop and roll on it, do they invoke need before greed ? Do they use DKP's ( or LJKP's in this case) .  Hell no, the kill group gets the loot and does what ever they want to with it.<br>
<br>
 So pretty much Mandoman is 100% correct in what he did. His group got the kill, and it was his groups loot. If he had destroyed it, he would have been within his rights.<br>
<br>
 So basically the entire argument revolves around who decides who gets the loot. I am sure someone like Lothoris or Arec would have personally spoken with everyone in the zone to ensure that the entire EQ community agreed on who got the belt.<br>
<br>
 I have to agree with the sentiment though that if a Legendary rogue had gotten the belt, we wouldn't have this thread, because Mandoman wouldn't have ran to the flame board crying over it.<br>

Comparing a GM encounter to a LockJaw spawn!!!  Hahaha!<br>
<br>
No really if it was a multi guild event then it should have been treated as such, you roll all the loot, simple as that.  LockJaw hahaha really.  <br>
<br>
If Mando was going to decide the loot then maybe he should have told all present.  &quot;Sorry, but when we kill this mob then I will decide who gets what loot&quot; or &quot;whoever gets the kill will decide the loot, btw I have 2 rogues and wizards in my group&quot;.  That way people those who do not agree can simply leave, the idiots who want to stay can stay.  <br>
<br>
But doing this way without telling anybody...  <br>
Is that the Companions way?  <br>
<br>
I ask Companions Leadership is that what your guild stands for?  Is that the treatement another guild can expect if there is a multi guild event with Companion members?<br>
<br>
I understand that rogues from other guilds have filled a petition, hrmmm... what a waste of time.  But we shall see.<br>

I assume that no GM stepped in and removed the belt from Slyie, so obviously the GM's agree with my position more than they do with yours. Somebody has to decide who gets the loot, and being the group that got the kill is as good of a qualifier as any. <br>
<br>
 As was pointed out, if a Legendary rogue had gotten the belt ( which would have happened if the Legendary group had gotten the kill ). This thread wouldn't exist , because everyone else would have just shrugged it off as no big deal.<br>
<br>
 Mandomans actions no more reflect poorly on the Comps than Arec's and Lothoris's posting here should reflect poorly on Legendary. It isn't a situation of Comps vs Legendary vs Trans, it is just a couple of unhappy players bitching. So it is pointless to try to drag the guilds into the argument.<br>

As in, it wasn't a GM playing a mob, just a relatively new encounter that they decided to turn into a bloodfest by announcing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the strict rules are that Exp group gets to choose where loot goes.  Mando extended that to those that were actually acting like they were on a raid, and not spamming the raid channel.   (Attempt to communicate over raid channel was not very functional, as stated above).<br>
<br>
I mean really... how is this even a discussion? It went to a non-guildie, so it's not like he &quot;hoarded&quot; the loot.  I've been to events like this with 5 different guilds in the zone, communication is almost impossible.  Probably would have taken 30 minutes just to get newb_03 to stop complaining about the belt being rogue-only, and it should really be a warrior item. :/<br>
<br>
Good Work Mando, Congrats Slyie.<br>

If it wasnt a trans member, i bet this wouldnt even be here. <br>

I think mando's decision may have not been the best choice (ie just giving it to one rog and not giving others a chance) but still, he and his friends got that organized and it prolly woulda been a steaming mess if he hadnt. And his group got the experience. So i agree with his decision.<br>

(at least thats the label we have on our heads now, ohh well we'll get over it and move on i guess) And *IF* our guild group would have gotten the experience on killing the mob, i would put alot of money on the line to say that they would not have ninja'd or called for someone in grp to loot, thats just not how we are. But then again (because of the label on our head that we are aparently lootwhores) i guess we would have to you guys, but we will never know now will we? And yes, you guys had ample opportunity and time to rezz everyone and let the rogues there roll on the loot (at least had time to drag the rogues out and let them roll while nakked). I was not &quot;bitching&quot; about the loot, i was simply mad at the call that was made, yes i believe it was a very bad call saying that you organized the &quot;force&quot; (30-35 out of the 70-75 people that were there) and had the power to make the decision, but i guess thats done and overwith now.

(I) Is there anything so bold
   as an honest person?
think on this....
when your body is pierced
and the draining blood
makes your fingers numb
is it easier to be honest
and face that,
or hide away for a few more minutes...? <>

(II) she stroked the white mane
traced the sacred horn
with her fingertips...
she lightly licked the red smears
from her fingers...
it burned like it was supposed to.
she smiled sadly at the glazed eyes...
a touch less beauty in the world <>

(III) He knew it was time
and hence, he knelt...
pain in arms
and pain in head
he bent his mind in circles
as the blood dript
in circles...
and set his life
upon his lips... <>

(IV) it didn't take a lot
he thought
to fill it up...
and dipping finger
baptised one and all
making sure to save
the rest
till he turned them all
away... <>

(V) She slipped further...
into
the lake...
and the wetness
was mostly from her eyes.
what she thought was best
was being afraid
and in that
she turned away
her every wish... <>

It was just a new encounter that GM's announced to the server.  Naturally lots of random people showed up.  There was a few people from every high-end guild, but the only guild that showed up in force were The Companions.  There were 3 SI in zone, maybe 5-6 RNG and Legendary, a few Transcended, and 20+ Comps.  The main tank was a Comp, most of the mana burners were Comps, most of the clerics were Comps, that raid would've failed without those Comps.  Hell the crappy force that was there was wiping out to the black sperm thingies until Comps showed up.  Just be happy you got to participate in a fun new event and stop bitching over the loot.  It was awarded as fairly as it could've been.  If Mando would've done all that rezzing/rolling bullshit it probably would've gotten ninja looted by some n00b that couldn't even use it anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udabernwar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dabernwar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/29/02 2:09:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New PoMS</span><hr size=1> lemme use my flame gererator on this on bowynn...<br>

<br>
<br>
you are absoultely correct..they were not half the force.. <br>
<br>
30 organized Companions..  would have made up roughly 75% of the raiding force... IF you take effectiveness and damage produced into account..  Especially considering the other 45 were random n00bies, Legendary, and Phalanx people..<br>
