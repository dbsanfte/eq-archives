Okay so Kowie, when you say this guy is shit and you were a bad judge of character and he got booted from the guild straight away for ninja-looting, is that the same as when you said during the last DV fuckup:<br>
<br>
&quot;you all like to pretend that dark virtue is a piece of shit because we defend her, but we're not. she is one of us, thorns, warts, herpies and all, ... when it comes down to it its a moral thing. someone fucks up, and either loots something on purpose or by accident.... do you remove them and never speak to them again? i am very fond of second chances, myself.&quot;?<br>
<br>
Because this guy did try to make amends and contacted a GM to have the item removed from his inventory, just like Poladara. Or is that different coz this was a guy, not a sweety pie who Podaman had a thing for?<br>
<br>
So for this guy you say:<br>
<br>
&quot;may he burn at the stake for doing something so stupid while being tagged dv, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Quite the turn around Kowie, that's almost impressive it's such a total about face. I wonder if this guy wasn't the sexy cyber-type like Poladara so he didn't deserve the same second chance that Pola did or if maybe DV are finally starting to learn the lessons via the flameboard that they should have known all along. But then with a leader like<br>
Podaman it's hard to get things right ...<br>
<br>
Isn't that right, Podaman?  Hey when you booted this guy for<br>
ninja-looting off NGoH's kill, did you have any flashbacks to other things in your own past?  Because, ya see, some of your own guildmembers were telling me a couple of weeks ago that you were last seen in Acrylia Caverns locking some other guild's worm corpse when they'd gotten then kill while your own guild was still getting organised. What I heard was that you hung around spam clicking the corpse till it went public and then you stayed on the corpse demanding that the guild who killed it make an agreement with you or you were gonna ninja the items. You even linked them into guildchat so your<br>
members could decide what you should ninja right? Then when the other guild told you to fuck off you you annouced to the whole zone which item you were gonna ninja! But looting has a time on it so you musta gotten booted from the corpse and then you had your whole guild spam clicking the corpse and trying to lock it. Haha you sound like a class act! But I heard you didn't get any of the stuff at all in the end so I guess threatening to ninja stuff and locking another guilds kill for as long as you can and telling the rest of your guild to try to do the same isn't as bad as actually ninjaing an item and isn't quite enough to make get you to boot yourself from your own guild hey?  Shame coz my DV friends are cool guys and you give them a shit name with all this sort of crap.<br>
<br>
(And no I'm not gonna dob them in coz they say theres still some stuff they wanna get from DV.)<br>
<br>
With a guildleader like Podaman who needs other ninjas?<br>

<br>
if it wasnt for a incredibly nice person, podaman, inviting me to groups when i was naked... hmm... i wouldnt be in DV now at the least. and id probably be wearing ravenscale. probably would have quit the game, because the first few weeks over here.. when i was farming finesteel for money, were pretty sad haha.<br>
<br>
why did i move? dont know if you care, but an aussie friend said he was moving... and well, ive always been impulsive. i put in an app to come over that same day, and gave all my gear away. at the moment i am about on equal par equipment wise, though im a lot poorer.. you collect a lot of dropable cash items over 3 years, and i have none on trib. im still sad i couldnt bring my manastone<br>
<br>
but i wouldnt reccomend transfering for anyone unless they have friends on the new server, or make friends easy :P <p>-----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

All we have here is 2 more fuck heads like the one that started this theard posting about something they have nfc about in order to stir up shit.<br>

As for what happened let someone from AN post how they jumped past us while we were in the prep room( us with a raid force) with 7 or 9 ppl straight into the water and tash a perma rooted mob in order to claim they engaged first so they could wait for the rest of the guild that was still in GF.<br>

First of all Synap, all you jackass Phalanx.  Blow me.  You'r place nice policies?  yeah, i guess groups camping oozes don't qualify as being worth not being KSed and walked over huh?  Ring of slime?  Synap is such a peice of shit, that while we are camping oozes, he asks us if we MIND if he takes his guild in to do Ring of Slime, and promised not to mess with our spawns.  Whats he do?  Well lets just say we left the camp because he refused to allow us any pulls minus the 2 spawns that were behind him.  All this of course, is us having the camp first and his &quot;raid&quot; taking priority over a group.  for that a big FUCK YOU comes your way.<br>
<br>
Second, Everyone involved in this DS BS shit story needs to shut the fuck up.  Show us proof that there was mem bluring going on.  Fact of the matter is DS is a motherfucker with aggro.  I was on a raid with him and nuked him for the first time at 50% life and gained aggro?  why?  because the motherfucker goes nuts on almost everyone on his aggro list.  Its called RAMPAGE. Phalanx just was not prepared for this.  Nobody mem blured DS on your Attempt to kill a SPAWNED mob that you did NOT spawn. Even though there's no proof, i wouldn't put it past your idiotic 2 year old mentality to try something like mem bluring.  For that a big FUCK YOU comes your way.<br>
<br>
It comes down to this<br>
1) Sure seems like DV spawned DS<br>
2) DV let you die to...err have the first crack at DS<br>
3) Respecting that you were dying, they let you before they engaged<br>
4) Phalanx eats shit<br>
5) DV dies <br>
6) NGoH kills a 20% DS...congrats on your gimp kill<br>
7) a fucktard DV ninja loots and gets booted.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Phalanx eats shit<br>
9) DV boots the fucktard <br>
10) Some dumb fuck that wasn't even involved starts a flame.<br>
<br>
WTF?  <br>
<br>
WHo's right and who's wrong??   NOBODY GIVES A FLYING FUCK!!  <br>
He's gunna pop again and Phalanx can die to him numerous times with their zurg tatics.  <br>
<br>
Hell, fuck that, here's a solution.  The whole server will no longer attempt DS so that Synap and his band of merry fucking retards can die to DS many times over again.<br>

No they are quite different actually. You are completely wrong. The agro is extremely easy to control when there isn't outside interference from fucktards like yourself. In case you didn't realize, things like flurry don't effect how Doomshade chooses targets off his hate list. Of course, I didn't expect you to know that with your sub par knowledge of the game. Not to mention, our MT was using an SoD in mainhand and primal battlehammer in offhand. Do you have any idea what that does for agro? No of course not, yet again you prove your newbishness. Crawl back into your tiny insignificant hole and don't come out, i'd prefer not to listen to any of your inaccurate and false pointless ramblings. <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157701&gt;Sensei Morannon McJohnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

Did I ever say that flurry and Rampage where the same thing?  God damn right I didn't.  I said what the fuckever as in I don't give a flying fuck rats ass to what he does.  I know for a fact that aggro is hard to control on him and you make the point yourself.  Your MT has an SoD and Primal and can't hold aggro?  Thanks for making my point.  And don't bring that bullshit about him being mem blured.  Until someone posts a link showing that DV mem blured DS while you were engaged, its bullshit.<br>
<br>
Don't worry, Moronnon, The rest of the server will let Phalanx wipe to DS a few more times so they can get the timing down.  Hey i have an idea for you...Since DV did twice the damage you fucktards did with half as many people, when you finally do manage to kill him, we'll still let you keep the spawn doing him over and over again subtracting one person from each raid so you can even have bragging rights that you did something years after DV did with less people.<br>
<br>
Go back to your mom's tit you whining bitch.  People are sick of hearing this shit.    Any more questions?  Refer to point 8 in my previous post.<br>

Yeah I know that motherfucker.   I haven't known many people in game that would give up more shit or go out of there way to help others than him.  So for the shit that went down I wasn't there so I cant post fuckin logs and shit.  I can however vouch for the kinda person he is.  From what I read so far and if thats how it went down all I got to say is Grats on that wand.  Cause if thats how you other motherfuckers play y'all deserve to do without.  <br>
<br>
I sat and talked with Kasp and he told me how the shit went down, and how he felt when others jumped in when they hadn't even been given the chance to wipe before others jumped in.  I understand that on the very same nite there was a plan of action to make this right with the guild involved.  If thats so why did someone NOT even involved bring this shit here?  Why because you got your ass handed to you when you zoned in and you wanted retribution for that??  Either that or was it a slow day at work, and you need your  &quot;bullshit&quot; fix from the flameboard to make it to 5 o'clock?<br>

I hope you found what you were looking for.  Kaspian is expecting his Fuck You shout out whenever you get a chance. <br>

The POMS has no credibility when shit like this goes down.  It just proves that you can get anyone on that list by just posting enough bullshit about someone even though you werent involved. Hell you dont even have to know what went on just get on there and post about what color your moms tampons turn after a day or two in under your pillow.  Get enough post and you will be proper fucked in no time.   Fuck half the posters weren't even involved in the shit and they come to trash talk.  <br>
<br>
We learned that grozzer knows how to use babblefish or whatever the shit that is.  Go translate this when you get a chance:Você suga dicks enormes do asno, e seu mom tem um bichano hairy.  Morananonanonan  or whatever you still sound like a dumb ass.  You played like a dumb ass a long time ago when I was on a Naggy raid with you and others and it looks like you haven't gotten much better.  <br>
