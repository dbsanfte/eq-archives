That so @*#*ing irks me, when parents get this uppity attitude, that they are right, JUST BECAUSE they've bred. I've read a LOT, I've WATCHED other parents, AND, this may come as a big surprise, HAD A CHILDHOOD MYSELF. So yea, I have a pretty good idea what will and won't work. While I agree that all children are different, I don't agree that adults sans child are idiots, and should keep their opinions to themselves. I'm not saying I'm right, but I like to share my thoughts, and cultivate them further, so I can do right by the human life I bring into the world someday.<br>

Sorry Intrigued but childhood is extremely universal. As is psychology. Personalities vary from one to the next but each has primal instincts. Any intelligent parent will figure out which their child possesses and raise them accordingly. Im am 100% sure physical punishment is not the only primal instinct of any single child. In other words, there are so many flavors of freedom. Why choose the most barbaric match of negation? But if you dont believe me, feel free to call up my mother. She can tell you the same thing. Maybe even how the church she went to said what you and others say. She proved them wrong, though.<br>

I knew a few people back in the day who were into Dungeons and Dragons, and was worried that EQ was going to be a world wide version of that kind of weirdness.  So, I got the game also, and we played together so i could keep an eye on things, I found there was almost no roleplaying, and the game was goal oriented, so was ok with it.  If I had found it to consist of roleplaying, or if he was the kind of person to get into such things the game would have been gone.<br>
<br>
There were some issues early on with him not having his priorities in order, and he lost his computer priveledges for several months, but now I actually think it has been a good thing, he has become very organized and efficient in time management.<br>
<br>
As for the sub topic of child punishment, in my opinion, physical punishment is an effective tool, especially at young ages.  Kids are different, and parents are different, maybe spanking isn't right for everyone, but for me it worked.  The one thing I do know, kids are kids and need to be abundantly aware of who the parent is, if you think your child is your friend you are doing them a disservice, and in my opinion engaging in a form of child abuse as bad as any other.<br>
<br>
Delight, I'm not really sure how to say this without being rude, but, you are obviously not the most stable person around, it's outrageous to me that you would attempt to express an opinion on how people should raise thier children when you haven't even gotten a grip on your own life yet.  It's also obvious that despite the time you have spent thinking about the situation, you haven't quite thought things all the way thru yet.  Saying that teachers shouldn't censor the activities of the children entrusted to them and suggesting that a parent expressing thier disappointment is effective punishment for a 3 year old is, well, not very well thought out.<br>
<br>
It's a strange thing, but at a certain age we think we know all there is to know, we are cocky and arrogant, and freely express our thoughts on topics we really don't have any thoughts on.  We are infinately wiser than our parents, and our teachers, and don't even get me started on that idiot who is my boss.  My parents are idiots who make me go to bed too early, and boy what I would do if I had all the money they do.<br>
<br>
15 years later and you know that you're now 100 times wiser than you were before, and there is still so much you don't know, you're not so cocky or arrogant because of this knowledge.  You are more reserved about expressing your thoughts, and especially about topics you are not well versed in.  You realize how right your parents were all those times you were hating them for being in your business, you have fond memories of your teachers for all they did for you, and wish you had paid more attention, your boss is your friend, and you're debating if the little bit of extra money he gets is worth all the hassles he puts up with.  You go to bed at the same time your parents made you when you were a kid because you're too damn tired to stay up any later, you make more money than your parents ever did, and you're wearing 2 year old shoes so your kids, who think you're an idiot, can have new ones.<br>

 Great thats all we need is more hatefull idiots in the world.<br>
 I have a son. Would i let him play this game no way not at his age when hes 14 15 maybe but thats along way away. Even then i think it would be better for him to be playing out side doing something with other human beings then being on a comp for hours on in. However so of the nicest people I have met have been on the comp. You get to meet people from all over. To me thats kinda cool. When my sons is with me I chose not to play the game. I would rather spend that time talking with him rideing bikes and other stuff. There are worse things for kids to be doing then playin this game however as with anything to much of it is just that too much.<br>
 be safe and take care of your kids<br>

Are you a parent? Have you ever raised a child?<br>
I taught both my sons to read by the time they were 4 years old.<br>
They were NEVER made to display their reading abilities as an example of what &quot;good&quot; parents we are.<br>
Sorry to tell you but where they WERE taken was to the library.<br>
If more children were taught to read and love books and reading at an earlier age, the literacy rate in this country would be far superior to what it is today.<br>
As it stands both have done very well academically now that they're in their teens.<br>

Wanna bet?  My grandfather taught me how to read in Russian by the time I was 4 years old.  By the time I was 10, I read most of my mother's 2000+ book private library and was regularly at the top of my class.<br>
<br>
Then my family immigrated to USA in 1991 when I was almost 11 and I learned English in a matter of months.  I could speak it very fluently in 18 months.  After 18 months of being in U.S., I was at the top of my class again and was acing standardized testing.  In High School they would not allow me to take any college prep courses (except math and science).  Aside from math and science, everything had to be either Honors courses or AP(advanced Placement).  Took the ACT during junior year, scored a 34 out of 36 (99th percentile in the nation) on the reading section and a 28 (93rd percentile in the nation) overall.<br>
<br>
Silently, I thank my parents and my grandfather every day for teaching me how to read and encouraging my interest in books because otherwise I would have just turn into one of the countless slack-jawed rubes that I have eclipsed throughout my academic career.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, I am 21 years old and I actually work as a writer of a sort.  I translate Russian materials and texts into English language.  Next month, I will complete the translation of the first edition of a Russian book that has sold 2 million copies in Russia in the past 2 years.  It should be available for the American consumption sometime in March.  It will be the first time that it has ever been translated into English and the honor of the first translation has been entrusted to me.  I hardly doubt that any of it could have been possible had my parents and grandfather considered the ability to read at age of 4 to be some pony trick, suitable to impressing others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/02 4:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &gt; By the time I was 10, I read most of my mother's 2000+ book private library and was regularly at the top of my class.<br>

Let's do some math.<br>
<br>
1 book per week<br>
52 books/year<br>
<br>
Only take 38 1/2 years to complete 2000 books at that pace.<br>
<br>
2000 books is equal a book/day for almost 6 years. <br>
<br>
You're 21 now, and started to read books from your mother's library at 10. 11 years * 365 days = 4015 days. You have picked a new book from your nothers library every other day for 11 years.<br>

It could be a very good learning experience if done correctly.  The moral issues are not why I think that children shouldn't play this game.  The addictiveness of this game is another story altogether.  <br>
<br>
Adults have a hard enough time juggling this game and their RL responsibilities.  Children have no chance.  Unless you are the type of parent that is willing to monitor your child's actions constantly, you are going to have a rough road as they begin to neglect school work and friends and extra-curricular activities at school in favor of a virtual world.  <br>

<br>
I know quite a few kids, myself included, who were reguarly spanked when we didn't behave.  None of us has grown up to be abusive, much less in need of a head doctor.  Spanking was simply the last escalation from behavior not accepted by our parents - we were warned, and if we didn't get it, we got the paddle.  You learned not to do those things pretty quick, much like touching the hot stove.  Oh, and my folks spent plenty of time with me, teaching me to read and all that, so I didn't want for attention.  I was just a kid with a lot of imagination that got into more than a fair share of trouble.<br>
<br>
Also, kapesh?  Unless you're being &quot;retro&quot; or &quot;hip&quot;, it's capiche.  (nitpicking I know)<br>
<br>
As much as it pains me, I have to agree with Merton on the benefits of reading at an early age.  I was able to read children's books at 3, and could read anything short of full-on technical books by 5.  I guarantee that helped me through grade/middle/high school, as well as college.  It was never considered a 'trick', both of my parents are avid readers and I'm glad they raised me the same.  Oh, and it's very possible to read much more than a book a week, as I've read a book a day before myself. <p>Inshadar<br>

<br>
excess nagging will get you nowhere. my mother used to (and still does... grr) nag and nag and nag about every little thing that didnt go as she wanted... no matter if it was an accident or purposeful... whether i broke a glass or smoked... i'd get the same lecture. eventually i learned to block it out and not defend myself if she was wrong, which she frequently was.<br>
<br>
so in order to have a chance to save a generation... please think about things before handing out a lecture... things like asking yourself if its worth it will do a lot of good.<br>
<br>
prime example... i had an accident in my first car... was my pride and joy, loved it more than anything else because i spent months looking for it and eventually spent about 5 grand on it... after the accident the car was totaled, everyone was fine, but i still got a lecture about how stupid i was, even tho i lost a fair bit that night... i think that was probably the night i lost my respect for my mother too.<br>

anyway... thats the short version of the post you were originally going to recieve <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  consider yourselves lucky.<br>

I'm enjoying this post and the different opinions and experiences everyone has.   Stick to the flameboard if you want to jump on people.  Jadae its great that your mother never spanked you and everything worked out well, but to say that childhood is universal is not reality. What about children born into poverty, sexually abused children, single-family homes, with mental or physical problems etc.  Only in a perfect world would anything be universal.  <br>
<br>
If you chose not to spank your child that is wonderful, I do chose to use that as a back up.  I use time-out, I use taking away of possessions, I use gounding,  we have long discussions, I use it all.  But in certain situations I choose to spank too, usually followed by a talk.  I don't find it barbaric, I don't just smack them for anything, they are warned, and they have the choice whether they want to push it that far. <br>
<br>
One of my kids I don't even know if I have ever spanked her.  That's because she is different than the others.   She's very responsible.  Two I never even have to ask if they have done their homework, two I have to ask and then check their backpacks too.  One I have to sit with until he finishes.  All very different personalities, in no way are they universal except in the fact that they are all kids.  <br>
<br>
As for teaching kids young, I think it is the best gift you can give your child.  At a young age they are so much more open to learning and its easier for them I think because they really have nothing else going on in their little lives to interfere.  But if a child is not reading by 4, there is nothing wrong with them.  Having put 5 children through school now, only two were reading by the time they were 4 and they were not in the norm, most kids are not reading much by that age.  Are they capable of it, yes most are.  The school system in this country is a joke (that could be a whole other discussion) so its up to parents to do as much as they can to help it along.<br>
<br>
Xanta someone already said some of what I was thinking, but I will say...you can read all you want, look at as many kids as you want, and live 17 childhoods...but you never know until you actually do it.  That is all helpful but there is no manual or PLAN.  I had planned I wanted 2 kids, I wouldn't spank them, blah blah.  Having 5 wasn't in the plan, my son having ADD wasn't in the plan, my daughter having ODD wasn't in the plan, my other daughter being smarter than me wasn't in the plan.   Being married for 15 years and then separated and being their prime caretaker wasn't in the plan. Dam the books should of covered all that.  I've read the books, I have 13 neices and nephews, my mother came from a family of 10 so I can't even count the cousins and their kids, with my closest friends I can add another 15 kids, I coach cheerleaders and have been doing so for 5 years (thats 35 kids a year), I average 9 kids at my house daily with my kids friends, neighbors kids, etc. But guess what...its still a challenge and different every single day. <br>
<br>
I respect all of you that are raising children because its the hardest but most important thing you will ever do.<br>
<br>
Also a friend and I were discussing this the other day...are other servers really different?  If so, point me towards a new one, kid friendly preferred <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
