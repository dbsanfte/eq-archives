I don't know if it's illegal now or not, but I'm fairly certain most doctors won't perform an abortion that late without one of the above reasons.<br>
<br>
3rd Tri-mester fetuses can survive without the mother in many/most cases.  So that kind of answers the question for me about when is a fetus a human being.  If it needs the mother's body to survive then it isn't a human being, technically, it's a parasite.<br>
<br>
Bottom line tho is that it's not my decision as much as I'd like it to be were I the father of an aborted baby.  It drives me crazy when Men try to argue pro-life, as if they had a fucking clue. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

I don't like the concept of how they are performed, compared to the use of herbs in the old days (yes, we're dating abortion back to at least the times of the Celts) to cause a miscarriage... but it's the woman's right.<br>
<br>
To an extent.<br>
<br>
It does bother me how a woman can choose to have the child, then force the father to pay for it. Reciprocally, if the woman doesn't wan't the child, she can have the abortion and the father has no right to complain. Seems to me that if its fair for you to fuck me over for 18 years, it should be fair for me to fuck you over for 9 months... but that's my opinion. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Rape pregnancies are rare but do occur and I fully support these. As I understand it, the emotions at the time cause hormones that lower the chances of pregnacy, but sometimes not fast enough, etc.<br>

The fact that the majority of younger people are pro-choice doesn't mean they are anti-life.  It just means they see things without as much grey, where all answers are multiple choice, and there is always right and wrong.<br>
<br>
The fact that probably every single person who posted on this issue has never experienced an abortion first-hand says volumes of your opinion on the subject.<br>

Cogito, your friend is human.  To the best of my knowledge, this still isn't a crime.<br>
<br>
(For validity's sake, I'm a young person who is pro-life and has experienced an ex-g/f going through an abortion for birth-control reasons due to me.  I also helped her through the after-math of that, and rebuilt our relationship; at least for another year, oh well.)<br>

<br>
 Not but two years ago my girlfriend at the time (we were together three years before this date) became pregnant. Yes we were using protection, but it doesnt always work. My first reaction when she told me was shock..the natural emotion that happens when you are faced with anything unexpected. After the shock wore down I became happy..truely happy. I couldnt imagine any other woman who I would want to have a kid with. Sure it would have been hard because we were both in college but damnit I was up for the challenge.<br>
<br>
A few days later she called me saying she couldnt come to class nor see me for lunch because she was feeling sick. That night I went over to her townhouse and found her on the floor passed out. Of course I rushed her to the hospital. <br>
<br>
That day she had an abortion and it seems she started hemorrhaging later in the day....<br>
<br>
She killed our baby. I dont give a fuck if she had to carry it around for 9months I would have raised it my damn self after she gave birth to it. That was a piece of me that she destroyed just because she was afraid to tell her parents she was pregnant. If she was to afraid to have a kid with me then she shouldnt have fricken ever had sex with me. Wtf is sex nowdays? A fucking sport or something? I told to her face that I wanted to never see her again. Yes I still love her, but I could never trust her again.<br>
<br>
This is one of the things that drove me to EQ. I just couldnt deal with these types of events that happen to commonly now. I havent even been interested in 2 year to even start a new relationship. I do know though that the next time I ever have a sexual encounter with a girlfriend it will be after we discused the chance of pregnancy in great detail.<br>
<br>
Take it as you will but murder is murder.<br>

I don't want kids, I take every pre-caution in order not to get pregnant.  Doctors say I'm too young to make this decision (I'm 28 ).  Once I reach the &quot;ideal&quot; age to be able to make this life changing decision, you bet your ass I will, until then, I have to wait, so if I were to get pregnant by chance/accident (they do happen), then I sure as hell want the choice not to have to raise a child.  As long as my partner knows exactly where I stand and we are in agreement, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> it doesn't concern anyone else.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  What goes on in a bedroom is not of public concern, so why should what happens as a result of that bedroom encounter be of public concern?<br>

Oh so you thought you could have your fun and then not have to deal with abortions and the like? ah..... if you dont know how hard being a parent is. SHUT YOUR FUCKIN HOLE! you have no idea what you are talking about and until you do! KEEP YOUR FUCKIN HOLE SHUT!<br>

Karthunk, your woman was sensible, you are a fucking nut. I can see why she realised that she wasnt willing to have kids with you, IMO she did the right thing. There ya go the hard fuckin truth.<br>
<br>
We dont need millions more children in the world sufferring bad homes and bad parents. Pro Lifers say, 'think of the child that's life is lost' I say THINK OF THE CHILD WHOSE LIFE IS GONNA SUCK!. FUCK YOU! you have no concept of what you are talking about. It's our responsibility to care for and provide both financial and emotional sustenance for our children, along with a good education. If we are incapable of that then we should not have them. We can't neuter people and people will fuck like bunnies and not realise the implications or not care at the time because you dont. We need to have the option if we are prepared to admit that we cannot provide a proper home and a proper life for our children.<br>

In the UK you are allowed to abort in the first 20 weeks. Well within the first two trimesters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugalendril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galendril</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/01 4:39:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mdr-nhl.home.att.net/gal.gif HEIGHT=184 WIDTH=153></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortions: can't live with them, can't live with--uh han</span><hr size=1> Greetings Guddyear!!<br>
<br>
In your post you stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;SHUT YOUR FUCKIN HOLE!&quot;<br>
<br>
And:<br>
<br>
&quot;KEEP YOUR FUCKIN HOLE SHUT!&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree.  But, I don't think we are both talking about the same 'hole'.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> &quot;The second item in the liberal creed, after self-righteousness, is unaccountability. Liberals have invented whole college majors--psychology, sociology, women's studies--to prove that nothing is anybody's fault. No one is fond of taking responsibility for his actions, but consider how much you'd have to hate free will to come up with a political platform that advocates killing unborn babies but not convicted murderers. A callous pragmatist might favor abortion and capital punishment. A devout Christian would sanction neither. But it takes years of therapy to arrive at the liberal view.&quot;</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
short of that, i'm left with my opinion...<br>
<br>
i'm pro choice. i personally would never abort, to the extreme of if i had a 50/50 chance to live because of a tubal pregnancy, if there was a chance the child would live, i'd carry to term. of course, i want children, and nothing drives me more nuts than seeing 13 year old girls giggling over how cute that little pink dress is. ffs, her kid would be old enough to be her sister. GAH. anyways..<br>
<br>
no one should tell a woman what she can do with her body. but i'm in a quandry, because i don't want to pay for these kids to have more kids. <br>
<br>
mandatory hysterectimies (GAH, you know, having the uterus removed) for any woman with no means of survival other than gov't and 3 kids. ya, that's what i'm gonna go with. <p><img src=http://www.cgocable.net/~nvocal/RDS/xantas.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulothoris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lothoris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/16/01 8:06:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortions: can't live with them, can't live with--uh han</span><hr size=1> hmm  its a complex issue this one but fuck it here goes.<br>
<br>
I believe that each case has to be taken on its own merits.<br>
<br>
I believe that abortion should be legal, atleast you are giving the person who is going to be effected by it most the option of terminating the pregnancy.<br>
<br>
Having known several woman who have had abortions I have a some idea of why they did it, one was a rape victim and that I believe goes without saying.<br>
<br>
One girl didn't plan to get pregnant and so had the thing destroyed<br>
<br>
Another girl had a scan at 20weeks (the maximum legal age a child can be aborted at in the UK) and was informed that it carried a very high risk of being brain damaged and they were giving her the option to terminate now.<br>
<br>
I think that the rape and the brain dmg case were both valid reasons to abort the child, bringing into the world a child that is disabled isn't fair, I am not saying that disabled ppl are substandard or are in anyway less human than us more fortunate ppl, more that I have seen and been around brain damaged children and know first hand the heart ache it can bring when you watch them struggling to do the simplest tasks and not being able to step in and do something about it, their quality of life is lower than other peoples end of.<br>
<br>
the rape case speaks for itself I dont need to mention that one, as goes for incest.<br>
<br>
the unplanned one is alittle difficult, I disagree that trollops that cant keep their damn legs closed can use abortion as a means of protection, I also dont think that they can bring all their little shits into the world who, no doubt will be a bunch of thieving little f**kers. <br>
<br>
I know I am contradicting myself but thats why its a complex subject.<br>
<br>
I think that if the pregancy, if carried through to the end, may harm the health of the mother than she should have the option of aborting it.<br>
<br>
so I think:<br>
<br>
The mother should have the final choice, but they shouldn't be allowed to us it as a get out of jail free card.<br>
<br>
Finally, if they mother is squirting out kids left right and centre then the govt. should have her bloody tubes tied sho she cant have anymore, dirty god damn scutter<br>

<br>
Abortions are rarely used as contraception, I would be inclined to think that is very much deep in the minority. Abortion itself isnt simple or easy it's pretty traumatic. They are almost always a last resort.<br>
<br>
The pro-lifers would have you think that this is not the case and that abortion is an excuse for promiscuity.<br>
<br>
That's just bullshit.<br>
<br>
As for the chap that thinks the being 'pro-choice' is a liberal stand then that guy is clearly a total fuckin idiot. I'm not liberal by any stretch of the imagination yet I totally agree with allowing abortions purely from a financial perspective.<br>
<br>
Id much rather pay the money for an abortion rather than the tens of thousands for years and years of child/income/welfare support, for a child that is going to have no true impact on the world based on the fact that it's parents will treat it badly and educate it poorly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umcbethdupree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>McbethDupree</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/20/01 4:33:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mysite.directlink.net/gove/images/members/mcbeth.jpg width=170 height=360></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortions: can't live with them, can't live with--uh han</span><hr size=1> I am ... I dont go any ways, like many people view it; Each case should be looked at. I think that if a woman is raped she should have the kid aborted then to raise a child of a bastard. I would hate knowing my father raped my mother and probly countless other women. I do how everthink if a baby has a disorder or the like that it should be looked into about getting an abortion. No kid should suffer their entire life and with the risk of dieing at a young age. I also believe all you dipshits need to remember there is a thing called adoption. Have the baby and give it to a loving family who will care for them. But what ever you do dont send them to a orphanage type place you might as well have them aborted. I for one am adopted and so is my sister. I respect that my real mother and/or father could not take care of me and put me up for adopting rather then to kill me off. I dont believe people should have an abortion because off a slip up in bed more then once. first time is ok, second your a fucking moron. Use a god damn condom, birthcontrol, get the surgery done or fucking to masturebate.
