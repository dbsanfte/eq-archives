<br>
thats why people always talk about it. <br>
<br>
its like any other sport/game that rewards commitment and hard work.<br>
<br>
chess is a game designed for amusement, but playing it regularly and with discipline has its rewards in international recognition.  Eq is a game desigend for amusement, but playing it regularly and with discipline has its rewards in prestige and loot. <br>
<br>
sure we all pay the same 10 bucks, but only those that are willing (or stupid enough) to log the time will reap the most rewards. <br>
<br>
Everyone in EQ makes choices, those who choose to powergame often sacrifice other aspects of their lives, those who choose to be casual gamers must deal with the sacrifices they make in EQ. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
not willing to log the time? then you have to accept your fate.<br>
<br>
I have witnessed more sharing and good will in the FCFS environment than I ever did in the days of the scheduling board. those days were mared by suspicion, antagonism and mistrust. I have also witnessed very little monopolization of the planes or other zones, pretty much every time SP has a raid there is something up for us to kill. <br>
<br>
at least now we all know where we stand. <br>

<br>
I disagree. You take a look at what my guild does on a raid in ToV-N or VP and I don't think you'll be saying anyone can do it. We work as a unit and learning to do that takes time, effort and instinct. To handle the stresses associated with a large raiding guild takes a certain type of personality. To get along in a guild of this size takes tolerance. To make it up through the loot/seniority order takes patience and dedication.<br>
<br>
Many people can play their class well, the trick is playing your class well AND knowing how to play your class to most benefit the others in your raid. I'm not saying this is rocket science, but instinct plays a major role in succeeding at EQ.<br>
<br>
It's easy to sit back and say &quot;anyone can do what EV/Comps do with enough time&quot;, but I promise you, it takes ALOT more than free time to get to this level of play. <p><br>

However, the fact that there was a schedule at all is indicative that quite a few people DO think scheduling is fair.<br>
The mistrust came from the few aforementioned greedy and selfish bastards.<br>
As for the rewards in the game, I begrudge absolutely no one the things they've acquired or the fantastic mobs they've killed.<br>
However to use Loegan's analogy, this IS a big amusement park. If you've made all those accomplishments, sit, take a breather, let some others work their way up.<br>
Nowhere have I advocated handing uber gear or experience to those that don't work for it.<br>
All I've argued is that scheduling IS fair and it is.<br>
I've even mentioned that it's not really practical.<br>
But that's because the few so often spoil it for the many.<br>

<br>
It's not rocket science, it all boils down to correctly pressing a series of keys in conjunction with everyone else correctly pressing their keys in order to beat a very dumb (AI wise),but very powerful mob.<br>
<br>
In that EQ is very Quake like I would also add good eye hand coordination, depth perception, and sensory awareness, though those traits are more or less innate and can't really be improved upon. <br>
<br>
I will give you the good communication and teamwork part, though I fail to see how greedy, manipulative, self-serving behavior can facilitate  these traits.<br>
<br>
Every encounter in this game no matter how large or small is merely a matter of learning  the mob(s) characteristics, developing a set of strategies (often through numerous trials) and implementing them. Basically all this process requires is TIME and resources.<br>
<br>
Old Military Proverb<br>
“Amateurs speak of tactics, while Professionals speak of logistics…” <br>
<br>
This argument is interesting, but in the end pointless in that VI refuses to police the masses on this issue. The rule of the mob is the law of the land. Long live the Mob...<br>
<br>
I agree with Ravlow, that FCFS is inefficient and chaotic. Time that could be spent playing the game is spent dealing with other people's histrionics. If I thought that was fun, then I would volunteer to help the local cops settle domestic disputes.<br>
<br>
However this game is about making choices, I guess if one chooses to make great sacrifices in rl time,resources, and relationships, etc, they should reap the rewards.<br>
<br>
 I hope that in the end that everyone is happy with the real life sacrifices they have made for all this imaginary wealth, power, and glory.<br>

when we went fcfs I was livid, I liked the ability to plan and organize a good raid and call in allies in advance.  I think you could say that my guild , Eternal Heroes, falls in as a midsized guild  so i thought we would be the ones getting screwed as we competed with the other midsized guilds for the planes. <br>
Well some months later i look back and have to laugh.  We have done more planes raids in the last two months than we managed to do in six under a scedule.  <br>
We have been fortunate to have dedicated people who show up for the raids and the ability to organize our members and outside help quickly in order to do the plane.  When the plane is taken we simply move our raid to another location.  <br>
You adapt, you overcome  or you can sit on the flameboard and bitch about someone &quot;taking&quot; your plane from you.<br>
<br>
For the most parts everyone tries to play nice in this game, you dont often hear of someone running up into someones plane and taking the shissar or whathaveyou from a guild who was there breaking down the plane like a shotgun.  <br>
We still are following a scedule for the dragons among us midsizers, and thats all fine and dandy because dragons are single spawns and it would kinda suck in my opinion if they were freeforall.  But I dont really have a problem with the idea of FCFS on the server.  <br>
In my opinion it encourages guildleaders and officers to maintain a good line of communication with each other and will lead to a little bit of mutual respect and cooperation hopefully .  ( &quot; sure you can send your ***** up to us  to get his ****** &quot;)   <br>
Good example of this was when we wanted to do city of mist for part of the chanter epic,  legendary was already there sadly, but a little communication and wham bam thank you call of heroes our chanter was up there getting his epic piece.<br>
<br>
The game as a lot of dicks in it,( last time I looked so did the planet)  but for the most part if you play well with others they will play well with you.<br>

<br>
I was referring to the game of Everquest and meant in no way to comment on those of us who sit in a chair all day at work (which I do as well). However to answer your question (and in no way disparaging your profession) I would say hard work is taking a call at 3am from a suicidal. hysterical woman with Bi-Polar disorder, who just took a bottle of pills, trying to keep her calm, whilst coaxing her to give me enough information so that I can have a co-worker dispatch emergency help (employed at a Crisis Center during Graduate School, and no we didn’t use caller  ID because of confidentiality reasons). <br>
<br>
Hell I got that one beat. Hard work was what my Dad did back in 1969, when he went to this lovely little interesting Asian country, and did such fun tasks as walk point through   saw grass and rice paddies with his cute German Shepard named Adolph. He continued to do other interesting things till he retired in 87.  He moved on to corporate work became a suit and nursed a chair, but I don’t think he ever thought any of the client abuse, deadlines, sales trips, and other minutiae really ever compared to the stress he felt when he was our age (well maybe yours, I’m a little old now). <br>
<br>
What’s really funny is that neither him nor me made a fraction of what you make now, when we worked as a soldier and crisis counselor. We did have the thrill of knowing though that if we screwed up, someone might get hurt or worse…<br>
<br>
With that said, I sure all of us work hard at whatever we do…<br>

<br>
1. Yes you do Deserve Phat Lewt/Praise For all the time That you have put up being Playing This game.. i know many of you have been playing this game that it has come out and ive only been playing 8 months And I salute all of You that have earned what you deserve <br>
<br>
2. I realize That A schedule/GM &quot;Coordinator&quot; type of thing wont work since The Abundance Of players is too much To handle even if you assign one GM per player (impossible also). Also sadly but true..people Crave Power/&quot;territory&quot; Since thats how society has made us, I do not Believe That People Make society Bad just , Its just the way the world goes (Example: The Renaissance, Dark Ages) People Were so happy with each other and enjoyed life during the renaissance, But Struggled To Survive Plagues and did anything Possible in their power to overpower others. Well Anyways I think history repeats itself and something good will come =P.<br>
<br>
3.Monopoly. Word That we hear in RL and Many Companies are being accused of Being ( microsoft, At&amp;T, etc..). They Earned It, They came First, They were the originals, <br>
SOLUTION=dont Fight it Just be original and create/make something different that will appeal people (Throwing some theology In here so if i offend anyone sorry =( ) God Created Us to Achieve Prosper, Live happily with one another and share, Invent, Create, Make the World A better Place.... So just Fulfill your duty as a human and do those things above IMO, We are all going to die someday and we have a beautiful Life After Death, So why not leave Something nice for our children to live in when we go ?<br>
<br>
4. In conclusion..sorry For Making such a big deal out of things..i think i went Off track on what i was really supposed to say =P. Just be happy, Continue Life, Do everything in your Power to make it great, you only live once, Its a Game but with much Human Aspects and Emotion in it.. thats why we are all so hooked into this game , Its life but in another world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Im Egrothius and thes are my 2 (4 if you will =P) Cents<br>

I always thought the &quot;hard work&quot; in a plane raid was the actual breaking and clearing of the plane.<br>
<br>
I have NEVER seen any one DEMAND that someone else go up and break/clear a plane for them.<br>
<br>
Right now a guild can get everyone together, have everything organized and ready to go, doing all the &quot;hard work&quot; you all are bringing up but then have to cancel cause someone else got there first.  Getting there &quot;first&quot; involves very little work above and beyond what is ALREADY needed to do a successful raid.  What it DOES take some luck and haveing the right guildmembers logged on at the right time.  That is NOT WORK.<br>
<br>
Now is that fair?  maybe, maybe not, but it DOES put those players who are more than willing to put the time and effort in BUT need to know ahead of time to adjust thier RL schedules at a disadvantage.  Guilds that have enough members who don't need this kind of advance warning are at an advantage.  <br>
<br>
In the end FCFS favors those who can drop everything to do something NOW.   Those who need advance notice are often left out because though they can PLAN to do a plane on such and such day,  The chance of it being canceled cause soemone else is already there is high.  That discourages the kind of RL rearrangement of schedules that the casual gamer could do in order to participate in a raid.<br>
<br>
Yes some guilds are doing MORE Plane Raids than before but if they look closely they will see that the people doing the raids are probably always the same ones, while others who use to be able to get in on SOME raids are left out.<br>
<br>
We all pay the same to use the &quot;facilities&quot; this game offers.  The &quot;work&quot; argument holds no water with me.  It is not work to get to a Plane first.  Circumstance has far more influance on that.  <br>
<br>
Now with all that,  A schedule cannot work unless the vast majority agrees to it.  We have a significant # of people who don't like schedules.  As long as that is true, no schedule will hold.<br>
<br>
I do blame VI for this.  Their attitude twoard &quot;resourse management&quot; is laughable at best.  And to a large extent they have no CHOICE because of a basic flaw in the game design.  They on one hand don't WANT everyone to get uber item X but set up a game where equipment is king.  Add in the fact that being capable and willing to work to get an item is only half the battle, the other half is luck.<br>
<br>
I see it like this.  You have 2 players.  One can play for 8 hours at a time, the other can only play for 2-3 hours at a time.  The way the game is set up now, if you compare them after they both have 50 days played, the one who can play 8 hours at a time will be higher in level, and better equipped than the player who can only play 2-3 hours at a time.  This is the inherent unfairness of EQ game design.  Two characters who both have 50 days played should be about equal because BOTH have played the game just as much<br>
(Admittedly my example assumed equal skill at playing)<br>
<br>
Because of this certain individuals will always be better off than others even given &quot;equal&quot; work/time  FCFS amplifies that advantage.  THAT is why you will see grumbling about it.  Now scheduling in no more &quot;fair&quot; than FCFS.  All it does is attack ONE aspect of unfairness that is built into the game.  Schedules however, depending on the actual setup come with thier own different set of unfairness. <p><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Ranger of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Etheios</font></b><br><img src=http://www.geocities.com/radgen/source/tiger_run_md_clr.gif>

<br>
Here's the ways you can get to the planes a lot, in a nutshell, if you don't get it yet.<br>
<br>
1) Get in a guild that has enough people on during your play times to grab an open plane on short notice.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you don't like that, then like it or not, you are fresh out of options. You can whine, complain, whatever, but guess what? It's not going to change, it's the way the game is made. Fair to everyone? No, but show me anything in life that's fair to everyone. And yes, asking people who did do what it takes to get up there regularly to just step aside so you can come on through is absolutely asking for something for nothing. Regardless of that, lashing out at everyone around you does nothing to make your case.<br>

<br>
Where did it say on the box that in order to use ALL of the game you had to join a large guild with a lot of players on at the right time?<br>
<br>
And again, you will never convince me that the &quot;work&quot; involved in getting TOO a plane is anything more than a fraction of the work required to break/clear a plane.<br>
<br>
FCFS is in place cause of rebellion against the scheduling system we had set up.  That system wasn'r perfectly fair but it was one of the most fair I had seen given its simplicity.<br>
<br>
FCFS is just as much a player enforced system as was scheduling.  Eventually if you have a guild that finds itself NEVER being able to get a Plane, they are going to start going no matter if someone is up there or not.  FCFS is not recognized by Verant except on a single MoB or camp (sometimes) basis.  People will scream and call them greedy for ignoring FCFS, but if it is what they have to resort too, oh well, ain't nobody going to stop them. <p><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Warenherz</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Ranger of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Etheios</font></b><br><img src=http://www.geocities.com/radgen/source/tiger_run_md_clr.gif>

Hell, you think waiting around to get an open plane is bad, but at least you have a very good chance at getting something when you do get an open spot. <p><br>
