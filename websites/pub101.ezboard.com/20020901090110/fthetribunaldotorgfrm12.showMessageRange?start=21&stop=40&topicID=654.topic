Funny thing is the story he gave me when I found him on-line 2 days later after screwiing me was this:<br>
<br>
I send him a tell saying I want my shit back.  He comes back and says &quot;Is this BP yours?&quot;  Then he says someone hacked his account cause he has a ton of stuff on him NOT his.  THen he says he does not have the BP.  We go around like this for about 30 mins, then I petition.<br>
<br>
This guy tells the GM his account was hacked.  GM sends me a tell laughing at this guy because of the lies he is telling.<br>
<br>
I have not seen this piece of shit in a while and I am sorry to you all he screwed out of some nice items.  <br>

He said that Micarlin was playing an alt and logging back on as the Micarlin character.  <br>
<br>
Hogge immediately went ld, only to have this Micarlin appear.  Hogge had been checking out a warrior who was wearing a Cobalt BP and even tried it on and handed it back.  Micarlin then asked if he could try it on, went ld, never to return to the game.<br>
<br>
Then strangely, a couple days later, Hogge is sporting a new Cobalt BP which he says he bought for 45k.  He knew I saw him wearing it and gave me a tell explaining how he aquired this item.  <br>

I would not trust this player and would be careful of any dealings with him.

<br>
Couple weeks ago, a group of friends and I set up at b2 in seb. Hogge and his group showed up (including Laenini) 5-10 min later. He immediately started being an asshole and demanding we leave while trying to KS us (warrior, bard x2, druid, and shammy). Normally when something like this happens I'm real understanding and will leave, but he was asking for it being an ass. We eventually left because it was clear the rest of his group was getting fed up with his actions and there was no reason to punish them for one dimwit's actions.<br>
<br>
Later in the night we found out what this pos had done and I contacted Lhelith to get the stuff back to Laenini's b2 group, which I finally did. When I tried contacting Hogge directly regarding this he got all defensive right away. So he probably has a reason to act guilty to everyone who sends him a tell Rimidal, he's prolly made quite a piece of shit rep for himself. <p><HR>

and for the guy who got his Fungi stolen...the same guy auctioned a Fungi earlier this week for about 200 bucks...if you look at some of these auctions you gotta think this guy is a scammer of some kind....fuggin shame this POS whether it is Hogge or not is making more in a week selling shit to people on the internet than I make in an honest weeks work.

I imagine some of you are going to be pretty warry of sending me e-mail, and you should be if you are on the shit list &amp; blatently lying to me.<br>
<br>
This one is from Hogge, using Hogge's Bumblene1318 account and pretending to be a friend defending him. God he is a such a piece of shit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (An ezboard private message from bumblebe1318)<br>
<br>
i am a RL friend of hogge and was over at his house when he bought<br>
the Cobalt bp. and prior to that he was in the group with the same<br>
person who lost the Cobalt bp. hogge when in the group of<br>
Kabaull(person who lost the BP) tried it on and took a pic of it. then<br>
gave it back. then he logged. we had a hockey game to go to, so then<br>
when he gets on he gets on a mule in EC and see's someone selling a<br>
Cobalt BP. so he told the person i cant remember the name maybe hogge<br>
does but not sure, anyways the person says make offer on the BP hogge<br>
says 40k cash the person said i need a little more, hogge says 45. the<br>
guy says deal. so then they do the trade. and then hogge sent a tell<br>
to Kabaull and tells him how he just got a hell of a steal on a Cobalt<br>
BP. we were jumping up and down when he got the BP. What im saying is<br>
that hogge did not steal it. he bought it and it was just extremely<br>
bad luck that at the same time hogge buys it the same day someone<br>
loses one. pluc if you go to playerauctions.com you will see a cobalt<br>
bp for sale on the tribunal server. kinda wierd. Hogge would not steal<br>
a Cobalt BP. he bought it. and thats all i wanna say since if i post<br>
on the board it would get overloaded on how much of a scammer hogge<br>
is. and he isnt just thought you should know.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
It was a good effort adding some punctuation.  Of course, punctuation is more useful when used correctly.  Spaces between words are nice as well.<br>
<br>
So you and Hogge are RL friends eh?  Where'd you meet? The GED exam?<br>
<br>
Just my two cents.<br>
