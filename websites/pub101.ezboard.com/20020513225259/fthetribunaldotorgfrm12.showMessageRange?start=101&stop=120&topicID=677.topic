None of this was posted until after he sold the items - when he got your account info he could have spoken to anyone of us and told us what he was doing, returned the items and none of this would have happened.<br>
<br>
But no, like the greedy fucked up arse he is, he sold them... then complains when this shit blows up on him ?<br>

I never said you were telling &quot;me&quot; anything.  You're really stretching here... for future referance, attempting to change the topic does NOT win arguements.

<br>
Telymon said he was quiting, gave Nexxon all the loot.<br>
<br>
Nexxon happily played with the crap.<br>
<br>
Telymon logged back in, started playing again, and took back all the stuff.<br>
<br>
Sash contacted Nexxon about the gear.  Nexxon denied having the stuff, ever having the stuff, so he could wash his hands of the matter.  Having lied like that only smeared the crap further, digging himself deeper.<br>
<br>
Telymon, quit once again.  This time deleteing EQ from his computer.<br>
<br>
Nexxon in a bind with Sash, logged Telymon in with his EQ, transferred the items back to Nexxon, to then give them back to whomever he apparently gave the stuff back to.<br>
<br>
Loose threads still abound....<br>
<br>
What happened to the items that are still missing?  Sold reportedly?<br>
<br>
Who sold them?<br>

Where is the plat that was garnered from the sales?<br>

My take on this is that you're a complete and total fucking idiot, thief, who fucks over his friends for the theft.  Your friend is an idiot for not coming clean in the first place and just saying he didnt know he shouldn't sell the crap and just giving it back.  <p>Level 55 rogue of The Tribunal, and member in good standing of Equilibrium. <br>

<br>
&quot;That is exactly the thing Ryannia. This feels much different than that, but in reality it really isn't. That is why I don't want to put him on the list. Because I am not<br>
                                           going to put people on the list everytime someone leaves a guild without giving back everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fine 'n' dandy.  (my wrists just went limp there as I typed that... god help me)<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           But ya know, there is a huge difference between say what Shortman did &amp; what Heratio did. The Elitists lost equipment that should have gone to the guild on both<br>
                                           counts. But Heratio I could understand better. Ya know what I mean? Shortman's way is much much lower to me, and it may just be me. I imagine some don't see<br>
                                           much of a difference.&quot;<br>
<br>
Depends on how you look at it.  If you look at it like is illustrated in this thread, droppable guild items belong to the guilds that acquired them, and not to the individual.  As such no matter *what* the individual does after leaving the guild, droppables should go back to the original guild.<br>
<br>
Given this set of values and beliefs, I would expect that each and every guild that follows that mentality, would not contradict themselves in their recruitment behavior, and make invites conditional upon the new members returning all droppable items to their former guilds before allowing them to join, assuming their former guilds follow a policy of &quot;guild loot stays in guild.&quot;  If this is NOT practiced then I have an exceptionally hard time sympathizing when any guild gets burned.  Let's throw a name out here.   Did Javelyn return his droppable items to The Companions when he left and joined EV?  Since he has long ago Ebayed his character I feel bringing up his name is acceptable as anything said here does not affect his &quot;gaming experience.&quot;  Since his Orb of The Infinite Void was reportedly sold with his character, I would guess the answer to my question is &quot;no.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's black and white in my eyes.  No gray.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           Beened &amp; Pigg gave back all their guild loot before they came. And ya know, I respected them greatly for it. Would we have let them in if they hadn't? Yeah, most<br>
                                           likely.&quot;<br>
<br>
And therein you contradict yourselves.  Harassing a member of my guild because he has some droppables that &quot;supposedly&quot; belong to EV, yet saying you would probably take in members who acted similarly in the reverse situation.   Giving a member of my guild shit because he asked for an item of his back, and a guild item at that, from a member that left SI to join EV.  It's hypocritical and contradictory to what you say here.  You guys blasted the shit out of Heratio anyways.  Krakkan also, and with him you focused on the green scale for quite awhile.  Because of past actions and flames I feel it is safe to assume that EV feels similar about taking droppable loot with you to other guilds.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           And yet, if they had gave all of their dropables to some jackass friend to sell in EC, ya bet your ass I would have been flaming them for it though. <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
I fail to see the difference.  Guild obtained items, if droppable, are guild obtained items.  If someone takes them to another guild, gives them to their friend, sells them in EC, etc etc they are doing the exact same thing as far as their former guild is concerned: removing those items from the guild's posession.  As such the 'crime' is equal in a justice sense. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwalkabout.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 6:08:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Add Nexxon(Qrit) to the ***list for stealing from his fr</span><hr size=1> Telymon,<br>

Games and Everquest aside, I absolutely loathe people like you. You have no honour, and I don't for a second doubt you have the same values &quot;real life&quot;.<br>
