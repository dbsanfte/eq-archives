<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> steal all their strats<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This always boggles me when I read it.  What &quot;strats&quot; are out there to steal?  CHeal Circle, Main Tanking, Assisting, Right Click items to avoid AE dispels? What?  It just seems really arrogant that people who kill a monster think they are the first ones to come up with a way to kill it or that there was zero outside influence to their strategy.<br>
<br>
Also, why is so much pride taken in re-inventing the wheel?  If someone has done it before you it makes sense to learn from their mistakes.  Why not save yourself a headache and mass wipeouts if the chance is there?  I've read that being the first one to do something carries with it the perk of learning how to do it.  Well being after the first carries with it the perk of learning from the mistakes of those that went before you.<br>
<br>
Finally, EverQuest is not brain science.  Most of this stuff is not so incredibly difficult that a guild could not figure out how to kill a monster without &quot;stealing l33t strats&quot; from another guild. <p><div align="center"><image src="http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/eqsig.jpg"></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulumaden69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lumaden69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LUMADEN!</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/13/02 4:49:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.rit.edu/~jgs1536/media/sig21.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lesson for smaller guilds</span><hr size=1> I think the point is XXX guild whos never done something before learns the exact method, AE, resist checks, pathing, whats splitable what isnt and exact order of things... etc from a guy or girl whos bitter about god knows what and tells the new guild how its done therefor XXX guild hasnt really learned something new there just mimicking the guys and girls who bust there asses and hours trying to figure things out.<br>

It is a lot of fun trying out different things. Finding out strengths and weaknesses and coming up with a plan of action.<br>
<br>
Like Hosh in VP. A cleric named Bort came up with a good strat for some of us clerics to use. It wasn't anything too complex, and most likely had been done before, but it was something that came from his mind rather than from someone else. THat was a great feeling knowing that we were working it out on our own.<br>
<br>
I don't really care if someone changes guilds and gives away secrets or strats. A lot of people don't have the time or recourses to go through so many deaths to develop their own winning formula.<br>
<br>
Going through a dungeon without a printed up map done by our lovely muse is as exciting as hell though. Doing it with a map is cool too, it just feels like you are following directions more than making up your own. <p><BR>

I may not be uber enough to have encountered mobs or zones that this applies to - but damn I just search the boards when i need info on strategy - HOW to bust fear??? look it up there are at least 15 different posts on seperate boards on how to accomplish this depending on your experience - classes and numbers? And if you don't know which one to choose post here.  I posted here on how to do PoG and got great advice from RNG/EV/SP/a dn Comps members alike.  whats the issue here?  If I posted I want to lead a Vindi raid what do I need to know?? (I picked him, cause I know the &quot;BIG&quot; guilds are still pulling him)  YOU MEAN TO TELL ME IT'S A SECRET?<br>

<br>
There is definately an element of strategy connected to various mobs, some more than others. Maybe what many people can relate to is learning how to pull the Sebilite Protector without aggroing Trakanon. Some people had the patience to figure this out, others got told by others  (and I was one of them). Then there are other elements of strategy, how to position it, where to position it, triggering the first AE. Now while Trakanon may be easy to kill today with the gear and high DPS available he was very hard to kill for the first guilds that killed him, and these things really mattered because it was the difference between kill or wipe.<br>
<br>
Recently it has been common questions on monkly-business.com like 'how do I pull Ikatiar the Venomed', or 'how do I split Zlexak'. These are pieces of strategies or knowhow or 'tradesecrets' if you want that does take time to figure out. RNG spent what ? 5-6 days in tov north on their trip there, and I don't think they cleared it fully. What do you think they were doing if everything was a given ?<br>
<br>
Both Companions and EV is currently trying to figure out working strategies for High Priest in ssra (well, I assume EV is as well since to my knowledge EV hasn't killed it either). You have this snake with a name, 12 guardians which repop fairly fast around him and you have to fight him in his room while keeping his guards dead, over and over again. This is a fight with a fairly high level of strategy, which isn't about place MT there, launch cheals at required intervals. When Comps and EV have pulled their shit together and actually killed this mob, you can bet your ass it's reason for /guildremove if someone tells another guild how to do it (or how WE do it).<br>
<br>
Developing a strategy for a mob that requires one is time consuming, and the way you you do it is by trial and error to gather knowledge (and ideas and plans of course). Using someone elses strategy or 'howto' is very timesaving. Sometimes I read how other people did or do stuff and I think &quot;dang, that was smart&quot; other times it's like &quot;hah, we found a better way&quot;.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

<br>
Comes down to loyalty and screening. No matter how good you are at screening there will always be a few assholes that slip through recruitment, but fostering loyalty should be job 1 in any guild. Not only will it avoid the scenario you describe, but it will avoid hundreds of other problems as well.<br>
<br>
Now if you have screened well and taken care of job 1 and this still happens, then it means this disgruntled member was a true piece of shit, and while the guild they join may get some stolen strats, they will also get a bunch of probs from their newest member. In the end I think the guild with the stolen strats got the short end of the stick, don't you? <p><br>

Of course if there is valid reasons why they are disgruntled enough to give strats away, that might be a factor to consider, but it would have to be a pretty damn good reason to condone that sort of backstabbing and even then I wouldn't trust them fully. <p><br>

<br>
Boab, I would agree with you 100% but... in the last few months I was in Comps, all Leriana/Zen did was read other people's strategies off websites.  Sorry man, but you know that's true.. it was part of the reason ( small reason, yes, because my job that I had then is the same as I have now in which I don't get home until 7pm eastern US time, but still helped in making my decision easier ) that I was unhappy enough to leave when he was being chosen as a guild leader.  The funnest part about doing Gorenaire that first time was because we didn't use anyone else's strategies, we figured it out on our own and the result was spectacular.  I gave Laen a  suggestion about using a good cleric with our enchanters, he incorportated it into his own great ideas and strategies, and we kicked her ass.  ( btw, for those who don't remember, Gorenaire at one point, prior to SoV and uber DPS, was tough as hell )<br>
<br>
Reading strategies from a website is no different from taking them off a disgruntled ex-member that got them from a previous guild.  Maybe on the personal level with that one player it is.. but other than that the end result is the same.<br>
<br>
Anyway, had to get involved in a flame thread since I've been reading up again on the boards the last few days.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 695<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/13/02 7:48:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> BTW - we talking about anyone in particular here?

<br>
loegan, you left EV, for whatever reason, if you joined another guild, and told them how to kill every mob that EV was killing. Prior to this knowledge they were not able to kill even the easiest of those mobs without several wipeouts (thats assuming they even did get around to winning). You think it is EV's fault for having pissed you off and that they have no reason to be upset at the hard work put in learning how to kill those mobs in the first place? <br>
<br>
Jav, do people go to websites and dig up some general info on mobs? Yeah. That information is also in the Spdat mostly. You dont go to a web site and have a detailed plan on how to pull/split/deal with the high priest in ssra. Just as even with velious out for so long, you dont go to a website and find out how to pull/split/deal with velious ubers. Will you find general info like AE's, approx hp, dps. Yeah, but those are generally things obtainable without having to actually even fight a mob. I can send a monk in to aggro Ubermob_001 and have the monk fd after a momnet. At that time we know what the ae is/if they have one. We also know pathing of it and mobs around it. We also know if its a quad/doubler and for how much. That is general info obtainable without much effort and is what is available on the web. People using this (we just send in the monks thx nyrkl/brend/wild/walk/makino for dying so much) I have no problem with. Its not hard information to obtain. Now people getting direct information on how to pull, how to position, how to deal with pets/adds for the specific encounter, how to tank(yes there are more than one way), how to deal with rampage/flurry, how to counter the ae/procs of the mobs, etc, etc, thats when i have problems.   <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=9900CC, strength=4)"><center><a style="font-family:Verdana; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none; font-size:12pt" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22676>Mandoman Mischieflover</a></center></div>

Everything we did in regards to PoS, Trak, VS, etc., we did based on Zen's reading websites and knowing the entire plan before even doing the raid.  When we did Trak he knew exactly how to pull Protector, when he had never even been there before.  <br>

Wrong on both counts...and please dont confuse reading websites (heh, can I get some URL's please?) with actually either having done it before or having enough knowledge of game mechanics to adapt to the situation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujavelyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Javelyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/13/02 9:19:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> Oh, right, you did it with FoH.<br>

If you want to lie out of your ass and relive the indignity of being forced to give back your droppable guild loot which you protested so vehemently, then go ahead and be my guest. But I really dont give a shit about you, or anyone else flaming me.<br>

See.. I can be honest with myself and others.  I don't make shit up, everyone who knew me from Trib knew that I was blunt without spouting the bullshit.  <br>

And you're right, I'm going to bed because I work tomorrow.  And considering the amount of time this board has been in existence, and that 2 of your 4 total posts came after what I've said, your &quot;feign interest&quot; comment doesn't hold much water.  <br>
