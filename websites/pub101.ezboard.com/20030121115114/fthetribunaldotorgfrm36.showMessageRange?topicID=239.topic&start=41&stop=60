That was in response to Hayzen's rhetoric by doctors with an agenda. My article was also more recent with the facts and mechanism include.<br>

<br>
Don't be ridiculous. The procedure must alway be allowed because it is the womans body. The procedure should be performed in such a way though, so if the fetus can survive outside the womb, that it is given the opportunity to do so, as long as the this procedure does not present greater danger to the mother.<br>
<br>
As to your previous argument, it's moot so I didn't answer it. It doesn't matter in the least how the woman got preganent. The only relevent fact is that she can't be forced to use her body to keep the fetus alive anymore than a person can be forced to donate an organ or give blood. Our bodies can't be used against our will, period. <p><br>

Well, you should read about abortion, although you claim you have. That statement is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard, actually knowing the facts of abortion and how it is performed. Its about killing the child as quickly and efficently as possible.<br>

Again, I argue that no one forces anyone to have sex (expect for rape). A possible outcome of sex is pregnancy. With pregnancy a new life is formed. To say that the government should have no role in protecting life, and especially the lives of those who cannot defend themselves, is absurd. You should be responsible for your actions. Whether or not that person depends on you for life or not is irrelevant. A 1 minute old baby cannot live without adult care anymore than a 9 month old &quot;fetus&quot; can. <br>
<br>
Under your argument, a mother should have the right to neglect her children at any point it becomes inconvient to her. You cannot say this is not using her body, becuase it is. When you have a child, you need to work to feed, clothe, take care of the child. That working would be using &quot;your body&quot; so to speak, in order to feed the child. Or any action that you would perform, such as feeding. Without your working or using your body to raise that child, it surely would die. <br>
<br>
The physicality of actually having the child in the womb to having a 1 minute baby in your arms has nothing to do with it. That's really illogical and stretching things. <br>
<br>
Do you believe that if a parent takes home an infant and doesnt feed it and it dies, it is ok since that would impede on their life? After all, no one can force you to take care of your children, right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1774<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/13/02 1:39:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Man denied appeal to have more children.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Its about killing the child as quickly and efficently as possible.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Good, we both agree that it is done in as humanely as possible. Now that that's out of the way:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Again, I argue that no one forces anyone to have sex (expect for rape). A possible outcome of sex is pregnancy.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So what? Conception is not a contract. If a woman intentionally gets preganent and then decides 2 months later she doesn't want to go through the pain of birth, are you trying to say she is legally obligated to go full term? Gimme a break. It's her body and none of your business. The most sacred right any of us have is control of our own bodies. People are getting too self righteous when they sart thinking they can tell somebody what to do with their own body or have some moral right to do so. Keep your nose out of other people's bodies and tend to your own.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Under your argument, a mother should have the right to neglect her children at any point it becomes inconvient to her.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Another argument that shows you don't understand the issue at all. Once a child is outside the womb, it does not rely on anothers body to survive. It's rights do not infringe on the mothers control of he body and neglect has nothing to do with a person's right to control their own body. Neglect involves control of ones actions, not their body, which is not even in the same realm of this discussion.<br>

You keep contradicting yourself Loegan. <br>
<br>
Once you have a person living inside your body, I don't think it is your right to murder it becuase you don't want to be bothered. You do. <br>

<br>
Yes, it most definately is. Its about dependency. Neglect comes from dependency. An unborn infant depends on its mother for survival much the same way a 1 minute old infant does. Your argument that because its in the mother's body, it has no rights is childish, immature and absurd. <br>
<br>
That would make abortions legal up to 1 second before birth. <br>
<br>

Yes, a fetus has a right to live -but- that right can not infringe on the mother's right to control her body. The fetus -does not- have the right to -force- the woman to use her body to sustain it.<br>
<br>
Now if the child was incubated in a test tube and could grow without infringing on the woman's right to control her body, I would agree with you 100%. But ones right to life -can not- infringe on a persons right to control their body. How much more simple can it be? <br>
<br>
To state that neglecting a child who is no longer dependent on the mother's body is the same as abortion is the most stupid argument I have ever heard. Refusal of care is not the same as rufusal to use your body to sustain a life. The right to control your body has nothing what-so-ever to do with a child once it is born. Caring for a child in no way infringes on the control of your body (unless you get into breast feeding, but it's not illegal to use milk/formula instead, so until there is forced breast feeding, that doesn't apply either). <p><br>

<br>
If however, a late term abortion is done where there is a chance of survival outside the woman, then I believe that fetus should be given the chance to survive instead of aborted, since that would not infringe on the womans rights in any way. She has the right to control her body - not to control the fetus once it can survive on it's own.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is that a fetus who has not gone full term usually has underdeveloped lungs among other problems. It may very well turn out that the more humane thing to do is just abort, since there is great potential for complications that could effect quality of life should the fetus survive. <p><br>

You see, it is legal for doctors to not treat babies who are born with birth defects. Basically they do not give any food or water until the child dies. It's called non-treatment or some such thing.<br>

Seems to me you could make a far better case against this sort of thing than abortion.  <p><br>

Your definition of life and mine are very different. I look at an egg and I see a bunch of cells and fluid that would have been a chicken. You look at an egg and you see a chicken.<br>
<br>
An egg is not a chicken and a fetus is not a child. They both have the potential to grow into beings if allowed to and nothing goes wrong, but having the potential to be something and actually being something, are two different things. And just like eating an egg is not killing a chicken, aborting a fetus is not killing a child.<br>
<br>
Guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.<br>

<br>
So until there is a screen that pops up asking "Do you want to become pregnant?  Yes or No"  it isn't exactly a real choice.<br>
<br>
Aborting an artificially inseminated child, would be wrong.   Aborting a child because it didn't happen to be a boy, would be wrong.<br>
<br>
I can't site a source, but I've heard that most abortions in the country are conducted for married couples.  These couples are obviously people that are irresponsible to begin with.  Myself, I didn't get married until I knew I could financially support my wife and I, and had a foreseeable future career that could support the family we both want.  She has been on birth control (which some Christians find immoral as well) since before we became sexually intimate.<br>
<br>
These couples that have these abortions, are obviously aren't responsible enough to make such decisions.  So you want to put a child into the hands of these people?  You honestly think that the child will have a fulfilled life?  That they won't be born to poverty?<br>
<br>
There are so many scenerios that lead up to a person's decision to abort their pregnancy.  Not all of them are honorable, actually most aren't, but I'd say most are good intentioned.  Laws can't not differ between the two.   Nor should laws stripe someone of their PERSONAL rights.  A person should have complete control over there own body.<br>
<br>
No one should have the right to make personal decisions for another.<br>

You stand for it, you should know what you are standing for. Are you afraid to see the outcomes of what you believe in? <br>
<br>
Faces of Death, how absurd a comparison. Do you even know what Faces of Death is? It's like these freakish customs around the world. WTF does that have to do with war? <br>
<br>
Again, I go back to the fact that it is a human life, regardless whether or not it lives inside the womb.<br>
<br>
And the 1,000th time on this post, if a fetus is not human, then what life form is it? Fetus is an early stage of human devlepoment. How many fucking times does this need to be said?<br>
<br>
I am not trying to convince any of you to be pro life. I honestly could not give two shits. Just admit what it is, stop lying to yoursleves and trying to make excuses for it. Its the taking of human life for convience. No matter how you fucking sugar coat it, that is what it is. <br>
<br>
Until you can prove a fetus is not a human being in the early stages of development (like an infant is, an adolescent, and so on), YOU STFU.<br>

I'm not PRO abortion, you wacko.  I'm Pro CHOICE, though I hope they choose life.  I'm NOT for being some self rightious asshole that thinks they know the ways of everyone's life, and making someone do something that is harmful to them and their future children.<br>
<br>
Faces of Death is NOT all about freakish customs around the world.  It has all kinds of video clips of people dying in many different ways.  The one I had watched mostly contained people shooting other people, or themselves.  So yes it has plenty to do with war, especially since some of the footage was WAR footage.  So very on similiar to your crappy Silent Scream movie you wish everyone to watch.<br>
<br>
What I was saying is this.  You have been suggesting that watch a propoganda video in order for them to get a full understanding of what they are activists for.  With that thought in mind, then you should also be advocating for people to understand the nature of WAR, before they go off and support the waging of it.  I KNOW it is something that needs to be done.  I am not here making suggestions that people should watch those movies before supporting a war.<br>
<br>
I never denied that it wasn't a "human".  But the relationship is between a mother and HER developing child.  As long as that human fetus exists within that mother, it is HER responsibility ALONE.  It's HER body.  HER rights.  Not yours.<br>
<br>
As far as adoption and what not.  Yeah that's a GREAT system.  So many scholars and world leaders have come from that system.  It's something I'd recommend to all of the children of the country to exist within.<br>
<br>
I don't want the government raising the children of this country.  They should be raised within a family, not being shuffled around, abused, or falling between the cracks of the system and lost.<br>
<br>
It's the woman's body, it's HER choice.  No one should take that away.<br>
<br>
Also keep this in mind you wackos.  Just because it's against the law doesn't STOP it.  When abortion was illegal, women still went to back alley, kitchen table, surgeons that preformed these surgeries.  It wasn't a rare thing for women to bleed to death, or contract a deadly infection from these proceedures.  But I guess you could give two shits about such women, cause well... they deserve it right?<br>
<br>
So until you prove there is a YES or NO question that women can answer before they become pregnant with a perfectly normal child birth (no complications), you can STFU.<br>

First off, I returned your extreme rudeness in my last post, but I won't do that here. Calling me names doesn't solidify your argument Wenin, it makes it weaker. I thought you knew this, but I guess your passion got to you. <br>
<br>
You say you are Pro Coice, but not Pro Abortion. Let's analyze the logical ramifications of this. What does it mean to be pro choice. Well, you pretty much say that you think a woman should have control over her own body. I don't disagree with that. BUT, I think that there is an actual human living in there, hence, not &quot;part&quot; of her body, but dependent on her body for survival. A fetus is not like an arm or a leg. A least, I don't view it as such, and neither does medical science, or, for that fact, the law. What I mean by the law not viewing it, goes back to my double homicide argument. How can you charge someone for a double homicide if they are just eliminating part of someone's own body. <br>
<br>
On to the your for choice, not for abortion argument. Well, the choice you are for, is to have abortions. And while I am sure you do not think &quot;Yea, everyone should get abortions&quot;, I think you are kidding yourself to think the choice you so passionately hold dear, is to actually HAVE an abortion. You are for the choice of abortion. <br>

So, you are ok with killing someone then as long as the child is still inside the mother's womb? You say it is human. Also, I gather, from your argument, that you are for abortions right up until the point wher the baby exists the mother. <br>

Silent Scream was made by a doctor who performed over 40,000 abortions. It is about the procedures and tehcniques used during abortion. It is about what they do with the discarded fetus' afterwards.

You can't have it both ways, Wenin. Again, a fetus is a human (as conceeded by you earlier), therefore not PART of her body, but dependent upon it for survival.
