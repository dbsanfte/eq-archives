<br>
You're level 59, eh? Yeah, that would have been pretty respectable... about a year and a half ago. By now you either got level 60 over 5/6 months ago, you suck, or you're not trying. I, for one, am not trying. Since you wield the &quot;look at me and my level 59&quot; as though it has some sort of clout, you obviously <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> care, which means you just flat out fucking suck (not that I couldn't have inferred that by your previous &quot;I'm level 59 and I'm so fucking destitute that I NEED 200pp&quot; attempted smear that go yo' ass caught, you stupid whore.)<br>
<br>
Pinkerton? It's the name of a weezer album, though I'll admit that when I used that I didn't know it. On top of that, it's not even my ingame surname anymore. You know why? cause you're right, it is pretty fucking gay, though not a quarter so much as your joke of a flame.<br>
<br>
As for goatse.cx, you really should post a picture of it here on the flameboard. I'm sure everyone thats already seen it like 25 fucking times would think it was absolutely witty, and might even go so far as to complement you for your &quot;10 for originality&quot; in the 3 minutes before your ass got banned.<br>
<br>
Yeah, way to take apart a &quot;fat fuck&quot; like me. What's that called? 2 words that both begin with the same letter? Alliteration, I think. You used an alliteration, brav-fucking-o oh king of brilliantness and shit, cause I gotta admit that was pretty much all that had going for it. Outside of that, totally reeked of suckiness.<br>
<br>
So, now that you're done getting totally fucked over by like 16 people, why don't you just cooperate and sit your cro-magnon ass down in the corner, cause as long as you're here I, not to mention the aforementioned others, completely fucking own you.<br>

Excellent idea. Does the 1pp from every newbie include you, oct, and krickett?<br>

In denial are we Octracula? You are obviously insecure that im level 59 and your 49 otherwise you wouldn't keep mentioning it. How do you think people get money in EQ oct? By looting platinum of course. Any amount helps no matter what the number is. Most people like to stand up for their principles.<br>

<br>
Im glad youve changed it. However, your personality doesnt change even if you change your surname. Just thought you should know that. My &quot;jokes&quot; of a flame keep sending you back to the boards, so theyve proven to be effective. <br>

&quot;As for goatse.cx, you really should post a picture of it here on the flameboard.&quot;<br>

Correct, 4 people (all of them being no names like you). Want me to list em off? YOU, Krickett, Slutvinna, and shitface Aeadiin. Do you and krickett compare notes? You must subscribe to his anti trogldyte magazine or something. Big words don't help you here Octracula. Face it, you lose.<br>

Setting: A cave settlement inhabited by 25 cave men.<br>
<br>
10 cave men are what we call l33t. They hunt and kill T. Rexes. 14 can merely kill Allosauruses, but one can kill Giant Allosauruses. <br>
On a scale of difficulty, the T. Rex is a 10, the Giant allosaurus is a 6, and the Allosaurus is a 5.<br>
<br>
The 10 l33ts eventually start to wander off, only spending half their time at the settlement. They have larger concerns.<br>
<br>
Of the 15 left, the one giant allosaurus hunter starts thumping his chest cause only HE can hunt allosauruses. In response, the other 14 just chuckle, shrug, and point at the 10 that completely blow ALL of them out of the water, including the one that thinks he's just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> shit. <p><center><img src=http://www.casiesplace.com/cntchoc.jpg></center>

Then what is your goal? To be faggot and prance around IN game and ON the boards at the SAME time?<br>
<br>
&quot;Flaming my level means nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Means something to me. Try not to put yourself down next time.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I was in denial I probably wouldn't have said what my level was to begin with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or it could just be the fact that everyone hates you at this point and you have nothing to lose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I know how to get money. Enough so that 200pp is NOTHING to me. I can get that in 10 minutes of hunting in the right places.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've finally figured it out, oct doesnt play for levels, then he MUST play for money! Maybe thats why his pointless posts are all over this money-related thread. As an expert of the field, he feels the need to give some input on the matter.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for principles, I say 'God bless you' when people sneeze.&quot;<br>
<br>
As do I.<br>
<br>
&quot;However, I don't shoot someone that forgets to say &quot;god bless you&quot; because it could possibly be a slight to me.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;You see, it's a FANTASY GAME.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's nearing 800. I post here daily, and I'm sure as hell not going to stop simply to prove that I don't care.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you honestly think I will? I've been crushing you like a bug from the beginning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just cause I acknowledge your existance doesn't mean I give a flying fuck about you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Im feeling the same way about you right about now.<br>
