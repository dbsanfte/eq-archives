<br>
I really hope this isnt the Dvin I know, for I am rather upset to say the least with the initial post, and also with the posts that Dvin made after trying to explain his/her opinion.<br>
<br>
I am a Fireman, (professional for the city I work for, and a volunteer for my Fathers dept.), and very proud to be one.<br>
<br>
I am also a former Marine, and have many relatives who do or have served as Firefighters, Marines', Police Officers, Airmen, EMT's, Paramedics, and Navel personel.  You might go as far as to say that its in the blood.<br>
<br>
I do feel I must respond to a few of the topics that found most disturbing.<br>
<br>
Most of all I feel sorry for the person that wrote the article in  your initial post.  His hatred is very apparent, and must be eating him up.  I would hope that he could find a good counselor and heal whatever wounds would have caused so deep a scar.<br>
<br>
If anyone joined the armed forces or civil servises in the hopes of being labled as, or becoming a &quot;Hero&quot;, than they should honestly look for other work.  NONE of the people I know that I consider to be true &quot;Heros&quot;, can be made to believe that they are anything but an average &quot;joe&quot; or &quot;jane.&quot;<br>
<br>
An example of this is a friend of mine that rushed into a trailer when it was fully invoved, (on fire), when the owners yelled that they couldnt find their baby.  By the time we had started flowing water, he had found the baby, wrapped her in his bunker coat, and with no reguards for his personal safety, brought her through a literal &quot;Hell&quot; to safety.  She came through with minor skin damage, and some smoke inhalation, he did not fare as well, (though he was able to come back to the line after a few months off).<br>
<br>
Is he a &quot;Hero&quot;?? I think so, would you?<br>
<br>
Yes I feel that every Fireman, Police officer, EMT, Paramedic, or civilian that saved ONE life that day or died trying is a Hero in every sence of the word. Nothing anyone will ever say will change how I feel about that. It amazes me that there are some so heartless as to not see it that way.<br>
<br>
On a different note, you spoke of wildland firefighters as if they never do more than clear fire lines and stand back hopeing that the flames stop.<br>
<br>
Being a member of my Fathers volunteer FD, I have to have an up to date Red Card, (or wildland card). For his department is in a mountain community, and suffers every Summer, (especially the last few years from being so dry), from multiple forrest fires.  I don't remember once on any of the fires I have been on, digging a fire line and standing around.  Usually we are in our 5 ton, making our own path, trying to get close enough to the fire to reach it with our hose reel so we can get some foam on it.  Finding, avoiding, and marking &quot;snags&quot; for the saw crews. finding, foaming and digging up hot spots. Shuttling water, and setting up portable tanks. Running like hell from slurry bombers that &quot;just miss their target&quot;, etc, etc.  Wildland Firefighting is just as tough as a structure fire, but streached into 12+ hrs, I can assure you.<br>
<br>
Finally, this IS the USA. If someone wants to display the flag because they are truely patriotic, or they just want to wear the flag in any form because its the latest craze, it doesnt matter.  That is their choice to make, and having that choice IS America. By having a choice they are practicing Democracy in its most pure form IMO.<br>

lets tell their wives that eh? maybe that will make em feel better.  i dont agree with dvin, but i dont disagree with him.  i believe we are focusing WAY to much on police/fire fighters.  90% or more of the people that died were not in public service.  yet they are being forgotten.  they are going to make a holiday for the fire fighters...i say why not make it for everyone that died?  or are normal people not good enough?  <br>

<br>
Hey uh, I'm not a child though.  I'm going on 26 years old.  And I don't make up 'imaginative' stories to impress flameboard people, sorry Kellianne.  It actually happened, whether you want to believe it or not is your prerogative.  I also don't have 'pride in the fact that you drive while intoxicated (and apparently high) and put the lives of everyone around you in danger', I never said that at all.  I said I've never been caught.  And I don't put people in danger, in fact I've never been in a crash while driving.  I'd take a person driving high over some brainless idiot on a cell phone anyday.  People who're high are more patient, laid back and cautious in driving...it's the rest of you friggin morons on the road that are the hazard.  Ever driven totally fatigued after a long stressful day, or driven for an extended period of time on a long trip?  Well, surprise surprise you were more a danger to people on the road than I ever was.<br>
<br>
As for the core of this thread, this was a good thought here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Before you disrespect the men and women that ran into that burning building in hopes to rescue as many people as they could before it fell ... ask yourself if you would do that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't think any everyday person would ever know that until they were put into that situation.  I would think that I would, because I'm a kind of person who'd just take charge and act right away without really stopping to dwell on what was going on.  But until faced with it, I'd never know for sure.  Then again, I'm not trained to react like an automaton in a situation such as that.  That doesn't mean I disrespect those that are however, in fact I don't believe I did.<br>
<br>
What I said was, the nation's getting ridiculous, going beserk with its treatment of this incident.  Like a bunch of wussies.  Put it in the history books already, and move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umaxamaji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 520<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/4/02 5:39:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ya know, I gotta agree with this</span><hr size=1> Wow, Dvin's still babbling.

Judging from your ridiculous stories you are, in fact, a going on 26 year old child. Most people brag (bullshit) about stunts like that when they're 18. Seeing as though that's the type of thing you think is cool I'd say you're a fuckup with a good vocabulary. Don't go fucking up being a misanthrope now, that would be just sad.<br>
