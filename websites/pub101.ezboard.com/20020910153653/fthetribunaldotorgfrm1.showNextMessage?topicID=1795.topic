Re: The Altazar GM scandal, aka Spydergate<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, figured I'd drop in and say something. Since I don't really have much time, here's the order of events:<br>
<br>
<br>
June 3-6: Spyderbyte flies to San Diego after a week of talking to Altazar on the phone. She stays with him, this worked out because he has Monday/Tuesday off every week.<br>
<br>
June 7-9: I was at Smilefest (3 day festival in NC) when I found out about all of this.<br>
<br>
June 9: I arrived at my house and talked to Spyderbyte on the phone for a couple hours about her trip to San Diego.<br>
<br>
June 10: I write my first e-mail to Alan Crosby (EverQuest Customer Service Manager) giving dates of events, and explaining everything. He e-mails me back within an hour saying he will look into it.<br>
<br>
June 12: I write another e-mail to see what the status is, he responds assuring me it will be investigated. Later that day I'm unable to log into EverQuest (Error 0025: You have been BANNED from EverQuest due to inappropriate behavior. To contest this decision, contact EverQuest at eqaccountstatus@station.sony.com for further assistance.). At this point I assume Altazar came into work, was approached by Alan Crosby, and denied even knowing Spyderbyte on any level. Alan Crosby then banned my account without any warning.<br>
<br>
This is the e-mail I received from him:<br>
<br>
Greetings Brandon,<br>
<br>
I have had the access to your account taken away due to your continued attempts to harass an employee. You have emailed additional addresses in an attempt to impugn and disparage an employee of the company over a personal issue involving your ex-girlfriend. This will not be tolerated. <br>
<br>
While I cannot discuss specifics I can assure you that the situation you presented was handled in accordance with our companies policies. <br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Alan Crosby<br>

<br>
I only e-mailed Alan Crosby about this and he makes it sound like I've been contacting every employee that works under Verant Interactive. Ok, so that was last Wednesday (June 12). I e-mailed EQAccountStatus to 'contest' the ban and haven't received anything back from them. Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out how I got banned for just suggesting information about one of the GM's having a player stay at his house for 4 days to Alan Crosby (which turned out to be true - see: Spyderbyte bragging about dating Altazar on Luclin / Flames and Rants). I'm not going to sit here and cry about my Monk being banned, I just think it's absolutely retarded and beyond unjustified. <br>

<br>
<br>
I've got a true story to tell you about one of your Server GM's. You see, it has to do with a certain female. Marlena ***** of Atlanta Georgia (Spyderbyte Doku, Legacy of Sorrow, Luclin). Also, a certain male. Ryan Robinson of San Diego California (Altazar, Luclin).<br>
<br>
In simple terms this is what happened, over the course of 3 months, Altazar has messaged Spyderbyte. Days pass, more trust is earned, the next thing you know they're on the phone, or sharing his private email address (*********@canoemail.com). Finally a couple weeks ago, he decided to invite her to his place in California - he offered to pay her way. She couldn't resist. Monday, June 3rd, she flew out of Atlanta on a Delta flight to San Diego. They hung out, he told her alot about how Verant works, what his play server is, and they had intercourse, June 6th came and she flew back to Atlanta.<br>
<br>
Altazar knew exactly what he was doing. That's why he moved Spyderbyte to Legends ASAP (I'm not even sure she paid for this transfer). He knew it'd surface, he knew his job was on the line, so he covered his footprints. But the facts remain - he abused his power as a Gamemaster in EverQuest to seduce a regular player of his server. Pathetic.<br>
<br>
Guides have been removed for 'cybering' players in the past. What's the punishment for a GM abusing his powers to actually sleep with a player on HIS server? Check the logs, check anything you want - it's all fact. I find it hard to believe a company of your stature would allow something like this to happen under the strict guidelines that you have for GM's/Guides and player interactions. Call me if you have any questions regarding anything (***-***-****).<br>
<br>
---(Pre Ban)<br>
<br>
Greetings Brandon,<br>
<br>
Thank you for this information. I will look into it. I do wonder though how you are so intimately aware of the facts regarding this situation and what your stake in this matter is.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
<br>
Alan Crosby<br>

<br>
Hello Alan, I appreciate the fast response. I've been friends with Marlena ***** for over a year now, we've met on four different trips. I don't live in Atlanta GA though, I'm in Roanoke VA. We tell each other everything, she even called me from San Diego to tell me how wonderful Altazar is (on Monday). They're dating, and I hope the best for them, but under the circumstances I don't see it being appropriate at all. Working at Verant is a job, it's not a singles hotline.<br>
<br>
I can understand how you'd question this, and I imagine you'll probably take the word of Altazar over me. However, I really hope you approach it in the right manner.<br>
<br>
---(Pre Ban)<br>
<br>
Greetings Brandon,<br>
<br>
Again I would like to thank you for bringing this to my attention. Unfortunately I cannot discuss what disciplinary actions, if any, were taken with an employee. I would further ask that desist in contacting other employees regarding this matter as I am the highest point of contact in In-Game Support and I am already addressing the issue.<br>
<br>
Thanks Again,<br>
<br>

<br>
Hello Alan, any luck with the Altazar situation? Curious minds would like to know. Every Verant employee I've talked to as of late had the same thing to say (2 SWAT GM's), they're all wondering if Altazar is going to be let off the hook. Even a Senior Guide I know on another server said it's blatantly against the rules.<br>
<br>
---(Post Ban)<br>
<br>
Error 0025: You have been BANNED from EverQuest due to inappropriate behavior. To contest this decision, contact EverQuest at eqaccountstatus@station.sony.com for further assistance.<br>
<br>
Did you ban me for emailing you the information regarding Altazar? I don't understand where this comes into play. I didn't do anything against the rules and all of a sudden I used "inappropriate behavior" and my account is "banned" ?<br>
<br>

I e-mailed Alan Crosby in hopes he would investigate, maybe slap Altazar on the wrist at best. I had no clue my account was at risk of a ban, if so I would of used an Anonymous e-mail. It's still unjustified. None of the e-mails have been edited at all except for Marlena's last name, Altazar's private e-mail, and Alan Crosby's work e-mail.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucytheralobotamizer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CytheraLobotamizer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 9:14:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1776.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: amazing... luclin server's gm scandal</span><hr size=1> This doesnt surprise me one bit, I knew guides on that server and they are rather shitty, big headed and very rude..

What 'Powers' did he actually abuse?  I'm sure he couldn't give her uber loot or anything, it would show up on a log.  Then he has her move to Legends where he CAN'T do anything for her just to keep kosher.  I'm sure the chick was impresed that he was a GM and he used that to his advantage, but that's just using your assets, not abuse.<br>
<br>
The Gm sounds like he cool here, wtf did you try and gank him by sending emails to his bosses ?  Sorry you got banned, but sounds like you were asking for it.  Live and let live.<br>

What you also need to understand is that Neku is the leader of a guild that reminds me at times of E/V. The type of ire that their play style could cause <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The server would be in an uproar over the high end encounters -  his guild, Legacy of Sorrow,  not honoring any type of lists or rotations that the other guilds adhered to. <br>
<br>
Neku has several warnings on his account, and I am sure this must have had something to so with the banning as well. <br>
<br>
However, he is young and probably quite impetuous. He should have been a bit more guarded with information, and perhaps he wouldn't have been banned. He already had enough on his record to give them justification to do it.<br>
<br>
Will be interesting to see what plays out next. <p><table>

Guides cannot guide on their play server, yet if everything is true that I have heard so far, they are saying its ok for GMs to date players on the server they get paid to be on? <p><center>

<br>
If he is using company time to do anything but his job then it would be wrong, I agree.<br>
<br>
If he was using his abilities as a GM to grant favors to this person in game then it would be wrong, I agree.<br>
<br>
If he had abused his power in any way then I would agree that it was wrong, but from what I've gathered none of that happened.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything wrong with the GM dating a player.  Would it be different if they had met in a coffee house and later they both found out that he was a GM and she was a player?<br>
<br>
What about jobs where people have a ton of interaction with the public.  Say for instance someone who works at the DMV.  Should this person not be allowed to date anyone with a driver's liscence?  What about government workers who process federal taxes? Should they not be allowed to date anyone who files taxes??<br>
<br>
450,000 people player EverQuest.  Should every Verant employee screen a potential date everytime they want to go out and meet someone?  That seems a little ridiculous to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1776.topic&start=21&stop=32>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1776.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1776.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1776.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1776.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.threadControl?topicID=1776.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1776.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1776.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
