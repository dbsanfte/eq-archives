As far as the names go, there are a lot of really screwed up names out there.  But was he involve in the whole &quot;Master Bater&quot; thing?  Forcing people to change their names cause of new variables is lame.  It would be like forcing Perkins to change his first name, cause there is a dwarf in Thurgadin named Perkins as well. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uestevaneldiabolo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Estevan Eldiabolo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mock turtleneck sweaters<br>hide my bewbs right?</span><br>  Posts: 454<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 6:43:48 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.toolband.com/store/img/dvd_sala.gif width=110 height=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How is our lead GM Aerendar?</span><hr size=1> Aerendar cyb0rz often.

I am Remnant Deimos of the guild Remnants.  I have had a run in with our lead GM Aerandar and I for one do not like him.  For over 2 years my name on our server was Locutos Deimos.  Which per my understanding meant Swarming Panic.  I later found out it didn't but whatever.  Anyway I had petitioned because one of my twinks had been killed and his body had rotted.  Well thats another story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   so the GM say's he couldn't help me with the twinkie issue and he'd have to talk to me about another issue.  My name.  He said my name was based off a character from star trek.  Now being the geek that I am that was not my purpose to be named after a character from star trek who is the personification of evil.  I'm a good druid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The character he was speaking about was Locutus of Borg.  When captain picard was captured by the borg this is the name he took on.  There is a difference between Locutus and Locutos and no way Verant/Sony could be sued by paramount.  I understand completly the reason for a naming policy or ever server would have LukeSkywalker and Homersimpsons on them but this is the worst example of I'm a GM and your rights mean NOTHING.  I tried to explain to him that I had 57 days PLAYED and that my name was my REP.  He didn't care and I continued to ask to reconsider he said no.  I finally decided to take the name of the guild I had founded so long ago and become Remnant Deimos.  After the name change I asked him if there was someone above himself I could talk to.  For some odd reason I've dealt with a MILLION GM's and this is the First one to have a problem with my name!  Locutos Deimos does not even look like Star Trek come on! heh well I continued asking him questions about his reasoning and why he thinks he can get away with this and he threatened to ban me for harassment.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A WARNING OR EVEN A STERN TALKING TO FROM A GM.  This was insane.  I later spoke with the GM of the GM's and he told me if I could prove that Locutos was latin that I could have my name back.  Well wanna hear something funny... LOCUTUS the name from star trek is the latin word I should of taken that one...hehe oh well I digress Aerandar is a Lamer and Karma will get him I'm sure.<br>
Thank you for listening to my ramblings hope to see you in game.<br>

<br>
That is just ignorance on his part, and there is no excuse for it. <br>
<br>
It reminds me of the debacle with the female dark elf cleric named Euthanasia being talked down to in very harsh terms by guides and GMs. She explained that it is not an illegal name according to Verant's name policy, however much they may dissaprove of it, there are countries that consider it legal. And as an evil dark elf cleric, the word was extremely appropriate... The responses she got made no sense at all, but after a while it was realized that the Verant CS rep. believed the word Euthanasia was somehow related to the Holocaust! This was confirmed no just by ONE person, but several of them -- there wasn't a single soul amongst them with enough knowledge to understand what the word ment. <br>
<br>
It's no coincidence that the intellectual effort required to utter the word &quot;I'm sorry, but I can't help you&quot; is about the same as &quot;Would you like fries with that?&quot;<br>

I found out that the Krom Military leg quest was bugged after I turned in the harness. He come's back and tells me that the Broodmother is on &quot;Vacation&quot;. <br>
<br>
So I figure I wait a week and then it should be ok. <br>
<br>
Week later comes and I turn in the harness again, and it thanks me for it....<br>
<br>
I /petition and send them an email. <br>
<br>
I forget to check my email for a few days and happen to /petition again and he responds and gives me the harness again. <br>
/thank<br>
/bow<br>
/junk like that<br>
He tells me to wait until I see a patch message about the BM being fixed. Ok no problem. I can dig that. <br>
<br>
I check my email and see one back from him telling me that I was SOL for the harness because he &quot;warned&quot; me not to do the quest after he gave me back the harness the 1st time. <br>
<br>
After about a 10 min talk with him I found out 1 thing. <br>
&quot;Vacation&quot; in gm babble talk means, Quest bugged. Do not try to complete the quest until you see a patch message relating to (insert quest name here). <br>

He is a child who has no customer service experience and enjoy's ruining the gamelife of those under his supervision.  Yes I refer to the game as Gamelife because I've dumped almost 90 days of my exsistance tring to level and camp items.  That is a LONG TIME!  I am in no way or form complaining about my time given as I have loved most of it because of the AWESOME people I have meet and become the closest of friends with.

&quot;ME NINJZ U L33T&quot; idiots...  Anyway...Aerandar can rest assured I will make other characters and they will be much less easier for him to take their names because I will have tons of evidence that it has nothing to do with such and such that can sue Verant/Sony.  And I also know now who to complain to about him :P  <br>

My ISP hires their customer service staff from the local insane asylum I think.  I know more about their systems than they do.<br>

Something the Trickster I think was his/her name. It was about 3 weeks ago when I was on my alt at the Sanark Fort in Lake of Ill Omen. Gave us some GM booze and Gnome Sandwiches. /yum<br>
<br>
The gnome that was with us freaked out. Kept jumping off the side of the fort till we stopped eating the Gnomewiches. <br>
He stopped jumping after a few of the local mobs took him and made him their bitch. /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=714.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=714.topic&start=41&stop=54>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=714.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=714.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=714.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=714.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=714.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=714.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
