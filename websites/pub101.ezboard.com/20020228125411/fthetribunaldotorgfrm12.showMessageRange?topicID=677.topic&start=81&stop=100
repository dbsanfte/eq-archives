<br>
If someone gave it to me and I didn't know it was yours and and you came up and started yelling and threatening me, you can bet half your dick that you'd be picking your teeth out of your shit for a week.<br>
<br>
If he did know, or even suspected, and didn't give it back well fuck him and I'd be right there with you burning his thieving ass, but I've seen nothing posted by anyone that shows that was the case. Nothing. Evidently someone has it logged, so fucking have them post it and show the world what a tard I am. Your namecalling sure as hell won't. lol<br>
<br>
You think you're in a guild with angels or something don't you. Well here's a nugget for you, you're not. I can't speak for the comps but I'm sure its the same as EV, and if you knew *half* the shit that goes on with shit getting sold/given out of guild, ebayed, etc. you wouldn't be able to type /guildr fast enough if you're as confused about things as you seem to be. Comps members are just too superhuman to do that right? Yeah, keep deluding yourself. Some people are going to do that shit, so how hard is it to give the guy a chance before you go off like a fucking Springer trailerpark bitch. I've never heard of the guy in my life, and chances are the people that first talked to him didn't either before this, which is all the more reason to ask if he knew where it came from and then make a decision, instead of playing my electrons are cooler than yours and just start screaming and expecting to cow him. <br>

Serious question.  Her whole response was one big kiss ass.  If i got into the companions and they gave me 300k in loot, i'd give it back if they wanted it.  Suuuuurrrre.  Coming from someone who hasn't seen 300k in their entire EQ career and could only dream of getting in a guild as capable as the Comps.  So please Krickett, as much as we love your amazingly educated opinion, stfu.  Go post on threads about incest in Hickville, Alabama, you might be a little more of an expert in that category.<br>
<br>
My opinion on Guild loot is it's a pain in the ass.  most the time, when guilds give out droppables, they are pretty much ready to take it in the ass if said person leaves the game.  And guild loot being given out by the player just pisses the guild off.  Custom is, you give it back to guild and let guild dispense it as they see fit.  How many people follow that custom...not many.  Hell, EV is missing God knows how many Trak BP's and even an SoD from jack ass's leaving the game and handing out their shit to their friends.  My advice....don't give jo shithole who was PL'd to 60 any droppable loot, cuz guess what, he's gonna stretch your rectum.  <br>
<br>
These 2 are obviously involved in some kind of scam, and i give sashanna props for logging the whole conversation.  Definitely incriminating.  So, i see either of these 2 applying for membership, fat fuck no from me.  Go fuck someone else over for guild loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujasmeralia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jasmeralia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Finally planar, FFS!<br>[Pickup P00ns]</span><br>  Posts: 1043<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 6:26:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.circleofpride.com/members/jasmer/jas_buffed.jpg height=110 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is pretty sad</span><hr size=1> Works for me, toss 'em both up there.<br>

The innocent bystander label on Nexxon is total B.S.  He's been there before, he knows how the game works.  The funny part is that Xebantiz, attempting to clear his buddy's name, has actually condemned him by giving up too much information.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Telymon is insane and within a week of coming back he had quit again, Nexxon received the gear back.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
According to this account, Nexxon was the last person to have posession of the items before they disappeared.<br>
<br>
Once again trying to defend his friend, Xebantiz has done the opposite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So he goes on a crusade of breaking into his friends accounts and *reclaiming* his old gear which he had given away (he always tried to get his older gear off my accounts too but I never let anyone know my info so I'm the only one who avoided this mess).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And finally the coup de grace.  Nexxon never gives anything back, but has lost it in past occurences because his friend breaks into the account.<br>

I now see why Nexxon is such a good friend of Tely. Of course those two are going to get along together. Couple of ass hairs.<br>
<br>
However, I am not to sure I am going to put either of them on the list right now. This is not direct scamming/stealing. If I put them up there, then there will be a precedent that I don’t want.<br>
<br>
They are both pieces of shit. And I have thought about putting them up there many many times this week, wondering how I would spin it &amp; justify it. But I doubt I will do it, unless something else comes to light or someone makes a hell of an argument.<br>
<br>
I think his rep is already pretty much screwed anyway, except with his own guildmates that is. Fucking lieing greedy assmunch. <p><BR>

I'd seen him ooc that he was LFG for 30 mins or so but ignored it coz we had a full group and no-one was in any hurry to leave. Next thing I see is him standing in front of me at US and I get a tell. Conversation went something like this (I never log shit coz I tend trust people and don't see the need).<br>
<br>
Nexxon: why do you all hate me?<br>
me: wtf? I don't even know you, whats with the hate shit?<br>
Nexxon: you all hate me, I can't get a group here<br>
me: not me and anyway we're a full group<br>
Nexxon: I returned everything to your guild<br>
me: look bud, I don't know what your on about<br>
Nexxon: your guildleader hates me and wants me to quit<br>
me: Temmy?  .. just tell him he's a fat mackem and he'll go away<br>
Nexxon: not him, your guildleader Sashanna<br>
me: whatever, its nothing to do with me<br>
Nexxon: but I returned everything, why don't you believe me<br>
me: look for an officer, I don't know about this<br>
<br>
At this point I ask in guildchat wtf this guy is on about and get given a rundown of events and told that as far as anyone knew nothing had been returned. I was going to ask him why he lied to me about returning everything but he'd logged.<br>

Have all juggled people in the past, and some moreso than others.   If a member leaves one guild for another and refuses to give guild obtained droppables back to their former guild, whatever that guild may be, given the expressed ideals by members and or former members of some of the guilds above, is justice exacted upon them in the same fashion as justice is exacted upon &quot;Level 55 Stranger.&quot;  Just curious.

This feels much different than that, but in reality it really isn't. That is why I don't want to put him on the list. Because I am not going to put people on the list everytime someone leaves a guild without giving back everything.<br>
<br>
This guy just makes me mad though. He fucking lied about it. He crys to every Comp he sees about how they are all out to get him. He knows what he did was wrong &amp; is a complete piece of shit. And he is fucking selling the items in EC!<br>
<br>
But ya know, there is a huge difference between say what Shortman did &amp; what Heratio did. The Elitists lost equipment that should have gone to the guild on both counts. But Heratio I could understand better. Ya know what I mean? Shortman's way is much much lower to me, and it may just be me. I imagine some don't see much of a difference.<br>
<br>
Beened &amp; Pigg gave back all their guild loot before they came. And ya know, I respected them greatly for it. Would we have let them in if they hadn't? Yeah, most likely.<br>
<br>
And yet, if they had gave all of their dropables to some jackass friend to sell in EC, ya bet your ass I would have been flaming them for it though. <p><BR>

<br>
To Xebantiz - Again you are talking about something which you know little to nothing about.  Next time mind your business.<br>
<br>
For one, you don't know me as well as you claim in all your posts.. Maybe you would if you left your house for once and stopped playing EverQuest.  Mentally unstable?  Maybe, maybe not.  This game sure makes me mentally unstable.<br>
<br>
I didn't read this post at all until today when Nexxon told me about it.  I hadn't seen him in a few days as he had been sick so sorry for the delay.<br>
<br>
The truth?  The truth is that Nexxon is not at fault at all here.  The blame is solely on me.  As Sinogue so harshly put it, I have trouble controlling myself in this game.  It is a bad influence on me and I make irrational decisions.  This is why I don't have EQ on my computer anymore and I never will.  A game where people take things so seriously is not a game at all. People can scream and shout &quot;It's only a game&quot; but when you have put the amount of time in that we have, others would call you crazy.<br>
<br>
The items I received should have gone back to the guild.  The way i saw it at the time, I had spent more time than most people would call sane earning them, and I deserved to do as I pleased.  Now that I look back, others spent time getting me those items too.  What can I do now?  Sit back and enjoy the flames that are coming.  Am I sorry for what I did?  Yes.  Is my excuse poor?  Yes.  Do I care anymore?  Hell no.  I have made the mistake and there's no going back.  I'm not going to look back at this anymore because there's something called LIFE that I have to attend to that has been put on the backburner for too long.<br>
<br>
DO NOT put this on Nexxon.  He has done nothing wrong.  My lies have hurt him and he knows I am sorry for even bringing him into this.  I cared only about myself and the punishment needs to be solely mine.  All who read this now know the truth, and if you choose to put this on Nexxon, then it is not justified.  Sorry to my old friends, you may not be able to forgive me now.  Maybe you will in time.<br>

Today I decided to start playing eq again since my schedule was a lot more leniant than it has been in the past 3 months. I logged on this morning to find damn near all of my droppable items gone, including even my food and drink and 3 out of 4 of my tink bags. Luckily, none of the no drop items were destroyed or anything like that. Lets just say I had a hunch who it was, and they weren't smart enough to change their password so I was able to recover the majority of the items. However, I couldn't find the mask of tinkerers that the guild gave me. I know this person in real life and I have already confronted them on this and they told me that they sold the mask. So basically there's nothing I can do now. This was all over a fight that we had and we hadn't been talking over the past few weeks and I guess he did it somewhere in that time period. I don't know what to say other than that I take full responsibility for this and I'm sorry. I'm really at a loss for words. I want to thank mando for helping me get back on my feet with some of the smaller items that I couldn't get back. Hopefully you guys can forgive me

Ladida - Nexxon is getting shit on because of my actions.. Pure and simple.. You still know nothing of this situation nor is it any of your business.  This is to let the Companions know who the shit head was that fucked them over.  Yes, it was me.  And if I could go back I would fix things.  But it's too late, so I have to move on.  And so do you.

Look genius, your actions obviously are what started all of this. But Nexxon is being shit on for the things he did, that he knows he shouldn't have done. <br>
<br>
I know you want to take the full blame here because he is your little ass buddy or whatever &amp; it could mean jack shit to you since ya don't play the game anymore. But he has just as much moral direction as you.<br>
<br>
You are both fuckups. <p><BR>
