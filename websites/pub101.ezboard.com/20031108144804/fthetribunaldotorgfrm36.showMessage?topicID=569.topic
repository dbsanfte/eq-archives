As US officers in the field have discovered, the defenders of Saddam's regime are using all means at their disposal, no matter how low-tech, to repel the US forces. In the fighting around Najaf last week, US commanders were shocked to encounter a well-orchestrated barrage of small arms and machinegun fire fire that greeted an attack against the Republican Guard's Medina Division on Sunday night by V Corps' 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment. It was described as a 'hornets' nest of fire' that saw one Apache shot down and 33 others so badly damaged that only seven were considered battle-worthy on returning to their base. The Iraqis had been tipped off ... by a network of observers armed with mobile phones. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When small arms fire damages 33 Apaches that bad... I dunno. That can't be as planned.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The failures in military strategy have already cost the US dearly in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">unnecessary</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> casualties, wrecked vehicles and a lowering of morale. This also has a physical effect on the ability to move supplies, leaving, say a number of credible reports, some units with only enough rations for one </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's what pisses me off - it was unnecessary if we had gone in with an appropriate size force.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Inside the Pentagon, officials reported heated debate over the wisdom of surging towards Baghdad with long supply lines and a rearguard vulnerable to ambush and attack. <br>
<br>
The Pentagon debate is between followers of Secretary of State Colin Powell - who was Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff and the professional soldier's hero and who advocated 'overwhelming force' from the outset, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, whose vision of warfare stresses the use of high-technology air power and use of special forces as part of a more political - less militarily traditional - game plan.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
WTF doesn't this surprise me? Powell has always been level headed and methodical... Rumsfeld is a shock jock who likes to play cowboy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is a position that Rumsfeld also took against his chief commander in the field - General Tommy Franks - and won. When Franks was originally asked to draw up a plan for an invasion of Iraq, in the spring of last year, he produced an outline requiring some 400,000 troops. An angry Rumsfeld sent it back three times, on each occasion asking for a cut in the number of soldiers needed for the job, so that, at the outset of war, Franks had seen his forces reduced to just over 250,000. <br>
<br>
Now Franks, it seems, is in the dri ving seat, not Rumsfeld. Last week he called for an additional 100,000 soldiers for the operation. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
About fuckin time. I would like to see the administration get rid of this prick. If this is his mess (and it appears it is) his bullshit cost the lives of many soldiers who otherwise might have come home from this war.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>These tensions are at the heart of the problems dogging the campaign. It is Rumsfeld and his team of political appointees who favour a continued push north, accompanied by intensified air strikes. <br>
<br>
This runs against the counsel of most battlefield commanders, who have been arguing for a pause and consolidation in the south. And it is Rumsfeld who is arguing for a swift encirclement and siege of Baghdad. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Gee, I wonder who should have the final say - some guy who is safe at home and already shown he can't accurately read the situation or the men on the ground who are fighting this war and see what the real picture is.<br>
<br>
This stuff really gets to me. It's people's lives we are gambling with. Maybe Rumsfeld ought to tell the families of the POWs why he only sent in 200k troops and 1/5th the tanks and Bradleys that we had in Desert Storm. And maybe the President ought to step up to the plate and admit responsibility for allowing this mess when the war is over (to do it now would only encourage Iraqi forces to fight harder).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The failure of strategy - and America's potential nightmare - is ultimately that of intelligence; not of the efficacy of US espionage, but a wilful desire by the administration, and Pentagon in particular, to ignore professional intelligence analysis and warnings on all matters relating to the war. <br>
<br>
Last month, the CIA issued a report saying that paramilitary units loyal to Saddam would threaten the rear of an advance on Baghdad. Similar warnings came from the Defence Intelligence Agency inside the Pentagon, during the months leading to war. <br>
<br>
Given their strength in numbers and technological advantages, it still seems certain that the coalition will win the war. What is at issue now is: at what cost to innocent civilians and their own soldiers? The US remains confident of victory, but what price the spoils of war? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Any American who reads this and thinks it is even close to accurate should be outraged imo. Not only has this administration ignored world protest and burned more diplomatic bridges than I care to count to get us into this war based on rosy pictures and wishful thinking, they went in with an inadaquate force and costs the lives of men and women who might have come home from this war otherwise.<br>
<br>
I still fail to se how Bush gets a free pass on the shit he pulls. Maybe he should be named the Teflon President instead.<br>

Its Pretty cool in this drawn out Battle where we are being &quot;defeated&quot; We have managed to agin ground, And at the same time suffer almost no casuelties....But from a tactical stand point I can really see how we are just getting owned......<br>

You know I never skirt the truth.  I looooove the truth.  Matter of fact I was talking to a girl the other day and she said &quot;I'm not angry at you because you are a liberal, I'm not agree at you because you're a foreigner, I'm angry at you because you're a prick!&quot;  It was beautiful.  But I digress.<br>
<br>
I guess I should mention that Russians typically liked Saddam and the residents of Ekaterinburg (former Stalingrad) even expressed an interest in offering Saddam exile.  Residents of 2 northern towns in the Moscow vicinity were surveyed as to whether they would donate money to Saddam's cause.  Between the surveys of these 2 towns (I dont think they surveyed every citizen) they found out that there was almost 86million dollars willing to be donated to the Iraqi cause.  Couple that with the nostalgia that some Russian folk view Saddam's regime because it reminds them of Stalin's regime - and you can see why so many Russians are supporting Saddam.<br>
<br>
But that's not me, I really dont give a shit about his regime, I don't give a shit about Saddam, I'd give him the finger if he asked for money and I'd give him 2 if he asked for exile.<br>
<br>
My support for Iraq stems from a deep seated desire to see self-righteous agressors fall flat on their face.  Aggressors that seek to exploit a weaker nation under the guise of democracy and freedom while in fact riding to a war on the wings of jingoist fascism.  Aggressors that utterly disregard the global organization for solving exactly these kinds of disputes, taking its own independent action like some sort of demented vigilante while preaching to the world that they are right and everyone else is wrong.<br>
<br>
It's a dangerous path that America decided to walk upon, unfortunately there is no turning back.  Clowns like Caledhon, Wenin (my favorite whipping boy, /hug!), Solovey and Arleanna goose marching lock step into the war, purely based on the bullshit that Washington feeds them.  Fuck if I know, maybe they dont even believe in the WMD's but use them to bolster their arguments.  God knows I dont believe in the oil conspiracies, but I'll pull them out and start using them if it fits my agenda.  At any rate, the hawks plunged the country back into the Cold War mentality: &quot;Us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot;, &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;evil&quot;.  It's a tragic repeat of mistakes made in the past 50 years that should have never been allowed to happen.  The world didn't fail U.S. when it vetoed the resolutions, instead Americans failed the world when they elected a leader who would ride personal agenda and grudges made by Rumsfeld, Cheney and Powell from 1988-1992 into the 21st century and act on those grudges and vendettas to settle old scores.<br>

Half a year of half-assed rhetoric games between the hawks and the doves on this forum is enough.  I'll come out right now and say that anti-war demonstrators are idiots.  You watch them all pump their fists in their trying to rekindle the anti-war movement of the 1960's but they aren't willing to sacrifice anything for it.  They would rather stay at home and wait for the tech guy to come to hook up their DSL line than go out to protest in 40 degree weather.  Aside from that, most of them are intellectual vacuums.  You ask them why they oppose the war and the blank look on their face answers the question well.  It's like watching jay Leno asking a blonde on Sunset Blvd. as to who is the current vice president.

First it was Cheney for his scary world domination plans that he shared with Wolfowitz and the now neutered Perle. Then it was Bush for his cowboy tactics on Iraq. Then it was Powell for his mindless transition to the dark side. Then it was Bush again for going through with the actions he had spoken of for 14 months straight. Then it was nobody for a couple days as people lied and said they'd support our commander in chief and our troops since the war was on. Then it was Tommy Franks for not briefing reporters enough while he was running a war. Now it's Rumsfeld cause generals who have no idea WTF is going on have concerns and theories about what happened and shit.<br>

Who is up? Which poor Washington straw will be grasped at next? Rice? Fleischer? We're running out of hawks. Frankly, I'm worried. What will you people do when there are no more targets?

I find it funny yet sad, because if he was in any of our &quot;enemy&quot; countries,  he couldn't make his stand against the resident country.  He's a coward.  I doubt he is anything nearly as this prickish with strangers that may be able to find out where he lives.

But then that isn't really about cowardice, that's just him not being stupid.  It would however show his lack of conviction.<br>
<br>
See there was a guy where I worked that was all into these conspiracy theories.  The difference between him and Merton was that his conviction was stronger than his level of common sense.  The guy couldn't keep his mouth shut. He would just keep at his anti-government conspiracy theories.  Well that dumb, but strong willed fuck is without a job right now.<br>
