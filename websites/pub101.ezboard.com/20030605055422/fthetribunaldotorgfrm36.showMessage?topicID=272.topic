<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Total Information Awareness</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Saturday, November 16, 2002; Page A20 <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A61653-2002Nov15?language=printer">www.washingtonpost.com/ac...ge=printer</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
ANYONE WHO deliberately set out to invent a government program with the specific aim of terrifying the Orwell-reading public could hardly have improved on the Information Awareness Office.<br>
<br>
Tucked away in the outer reaches of the Defense Department, brandishing an eerie and cryptic logo -- an all-seeing eye atop a pyramid and the slogan &quot;Scientia Est Potentia&quot; (&quot;Knowledge Is Power&quot;) -- the office is headed by retired Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, the Reagan administration official who was convicted in the wake of the Iran-contra scandal of five felony counts of lying to Congress, destroying official documents and obstructing the congressional inquiry into the affair. Not surprisingly, there have already been some fast- breathing reactions to recently published information about the office, including allegations that it is funded by the Homeland Security Bill (it isn't) and that Adm. Poindexter has compiled a computer dossier on every American (he hasn't, or not yet).<br>
<br>
In fact, the program is still a research project of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the high-tech innovators who helped create the Internet -- and who claim that this project is equally benign. Among other things, the Information Awareness Office is trying to find ways of better identifying potentially dangerous people by using video cameras and biometrics, and of processing large amounts of data from different sources so as to predict and prevent terrorist attacks (the &quot;Total Information Awareness System&quot;). Police tracking the Washington sniper suspects might, for example, have caught them more quickly with the help of a computer program that could simultaneously search their motel records, their immigration and police histories, and the traffic violations tied to their Chevrolet Caprice.<br>
<br>
Yet, given both the context and the content of the program, DARPA should hardly have been surprised by the bad publicity. For however revolutionary and innovative it may be, this is not neutral technology, and the potential for abuse is enormous. If information that once took five people a week to find will now take one person 15 minutes to find, then instant -- and instantly updatable -- computer dossiers on everyone really do cease to be science fiction. If computers can learn to identify a person through a video camera, then constant surveillance of society becomes possible, too. Because the legal system designed to protect privacy has yet to catch up with this technology, Congress needs to take a direct interest in this project, and the defense secretary should appoint an outside committee to oversee it before it proceeds. Privacy concerns need to be built into the technology from the beginning -- if the public decides, after being fully acquainted with the possibilities, that it is to be built at all.<br>
<br>
Finally, everyone involved might also want to consider whether Adm. Poindexter is the best person to direct this extremely sensitive project. Though his criminal convictions were overturned on appeal, his record of lying to Congress hardly makes him an ideal protector of the legal system, and his conduct of Iran-contra hardly makes him an advertisement for government competence. Even his choice of logo calls into question his tact and taste. Adm. Poindexter's presence on this project, the lack of clear public information about it and the absence of any real oversight already indicate a serious lapse of judgment.<br>

There used to be a list abstracts for projects the IAO was pitching, including some pretty instructive structural diagrams. Those have been gone for about a month and a half or so. Maybe they can still be found in google archives. Incidentally, I just found a pdf of Orwell's "1984" novel lately that I am avidly rereading. Best of luck comrades.<br>

Just a few points IMHO:<br>
<br>
- it will stop a couple of dumb terrorist who couldn't figure out that buying their chemicals from HomeDepot with a credit card was a bad idea. The rest of the organised crime that poses a real threat will very quickly figure out how to work around this, since it's pretty easy. In other words, the return on investment is potentially very minimal.<br>
<br>
- this is the perfect tool for complete political control of the population. The data mining capability of this is going to be unmatched, enabling whoever can get access to it, to target any kind of message (political or possibly commercial if that information were to ever spill over into corporate hands) with a profiled accuracy that focus groups are not even dreaming of.<br>
<br>
- add to the list the usual "racial profiling" or "anything profiling" arguments.<br>
<br>
- it is also a very dangerous economic tool that could enable financial institutions (the FRS for instance) to take advantage of spending information to fix stock markets (like they it's not bad enough already heh)<br>
<br>
- it is a complete violation of your privacy (remember that they plan to tap e-mail and every communication means)<br>
<br>
- there is absolutely no guarantee that this database or some spin-off will never make its way into corporate concerns (ask the FBI about their "safe" databases leaks...). <br>
<br>
- and more importantly : there is a grand total of zero legal accountability. <br>
<br>
That's just on top of my head. I am sure I can find some other more creative ways to abuse this. Just like Pandora's box, or the A-bomb : once you've opened it, you can't close it back. Again, IMHO, I would rather not have to give away the last shreds of my privacy in exchange of a very superficial feeling of security. The budget of these projects would probably be far better invested trying to solve problems at their root : woking on the wealth and development inequities that foster the threat in the first place. <br>

  The government is totally benign, isn't it?  When you give them total control over everything, they never turn into naughty dictatorships, so we really don't have anything to worry about.

  Perhaps King George won't enact a dictatorship this term, but if you let things like this keep happening, what's to stop it?  I mean seriously, 50 years down the road, if we let this trend continue, what's to stop someone form turning the U.S. into a Soviet Union or Nazi germany or (praise Pat Robertson) an Afghanistan?

Hmm, that sounds like a huge paranoid leap from what this is. I like how you assume what I think though, that's always a good thing to do.

I don't think it's that great of an idea, because like shehbahn alluded to earlier, I don't think terrorists are going to walk into Kmart and use a credit card =) I am not behind this plan, I would rather do without any government intervention on any level. I think we should put military troops on the borders and just shoot anyone invading our country. I am sure you left wingers are all against that though. <br>
<br>
I think sheh made some valid points (and we never agree), and I think that you, lonagan, went off half cocked with wild assumptions and paranoid dellusions. You and Grozzer took what I said to mean &quot;I am behind this 100%&quot;, which is not true. I voiced concerns about it, but honestly, I don't see it making that much of a difference either way.<br>
<br>
In the end, when you think about it, I would rather not have it, simply because it increases the size and scope of government, and that is never a good thing. I find it ironic, though, that you ultra lefties, who always think that government is the answer to everything, would be against this.<br>
<br>
I don't think any of you honestly answered my question though (lonagan and Grozzer too busy trying to call me names, make stupid assumptions, ect..).  Do you honestly think that if the government wanted to &quot;get&quot; you, they would not be able to do so now? How does this add to that? (try not to make paranoid dellusional leaps and wild assumptions about what I think). Also, what would you do as a prevention measure against future terrorist attacks? (again, stick to reality)<br>

I'm not attacking you personally.  While I doubt I would agree with you on much of anything politically, I have no desire to call you names, and to the best of my recollection, I did not ever call you a &quot;name.&quot;<br>
<br>
  But I do not think I'm going off half cocked.  If they can put cameras on street corners, why can't they put them in our homes?  If they can record our telephone conversations, why can't they record us at other times?  Sure my examples are extreme, but the surest way to get to such an extreme state is to say &quot;well I'm not doing anything wrong, why defend my rights?&quot;<br>
<br>
  If we allow the government a further step toward an &quot;all seeing eye&quot;, to draw reference form the office's logo, what makes you so sure the government will not seek to actually have an all seeing eye, that reaches into our homes, our bedrooms, and every nook and cranny of our lives?<br>
<br>
  I mean you did say that if you're not doing anything wrong, you shouldn't have anything to be afraid of.  So, if I'm the police and want to just walk into your house without a warrent, what can you say to me?  <br>
<br>
  The government cannot just come up one day and put a camera in your living room.  That would rather extreme, and people would not allow it.  But if we slowly allow the government to encroach on our lives and relinquish bit by bit of our liberties, eventually it's not so far fetched.<br>
<br>
  And the terrorism angle is an interesting one.  What, I would ask, do they want?  Well, judging form the name, I would assume they want to terrorize us.  Aren't we acting just a little terrorized if we just jump up and start giving away our liberties blindly?  Why feed into what they would have us do?  Playing the terrorist card is getting about as legitimate as playing the red card in the fifties.  And yeah, I think we do shoot people who invade our country, and rightly ought to.  But are you suggesting that all American citizens are foreign invaders?  If you want to say that defending our rights as Americans amounts to wanting terrorists to have all the freedoms they can, then why have ANY rights at all?  hey, our whole constittution gives protections to terrorists (as well the other 99.9% of society), why not just get that dusty old paper out of the way so we can catch more teorrorists?<br>
<br>
  Pick your cliche- The slippery slope, or Good intentions pave the road to hell, either applies.  This may seem benign, but it can very well lay the foundation for something far worse that we will have much less power to stop if we allow things like this to continue.  Do I think that tomorrow Adolf Bush is going to send brownshirts jackstepping down my street?  No, that's a little irrational.  Do I think that 50 years form now I could be a grey heaired prole sitting in a dingy bar dimly recalling what &quot;freedom&quot; was?  Well, I should certainly hope not, but the chance exists and if I do not want to be in that situation, the best way to prevent it is to stand opposed to the things that will allow that to happen. <p>  Kazak- 57 Troll Warrior.<br>

<br>
Well - no, until recently they couldn't *legally* do so, as being a citizen gave you a certain amount of rights, one of them being the privacy of your home. In other words, the government had to respect the sanctity of your possessions and needed things like warrants and court orders to invade your privacy (with wire taps, searches...). The difference now is that none of this will be required anymore, all the IAO has to say is &quot;terrorism suspect&quot;. The accountability element has also been shredded in the sake of not impeding on investigations. In other words : your most basic citizen's right to fair trial, legal representation (lawyer), privacy and a couple of others have been tossed down the can as soon as you are a &quot;presumed terrorist&quot;. Nevermind foreign nationals, whose detention is not even made public. <br>
<br>
Now let's take a small leap of imagination... How far a stretch is it going to be until any political party (say... the greens ?) becomes &quot;terrorists&quot; ? Well... check this little story out : <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2002/10/9225.php">victoria.indymedia.org/ne...0/9225.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  The first step of segregation is tabulation. Ask the jews what they thought of the Hollerith machines contributed by IBM to the Reich back in the days... <br>
<br>
I am indeed very worried when I see all those most basics tenets of free democacry being completely tossed out the window and the public actually marching right in line without a protest for fear of being labeled &quot;anti-american&quot; or &quot;unpatriotic&quot;. A secretive government is -never- one working in the best interest of its people.<br>

That's the whole point : all your citizen's right are stripped the moment you are *suspected* (not even convicted !) of terrorism with this lovely piece of new legislation. <br>

You will never win &quot;TWAT&quot; with guns or more policing. All that will buy you is the illusion of safety (and some profitable Halliburton stock options).<br>
