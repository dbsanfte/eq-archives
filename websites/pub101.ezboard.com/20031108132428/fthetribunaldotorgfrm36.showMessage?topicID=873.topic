<br>
This may take a paragraph or two to set up, so bear with me.<br>
<br>
In my experience, Liberalism and Conservatism can apply to two different aspects of our lives.  One is economics and the other one is social issues.  Ever since I have been interested in politics, I have seen the Democratic party push for more goverment spending on social programs.  At the same time, the Democratic party has maintained a partnership with organizations like the ACLU.<br>
<br>
At face value, these partnerships seem to make a lot of sense.  The ACLU likes to protect the rights of the &quot;little people&quot;, and the Democrats like to spend money on goverment programs to help the &quot;little people&quot;.  But these two organizations are actually working against one another.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to how much economics can affect social policy and vice-versa.  What happens when the ecomonic policies swing too far to the left (Socialism)?  Since the goverment becomes the driving force in the economy, the government has a much greater influence on social issues like free speech.  The works against the ACLU.<br>
<br>
In fact, pushing for more liberal social policies while at the same time pushing for bigger government makes no sense at all.  Larger government = less social freedom.  More social freedom = smaller government.<br>
<br>
If you accept these arguments, then you have to ask yourself what are the Democrats really trying to accomplish?  I don't know.  I don't think they know.  Does anybody know? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 684<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/03 2:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=873.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Self Defeating Liberalism?</span><hr size=1> I know &lt;raises hand&gt;.<br>

They don't care if it sounds self-defeating to rational self sufficient people, because they don't play to rational self sufficient people. If they can convince you that you're being victimized in some way, they can convince you that its the fault of Republican politics and that they, the lofty-minded Democrats, can fix it for you.<br>
<br>
Case in point would be Hillary, when interviewed while theoretically attending the 9/11 commemoration, continuing the Democratic fuss about how the Big Meanie Bush's Boys &quot;lied&quot; about the air quality in NYC after two aircraft chock full of JetA crashed and two of the worlds biggest office buildings collapsed. Rational self-sufficient people in that situation (expertly deducing from the cubic miles of smoke and piles of debris) realize this will tend to make the air full of Bad Shit, but that it's most likely nothing that's going to make them keel over next week. A report comes out saying &quot;yes the air is full of Bad Shit, but it's most likely not going to make anyone keel over in the next week&quot; and the Dems start pointing fingers and trying to make more victims.<br>
<br>
Create victims. Convice them that you're their savior. The Democratic way. <br>

Before Reagan would publicly discuss AIDS, 25,000 people in the US had died from it. The reason - he did not want to be seen as supporting research into a disease that only effected gays.<br>
<br>
Though the CDC and other health organization tried to get the national blood supply tested, it took 4 years of lobbying and hundreds of confirmed cases where transfusion was the infection method before they would spend the 100 million needed to begin testing.<br>
<br>
By that time 28,000 Hemophiliacs and surgical patients had received AIDS tainted blood.<br>
<br>
The reason - the republican controlled government did not want go against the big business of Blood Banks.<br>
<br>
That is one of the best cases of victimization that I know of.<br>
<br>
I pretty much agree with what Ed Koch, the former mayor of NYC said yesterday. Liberals believe in lending a helping hand, while conservatives expect everyone to make it on their own.<br>
<br>
The choice seems pretty clear on the social side of the coin - either you believe in social responsibility or you believe in social isolationism. It's either the all for one and one for all philosophy or the survival of the fittest philosophy.<br>
<br>
That is boiling it down to the very basics, but when you hit the bottom line, that's how it looks to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=diamondeyesp>DiamondeyeSP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/03 1:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=873.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Self Defeating Liberalism?</span><hr size=1> False dilemma logical falacy.<br>

While it's tempting to fall into Coulter/Limbaugh territory with the &quot;liberals buying votes&quot; schtick (and I think it does apply to *some*, but hardly all or even most Democrats/liberals), I'm a conservative on such issues now not because I think that we need to have a purely capitalistic society with absolutely no safety nets etc., but because I think we've progressed far enough in that direction (and too far, in some cases, of course).  For example, government unemployment is definitely a good thing, in many cases.  Welfare is another matter, but it's simply political reality that it's never going to go away, so we just need to find out how best to apply/reform it to better accomplish its goals.  This is where the political scientists, bureaucratic administrators, etc. come in.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think that while you are mostly right, Kreese, you overestimate the independence of the ACLU.  You make it sound as if they were more libertarian, while the sad reality is that they toe the Democratic party line far more often than not.<br>
<br>
Not to hijack the thread or anything, but here's another little &quot;paradox&quot; that I've been thinking about.  It's all the rage nowadays to be &quot;socially liberal and fiscally conservative&quot; (/wave Loegan, Tuwene, Ah-nuld, etc.)  It makes no sense to me.  Assuming by socially liberal you mean supportive of things like universal health care, broad welfare coverage, etc., how can you be socially liberal, i.e. supportive of massive (read: expensive) government programs, while advocating a restriction of government spending? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3942<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/03 4:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=873.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Self Defeating Liberalism?</span><hr size=1> Being socially liberal and fiscally conservative means that instead of cutting programs, you cut waste. For instance, instead of eliminating the food stamp program, you lower the overhead and track down fraud. Maine recently switched to a card (just like a credit card) for FS, which will reduce alot of the fraud (people trading FS for cash) and lowers the overhead of printing them up and mailing them every month.<br>
<br>
Being fiscally conservative to me means that you look to get the most bang out of every buck government spends. Of course that may not be the party view, since I am an odd democrat. I am pro gun, pro military, pro law enforcement (meaning pro on laws that enable LEOs to do their job, not overly concerned with privacy rights, pro death penalty and favor stiff prison sentences that match the crime, especially violent crime).<br>
<br>
I am also no fan of the ACLU as some of the stances they have taken the past few years seems ridiculous to me. I believe they were very good in the past, but they have changed imo.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW<br>
<br>
Here in Maine, alot of republicans share my views. Alot of people wouldn't consider a Maine republican to be a real republican (though we do have a few right wingers of course).

<br>
you misread my liberalism.  I don't support welfare, I hate homeless people and would like to see them all sent off to the California berry-picking fields so they can be productive at $5/hr and we can send all the illegal immigrants home at gunpoint.<br>
<br>
Don't make the mistake of my serious dislike for the current administration to mean that I'm a tree-hugging liberal; quite the contrary, if you made me choose between Ralph Nader and George Bush, I'd probably just go ahead and move to Canada.<br>
<br>
I'm moderate - middle of the road.  I support the death penalty and a women's right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy.  I actually believe in national healthcare, but only to the degree of government regulation of the healthcare industry - not healthcare for everyone using general tax dollars.  I believe money should be spent QUITE LIBERALLY on schools, because it's an investment in the future of the economy... but this is probably the only major area where you'll hear me talking about tax money being handed out to everyone in large volume.<br>
<br>
I also believe in corporate responsibility - namely, massive penalties for getting caught enronning, and some decent government controls in place.  I do also think that we need fairly tight environmental restrictions - nothing tree-hugging, but also not allowing ACME Chemical, inc. to dump whatever is spewing from inside their factories just because the government doesn't want to be seen as hurting business.<br>
<br>
Bill Clinton's politics were fairly in-line with where I stand in many ways.  Handouts to the poor (welfare) are not something I believe in AT ALL - I'm ok with spending money on the poor, but only in the form of social programs (even things like the WPA which simply created jobs, if you can't come up with other ways to help the poor and homeless improve their situation via training, etc).<br>
<br>
Like I've said before, the Bush-II administration's absurd right-wing conservatism (including its god-given arrogance which has infuriated me, Loegan, and the rest of this planet) has polarized me significantly.  I certainly come off as more liberal now, simply because if its a choice between voting for a hippie or a Bush/Ashcroft/Rumsfeld, I'm afraid I may vote for the hippie.  That doesn't mean I agree with their views; but I more strongly oppose those of the current administration.<br>
<br>
Bush Sr., as well as Clinton, were nicely moderate, and I felt comfortable with both in power.  I would have seriously considered voting Dole in '96 (I liked clinton's 2nd term far more than his first) if not for Ralph Reed pushing the right-wing platform onto the republicans, and I think that is what cost Dole the election.  Bush CERTAINLY didn't win on a right-wing platform (the man has been about 1% of what he promised, and about 99% of what we moderates and liberals feared worst), and in the wake of 9/11, conservatism has become en vogue.  <br>
<br>
I'm pretty much sitting back and praying Bush doesn't win again in 2004, even though a liberal like Dean would be as much of a disaster to me (fuck affirmative action...), especially as I've grown older, quite a bit wealthier, and will personally benefit greatly from a fairly conservative or moderate government (financially).  I can't say as I'll vote Democrat in 2004, because if i'm voting for someone who is going to tax the hell out of me to give it to the greens and the bums... well... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maxamaji>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>For the record,<BR>

Maxa, it is a case where a democratic president would have handled the situation far differently because they don't have the sexual hangups the republicans do and thus would not have paid a political price for helping gays.<br>
<br>

<br>
The dems may not have taken on big business on the testing issue any quicker than Reagan did (though I suspect they would have), but I am sure that they would have taken on the funding of AIDS research much faster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=873.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=873.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=873.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=873.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=873.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=873.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=873.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
