I made a sarcastic comment about how only the US has the God given right to own nukes, but I was trying to point out our arrogance.<br>
<br>
See, there are many ways to do things and right now, the US is doing things in a way that causes other countries to see us as arrogant blowhards. Actually, to be more accurate, Bush has done next to nothing so far, but the statements he has made and the way he has conducted himself is so arrogant and condenscending that it doesn't matter if we do anything or not... his attitude is enough to cause global animosity.<br>
<br>
For instance - there is no doubt in my mind that inspectors needed to be reinstated in Iraq. But instead of laying low and letting them do their job, Bush has been beating the war drums and antagonizing Iraq since before he even went to the UN.<br>
<br>
There is also no doubt in my mind that his 'axis of evil' speech did alot of harm, not to mention it was pure rhetoric.<br>
<br>
The US is like a big 6'4, rugged athlete. People won't like him if he swaggers around bragging and threatening people, even if he never follows through on those threats. On the other hand, if he just acts normal and only throws his weight around when the situations calls for it, most people will get along with him. Not everyone mind you, cause there is always the people who are jealous of the big guy, but most will get along.<br>
<br>
<br>
Truth be known, I have very few complaints about the things Bush has actually<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>done</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> regarding foreign affairs. It's the things he says and the threats he makes that irritates the fuck outta me (and our allies, enemies and indifferents). He is about as diplomatic as coked up baboon. <br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe Bush should consider the old saying - speak softly but carry a big stick. I think many of our current foreign problems can be attributed to Bush's attitude and rhetoric.<br>

I just don't believe that we can do anything that will shake this &quot;americans are arrogant&quot; stigma that has been tagged to us for longer than even Clinton was President.  I didn't really become interested in international affairs until I was introduced to the Internet, and IIRC chat rooms.  Almost from day one, I've been hearing about American arrogance.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, as long as we are that big 6'4'' line backer from New Jersey, there will always be an over-whelming voice of how arrogant we are. Fuck'm.<br>
<br>
Stuff is getting done, that's all I care about.  Inspectors are finally back in Iraq, doing what they should have been allowed to do 11 years ago.<br>
<br>
What country can't be accused of being arrogant?  Closest one I can think of is perhaps Jamacia, cause they just don't give a shit. =) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
There are few concerns that the US has in regards to North Korea.<br>
<br>
- They don't invade South Korea<br>
- They don't build nukes, in order to invade South Korea, or attack someone else with long range missiles.<br>
- They don't build nukes, and then sell them or loose them on the open market.<br>

What's to lose?  And with modern &quot;enlightened&quot; attitudes, even if they commit an act of aggression, they'll probably still be getting shipments of food from Europe, or somewhere else, even though it is those shipments which enable them to both feed their people and pay for their nuclear research, army, etc...<br>

IMO, we need to cut them off completely.  Even the most evil and corrupt government can't starve its own population for too long, or they won't have much of a population left to govern... or they'll have a revolt on their hands.  One can only hope.<br>

Alleluja ! The annoying part of the bargain, is that Kim Jong knows precisely that the odds of his country ever being unilaterally nuked are slim to none. However, just like most dictators (and certain presidents select) in history, he is riding the xenophobic fear train and using the argument to bolster his grip on his own population.<br>
<br>
So you can either :<br>
- rattle your sabers and issue threats and manichean rhetoric (next time I hear the word evil, i am ducking for my silver cross and wooden stakes...) and play in his game<br>
- undermine his credibility by driving home the values of peaceful democracy and diplomacy by example (and as a side benefit sow the seeds of future commerce with those not so innocent generous food donnations)<br>
<br>
What drove down the Berlin Wall was not the cry for democratic freedom from the population : it was the demand for the right to shopping !<br>

I assume you meean for the numbers of troops and artillery that N Korea has - I got the numbers from one of the retired military Colonels on Fox News (I bounce between Fox and MSNBC to get both the right and left views). I want to say his name is Buck something... I forget. Even though he is on the right wing network I like him alot and think he states the facts as they are.<br>
<br>
I don't have a site, but I am sure of the numbers on troops (1.2 million) and artillery (or they may have called them tubes or some such, but same diff) 11,000.<br>
<br>
Actually I tend to listen to the military/ex-military types much more than politicians. I think they present things without spin -most- of the time and have much more credibility than politicians.<br>
<br>
MSNBC has alot of ex-Generals consulting for them and Fox has this Colonel Buck something for the most part.<br>
<br>
**EDIT**<br>
<br>
Fox has another ex-military consultant that I just remembered. Guy has dark hair and glasses and was a marine if I remember right. Young guy. Anyway, he and Buck tend to present the majority of military info on Fox. <p><br>

Loegan's last reply to Cal had me realize something as well.  Problem with cutting supplies to a country, so that their people will starve and then apparently revolt.  Well how long do you think a revolution will last when done by starving people?<br>
<br>
I'm at a loss as to how things should be handled with North Korea.  Lining them up after we're done with Iraq would just be to much &quot;conquest&quot; going on.<br>
<br>
Hrms... but.... if no military action is needed in Iraq... it would kinda open that option for North Korea.  But military action against Korea would suck LOL.  It has two borders, South Korea, and China.  Yeah like we'll get support from China... LOL.  South Korea, naw... North Korea has been setting up for the past 50 years to steam roll into South Korea.  If we did any large scale build up, they'd invade most likely.<br>
<br>
Air campaign from Japan, and Russia would be an interesting venture.<br>
<br>
But anyhow, guess we'll see what the diplomats can get done, but then they were apparently &quot;done&quot; back in 1995~ right?  Negoitating with those that negoitate in bad faith isn't a solution.<br>

North Korea having Nukes isn't just South Korea's problem.  It's a WORLD problem.  We have enough problems with Russia having lost some of their stockpile.<br>
<br>
Let's look past their intential use against another country.<br>
<br>
Do you trust the government of North Korea enough to not sell nukes?<br>
<br>
Do you trust the government of North Korea to keep their nukes secure?<br>
<br>
We are talking about an impoverished country.  Just how far will they go to gain what they want?  Well apparently, they're willing to build a nuclear arsenal to get the international community to give them more free aid.<br>

Korea can take care of itself.  Look at the numbers that I posted... their army is bigger, better funded, and has had the benefit of U.S. training and equipment.  About the only danger South Korea is in comes from rockets etc. from North Korea... lots of civilians would die, instability etc... but imo South Korea would win.  With the current South Korean stance, however, I am also strongly inclined to just leave them be and deal with their problems on their own...<br>
<br>
The problem, of course, is that North Korea is getting nukes.  That makes the problem larger than the specific region.<br>
<br>
As for my numbers, I got them from a column by John Derbyshire where he says basically the same thing that I just did, only much better of course.  I don't know where he got them.  I'll go look around and check though.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Ok, did some more looking around... <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/crs/94-311s.htm">Look here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for a veerry thorough analysis from 1994, but probably still fairly accurate.

Korea is just that.  To make sure the N. Koreans stay put.  They might consider JUST attacking the south, but as long as US troops are in the way, they would have to kill American's to do it.  Even the positioning of our bases support this.  They are all to far north.  Every war plan practice I participated involved every US unit loading up on ammo and hauling ass south to a rally point as fast as possible.  Course the idea of haveing US bases AT those southern rally points seems to have not been thought of.  The most extreme case the unit I was assigned to when I was there.  I was in light infantry battallion.  We(and they still are) stationed barely 2-3 miles from the DMZ.  In range of a huge amount of N Korean artillary (which has had 50 years to plot thier targets.)  During an alert we had 2 hours to get loaded up and moveing.  Considering we were less than a 5 minute drive from N. Korea, I did not put much hope on our ability to pull this off.  The joke on base was, when war was started, all we would see was a big long line of tanks rolling by, a jeep at the end would stop, put a 'POW' sign outside our gate and the security gaurds would simply face the other way. (Oh I forgot to mention we were on the north bank of a major river.  Our primary crossing was a one lane bridge that was permenently rigged to blow and the South Koreans had the trigger, the secondary and only other crossing point was actually further north and except for being 2 lane was just like the primary)<br>
<br>
Kim Il Jong IS certifibly insane(Extreme meglamania).  He is also rumored that the N Korean military is less than impressed by him.  It is an open question whether Kim or the army is running things in N Korea.  As to the food problem, the emphasis on military spending has made things worse but they have also had a a bad combination of not enough rain in one part of the year and too much in the other for about 6 years now.  They would have needed help no matter what form of government was in charge.  Just not as MUCH help.<br>
<br>
A war in korea today would be ugly.  There is a reason the war fell into such a bloody stalemate after the first year.  The korean penninsula is from top to bottom one piece of nasty real estate.  Add in 50 years of fortification building(there is not a ridge line north or south that is not riddled with bunkers, trench lines and veh. firing positions and mine fields.)   The problem is it is unclear if N Korea would care how nasty it was.  They have already shown a disregargd for individual life.  I think the south on its own COULD hold off such an assault, but it would be very very costly.  Large important sectors of S. Korea are in easy reach of North Korean forces.  That is also the reason Bush is a BIT more muted when talking about the military option in Korea.  It isn't nice open desert.  It is mountainous and cramped.  The casualties from an attack into N Korea would be horrendous no matter what advantage we have. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
