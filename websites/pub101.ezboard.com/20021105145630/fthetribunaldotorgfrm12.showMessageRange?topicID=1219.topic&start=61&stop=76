<br>
IF you kill the Maidens Eye guy and he drops a shard.. and IF there is a Comp around..  Please consider letting them loot it.. they NEED it .. you have no immediate use for it ..  Its apparently the most rare piece.<br>
<br>
then it was sprinkled in that doing so would not only be helping out the comps .. it would also put a bug up people like Kreese and Lejina's ass.. cause someone else was in &quot;their&quot; zone.. <br>
<br>
<br>
I can tell you that revolution is not &quot;actively&quot; seeking shards..  But just like the VP key.. Many of us were doing the other pieces before Revo had ever killed or attempted Trakanon..  I seem to remember running into .. hmm.. dont think it was EV.. that sux.. think it was Self Inflictus or RNG people..  anyways I remember running into people from some self proclaimed uber guild while doing that quest as well.. and them laughing that we would never see VP ..   I honestly have very little concern for what anyone outside of Revo thinks is a good or bad use of my time..  The only thing I have taken issue with..  Is Ganndor's conspiracy theory .. <br>
<br>
The first encounter he mentioned..was without a doubt an Ichor farming run..  It was also our first time down there..   We didn't want to go kill green mobs in mons letalis.. figured we would get some exp while farming it..  We naturally ended up in them most namedish looking area we could find..  An hour later Ganndor, Croneus, Kreese, and I dont remember who else showed up..   Was actally a pretty hilarious group sinice it was alot of &quot;infamous&quot; people in Revolution.. Since Gann and Croneus were both ex members.. and we got Kreese his epic for him.. The first I  heard of them dropping shards.. was when Croneus asked me or Rifkind if he could loot a shard if it dropped..  we told them NO .. We want the shards all for ourselves..   Then watched Kreese get all puffy and make some self important comment..  Ganndor left .. and Croneus stood there for an hour dumbstruck, watching us hunt afterwards..  <br>
<br>
Yeah.. we TOLD them we were after shards... of course we told them that..  It was a group full of pricks.. Hell.. Lejina was probably there too.. It was seriously a rediculously ironic group..  If I had hand picked a grop of assholes this would most likely had been it..  I think fucking Livlongti was even in the group..   <br>
<br>
So I know the source of your stupid paranoia about us purchasing shards..  It started right there on that Ichor camp..  and was reinforced on day in Acrylia when Lejina accosted Possum about camping shards in Acrylia..  He was probably actually camping shards too. but Lejina freaked in OOC. .it was quite hilarious..  <br>
<br>
The Deep incident he mentioned..  Was either Happy shrooms, or some named,  or just an exp crawl..  Even pre exp patch that was pretty good exp there..  I dont kill frogs or FG mushrooms.. too fucking boring..  I dont care if im ever lvl 60 .. Killing frogs or shrooms or spiders is too much like work.. When I exp its usually somewhere you dont think of as an exp camp..   I STILL stand behind the fact that you dont need to &quot;CAMP&quot; the shard in there..  They are really pretty damn common..  We regularly see them rot.. <br>
<br>
<br>
What I have disputed her is Ganndor's ridiculous conspiracy theory ..  Go read his post.. Look at all the thought he put into it.. Look at the questions he was asking people..  The questions make it obvious he already had the whole conspiracy theory thought up and he was asking questions in order to Confirm it..   He really is an ill person ..  Wait till he threatens to come over to your house and kill you .. and accuses you of conspiring against him..  His whole friggin family is in Revo.. and he absolutely spazzed and quit convinced that the officers of Revo were out to get him.. <br>
<br>
Look at hjis current theory.. The officers of Revo are manipulating and lying to our members.. In order to get VT shards ?  <br>
<br>
What the fuck am I going to do with a VT shard ? <br>
<br>
Sure.. I'll loot one that drops.. I might even go and kill a few Goranga in ME when bored and in teh neighborhood..  But there are alot of other things that I would go after if I were going to dupe my guildmates and manipulate them..  not a fuckin VT shard.. thats just stupid.. <br>
<br>
Didn't he warn his family members of my evil intent ?<br>
<br>
<br>
hehe..  you guys can continue to say im lying.. <br>
<br>
Im just stupid, stubborn, and bored enough to keep on defending myself ..  <br>
<br>
But its clear that Ganndor has some issues .. and his conspiracy theory... interrogation of Revo members..  procurement of private Revo communications..  Those are not the thoughts and actions of a well person.. <br>
<br>
<br>

You really see me everywhere, do i obsess you so much?!? You got a screenshot of my toon on your desktop as well?<br>
<br>
Last time i went in this fucking zone was to camp my own shard after being invited by an E/V group already there, been in AC for total of 3-4 hours. Before that the only time someone could have seen me in AC was when E/V used to do the Ring of Fire, a long ass time ago. I hate this zone with passion.<br>
<br>
I never ever saw a Revolution member in AC, hell i never go there.<br>
<br>
To accost Possum? I never ever heard of this guy, even less talking to him, and why the fuck would i freak out about a Revolution member camping shards? My greatest reaction when i heard of Revolution members camping keys has been &quot;uh?&quot; in guildchat when someone announced it and thats about all i said on this topic so far since then hah. You guys arent that much interesting.<br>
<br>
I have my VT key since quite a while now and never met a Revolution member to any shard camp. Know why? Cause i get invited to group already made or close to and the camps are know clear of other group before i move there. So even if you guys camp them permanently, hell if i know, i never meet any of you.<br>
<br>
You're are indeed my greatest fan for thinking about me so much, hell, you imagine me present in places i never go to.<br>
<br>

 <br>
That is the only statement you have made that i would believe. And thats because you and your marry bunch of men already have them, and you dont give a flying fuck about the rest of your guild.<br>
<br>
Xav, i dont give a damn wether you were camping shards to get a key to VT someday.. My point and the point of the original post was that you were using and misleading memebers of your guild that helped you obtain these shards by not letting them know what they were for and or letting them loot them. You just sat there and kept your mouth shut and looted, looted ,looted.. You fucked your guild memebers to get ahead of the curve for you and your friends.. This has not even been denied by you, all you said was &quot;your delusional&quot; Not once have you said.. No Ganndor,  &quot;I TOLD MY GUILD WE WERE CAMPING SHARDS AND WHAT THEY WERE FOR MONTHS AGO, BEFORE ME AND MY CRONIES EVER LOOTED THEM AHEAD OF MY GUILDMEMEBERS WHITOUT INFORMING THEM THAT THESE WERE KEY COMPONENTS&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry for mistaking you for a family member of Xaviera's Deyatra (who  has admited herself that she suffers from some form of mental illness, i think it was depression). Its Rheannon and yourself who are relatives and Xav and you who are just friends. Got that one mixed up. <br>
<br>
And to address your heart felt concern for my mental well being..... HA ! I'm happy 24/7, i make the most of any said situation that i can. I think you just wanted some company in the good ole nuthouse and were hoping i would join you. Alas i cant help ya there, You'll have to continue to talk to your imaginarey friends and take your happy pills all by yourself.<br>
<br>
Some might say i should be sensitive to a person who suffers from mental illness and depresion, but i dont even believe in that shit. Thats an exscuse for not being able to handle reality<br>
or deal with your lifes circumstances. Let me give you some advise.<br>
<br>
1. Get off the happy pills<br>
2. Find yourself, who you really are and what you really believe.<br>
3. Hold your head up and be proud of that person.<br>
4. If there is something you just cant be proud of take one of two actions. Change it if you can, If you can not change it.. Except it and hold your head up in pride that you are the best you can be.<br>
5. Hold true to your values and beliefs.<br>
<br>
Or you can just post more threads about people you thihnk may have some mental illness according to the clasic signs of &quot;im too muchof a pussy to admit im a fuck up so can we just say i have some sort of mental illness#00739 and give me a pill ? cause thats easier than changing my faults.&quot; <p><div align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120962"><img src="http://www.evguild.org/wizards/merlin.gif" width="200" height="150" border="0"></aSage Sorcerer Ganndor Planesdweller, Elitists and Vagrants

Calloneous went cause he dint know what you all were using him for. But he got a shard and now has VT key and loot from VT as well. So thnaks for farming his shard for me. They dont remove cause they dont play the game for the same reasons i do. They are very casual players and your guild suits them fine as far as i can tell. Like i said earlier, we dont really discuss your Revo when we all hook up so i dont talk about how pathetic of a guild leader you are and all the bullshit polotics in your PoS &quot;Family Guild&quot;.<br>
<br>
Almost everyone of them solo or just all group together 80% of the time. Besides having to listen to all the arguing in your guildchat, there is no outstanding reason for them to leave cause like i said they prolly just dont give a shit one way or another.  Its safe to say that 90%+ of the shit that goes on in Revo has no effect on my family memebers.<br>
