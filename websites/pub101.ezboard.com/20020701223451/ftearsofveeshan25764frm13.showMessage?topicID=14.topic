<br>
I must inform all of you that it may be a bit difficult to find me for the next few days/weeks however long it takes.<br>
<br>
I recieved some information while hunting in the Lake of Ill Omen that my mother had been seen passing through with my father many years ago.  They had said they were on their way to Warslik Woods to visit the local Giant tribe.  The informant snickered and conitnued by telling me that they must have gotten quite a surprise, the giants there are not friendly. and dont speak any language that he knew of beyond grunts and belches.  <br>
<br>
His words made me curious and a bit angry at the possibility of these Giant men causing harm to my peaceful family.<br>
<br>
So i am off in search of these Giants and will return when i feel i have learned all i can from them.  <br>
<br>
Safe journey's to you all.<br>

<br>
     Alas, it may distress you greatly to hear these words, but it is, I think, in the best interest of any traveler to heed them.<br>
<br>
     The Warsliks Woods are filled with many wandering dangers, in addition to the giants which have built their fort there, including goblins, hairy apelike brutes, and Iksar. Be most careful when traveling through this area.<br>
<br>
     Perhaps your parents may have been taken prisoner by one of the brutes. I hear that they often capture unwary travelers from the woods, and bring them to their master in the crypt of Dalnir, to act as unwilling servants.<br>
<br>
     It may be that some information regarding their whereabouts may be gained from those who still labor against their will in Dalnir.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you in your Quest, Salvia.<br>
Please let us know if we can be of any assistance.<br>

Yours in the Light,<br>

I have recently been in the Crypt of Dalnir, and in fact am having this written to you from that vicinity.  In my travels there, I have not yet seen any Coerced Wood Elves.  The Kly seems to favor Gnomes, Dwarves, Erudites, Goblins, Iksar, and Teir'Dal as slaves.  <br>
<br>
Nay, your parents have not been found in that evil Crypt.  I fear for them being there, as the only release I am aware of for the Coerced Ones is death.  I do not know of any who can undo the effects of coersion, or whether such a thing can be accomplished.  <br>
<br>
O! That they might be found elsewhere and again see our happy woods in Faydwer.<br>

If you would like to venture into the Crypt yourself, this could be accomplished by your 27th or 28th Season.  I intend to venture back soon (/ooc when I am online the next time after the Aide Station, probably Sunday) and would be pleased if you would join me. We shall be within 10 seasons of each other and should both gain in skills.  I would very much enjoy the company.<br>

   If you have found that you can manage the Giants in the Frontier mountians, then the giants in the Warslicks Woods should be no problem. The breed there are weaker for the most parts. I believe you will find that the Goblins and Iksar of WW are a bit tougher than the giants, but still very manageable. Brutes and their kin are generally non-agressive, although the pretty much hate everyone.<br>
   The Crypt of Dalnir is the location of great treasure, as well as some serious hazards. I would highly recommend a group of 6 adventurous souls from 27-32 to adventure within and learn MUCH about the ways of combat.<br>
   If you need assistance in your quest, please feel free to ask. Although these locations are not entirely accessable to even the most savy of teleporters, it is not impossible to reach these locations with some haste. <p>Ennya Orcsbane<BR>

I have visited the Giant fort in WW and was greeted with disdain.<br>
<br>
One giant did mention that I looked very similar to a wodd elf that had come throught long before. He then mentioned something rather grotesque about munching on her bones and having her for supper.<br>
<br>
This infuriated me and I did battle with him. I reigned the victor in that skirmish, but decided I should most likely leave as the other giants had turned and were looking at me in a most unpleasant way.<br>
<br>
I will repay that visit and the insult to my mother as well.<br>
<br>
Dalnir is the next place I will search for more information.<br>
Maybe she was not slain in velious. My thoughts turn to her constantly. I hope I will find her one day.<br>

She pokes at her campfire, then musingly eats a Batwing Crunchie.  A thought crosses her mind.  Has Salvia had any success? The Warrior has heard nothing.<br>
<br>
It would be difficult for a message runner to find Tigonie out here by herself in the woods, yet the Wood Elf appreciates the quiet and the peace of the wind in the trees...a few more days, a few more days to rest here, then the battle should be joined again.<br>
<br>
Of late, Tigonie has waxed contemplative, and has taken to these woodland wanderings. She has come to love Kunark, not as she loves Faydwer, but second best.  The trees here call to her--a different call than the trees at home, but they call, nonetheless. She glances towards her pack, which, among many things, holds the note she received from Xior.  It would be no good getting it out.  The courier who had delivered it several days ago had had to read it to her.  Xior had very much wanted her to come to Velious. She wonders whether or not she should join him.<br>
<br>
Tigonie pulls out another Batwing Crunchie and recalls her last trip there.  She was younger and she was alone, but then again, it was not very long ago.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The wind bit mercilessly at her armor, and the snow crunched underfoot as Tigonie departed from the Igloos. It almost seemed that a trace of apprehension showed on her face as she checked again that she headed in the right direction. But her step and her demeanor were confident, belying any forebodings she may have felt. Soon icy water yawned before her. She shuddered at the thought of getting in, but there was little chance of staying dry if she intended to travel in this region. She performed a shallow dive and swam to the next island--or was it only a piece of ice? Who could tell? Her swimming had improved greatly as of late, and though the water was frigid, Tigonie took pride in her new skill and quickly reached the opposite shore. Soon she clambered up the bank and began again through the snow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I like the noise this snow makes,&quot; thought Tigonie. &quot;It is all crunchy.&quot; She checked again to make sure her direction was correct. She wondered whether she would be able to make it to Thurgadin, but the sun was bright and the day looked promising. Surely she would be just fine. One more check of direction, then Tigonie relaxed a little and began to enjoy the journey. &quot;Velious is not so bad,&quot; she thought. &quot;Even if it is rather stark, the sunlight on the snow makes such pretty sparkles!&quot;<br>
<br>
She fell into a bit of a daydream, but soon her reverie was shattered by the swipe of claws at her boot! It was one of those snow cougars again, and she knew she was outmatched, alone. Automatically, she swung her sword. Although the blade struck flesh, she knew it was vain. Tigonie ran for her life. <br>
<br>
Not knowing where to go--for the map had suddenly flown out of her head--she turned and headed back the way she had come. Tigonie struggled to keep her feet from sliding as she retraced her icy path back to the shore. The Cat at her heels had no such problem, and she could feel its hot breath upon her. Tigonie's breath came faster, as she thought wildly, &quot;Perhaps I can outswim it! Or perhaps it will not follow me into the water!&quot; She dove as far out as she could manage and used the momentum to speed herself towards the opposite shore. For a moment, the cougar seemed as though he would not follow. But, nay, the beast was a good swimmer. Faster Tigonie's arms stroked, her legs kicked, as she propelled herself through the icy deep trying to reach the first island and make it back to the igloos. The salt of the water stung her wounds, and the beast slashed again, hitting its mark. Oh! Would she never reach the shore!? The bank approached, but her limbs--her leg did not seem to kick anymore in the water. She clambered up the bank, but the Cat was upon her, and she collapsed, her wounded leg refusing to support her weight. Blackness came over her….<br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
She awoke, feeling stiff. A kind voice said to her, &quot;Rest.&quot; She looked, and saw an Ogress leaning over her. Tigonie tried to sit up, but the world seemed to spin. Grunga--for that was the Ogress, of course, smiled. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> It was not exactly a happy memory overall. She had been thankful for Grunga's  help, but wonders how she would fare in Velious again by herself.  Tigonie takes a drink of Honey Mead, pokes at the fire again, and leans back against a comfortable tree trunk, wondering where Salvia is.<br>
<br>
/ooc Grunga is from CdL. One night I had tried to reach Thurganin by myself, and died, of course (no SoW, no invis).  Grunga logged in around the time I died and was sweet enough to get me a res. They have threatened to clear out their message board, and the story was something I had posted there.  In a moment of inspiration, I thought I'd incorporate the story here, though that was not my originial intent when I started writing. <p>Tigonie Silvanstar<br>

This one was younger than the rest but seemed to be most exuberant about the tales he had heard of when my mother had ventured to this fort.  The insults he hurled were of a most foul and disgusting tone.  <br>
<br>
I warned him to leave of the insults and just tell me where he had heard of the druid going to after departing here, but I guess they can't hear with their heads up so high.<br>
<br>
I take what little of value he has on him and conceal myself from the sight of his brothers.<br>
<br>
Walking to the gate of the enormous fort I decided it was time to at least explore and find out where this &quot;Crypt of Dalnir&quot; was to be found.<br>
<br>
After exploring the woods I came to a shore of a lake I had not heard of.  I walk along the shore, letting the sound of the water calm my soul of its sorrow.  <br>
<br>
Off to my right I here the sound of a skulking brute.  These giant orange ape looking creatures seem harmless enough as long as they are left unprovoked.  I follow the sound to a curious tunnel in the side of a hill.<br>
<br>
As i enter the tunnel a strange dank smell greets me, along with the hoots and howls of the brutes.  The floor is a little slippery so I transform into the shape of a wolf to take advantage of the sure purchase only claws can obtain.<br>
<br>
I follow my nose to a room with two of the brutes standing near a small pool.  Almost as if they are guarding some secret.  This thought draws my insatiable curiousity to the pool.  My wolf's nose sniffs it.  But there is no scent of water. Only the same dank smell of the tunnel.<br>
<br>
I place a paw in to test the water, and my foot slides through dryly to hard rock below the &quot;surface&quot;. <br>
&quot;This is no pool,&quot; I think to myself.<br>
<br>
I walk down under the surface of the &quot;water&quot; afraid for a moment that I may be enveloped unsuspectingly by some murky bottomless depth( I am slightly afraid of being in the water you see)<br>
<br>
But instead I have entered a tunnel and I hear a faint unfamiliar sound.<br>
<br>
As I turn a corner i am taken aback by a stench that knocks me back to my natural form and I retch.  This is the stench of death, and all around me I here the screaming of tormented souls.<br>
<br>
I suspect I have entered the crypt...<br>

Musing thoughtfully among the boughs, Tigonie wonders where she should travel next.  Perhaps she should check on young Talcee, who is growing up quickly in Kunark.  Then her thoughts turn to Dalnir.  Tigonie fleetingly remembers how the slime from the floors of Dalnir never WOULD fully come off of her old bronze boots--there was always an odd haze on the soles once she had been there.

She was walking proudly..unafraid of what lay ahead.  Traveling with a small band of fighters the moved deep into the crypt.  Many strange beings were encountered, and slain.  The monsters were hideous, mouths full of teeth that seemed to float in mid air, strange piles of a gooey substance that came alive with feirceness, and strangest of all were the dwarves, erudites, and dark elves that seemed under a mind control.<br>

I saw my mother snatched up in the middle of one battle by a strange lizard man.  Not an iksar, but something far stranger.<br>
<br>
The party turned after the battle and n oticed her gone.  They called her name again and again but no reply came.<br>
<br>
Ten i saw Mirahze, my beloved mother in a cell, covered in dirt and slime.  A collar was around her neck and those strange lizards were taunting her mercilessly.<br>
<br>
Then one giant of a lizard walked toward her.  he had many adornments of jewelry, satin and what looked like body marks under the skin.  he spoke a single sentence to her..<br>
<br>
&quot;You belong to the kly now,&quot; he said. Then he brought a glowing amulet to herface and laughed maniacally.<br>

After my fitful dream I headed for the crypt of Dalnir.  Luckily my sense of direction did not misguide me this time and i arrived only a few minutes later.<br>

I entered the water and began heading down into the crypt. That stench, I fear, I will never forget.  It knocked me back and back to my natural form as it had before.  <br>
<br>
I gathered my senses, calmed myself and started searching.  <br>
<br>
As i turned the corner I came face to face with the ugliest gobin I had ever seen.  Thank Tunare I had made myself invisible to their sight before I entered.  I moved forward.<br>
<br>
Inside the temple of the Kly I found a pit that leads to the second floor.  I umped down(with the help of some batwings so as not to get hurt, and explored a bit.<br>
<br>
I found a sacrificial table, a weapons room, and a couple of nasty monsters, but no cells where my mother could be. <br>
<br>
But I knew how to get to the third level, so off I went.  <br>
<br>
After a short while I came to what looked like the cell from my dream.  I looked in and....EMPTY. She wasn't there.  I became panicked.  Tears formed in my eyes, rage burned in my stomach.  My vision began to cloud....I was losing control.<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes, calmed my maddened spirit, and continued my search.<br>
<br>
I entered a great hall full of the Kly and their minions.  None of them see me(thank Tunare).  As I enter what appears to be a throne room I see many Kly gathered around a very large being...He is being referred to as &quot;Overseer&quot;.  <br>
<br>
He has turned and looked at ME!  The other Kly turn, they see me now too.  I try to run away, but there are too many of them, I can't even get any of my spells off to defend myself.<br>
<br>
Soon I am bound hand and foot, and being led back to the second floor and that table I had seen earlier.<br>
<br>
The Overseer whispers in my ear &quot;You are a fool, and now all of Norrath will fall into my grasp with just this first step!&quot;<br>
<br>
..This is where I must pause, my throat is dry, my eyes are weary....Call on me tomorrow traveleer and I shall tell you the rest of the tale.&lt;bows and waves goodbye&gt;<br>

Thank you, Salvia, for continuing this story.  Any chance you could also post the last 2 of your posts (for the sake of continuity) to the AnDarim board in the thread below?<br>
<br>

<br>
I really should have wrapped this up long ago.  It just seemed to flow better in-game for me.  (That was VERY fun! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )  We can wrap it up in both places, if that is ok with you, since it is no big deal to copy-paste, and maybe make a few minor modifications to make it flow in.  Then you can continue her quest here as it diverges from the other thread. <p>Tigonie Silvanstar<br>

She orders a drink of honey dew and a light meal of baked roots and waits for her companions to arrive::<br>
<br>
<br>
::She waves as they enter and offers them places at the table::<br>
<br>
&quot;Now where was I?&quot; she ponders a moment,&quot;Oh yes. Now I remember..&quot;<br>
<br>
And the tale begins again....<br>
<br>
The Kly had me locked up in a cage.  It was too dark to see anyway of getting out easily.  My hands had been bound so I could not transport out easily.  I was also to fatigued to form the spell words anyway. My stuggle with the Kly Oveerseer left me drained and almost unconcious.<br>
<br>
Outside the bars of my new prison a smoldering goo was left to watch me.  Every few moments it would lift a slimy eyestalk and look at me with its sickly dripping &quot;eye&quot; and then return the stalk to the rest of its slimy mass.<br>
<br>
I sat in the stinkin darkness, trying desperately to remain awake.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How do I get myself out of this one?&quot; I thought desperately.<br>
<br>
A while later I was awakened. When I had fallen asleep I do not know, but now I was being taken back up to the second level by 2 strong Kly acolytes.  By their markings I guessed they were apprentices of some arcane magic, but their physical strength revealed warrior blood in them as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
As we entered the second floors hall, the intensity of the light <br>
caused me to squint my eyes from discomfort.  It seemed as if the very walls were on fire, they had so many torches and candles lit.  It was then that I heard the calls from higher in the crypt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Salvia!! Where are you!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Kly seemed to take no notice whatsoever and I thought I had imagined it.  Then the cries came again..many voices calling my name.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am HERE!!&quot; I shouted,&quot; They have me on the second floor!! Please hurry!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We come!!&quot; was the reply.  But I knew they must be having a hard time with the creatures that guard the entrance.  <br>
<br>
The Overseer scoffed at me and garbled something in my direction.<br>
<br>
I was placerd on a table near a pool of water.  The Overseer had an amulet in his hand that gleaamed dully in the firelight.  He walked over to the water, humming and chanting a strange song.  As he neared the pool, the water began to churn and bubble. A faint glow came from the center of the pool.  The Overseer thrust the amulet into the pool and the water hissed and churned all around it.  The light grew even more intense than the torchlight, I turned my head for fear of losing my sight to that brightness.<br>
<br>
Then all became quiet.  <br>
<br>
The Overseer lifted the amulet, which now glowed brightly from within, and began walking towards me. He lifted the amulet to my face and I screamed.<br>
<br>
The power from the amulet was ripping into my mind.  Shards of magic pierced my mind and ripped my soul to shreds.  I screamed again and again, begging for those at the entrance to hurry.  <br>
<br>
I could barely hear them now.  The last thing I remember is a quiet voice entering my mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must fight the magic,&quot; Ennya whispered.  How I heard her I do not know.  But alas I could not fight it, and once again the world went black.<br>
<br>
:: Salvia looks at her companions with a slight smile::<br>
<br>
&quot;You are now the ones who look tired,&quot;she says,&quot; Order more drinks and let us dine together, then I will finish my story.&quot;<br>
<br>
:: Salvia calls a waitress over and asks that her friends order some food::<br>

Salvia, so young and innocent, looking for her mother in the land of Kunark, with a hope that defied all hope, believing her mother to be alive and held captive in Dalnir.  The thought of the young Druid going into Dalnir alone seemed unthinkable.  Yet the girl was on such a mission, it seemed to be true that she had done that very thing!<br>
<br>
Tigonie and a number of others who had been in the AnDarim tavern--plus some others to whom they had dispatched messages--had grabbed their packs and headed to the evil Crypt, meeting at the enterance.  Solarianne and some others to whom they had sent messages to had not yet arrived.  Tigonie said to Rayth, &quot;I don't think we should wait. We have enough of a force here. Let the others catch up.&quot;  Rayth agreed, and together all those who had already arrived entered Dalnir--about a dozen in all.<br>
<br>
The place was as Tigonie remembered it from months before:  the slime covered floor, and the dank smell of death, and the evil creatures inhabiting it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Salvia!! Where are you!!&quot; they yelled.<br>
<br>
A faraway, almost muffeled voice replied, &quot;I am HERE!! They have me on the second floor!! Please hurry!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tigonie shouted, &quot;We come!!&quot;  Yet there could be no haste.  A Coerced Dwarf blocked their way, with a Ravenous Nibbler nearby.  Blades flashed, and the Dwarf proved to be a worthy foe.  She healed herself even as they thought she neared death.  Death--her release from the bondage of the Kly.  Pity filled Tigonie's heart as the Dwarf let out a final cry.  Elves have no special love for Dwarves, yet she thought of this one spending her youth in the land of Faydwer.  The end of the Dwarf's life was in this foul place, and according to Mala the Wood Elves might soon share the same fate--no, that could not be!  But at least there was freedom in death.  <br>
<br>
Tigonie had little time to muse, however, as they faced the sharp teeth of a Nibbler, teeth that could pierce strong armor.  The dim-witted creature fell to their blades, and they entered the twisting hall.  Gyrating Goo, more Nibblers, Coerced Goblins, Iksar, Gnomes--servant after servant of the Kly blocked their way.  It seemed as though they would never reach Salvia.  Where would she be?  &quot;We are close!&quot; shouted Tigonie, though she was not sure of that at all.<br>
<br>
A panicked voice replied, &quot;Oh no! they are going to make me a coerced like the others here! Please anyone nearby help me!&quot;  Tigonie's stomach lurched.  It could not really be true that the Kly really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> coerce Wood Elves, could it be?<br>
<br>
Tigonie yelled, with more confidence than she felt, &quot;Salvia, they cannot coerce Wood Elves...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that, Tigonie. They sure are trying!  I feel a magic, strong magic. It is creeping into my brain. I'm trying to resist.  It hurts! Millions of glass shards seem to be tearing my mind to shreds...&quot;  The voice trailed off.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are coming, Salvia!&quot;  No answer.  Only the sounds of battle echoed in the dank hallway.  Would this hall <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be clear of the Kly's evil ones? <p>Tigonie Silvanstar<br>

Tigonie shouted again, &quot;Salvia?&quot;  For a moment, there was no answer, then a Wood Elf attacked!  &quot;Salvia!  What are you doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
Salvia shouted in return, &quot;Tigonie you will belong to the Kly as I do!&quot;  A spell landed on the Warrior.  Tigonie felt sick, realizing what she was going to have to do.<br>
<br>
Takhteh yelled, &quot;Dammit they've taken Salvia's mind!&quot;  Kyrael turned, boggled at Salvia, and shook her head, looking confused.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Death is the only release for her,&quot; Tigonie said, the words sticking in her throat.  <br>
<br>
Fizzlebang shouted, &quot;There must be another way.&quot; But Tigonie knew there was no other way for the Kly's servants.  In any case, it was certain that Salvia intended to attack until she was either victorious or perished.<br>
<br>
Nathanius cried out desperately, &quot;Rayth can't you alter her memory?&quot;  Tigonie hesitated.  The young Druid had not been able to root the Warrior, and had suffered much from the Warrior's blows.  <br>
<br>
Nearing death, the Druid's eyes cleared and she looked like herself for a fleeting second as she begged, &quot;You have to kill me. It's the only way. Please kill me.&quot;  Salvia's face looked so pained in that moment.  Tigonie's heart seemed to stop beating, her soul pierced by the thought of what she had to do.  Her sword came down once more, and Salvia uttered a piteous cry.  Tigonie thought she had heard her whisper, &quot;Thank you,&quot; as she breathed her last.<br>
<br>
Tignonie and the others lowered their heads and mourned the loss of Salvia.  Fizzlebang shouted, &quot;All that is left now is revenge!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Wahoombah said, &quot;Aye, mefinks dis be war. Fer da gloree af Rallos Zek!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Fizzlebang exclaimed, &quot;Aye! Let the flames of Solusek Ro consume this foul place!&quot; <br>
<br>
Anger welled up in Tigonie, also.  She looked at her young friend, a coersion implant visible in her skin.  Tigonie reached down and removed the evil thing from the Druid's arm.  <br>
<br>
As the others clammored for revenge, Kyrael said quietly, &quot;But it is not a cleric's job to leave the dead to rest.  May I pray for her return?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rayth asked, &quot;Can you attempt to being her back, Kyrael, and cleanse her soul?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tigonie nodded and said, &quot;Please try, Kyrael.&quot;  Fizzlebang shuddered at the thought, in case Salvia might not be cured.  <br>
<br>
Kyrael prayed, and minutes passed, but nothing happened.  The Cleric said, &quot;No response. It is almost as though her soul is hiding.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fizzlebang sugested timidly, &quot;Perhaps it was consumed?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathanius glanced at Tigonie's striken face and said, &quot;Try again Kyr!&quot;  Kyrael nodded at Nate and returned to her prayers.  Nathanius bowed down and prayed also.<br>
<br>
In grief, Tigonie shouted, &quot;Surely the Kly is not so powerful!&quot;<br>
<br>
But then, the Druid seemed to stir.  She looked around weakly.  &quot;What is going on?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tignoe shouted with joy, &quot;Thank you, Kyrael!  You have resurrected her and brought her back to us!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyrael replied with a look of relief, &quot;Just doing my job.&quot; &lt;cough&gt;<br>
<br>
Tigonie said, &quot;Salvia, you were coerced by the Kly and we thought we could not resurrect you.&quot;  They all gathered around the Druid, hugging her and weeping tears of joy.<br>
<br>
Salvia looked at Tigonie, completely puzzled.  &quot;The last thing I remember, I was entering the Crypt.&quot;<br>
<br>

I set it up for you to finish it off, Salvia.  I'm not good at writing endings.

<br>
<br>
I cried for Tigonie and the others to hurry.  I screamed of what they were trying to do.  Tigonie seemed astounded at the thought of a coerced wood elf.  She evn shouted that it could not be done.  I told her that she should tell them that.&lt;winks at Tigonie&gt;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the brave souls who had come to rescue me came too late.  The Overseer brought the amulet to me, holding it close to my arm.  He spoke a few more broken phrases and all went black.  I have no memory of what happened after that.  <br>
<br>
But now that I have heard Tigonie's side I am most grieved at my actions. <br>
<br>
&lt;looks sadly at Tigonie&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry for how I acted my friend.  I cannot believe I attacked you like that. Please forgive me&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;lowers her head&gt;<br>
<br>
The next thing I remember is waking up on the ground.  I felt weak, my strength and mana drained away from me.  I could barely move.  I was surrounded by faces, strange and familiar alike.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; I whispered,&quot; What has happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tigonie gave me a quick explanation, just enough for me to grasp what had happened. I was helped to my feet by a pair of strong arms.  All around me people were smiling, and a small hand broke through the crowd, offering me a cookie to raise my spirits.<br>
<br>
I smiled and tears welled in my eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you everyone,&quot; I sniffled,&quot; I shall be forever in your debt.&quot;<br>
<br>
A handsome high elf in the group nodded my way and said, &quot;We were only too happy to help.&quot;  I was then introduced to my rescuers and we all made plans to gain revenge on the kly and teach them a lesson in manners.<br>
<br>
&lt;Salvia buys a round of drinks and makes a toast to the bravery of those who saved her&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;If ever you need help, I will come.  To the darkest jungles and the coldest wastelands I will travel to aide those that saved my life!&quot;<br>
