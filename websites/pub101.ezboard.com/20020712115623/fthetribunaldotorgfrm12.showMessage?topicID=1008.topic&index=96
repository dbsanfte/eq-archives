<br>
The things that more people &quot;blame&quot; E/V for than anything else:<br>
<br>
1. Recruiting their better guildmates -<br>
um...they want the best players they can get.  If that player is a 'raid-oriented' type, then it would make sense for them to look to the end-game raiding guilds, wouldn't it?  Wish them well, /wave good-bye, and move on.<br>
<br>
2. Elitist Attitude -<br>
look at the name of the guild.  And my experience has been that individually, most of E/V's members are pretty nice people, they just have no problems showing you their nasty side if you provoke it.<br>
<br>
It's when you have a large number of E/V together that gets the biggest outcry.  They gather and focus on obtaining a specific goal, and apparently have little to no concern for whom they are 'stepping on' to get to it.  Life is hard sometimes.  Get trained by an E/V crossing The Grey to get to Ssra?  Damn, that sucks.  They didn't call it?  Well, that is that particular player, not all of E/V.  Your guild zone into Akheva for your first attempt at Va'Dyn, only to find E/V is there to pick off Itraer Vious (sp) and popped Va'Dyn on the way in?  Tough.  Maybe you should have put a couple people in place to check the spawn before you had 30 people run to the zone.  Maybe if you'd establish a little dialog and express your intentions, they wouldn't have swatted the mob they have relatively little interest in, and you could have had your raid.  In my experience, most &quot;uber&quot; guilds are generally pretty nice people and they are quite willing to accomodate the smaller guilds hitting the less difficult targets - after all, most E/V players were in those types of guilds at one point or another; they know their roots, understand that their future guildmembers need the experience of hitting those lesser mobs, and aren't out to specifically piss you off.  If you'd open your mouth with a civil tongue and communicate, life would probably get quite a bit easier (IMHO).<br>
<br>
I'm a more casual player, and I enjoy most aspects of the game.  Just because I personally don't have the time to dedicate to attending 50% of E/V's scheduled raids doesn't mean I'm going to begrudge them for beating some other guild (including my own) to a spawn, or recruiting players out of my guild.  Sure, if you look at my guild tag you'll see my guildleaders and I generally take a different viewpoint.  But that's one of the reasons I'm in that guild - I can take a different point of view, and no one is going to get pissed about it.<br>

Oh no, the comps might have the same requirements as EV! FUCK NO THEY DON'T! Yes, yes, you guys are different then us at that too, your recruiting is the best EQ has ever seen. Please do us a favor and actualy be better then EV in game instead of just constantly reminding us all about how different and spectacular you are here.<br>
<br>
You people are making this epic requirement thing out way bigger then it is. There are only 3 classes that require an epic if you wish to be considered to join EV: rogue, shaman, and bard. I bet you can get in to rogue or shaman without your epic though, since it's not like it's even that useful. I suspect the requirement is because people from those classes won't shut the fucking hell up in guildchat about &quot;CAN YOU GUYZ PLZ HELP M3 GET MY EPIC!!!1?!?&quot; <br>
<br>
The one class that isn't flexable is bard. If you are a bard then you gotta have an epic weapon to be in EV. If you don't know why you need a fucking epic as a bard then YOU PROBABLY AREN'T A FUCKING BARD OR ARE SOME KIND OF WHINEY COFFEEHOUSE TOPIC DISCUSSING BITCH LIKE RIGADOON! &quot;Gee guys, this doesn't affect me in the slightest but I'd like to point out how your recruiting practices AREN'T VERY NICE!

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also if you think you do more in ten hours then I do in a week, you really are smoking crack, I dont have to explain all I do, I know what I do, so do the people I raid with, but that was quite funny.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It was quite funny because you are incapable of comprehending a complete sentence. You only read what you want to and make up the rest so you can beat your chest and be a mighty little man-boy. To put it in kindergarten terms so you are more able to comprehend the statement....... I can play Everquest 10 hours a week and that takes care of my on-line hobby for that week. You need many many hours a week to fulfil your needs. Maybe you are jealous of me and other casual gamers like me because we dont have to sit in front of the computer day after day after long ass day in order to fulfil our desires of everquest.<br>
Look back on my original post you lackwit. I supported your guilds recruitment policy. But you come out thumping your chest because you think your guild tag means you are a great player. Your guild tag has very little to do with how great a player you are. It merely symbolizes the amount of your life you spend playing Everquest.<br>
Go ahead and spin my words again DM. Seems I took up for you when someone was accusing you of twisting shit around before. Seems I was wrong. You really have no abilities to comprehend the written word. All you can do is grab a couple phrases and twist the meaning around to fit your drab little lonely existance.<br>
The only reason I give a fuck about what you have to say is because you take my words out of context, twist them, then poke em back in my face and expect me, and everyone else, to eat them for the truth. Well your truth and logic are totally flawed. You should have your midsection replaced with glass windows. Then you could still see around you, even tho your head is buried so far up your ass.<br>

On the spell side, you are absolutely right though.  So much so that some certain spells (no they are not &quot;ancient&quot;) are put on item loot tables and until very recently were very rare or have yet to drop on this server.<br>

That is why gear is somewhat important to casters as well. The same goes for every other class that uses mana, the only exception is maybe the shaman, but although max mana means less to shamans, we still have to worry about AC and HP.<br>
<br>
Also, someone who plays for 10 hours a day will not likely be very high level, and is even more unlikely to have much AA skills, some of which make great differences in one's abilities.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget someone who can only play 10 hours a week will not likely be very knowledgable about what to do against certain mobs. I think I can speak for everyone who's ever lead raids, ignorance on an individual's part can bring about rather large consequences. However, if this is a &quot;great player&quot; then theoretically this person would listen carefully, and follow directions well, so this may not become an issue.<br>
<br>
I think the largest issue here is dependability. For guilds who's goal is to raid, they would want members who could be depended upon to show up, especially for key classes. For a guild who does raids and no much else, somewho who could only show up to 1/5 of the raids would not be very useful, because 80% of the time the person isn't there when he's needed.<br>

Nukers don't worry about how much mana they have all up except wizards and manaburn, because they can't chain nuke - there is always a gap between spell casting to avoid aggro. Same with clerics - they don't non stop cast CH, there is a gap between casting. It's all about how mana you can regen in between those casts - against Luclin uber mobs in fights that go for 20-30mins against very high damage output mobs, its having FT that counts. Even FT 5 gives you such a huge boost over 20mins its insane, and FT10+ are just incredible. c3 + bard song + other mana regen is good, but FT on top of that gives a major extra advantage.<br>
<br>
Against Velious ubers it was a mix of endurance and damage, in Luclin its *all* endurance. And casters in Luclin need as much FT type gear as they can get against Luclin mobs. And now with Focus effects going in, casters are even more dependent on gear, cause you can bet VI will begin to balance uber encounters with Focus effects in mind.<br>

Actually the only reason you give a fuck about what I say is because you want to be respected and uber, you want people to like you and adore you thinking you are insightful and humorous. You couldnt accomplish anything in game so you decided to make an ezboard persona and level that apparently, lazy people usually take that route when they realize no one knows them in game and that camping a spider in velks was just so HARD. Also Krickett if, like I said, and asked, people dont respect what I say because I whored my way into EV, why would it matter what I said? It matters because you are crying at this moment, so upset feeling on the outside, feeling like me ( someone you supported which in yer mind should net you loyalty from me ) an uberguild player is making fun of you. Really do you need a tissue for your tears, its pretty apparent how upset you are over this. When you want to stop crying and whining like the little bitch you are, and maybe suck it up, then come talk to me, otherwise all your doing is throwing a tantrum pleading for acceptance and acknowledgement from someone whom you say dont respect, how pathetic you are. <p><center><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/RFthunderkickfinal2.gif><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92681>

I dont want to presume to speak for Loegan.  but what I believe his point is .. <br>
<br>
Take a naked warrior..  and a fully equipped warrior.  HUGE difference ..  In fact you can hardly even compare the two..  Now take a wizard who is naked.. VS one who is equipped .. BIG difference..  but they CAN be compared ..  <br>
<br>
then extend that some.. <br>
<br>
Take a Warrior in the best Kunark has to offer.   and a warrior in the best Velious has to offer..  <br>
<br>
HUGE difference again.. <br>
<br>
<br>
Take a wizard in the best Kunark has to offer .. and a wizard in the best Veilous has to offer..   There is a difference.  but not much of one.. <br>
<br>
I believe his point was that Melee are more dependant on gear than casters.  I dont see how anyone can really disagree with that..   Most casters had maxxed INT back before Kunark even.   How many warriors had over 1200 AC and over 4K hp back then.   Oneton and Pigg ... how many others ?<br>

<br>
How often do you go fighting a dragon NAKED ? The age old CR argument that &quot;casters have it easier because they can fight naked&quot; is about just as dumb. Naked or not : can I tank my way back to my corpse ? No.<br>
<br>
Your armor comparisons are also flawed: kunark vs velious : 2 MELEE expansions with about zero caster loot worth mentioning. Then again... we had bane spells back then and those weren't half bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (if expensive)<br>
<br>
As I said : it's not as obvious as bigger stats... but with Luclin, choices of gear are just as important for a caster than a melee. They are actually harder decisions to make IMHO because it's very often hard to evaluate the impact of some items &quot;in situ&quot;. It's not just about packing more AC/HP and resists. It's about compromising some stats to gain other advantages. Nevermind that you can't plan your gear ahead since we still dont know what high end items will have what focus added on them...<br>
  <br>
Enough freebies... i'll let you figure out the rest for yourself.<br>
