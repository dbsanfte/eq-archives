I couldn't agree with you more Loegan &amp; I would like to make it clear I am not a bit &quot;happy&quot; about Rush's addiction (if true).  Not happy, angry as hell, but not happy.  <br>
<br>
This is like Jimmy Swaggart soliciting a prostitute. Or the religious right family who is totally against abortion till their 16 year old daughter gets pregnant.   It just pisses me off.  <br>
<br>
I can respect someone that has strong convictions.  But, if you take an extreme view, stand by your convictions, promoting it everywhere you go, you damn well better stick to those convictions even when it hits home.  <br>
<br>
If Rush is addicted, &amp; DID go to treatment twice, this should be a real eye-opener for the Right.... that maybe they are Wrong.  That treatment, even multiple times when needed, is a better way to fight the &quot;war on drugs&quot; than what's been going on for the last 20 years.    <br>
<br>
Over a trillion dollars spent &amp; I can still go down the street &amp; score.  Inpatient treatment?  Better stand in line unless you got the cash or good insurance.  <br>

Back over 10 years ago I remember hearing &quot;drug addiction is a criminal justice problem, not a health problem...&quot;   It was a right wing radio talk show host, but I am unsure if it was Rush who said it.  At the time there were a lot of copy cats doing the shock jock right-wing crap &amp; I can't quote it directly.  <br>
<br>
What Rush DID endorse was &quot;punishment&quot; for breaking the law.  Not rehab, no parole, no education, just punishment.  Do the crime, do the time, no frills.  If he did purchase drugs illegally then according to his own opinion, jail time is what he deserves.<br>
<br>
In my own opinion, as much as he pisses me off for being a hypocrite, I don't think he deserves any jail sentence.  If he DID break the law, &amp; he co-operates with the investigation, he should get rehab, community service, &amp; closely monitored probation with drug screening.  What will most likely happen is million dollar lawyers &amp; an a acquittal.  <br>

Is it just me or is that statement a bit odd?  If he went to rehab twice, and is still addicted after two tries, how does it show that treatment is an effective way to fight the &quot;war on drugs&quot;?<br>
<br>
Wouldn't is show that treatment doesn't work for a damn on SOME people that that other measures are needed, seeing as the treatment well.. didn't work?  <br>

Actually that has been the debate for years...  does drug treatment work?<br>
<br>
At this time it would be impossible for me to produce statistics that I can back up, &amp; of course statistics can be bent to fit a desired result.  From what I understand though is that inpatient treatment alone, in which the patient is turned loose with no ongoing treatment or monitoring, has about a 10% success rate.   However, inpatient treatment, followed with a slow release back to society, with monitoring &amp; counselling, &amp; the threat of being returned to prison, can see a success rate of over 50%.<br>
<br>
In terms of cost, there is very little difference between rehab &amp; incarceration.  In terms of benefits, a success rate anywhere close to 50% would be a windfall savings to society.  Addicts that stop using also stop breaking the law &amp; become productive citizens.<br>
<br>
Rush Limbaugh (allegedly) put himself in treatment &amp; then put himself right back in the same situation that he was in when he fucked up the 1st time.  The odds would be stacked against him staying clean, no surprise he landed back in treatment.  Chances are he just put himself in for detox so that he could get though withdrawal &amp; experienced no real &quot;treatment&quot;.<br>
<br>
Maybe drug treatment doesn't work at all for some people.  If they continue to fuck up, they will end up right where they belong, behind bars.  <br>

<br>
Another factor in treatment success is the kind of drug you are talking about.  All have different rates of addiction and strengths of addiction.  Opiates are hard drugs to kick, Oxy-Cotin (Which i think is what Rush is in trouble for) is worse.  Meth is just slightly less.  Cocain is actually easier(just in comparison, it is still highy addictive) than those.  Success rates will vary with all these and it takes different strategies to do it.<br>
<br>
Another thing is sending people to treatment for marijuana or other non-physically addictive substances.  This is just a straight waste of time.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Everyone gets hurt by the drug/alcohol addicted.  Their family, loved ones, their employers, &amp; society as a whole thru costs.  Not that this means mandatory drug treatment for all addicts.  Only when they ask for help.  Treatment on demand is in order. Mandatory drug treatment only for the addict/alcoholic that commits crimes.  <br>
<br>
The truth is that our prisons are loaded with people who's main crime is being a alcoholic/addict.  Three types of crimes...  <br>
<br>
Crimes done to get money to buy intoxicants.  <br>
<br>
The crime of possession &amp; trafficking of illegal substances.  <br>
<br>
Crimes done because of being under the influence.  Meaning that these people would never committed their crime if they have not been loaded.<br>
<br>
Yes, they need to be punished for their crimes but keep in mind...  the majority of these people are going to be on the street in less than 5 years after they are convicted.  How do we want them to behave when released?<br>

All I gotta do is listen to him for 5 mins to get angry at him.  He is so full of shit he stinks.  He has all these strong convictions about crime &amp; punishment &amp; spouts off about them for years...   then (if its true) breaks the law himself.  Yea, that pisses me off.  <br>

In order for someone's opinion to &quot;piss you off&quot;, you have to have some measure of respect for the person voicing it. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sciekspellbottler>Sciek Spellbottler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/7/03 9:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=911.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Welfare does not cost NEAR the amount that incarceration does.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's a whole other problem and perhaps much larger one too.<br>
<br>
Prison shouldn't ever be an upgrade in quality of life IMO.  The deterrant factor of sending someone to prison is lost if they have it better in jail than out.  It's utterly ridiculous when prisoners are suing their prisons because the quality of life isn't good enough for whatever reason.  There also needs to be a larger division in the types of prison one can be sent to.  I have a few family members who have had some trouble following the laws of the land and thus I've had the opportunity to visit a few jails. :/  County lockup is mostly a joke from the ones I've seen.  It's typically little more than a nuisance unless you happen to be a middle class kinda guy who loses your job while in jail.  For the poor, their jobs are a dime a dozen anyway so that's not any huge loss.  The quality of life can arguably be better in jail than out. <br>
<br>
State pens are amazingly nice places, for a jail.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The KY state pen for women has a game room, and a nice one at that!  There are college courses you can take for free while in jail.  Healthcare is free.  There's vocational training if you're not inclined to take college courses.  And the hard labor?  Well, you might be stuck in the laundry room which I'm told kinda sucks. oh the agony...  <br>
<br>
Seriously, the men and women in the armed forces serving on extended deployments in peacetime typically have it harder than your average inmate during the same period of time.<br>
<br>
As far as Rush's hypocrisy, I think it should and probably will have a big backlash for him as far as his career goes, but I don't think there's any reason to make any special exceptions and throw the book at him because he was outspoken in his views about drug use.  That would be just as hypocritical as his use of drugs. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=361026&amp;amp;resize=true">Sciek</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&lt;Sol Invictus&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=felagund>Felagund</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/7/03 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=911.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> <br>
I only listen to Rush now &amp; then cuz I like The Pretenders... =P<br>
<br>
Then again you got to hand it to a guy that can lie through his teeth on a daily basis for years, develop a huge following of people that think what he says is gospel &amp; make wheelbarrels full of money at the same time.  <br>

If I could get a radio to work in here I could give a few current lies he is probably spouting off today.  That is if he is actually hosting his show today.  <br>
<br>
I can give a good example, if he is still using this line:<br>
<br>
&quot;We are in a relentless pursuit of the truth...&quot;  <br>
<br>
That statement is false, he is in relentless pursuit of his own agenda, which is more than anything else, making money for Rush.  In this &quot;..releentless pursuit of the truth...&quot;  he has consistantly used bad/false info &amp; warped whatever info he can to further his own agenda.  The continual harping about the &quot;liberal media&quot; is also a lie, one he uses nearly every time I listen.<br>
