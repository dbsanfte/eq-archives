I think its funny that people are so willing to flame him right off the bat when what he's saying seems like it comes from someone who has seen it first hand, not just making stuff up.. he included names, events, and accusations that haven't been answered other then someone saying &quot;Oh yeah?!  Well you're an anon loser!&quot;  So I'm hoping this unfolds beautifully.  Xaviera talks alot of crap on the boards about EV, and I expected a totally different personality at Fan Faire.  I haven't taken a single shot at Revo since meeting him, but reading these boards shows that his vendetta against EV (Over a damn mana robe?  I mean come on.. really.. and if you're gonna say its not over a mana robe, what is your true gripe then?) is as strong as ever.  Perhaps some interesting stories and information will come of this.  I think this has potential.   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

That mana robe is so water under the bridge it isnt even funny anymore.<br>
<br>
Xav likes to come here and poke fun and fan the flames.  What is Arleanna's board title ?  &quot;Were you not entertained ?&quot;  Think of Xav in that context.  Xav would argue with a road sign if he thought he could get an argument back.<br>
<br>
Today's post was from a person that did not like the way we handle loot.  More specifically, Trak loot.  And the sad part is this incident happened over 6 months ago, if not longer.<br>
<br>
As for who wrote this post.  I will let Xav answer that question, if he so chooses.<br>
<br>
hehe.  Somewhere in your post I owe you a thanks Jaeron.  It's nice to see that by meeting someone face to face, changes your perception.<br>

Maybe another contributor to the fact im about to post what I know of all this is simply that... I do know about all this, and let me tell ya, this anonymous person is telling the truth. <br>
<br>
What im going to post is my personal dealing with friends I have in the &quot;Family Guild&quot; of Revolution. What im not going to do is draw conclusions or try and sway your judgements with any statements i post.<br>
<br>
Incedents I have personal knowledge of. This is not going to be word for word nor will i exagerate anything. Its to the best of my memory and will be paraphrased as to what all i recall.<br>
<br>
These incidents happend about 3 months ago roughly.<br>
<br>
1. Myself and a full group of EV head into bug caves of FG to get some shard farming done when we encounter atleast 14 Revolution members already at the camp. I was kinda in awe as i was trying to figure out why 14 Revolution members including thier Guild leader and Co-guildleader (Xaviera, and Rifkind) along with a few of what i call &quot;inner circle&quot; members would be doing at this particular camp spot. I notice one of my friends from Revo is with them so i proceed to find out what they are doing here. <br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Revo freind (Keeping thier name anonymous), what are you guys doing here ?<br>
<br>
Revo friend tells Ganndor, Just doing EXP.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Revo friend, EXP ? here ? your not farming shards ?<br>
<br>
Revo friend tells Ganndor, What are shards ?<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Revo friend, Part of the key to VT quest, and like the only reason to kill these guys other than if your looking for a couple pieces of twink gear that drops off these bugs.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Revo friend, how did you get here ? who asked you to come and why did they say you were coming here ?<br>
<br>
Revo friend tells Ganndor, Rifkind asked me if i wanted to come for an EXP group.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Revo friend, Ok, but thats crazy, only reason to be here is for shards. Thats it thats all. EXP is not worth a damn and like i said nothing but a couple piece of twink gear drop here.<br>
<br>
(Ganndor notices Friend number 2 in Revo also here while hes talking to friend number 1, Friend number 2 is in the EXP group which is also Xaviera and rifkinds group.)<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Miassa (not keeping her anon becuase she has no need to be and did nothing wrong so hopefully they wont be pissed at her) What are you guys doing here ?<br>
<br>
Miassa tells Ganndor, EXP group.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Miassa, You guys are not farming shards ?<br>
<br>
Miassa tells Ganndor, Yeah a few of us are i think.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Miassa, Does everyone there know that and do you know what those shards are for ?<br>
<br>
Miassa tells Ganndor, Not sure what everyone knows and yeah the shards are for some key quest i think.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Miassa, OMG, wth are they doing Shards for ?<br>
<br>
(Alot of tells back and forth here explaing the whole quest for the VT key and how it requires killing the Emp and why its completely moronic and a waste of time for Revo memebers to be doing this)<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Miassa, are you all rolling on these shards or they just awarding them ?<br>
<br>
Miassa tells Ganndor, Well just a couple of us are looting them, we already have some that we have been doing over the last week or so. (Week or so was a made up time frame, im not positive how long they were working shards just positive that she referenced some amount of time that they had been doing them)<br>
<br>
(At this point i tried to convince her to not waste her time helping them farm shards cause it was pointless and a real waste of time, She responded in shorth that she was getting EXP and had gotten a few shards herself so she wasnt worried about helping at all)<br>
<br>
So what i learned from this incident was that for some reason Revo leadership and the &quot;inner circle&quot; was farming shards, and doing it in atleast this case without telling all involved what the agenda of this gathering was and not letting the members roll on or even announcing when shards had dropped.<br>
<br>
Inncedent number 2.<br>
<br>
(I notice my RL friend Calloneous (in Revolution at this time) in the deep. this was the day after incident number 1 so i was imediately suspicious of him being there.)<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Calloneous, What are you doing in the Deep ?<br>
<br>
Calloneous tells Ganndor, EXP group.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Calloneous, How many there ?<br>
<br>
Calloneous tells Ganndor, Just a single group.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Calloneous, Where are you guys at ? the zone or what ?<br>
<br>
Calloneous tells Ganndor, No we are a long ways in.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Calloneous, what mobs are you fighting ? Thought horrors just past the invisible bridge ?<br>
<br>
Calloneous tells Ganndor, yeah, moving back and forth killing these in this tunnel.<br>
<br>
Ganndor tells Calloneous, Man your not there for EXP, they are farming shards. They didnt mention shards or anything like that to you ?<br>
<br>
Calloneous tells Ganndor, No Xaviera asked me to come, said it was for EXP group.<br>
<br>
(Ok, im laughing pretty damn hard about right now and told him to call me on the phone. I began to explain to him that they wer farming shards and he was familiar with what i was talking about and the key quest kinda, due to me telling him a bit from time to time about what a pain in the ass it was, i told him to hang out, not say anything but ask in group chat if he could loot a shard too. They were slow to respond but did eventaily answer him and did let him loot one after all others had one. This tells us that Revo leaders were again being secretive and by all acounts misleading and ninja looting shards for a key quest. I call it ninja looting cause looting those and not explaining what they are for would make any group eember assume it was just a sellable or whatever)<br>
<br>
After i found this out i asked Calloneous if they had been raiding and stuf lately. He said No, havent been raidng and havent done ToV HoT in weeks now which is a weekly run for Revo. He said that Xaviera and a few others had taken 2 group runs to HoT and did not invite the rest of the guild, that the raids were to outfit a few of the people who just needed 1 or 2 pieces to complete thier HoT armor sets. I asked him who had been invited and as usual it was the as i call them &quot;inner circle&quot; members of the &quot;Family guild&quot;<br>
<br>
Incident number 3<br>
<br>
I was told a story and now for the life of me i cant rember who told me !!! oh well, no one can dispute this happening cause too many know and they even lost peeps over this one. It was the Ssra incident that Anon poster is talking about. They called a raid and said it was for EXP and i think a named mob was . The named mob turned out to be a mob that drops a part to the ring for the key to Emps room. I was told that they farmed several pices for keys in the past in Ssra and when they had dropped not said a word to anyone but let specific peeps &quot;the inner circle&quot; loot them un announced. Well, it turns out that atleast 4 memebers of Revo had been invited to help the comps kill the Emp, So these 4 needed thier keys for the upcoming raid. Now for some reason all of a sudden the raid lader (not sure who this was) dicided to tell the raid about the emp rings/keys and what was required for them. Then they announced the 4 peeps that these pieces were going to be awarded to. Well, needless to say alot of peeps felt kinda used at this point. and 3 (i think) 60's including an officer deguilded after possum ninja looted a piece.<br>
<br>
UGHT OHH, time to go home... to make a long story short.. yeah, anon is not a liar, hes just prolly still in the guild and scared.. I may or may not post when i get hom to finish the story. Who knows and Who cars.. Hope it was good reading and informative of to the kind of &quot;family guild&quot; Revolution is and as to why thier turnover rate of solid players is rather mind boggling.<br>
<br>
P.S. this wasnt a flame, i honestly dont care, and the few that i do care about know all about revo's misleading and selfishness in its upper ranks. I just posted cause i wanted to defend anon guy and his truths. Hell, im in a wonderfull guild now and love the game. Revo is dead and gone to me. I remember people, not the guild as a whole. <br>
<br>

As for how things are in EACH guild<br>
<br>
You get accepted, you stay by the rules.<br>
<br>
You dont like them...you leave...very simple.<br>
<br>
Both guilds abide by the same VI commands..<br>
<br>
The last one you type in each is /guildremove.<br>
<br>
I know Rif and Xav more than most do...I dont know Mojak more than the rumors that fly..so I cant speak for or against. But I do know Revolutions policies, and they are more family related than you can imagine...and more than you care to admit. I would speculate who you are, and I could narrow it down to maybe one and if the guild your in accepts you for what you are, I feel sorry for them.<br>

Isn't there a rule about Anonymous flames getting deleted ?  I guess thats only when they dont flame Xaviera or Revolution..<br>
<br>
<br>
well..  this isn't an Anonymous poster.. anyways..  <br>
<br>
This is Rheannon  60 Rogue in RNG ..  aka  .. Sargy  50ish Monk.. <br>
<br>
<br>
He's currently in RNG..  but he has been in Dies Irae, Revo, SP, Vis Veres, Equilibrium .. and probably a handful of other guilds..  I know him IRL ..  He is the cousin of a friend of mine who also plays EQ.. This is why he was in DI and Revo with his cousin and myself..  <br>
<br>
He left Revo about 8 months ago because he was not GIVEN a Trakanon Rogue BP that dropped..  Long story, but he ended up playing a cleric who was already present at the raid because he logged on right before the pull. When the rogue bp dropped we had a rogue present who actually needed the BP so it was a no brainer.  He got mad and quit revo because &quot; Im your real life friend,  fuck those people.  You take this game too seriously,  you are fucked up in the head &quot; ..   Because I refused to treat him any differently from any other member of the guild just because I know him IRL..  When he left , he vowed to be in EVERY guild on the server. He was in a bunch of guilds I dont even remember them all.. VV, RNG, Equilibrium for certain, and I think SP or Requiem also.. <br>
<br>
He is a cousin of a RL friend..  I dont really care for him all that much, and my wife doesn't like him at all, so I hadn't seen him out of game since the first run in.. About 2 months ago he showed back up without a guild tag and expressed interest in joining Revolution.  I told him he could go through the same process an anyone else,  post his intent and we'll put it to a vote..  At that point I was told &quot; Man you are so fucked up.  You should be inviting me on the spot &quot; ( because I know him RL ) &quot;Fuck you.. Im a 60 rogue I'll get into any guild on the server TONITE.  You just watch , I'll be in EV tonite &quot; <br>
<br>
He didn't get into EV ..  /bow EV ..  But shot me a tell a few hours later wearing an RNG tag to tell me to fuck off again.  That must be why he's trashing EV here as well. But he's a rogue so I dont know why he would approach Lejina ..  I guess his therapist can deal with why he hates her..  I just know why he hates Me and Revo.. <br>
<br>
<br>
Cant really comment on the specifics of his post..  mainly because there were not really any ..  Cept something about GEBs on coaster..   Coaster had GEBs in like Feb 2000 ..  There were 12 members of Dies Irae at that time and he wasn't one of them... My pair were given to me by Fairfax who was our Shaman ..  so no clue what the hell he is talking about..   Since his only specific doesn't even make any sense I dont suppose I have to address the generalities.. <br>

I don't know squat about Revo, never really dealt with them.  Not sure why this person is sucking up to E/V... though I can't refute anything they mentioned about E/V, that's my take on Mojak and his guild also.<br>

It's the principle. If you're going to flame, have the balls to at least let people know who the fuck you are. It's put in bold all over the board, it's standard policy, and it's just fucking understood. If you're too much of a pussy to give your name, then get the fuck out.<br>

<br>
I had hoped that getting away from us would help to ease your paranoia ..  There is a reason that no less than 6 of your friends/guildmates here in Revo recommended you seek therapy after you left Revo.  But this conspiracy theory here is great.  I guess it goes right in with the posts from other EV about us buying a staff from Legends.  So maybe you had some help in arriving at this.  But its not good to see that you are still suffering from the same delusions that led to your accusing us all of beign out to get you,  then threatening people with coming to their home to kill them.   <br>
<br>
We are not out to get you Brandon..  please seek help.. <br>
<br>
OK.. the big conspiracy<br>
<br>
<br>
Fungus Grove <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot; Myself and a full group of EV head into bug caves of FG to get some shard farming done when we encounter atleast 14 Revolution members already at the camp. &quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot; Part of the key to VT quest, and like the only reason to kill these guys other than if your looking for a couple pieces of twink gear that drops off these bugs.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Umm.. you gave two reasons to kill those guys right there ?<br>
and you left off Shiknar Ichor. <br>
<br>
First off.  Revo is not EV .. As much as i wish I could say the Chitinous Belt is twink gear, we have some mains wearing it.  But thats not why we were there.   We were there for Shiknar Ichor ..  But if we are gonna have to kill bugs to get Ichor.. We might as well kill ones that drop loot and maybe a shard for the VT key. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So what i learned from this incident was that for some reason Revo leadership and the &quot;inner circle&quot; was farming shards, and doing it in atleast this case without telling all involved what the agenda of this gathering was and not letting the members roll on or even announcing when shards had dropped.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Again the paranoia Gann ..   you should really take it easy..  how the hell did you come to this sinister conclusion.. especially when your own post contains these lines.. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ganndor tells Miassa, You guys are not farming shards ?<br>

<br>
Miassa tells Ganndor, Not sure what everyone knows and yeah the shards are for some key quest i think. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Thats quite the cover up we have going there.. she knows shards are for some Key Quest .. and that a few people are looting them..  and WOW.. look at this .. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> She responded in shorth that she was getting EXP and had gotten a few shards herself so she wasnt worried about helping at all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Umm.. she has a few shards herself Ganndor..  Doesn't that kinda kill your whole theory right there.. she was aware that some people are collecting shards..  she was aware they drop there.  she was aware they are for some key quest.. and she had a couple herself that she had picked up..   Please explain to me again how you arrived at the conclusion I quoted above.. from the information you had in front of you ?  <br>
<br>
Not everyone is going to give up ten spaces in their inventory to farm a key that you may never get to see.. So most people would not loot the shards ..  However I had most of my VP key pieces before Revo had ever killed Trakanon and once we did kill him..  I looted the very first tooth off the corpse..  I camped the Pained Soul then the next day and I was the first person in Revo with a VP key.   What a horrible person that makes me.. Why on earth would the Guildleader.  and the person who leads most of the raids be the first person with a Key ? ..  I also looted the first Zlandicar and Vaniki hearts revo saw, to obtain the Jaled Dar Tomb key..  I looted the first Zlandicar talisman for the guild's first ST key .. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I also have an Arx Key</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ...   Just figured I would list all my CRIMES out here in public..  I cant imagine why the guildleader and raid leader would have those keys before anyone else.. <br>
<br>
Anyways ...  Yep .. when I run across shards that I dont have.. I loot them..  a few people in the guild do ..  just like Miassa told you flat out ..   Luckily they tend to drop places that we hunt anyways and we can get them as we go along without waiting till the last minute and having to camp them should we ever need them..   A good example of a way to obtain them &quot;on the fly&quot; as opposed to waiting till you need one.. Would be that while<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  out hunting Shiknar Ichor </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.. you can go to the Imperial area and have a chance for a Chitinous Belt,  Brown Chitin Legs .. and the occasional shard. <br>
<br>
<br>
Episode 2 ..  The Deep <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (I notice my RL friend Calloneous (in Revolution at this time) in the deep. this was the day after incident number 1 so i was imediately suspicious of him being there.)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>

<br>
First off.. I dont even know what you mean by thought horrors just past the bridge.. The shards drop in there off ANY horror.. we've seen shards drop off the young horrors you pull doing the Deranged camp even..  There is no particular patch of Horrors.. so this miracle patch of horrors just past the bridge is news to me.. besides,  just past the bridge..  thats not a patch of Horrors..  its a patch of Mushrooms..we were there killing mushrooms..moving back and forth between the patches of Ancients <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> gathering Fungoid Sap</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ..  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;They were slow to respond but did eventaily answer him and did let him loot one after all others had one.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
hehe..  I could tell they were up to something.. they only let him loot one because they were on to me..  but I KNOW what they are up to.   Its a conspiracy ..  The fact that they let him loot one means NOTHING ..  They only did it because they KNEW I was on to them.. That Xaviera.. he's a crafty bastard.. but I know his game.. he will not get away with this.. He's out to get me I tell you.. but I wont let him win.. I will get him first..  he's Evil I tell you.. he's EVIL..  he's EVIL .. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;This tells us that Revo leaders were again being secretive and by all acounts misleading and ninja looting shards for a key quest&quot;&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
What tipped you off to the fact that we were hoarding shards..  The fact that Calloneous looted one ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Its  hilarious that you ran across two camps that I will admit.. were for a SPECIFIC purpose, and they were both related camps ...   But they had squat to do with VT keys.. <br>
<br>
You know Ganndor..<br>
<br>
If members of EV had looted shards as they came across them..  you would not have ended up in such a mad rush camping them at the last minute..  The pressure from having the RARE piece and still needing the &quot;comons&quot; can be stressful.. Especially when watching your guildmates in the new zone having fun..  <br>
<br>
<br>
On incident three.. you have a few of the facts... but not many of them.. I bet its news to the comps that they are taking me to an Emp run..  Since Im level 59 and do not even have ONE PIECE of my emperor key yet..   It was a 2 group Exp run.. that turned into a 30 person raid cause there was nothing else going on..  So we went in and killed the Arbitor and all those named in there..   The fact that there was a loot argument and people left the guild shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's ever been in a guild before.. <br>
<br>
<br>
Again Ganndor..  you are one paranoid fucked up individual.. <br>

To anyone who's been in Revo that is absolutely NO surprise. Half the people leave because they didn't get said loot, and the other half leave because they are absolutely digusted with the fighting and arguing that proceeds (in guildchat mind you)  over said loot, thanks to your brilliant loot award system. Or you could just be that unique case where you get removed because you blatantly call an officer (after he makes some ridiculous accusations) out and successfully make him look like an idiot (/wave Wombat).<br>
<br>
There's no denying that Revo is a family. Dysfunctional yes, but a family nonetheless.  Sad thing is, it would be so easy to reduce your turn over rate if you changed a few simple rules. But I know exactly how you'd reply to that. &quot;That high turnover rate allows us to weed out the people that never really belonged in Revo, and hold on to the few genuine people that fit our criteria&quot; or some shit like that. What you may not realize is that before these &quot;non-belonged&quot; people get squeezed through that twisted filter, they already make out with some loot that you'd prefer stay on long term people that genuinely deserved it. Why not fix the problem at its source? Perhaps those suggestions are falling on deaf ears. Ah well. There was never anything serious enough that happened in Revo to make me leave, which is why I never did. But there's clearly some sort of problem. At least acknowledge it.<br>

Lesson One:   How REAL men flame<br>
<br>
This is so sad. I really pity you. Do you actually ever see anyone in real life??? Had this game made you fantasy life so powerful that your real life just sucks? <br>
<br>
Sure I know you only alternative is to climb into bed with you wife but hey is it really all that bad?  I am sure she was cute once. Just fantasize that she still is. Hey if she is reading this then I want to apologize for pointing out the truth in such a public way. If you weren't such a cow he most likely would be fucking you instead of playing with himself...er I mean a fantasy game.. er I mean on the computer. Whatever you do don't look into the mirror and wonder why you have to take care care of yourself rather than having little dingle attempting to climb on top of you. <br>
<br>
It is not his fault. His real life sucks so he has to retreat into a fantasy where he can feel like the man who pretty women would want. <br>
<br>
I imagine him sitting alone late at night and looking at his wife and then the computer and having to make the choice. Then he runs to the computer!!!<br>
When I think about it I just think of how pathetic it is. There he sits with a coke in one hand and a bag of chips in the other trying to rule an imaginary world. All the while you have to use your hands on yourself and imagine what a real man would be like instead of a pretend god. <br>
<br>
It his not his fault. What a dumb fuck. Maybe your wife just says she hates me while she is secretly longing for a longer more penetrating relationship. <br>
<br>
See weakling...this is how MEN flame. Right in your face and not hiding anywhere. No pathetic anonymous user but right in your face like....real people do who are not hiding behind keyboards when their fingers should be satisfying there wife! Maybe the occasional use of that other little appendage whenever is actually moves from flacid to the full inch of it's height. But then it doen't clear your gut so what really is the point?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So no I did not post the topic but I did post this reply. As You can see I can a much better job other than anonymous asshole.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
The truth is I feel real sorry for you two. Not many others here have the entire lives wrapped up in a fantasy game because the alternative is to have to face each other...maybe even naked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  EEEK!!

I would be worried Xav. This  homo likes to sit around imagining what you are doing at night. I think he has fantasies about you turning away your wife because you have a secret desire to be with him. He longs for the day you publicly confess your love for him and leave your wife.<br>
<br>
What are the stalking laws in your state? Might be worth looking into. These guys have a way of turning violent when their fantasies don't come true. <p><br>
