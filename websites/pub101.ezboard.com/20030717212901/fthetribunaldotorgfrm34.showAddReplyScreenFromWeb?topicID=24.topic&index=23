Its very simple ..... computer Blackjack simulators have run countless hands since the late 1950s and analysis of that data has resulted in basic strategy.  Math doesn't lie, but you can choose to ignore the hard numbers.  In fact, the casinos want you to ignore it because they make their money off of the idiots who do so. <p>Cathol Chevalier <BR>

Yes, and no. In my experience, no. I've never had any problem with counting. But I never were any good at it, and never played all that much. I think they really only boot counters who win. <br>
<br>
Once, a guy mosey up to the table and explained that he had been practicing card counting on his computer all week, so he was really excited to play -- dealer just smiled and wished him luck. <br>
<br>
And myself, I would make make huge changes in my bets, when the count went high, I mean I'd be really obvious about it. I'd play the first seat, bet $5 (yeah I pretty much always played the low end, heh), maybe win, leave the original bet and the payoff there, but then plonk out an extra $40 cos a shitload of 4, 5, 6 etc left the deck when the dealer delt the rest of the table. And then, if they shuffled the deck on me at that point, I'd grab the chips and go back to a $5 bet again. I never had a dealer nor a any pit boss hassle me over it, Vegas, Reno, Tahoe, Atlantic city. I would lose, but I would lose only a little. I think they only hassle people who play a lot, and win consistently. <br>
<br>
The main programmer behind Quake, John Somethingorother -- I forget his surname, not Romero -- he once had a neat story in his .plan file. Said he'd been asked to quit playing Blackjack, I think it was a Vegas place. He counted, and said he'd problably won a total of approx $30,000 (can't remember what time period). He wasn't outraged or anything, and 30k wasn't a big deal to him anways. The pit boss was polite and courteous, saying he was more than welcome to stay around and play any other game, but could he please not play Blackjack, heheh. <br>
<br>
Only problem I ever had, was at the Peppermill in Reno. This place had female dealers only (dunno if this is still the case, they've probly gotten sued over it or something by now), young ones, hotties as far as the eye could see... This dealer wasn't paying attention, and neither were I <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Well, she started shuffling the deck without playing my hand. I wasn't covering the card up or anything, she just spazzed out I guess. So I said hang on you haven't dealt me yet! And since she's shuffled the deck, and players never think of the deck as being random, she didn't want to deal me. Well, I'm sure there are procedures for this that they have to follow, of course. So she brought the pit boss over, and he took a quick look at this, and told her to pay me as if I had won the bet, collect the card and continue. <br>
<br>
No problem, I thought. But then, after the dealer had dealt only a single round, a new dealer showed up. Our current dealer had only done about 5 or 10 min of her shift (shifts are about 20-30 min or so), so this was totally unusual, I'd never see them do this before. And this dealer was totally unusual also. She was middle aged, and stood out like a sore thumb, compared to the rest of the Peppermill babes. And she the most foul, sour expression I had ever seen on any damn dealer. And, she was REALLY good, the fastest dealer I ever saw. Her movements were totally minimalistic, the cards just flew off the deck like bullets. And when she delt me, she sent the cards right into my fingers! You know how you hold your hand on the table, and scrape or shake your hand to indicate hit or stand? BONK, card hit my fingers, I thought it was a coincidence. BONK again. WTF. Third time, I start picking my hands up off the table, wondering what the hell is going on here? And then I realized -- they fucking well thought I had palmed that goddamn card, that I had taken it out of play, and hidden it, to cheat... So they brought this nasty hag in to give me a hint to please fuck off. Obviously, I hadn't cheated, and if they had looked at the surveilance tapes, they could have seen this, so I guess this must have been just a decision the pit boss took on the fly. <br>
<br>
That hag had a streak of 21s, like I have never seen before either -- just wiped us all out. I lost nearly every single hand out of 20 or so, just sitting there in a kinda shocked state... I think it makes no damn sense at all, that this dealer would have cheated, because casinos stand to lose a shitload, if they get caught cheating. But she just had had 21 after 21 after 21, it was nuts. <br>

<br>
I remember looking around a lot to try find single deck games in Reno, and also remember always picking the game with the fewest number of decks. But I also remember reading that the only difference between a single or multi deck, is that it's easier to count a single. With multi decks, you have to remember how many cards have been delt, in addition to how the actual count. Also, a multi-deck can get much richer in tens, than a single deck. <br>

There is indeed a high demand for single deck games.  However unless you are counting, the shoe is not going to change your odds.<br>
