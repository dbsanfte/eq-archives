<br>
Only wanted to key in on one thing that jumped out at me:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> why do they(humans) not continue to evolve now? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's pretty short-sighted to say they're not.  Homo Sapien, the species almost all of us are (a few of you here make me question that =P ) has only existed for about 35,000 years.<br>
<br>
Chimps existed 5 million years ago.<br>
<br>
What came in between?<br>
<br>
The pure arrogance of our species to assume we're the &quot;end-all&quot; of nature is foolish; there are more perfect (biologically) species out there.  Sharks, for example, are damn near perfect - they've not shown any major evolution since what, the time of the dinosaurs? because they got it right.  Sharks only have one natural predator, and that predator has only been capable of hunting them for *200* years.  Not early enough time for them to adapt (&quot;Jaws&quot; notwithstanding :) )<br>
<br>
As for the rest, I agree with Holdan's basic premise:  There's no satisfactory explanation for the beginning - of the universe or of life.  There are good theories - and I accept some of them as good possibilities - but I agree this is one place where science doesn't have an answer, just a suggestion.<br>
<br>
Of course, neither does religion - it has a suggestion as well.  &quot;There must be a higher power&quot;.  Frankly, that's as good a theory as anything else - and this is where, in intelligent debate, I can agree to disagree.  I simply don't accept that particular theory as the &quot;best theory out there&quot; and Holdan does - fair enough!<br>
<br>
Its more the ignorant viewpoints seen earlier on this thread which get me fired up :)  Refusal to believe in the possibility of evolution &quot;because it *MUST* be wrong!&quot; is very shortsighted.<br>
<br>
Oh, and what exactly is the difference between evolution and adaptation?  When you get enough adaptations to be a very different being, haven't you evolved?<br>
<br>
One thing people seem to miss is that evolution does NOT imply &quot;moving up&quot; or &quot;getting better&quot;.  All evolutions are adaptations which give a particular species a better shot at survival.<br>
<br>
In some cases, that adaptation means reduced competition - in that case, there is now room for BOTH species - and you get diversity.  <br>
<br>
Example (i'm making this up because i'm too lazy to look up a &quot;real&quot; example, but I think its clear enough to suffice):  Bacteria need to consume in order to fuel themselves.  If all bacteria on the planet shared a common food source, then all adaptations which allowed them a better shot at that food would be selected - and the species would &quot;evolve higher&quot;, killing off the un-evolved version via eventual starvation.  HOWEVER, if another adaptation allowed a new species to work from a DIFFERENT fuel source (say, from the sun)... now BOTH species would be able to co-exist successfully.  In short order, you'd now have diversity - a &quot;sideways&quot; evolution, if you will, instead of &quot;upward&quot;.<br>
<br>
That's why you still have dogs in this world, even though you also have cats - they evolved in a manner which made them NOT competitors (either because of geography or whatnot).  As such, dogs (wolves) stayed relatively intact while their newly formed cousins worked down the evolutionary chain toward cats.  <br>
<br>
All the interim species between Dogs and Cats are gone because in each change, there was an improvement and the newer cat beat out the older one, until they finally landed on the current &quot;cat&quot; template.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Chimps and Humans don't compete for resources (until very very recently).  However, Homo Sapiens certainly were competiting with Neanderthals and Homo Erectus - and that's why they are gone and we are here.  Our current species had a significant advantage over them, and given a limit on resources, we wiped them out.<br>
<br>
To say that the next version of humanity won't eventually sneak up on us and dilute and then replace homo sapien is pretty short-sighted.  We don't CURRENTLY have another Human species competiting with us - but we very likely will :)<br>
<br>
Not for thousands of generations, though - this stuff happens over MILLIONS of years.  Homo Sapien is probably near the end branch for humanity, honestly - the next evolution will probably be a side-step, not upward, since (unlike ALL prior human species) we are successful in reproducing in every environment - like the shark, we're pretty much only being stopped by ourselves at this point.  We don't need to evolve too much to do away with any other problems. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelcheproudfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 819<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/02 9:43:37 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.renvall.se/start/bild/richman21.gif height=154 width=164></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: With all of the topics sharing this theme:</span><hr size=1> there is some new scholarship that suggest that neaderthal man didn't entirely die out but was breed into the cro-magnon population.

The Hollywood crap you were trying to feed us isn't a very good argument.  Try not to base your political, religious, or social views on what you saw in a movie that was only good because of the special effects.  <br>

And to the person that said &quot;westernized society is killing our eco-system&quot;, you need to listen to more than green peace and Tom Daschle.  Your statement is way off base, and entirely too generalized.<br>

I dunno. The point is that before Columbus, people said the fact that they were standing on the earth was proof it was flat. Made sense really. Except they didn't know they were too close to see the curvature, thus they thought it was proof it didn't exist. So much for that theory.<br>
<br>
The same might be true of God. The matter we interact and consist of might actually be the proof of his existance, yet we are too close to see.<br>

Just like radiowaves. Does the fact that we couldn't see them 200 years ago mean they didn't exist? Hardly. They were all around us and travelling through us.<br>
<br>
We have just begun to scratch the surface of knowledge, and I think it's kinda crazy to rule out much of anything at our stage of development. God may well be right under our nose just like the proof of human existance is all around the virus. <p><br>

its exactly that type of attitude that makes bible-thumpers look like closed-minded idiots.<br>
<br>
Oh, and many viruses don't even have DNA; in fact, by some &quot;textbook&quot; definitions of &quot;life&quot; they're not even &quot;alive&quot;.  Interesting nit-picking of the definition, more than anything, but still interesting :)<br>
<br>
And there's one more FUNDAMENTAL flaw in the above reasoning -  even if Jesus claimed to have proof... how do you know he was right?  And not just off his rocker?<br>
<br>
Lots and lots of people have come since jesus claiming to be the messaih or to talk to God... why don't you believe them, but you do believe Jesus?<br>
<br>
my point is that you're basing your belief system on accepting that Jesus was who he said he was, and did the things his followers said he did.  Of course, his followers were on a propoganda campaign as much as anything... can they be believed? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vacated>Vacated</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/02 11:37:02 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.followmearound.com/links/mirror3/afight.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: With all of the topics sharing this theme:</span><hr size=1> Here's what I believe is a much more interesting question.  I think if we are all honest with ourselves we can say that each of us ascribes to some code of ethics to get through life i.e. &quot;Do unto others&quot; etc. etc.  You can argue that morality is a human construct and is conditioned by Family and society and that's fine.<br>
<br>
What I want to know is why is every human being totally incapable of conforming to these standards of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;?  I don't wan't an explanation in terms of this inability being a function of evolution because that doesn't address the human condition of helpless depravity.  The fact is we all lie, we all cheat, we all steal and we all do things which our conscience convicts us of.<br>
<br>
<br>
So to clarify my question.  Why is it that no matter what effort we put toward living a guilt free life are we totally incapable of doing so? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uadolenandmurray.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adolen and Murray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/02 11:40:07 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://sayree.homestead.com/files/HANKPIC.jpg height=102 width=78></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: With all of the topics sharing this theme:</span><hr size=1> If I look like a close minded idiot, I'd love to know what he looked like.

Second, I've defended my position on Jesus time and time again. Jesus' body is no where to be found, yet Mohammed still rests in his tomb. Jesus healed people, raised people from the dead, turned water to wine, and walked on water. He rose from the dead three days after his death. His apostles so believed they saw Him rise, that they let themselves be tortured to death, when all they had to do was deny they ever saw Him. That's why I believe in Jesus and no one else. <p><center><img src=http://sayree.homestead.com/files/adolensig.jpg></center>

<br>
retroviruses don't have DNA, they have RNA and an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) which makes the host cell create DNA for them.  <br>
<br>
Retroviruses include HIV, the common cold, and the flu, so they're hardly rare :)  I've often wondered what would happen if your cells could block reverse transcriptase... in theory, you'd instantly become immune to all retroviruses.  Cure for AIDS, Common Cold, Flu... that'd be one hell of an evolution.<br>
