The Cleric, followed by his Barbarian companion, motioned for Qykos to have a seat.  Reluctantly, Qykos sat down and motioned to the Bartender for food and drink.  It was a long time before the Cleric spoke and he seemed to not notice the uneasiness of those assembled around him.  Absently, he plucked at the glove which had been replaced on the hand before they returned to the Tavern.<br>
<br>
&quot;This Mark you see upon my hand has been with me since birth&quot;, Cykos began slowly, &quot;and even the Elders of Felwithe can not speak of its origin.  It was an oddity and nothing more for most of my youth and it was not until my passing of the 30th Psalm did I begin to wonder what its meaning was to be.&quot;, Cykos paused as the Bartender delivered the food and drink.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was at this point, I began to search in earnest for an answer.  In the year of my 30th Psalm, My family was called away to the continent of Kunark to spread the word of Tunare amongst the people of Xykos' Tribe.  I went with them on this journey and it was at sea that it happened...&quot;, Cykos trailed away and sipped the wine placed in front of him. <br>
<br>
&quot;The skies had grown dark and the seas grew furious.  The small ship was thrown about like a tiny toy.  Within that darkness, an even greater darkness appeared as an apparation.  Huge beating wings, loud as thunder and swift as any wind; the creature fell upon us.  The fear overcame the most stout of us all.  The screaming and shouting, confusion and chaos raged for an eternity. It was then I noticed for the first time the light eminating from this very Mark upon my hand.&quot;, again Cykos paused to sip from his glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was the last thing I remember of that terrible night and it was the last time I saw my family.  As I awoke upon a foreign shore, I saw about me the wreckage of the ship. It was my only desire to finish the task for which we had been sent.  Praise Tunare, it was not long before I stumbled into Xykos' village.&quot;, Cykos sat quietly for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was the first to see him enter our village.&quot;, Xykos said in surprisingly good elvish.  &quot;By his appearance, it was clear that our Chieftain was to be summoned.  For many days and nights, sickness coursed through our strange guest until it had finally passed.  In tending to our new found Cleric, it was then we noticed the Mark upon which we now speak.  The lore of our Tribe spans many seasons and great speculation rose amongst the Chieftains council.&quot;, Xykos now paused and surveyed the room about him.  <br>
<br>
&quot;The speculation was not about the origin of the Mark itself, it had been long since forgotten.&quot;, at this point Xykos pulled the sleeve of his heavy Tunic almost to his shoulder on his right arm, &quot;The speculation was how it came to pass that we should bear the same Mark from birth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clear surprise and shock was evident on Qykos' face at this new revelation.  The uneasiness grew in Qykos as it had earlier in the evening.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What does this all mean?&quot;, Qykos managed to whisper out loud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Until this evening, we had no path to follow.&quot;, the Cleric spoke again. &quot;Now, it appears that we have a new development to ponder.&quot;, and the Cleric fell silent again.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think Qykos?........<br>
<br>
.....Qykos? Are you sure this is the place of which your friend spoke?&quot;, inquired the Cleric from Qykos.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I believe so.&quot;,  Qykos answered somewhat vaguely as he snapped back into the present from his brief thoughts of the past. &quot;My friend indicated this place to be the home of those who might know of your 'Mark'.&quot;, Qykos added with a slight hesitation around the last few words.<br>
<br>
Xykos shifted his tall Barbarian frame impatiently and began to move further into the entrance of the Great Hall.  &quot;I do not sense danger from this place and it appears empty&quot;, Xykos observed as he continued forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;One can never be too sure.&quot;, Qykos called after the Barbarian, &quot;and do not venture too far away from us.&quot;  <br>
<br>
A slight twinge in his shoulder caused Qykos to pause.  &quot;Why is this bothering me again?  After all this time?&quot;, he wondered to himself.  Qykos turned to the Cleric and immediately was not surprised to see the soft light eminating again from the gloved hand.................. <br>
