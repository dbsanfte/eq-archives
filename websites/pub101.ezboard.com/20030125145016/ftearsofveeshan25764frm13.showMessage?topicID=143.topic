“Where can you be Thelaskir, did you hear of my plan, are you hiding from me, are you waiting, hoping I will show signs of love, are you following me waiting for the words to escape my lips in a vulnerable moment?”<br>
*Distraught over her need to rid herself of the curse she has another Idea*<br>
“I need someone that does not raise so much suspicion when asking about Thelaskir, someone that could easily wander among the cold dark black hearts and a second thought not be taken of them.  My pale skin is my enemy as I try and learn more of the stone, the blood red ruby that holds the secret to my curse, unless this too was just another wild goose chase to lead me from the truth.”<br>
*She sighs heavily for all of her energy, time, platinum, it had nearly consumed her but save one man, one that she could not speak the words that hear heart begged to speak*<br>
“I dare not ask Eglath for she has been through so much as of late, and I would not subject her to the ridicule of her former family.  But there is one with a heart nearly as dark as Eglath’s used to be, one that borders on psychotic, the Cheshire cat grin that makes you wonder what he is up too, I could ask him, though we have never seen eye to eye, we are not enemy by any means, perhaps I could use what is left in my vault, perhaps I could ask my father, if I could delve into my riches of my birth, I swore never to touch of it, but alas I am in a fix, I would do anything at this point to survive this curse.”<br>
*With that she drew a dark cloak and wandered to the other end of the hall looking for his room, what would she find there, is he filthy, will there be dead bones lying about, would he be angry for her coming un announced, could she be placing herself in yet more danger… The questions riddled through her head as she walked nearly to the end of the hall, knowing he had his own place in Neriak but hoping just this one night he could have kept his room in the hall.  There stood the door, dare she knock, her hand moved to make the noise but stopped suddenly, and as if her heart pushed it the rest of the way a gentle knock had now laden the once quiet hall*<br>
“Cadani what brings you here at this hour”<br>
*His room dark, his features exaggerated from the flames that were all lighting his room, nearly speechless she begins to mutter carelessly in the hall*<br>
“I wish to hire you for a job, and I am sorry to bother you at this time, I have a task I cannot do.  I need someone of your kind, err someone like you… I mean I need some help to find out.. <br>
*Her voice trembling, rambling on trying to find the words, the dark elf smiled at her with that grin, the grin that always made you wonder what he was thinking, then he stepped back from the door opening it wide and holding his finger to his lips as to tell her to stop her senseless ramblings and come in, as if drawn in by a force unknown to her she enters his room, she vaguely hears him whisper something about not waking the others as she enters his room.  Still very dark but the flames still dancing and mocking her, his room was immaculate, dark with strange art adorning the walls and mantle, a bottle of brandy and a glass are all that sat at the small round table by the chair, obviously crafted by some of the finest merchants, his room, adorned with the finer things, not a single bone lying on the floor, not a single hidden corpse in the closet… that she could see…*<br>
*Perhaps she judged him wrongly, perhaps she didn’t really know what kind of man he was, perhaps she should have never come, and then he spoke awaking her from her always-cluttered mind as it never ceased run a thousand scenarios through her mind in a single second*<br>
“Would you like a drink Cadani?”<br>
“No I don’t wish to keep you, I will make this brief.”<br>
*Signaling for her to have a seat they both sit by the warmth of the fire*<br>
“Again forgive me if I have intruded, I need some help and I feel you might be the only one I that can help me at this point, not that I don’t appreciate.. I mean.. Ok I need someone to get information from the Order of the White hand about Thelaskir”<br>
*Her rambling words spilling out as if they had been kept for much too long, but now watching his face, not able to read him, not able to see his eyes, not able to notice anymore than the grin, when alas he spoke after what felt to her like hours*<br>
“Hmn The Order of the White hand you say?,  And what would I get for my curiosity of the Order, hmmn?”<br>
*Rubbing his chin and looking at her as if she had something he wanted, perhaps that is how he lives so well, doing foul deeds, making deals, perhaps she would not have enough platinum, then would he tell the Order of her quest and be paid by them to stop her, her mind at times her own enemy, she shakes the thoughts and tries to speak, trying not to show her muddled thoughts as she does*<br>
“I am prepared to pay you well, I could offer you platinum, or an item, just name it and it shall be yours if you help me”<br>
*A smile of great proportions graced his lips as he heard her speak, she was sure now that he would ask for something she could not deliver, though she had now made up her mind to ask her father if she must, she knows he would never turn her down, though if she used the royal riches, she again would be obliged to become the princess, and take all of the duties at the castle once again, that to her could be a fate worse than death*<br>
“I will ask only that you owe me a favor lady Cadani, a favor as I am doing for you, perhaps in the future I will have need of such a favor, and then you can help me, as friends do”<br>
“Yes indeed, that I can do, then we have a deal, you will do this for me?”<br>
*The words again spilling from her lips, but possibly before her thoughts had a chance to allow her the feeling that she got now seeing again his Cheshire grin, what has she just done, her hand extended and shaking with his, has she just sold her soul from one Devil to another*<br>
“I do not wish to bore you with the details, its all written in this letter, though if you have questions you know where to find me, if there is nothing else I will be off.”<br>
*Hoping he does not sense her uncomfortable feelings of the deal she has just made she makes for the door, taking a last look at his room trying to draw comfort from it, comfort as to whom he was, what his intentions were and if he would hold true to his word and find Thelaskir and the ruby that held her future, and if he did, that his wish of her would not be that which she could not repay, she was a lady of her word, she would keep it, though the thought terrified her now… what had she done.. What pact had she made?<br>
Wandering down a different hall she stops at the Rangers quarters rapping on her door lightly and watching that no one saw her and she had not been followed*<br>
“Cadani!!”<br>
*The ranger taking her hand and pulling her inside where a hug followed, the two both feeling good of one another, it had been a long time since the two had visited*<br>
“Hello Levanna, I was told you had moved in but had not seen you, then got word you returned tonight, and wanted to see for myself how you were, ohhhh its been so long my dear, and how good you look!!”<br>
*The two talk for hours into the night, of old times and new, laughing and crying and drinking far into the morning, the two had different lives but had a bond that could not be broken, even though Levanna was now in her eyes and that of her kind, a fallen ranger, her connections with the dark elf were much stronger than that of her own kind, though she never heard it from Levanna she knew that Levanna had killed some of her own kind, a job… a job Thelaskir sent her to do…*<br>
“Levanna I need to ask you a favor, I need you to follow someone and keep an eye on him, he is one in our guild and is no threat to us, but I have hired him for a job and, I just don’t want to be betrayed by him, I fear I could endanger those in my own family, mind you I have no reason to distrust him, I also have no reason TOO trust him.  Just watch and observe, I will set it up that the two of you meet, then he will find no wrong in you popping up now and again where he might be.”<br>
“Yes I am in need of work, I fear since I left the Order of the White hand I have been lacking in work, I cannot lie Idol Cadani... its not in my nature, so I thank you for asking me, no worries my friend I am sure all is well.”<br>
*After a long night Cadani made for her room, a nap was all she would get today, though she felt as if she had accomplished so much that night, a smile formed on her lips, she laughed at the flames now, for nothing could mock her, she was on a mission, and she never will stop until her soul is free from the curse of Thelaskir*<br>

  &quot;What a delightfully treacherous plot unfolds at my very door&quot; he thought. &quot;I shall do this small task and have the very powers of a wizardess to call on&quot;.<br>
  The all too familiar grin forms on his lips. Swallowing the last of his glass of fine red wine, he begins to strap on his armor. The first rays of dawn shine through his window as he sheaths his sword. Quietly he leaves his room and makes his exit of the guildhall.<br>
  &quot; I shall make my way to Neriak, members of the Order can always be found within the walls of my home.&quot; his plan forming in his mind he sets out. Pausing only long enough to summon a minion.<br>
  The shadows of Nektulos forest so fell over Agon as he followed the path that lead to the gates of Neriak. The guards bowed courteously as he entered the city. As his wandered the streets he caught sight of Aphyon, one of the Orders ranking shadow knights.<br>
  &quot;Greetings Aphyon&quot; greeting the fellow knight as he bowed low.<br>

With this new information he once again packed his things for the journey. Heading out the gates of Neriak he followed the all too familiar path which lead him to the portal that would transport him to the glorious city of New Tanaan. <br>
  Upon arriving in New Tanaan he renewed his search for Thelaskir. Agon hired out his sword to bands that wished to fight the creatures of the various planes. For weeks he fought alongside strangers adding weight to his purse and skill to his sword arm.<br>
  Then at last his search was at an end. While engaging the clockworks on the plane of Innovation, he had finally caught up with Thelaskir. As the battle lulled he summoned a minion.<br>
   &quot;Tell the wizardess I have found the one she seeks. I will keep watch on him and see where he goes. Now go carry this message swiftly!!&quot; Agon commanded the skele.<br>
   Being absolutely obedient to his master the minion travels straight to the doors of the guild hall.<br>
   &quot;Wizardess,I carry a message for the wizardess Cadani&quot; Lebor gasps as he enters the hall.<br>
  <br>
