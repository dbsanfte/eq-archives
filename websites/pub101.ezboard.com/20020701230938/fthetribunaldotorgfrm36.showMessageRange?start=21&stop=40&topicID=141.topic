Is that a different story now?  How about before 9/11?  The fact is, America was, and is about making a living.  And these COULD have been people just learning to make a living.  Yes, you are correct if you say &quot;Well had we acted on those damn arabs learning to fly, we would have prevented this.&quot; but I can also say that if they hadn't done what they did, and they were just hard working citizens, the democrats would have been in an uproar for going after them based on racial descrimination.  You can't go after every lead when there are hundreds of leads a day.  Don't forget.. Clinton didn't do a thing when the WTC was bombed in 93, but what was the difference?  Oh yeah.. it didn't actually fall the first time.  The intention in 93 was to bring the buildings down.  The intention in 2001 was to bring the buildings down.  Clinton was so busy reducing military spending to create artificial padding for the surplus, that stuff like National security was compromised.  And as for the people saying &quot;Look what Clinton did for the economy.&quot;  I got news for you.  Reagan put those plans in motion, and the economy boom was because of computers.  Not because of Clinton.  Just like the fall that is being placed on Bush is because the internet boom died.  By the way.. did the media go on and on about how we could have prevented the Yemen attacks if Clintons administration hadn't proposed that we disarm all military when docked in Yemen?  Those soldiers had to WATCH as those militants blew up the ship.  They weren't allowed to have ammo.  Believe me.. the islamic militants have intelligence too.  They knew that and used it to their advantage.  As for the fools saying that Bush knew and wanted it to happen because it would take focus away from the election, why the hell would he care about that?  He won.  It was over.  Yeah I'm sure he wanted to temporarily cripple the economy, and kill thousands of people cause he didn't wanna hear the democrats crying &quot;I would have won but the ballot was tricky!  The people who wanted to vote for me thought they were voting for me, but weren't!&quot;  In that case, if the people voting for him are that stupid, they have no say in the matter. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

They all agreed that he needed something like the Cuba Missile Crisis that Kennedy had to bolster his numbers. I am not saying that he engineered this, but it is odd that less than a year after taking office that was exactly what he got.<br>
<br>
As to his culpability in 9/11, there are many, many facts coming out every day. Vetoing spending more money on counter terrorism, warnings that were ignored form the CIA and FBI both, secret memorandums, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
IMO, he knew there was going to be a hijacking, but figured it would be the traditional kind (foolishly). Thinking there would be little to no loss of life, he didn't act on the info because he wanted a reason to go to war. War is good for the economy and good for bolstering approval in the right situations.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, it turned out not to be a traditional hijacking and we all know the results.<br>
<br>
Now that is just opinion, but I think this administration has been caught in enough lies (lies that involve national interests, not just sex scandals like the previous administration) that their credibility is far from rock solid.<br>
<br>
Plus I really hate it when they use 9/11 to shield themselves from legitimate questions. Calling senators unpatriotic for doing their job is blasphemy in my mind. <p><br>

This post is PURE opinion, so do not judge any other postings by this opinion, for the other post is based on facts.  The US is a business.  I definately feel we were going to take out the Taliban, we just needed a reason to.  <br>
<br>
(Now we switch to fact from opinion here):<br>
<br>
Oil has been diverted AROUND Afghanistan for years now because they refused to let us pipeline through it.  We had a government that was to agree to let us in place many years ago when Afghanistan was peaceful, just before the Russians came in.  The Russians taking it over would have allowed Russian control of the oil flow, so we trained a Saudi Arabian outcast to help lead a rebellion army to take it back.  His name was Osama Bin Laden, and with his help, the Russians were fought off with (And I quote this to show doubt) &quot;little&quot; American help so that we didn't look like we had reasons to do so.  But, at that point, we turned our back on the country when they did not agree to our demands, upsetting the people we helped into power, and ultimately causing Osama Bin Laden to hate us.  It was only a matter of time before we could go in and flush the Taliban out, and place into power someone who would be more.. well.. sympathetic to our needs.<br>
<br>
Now back to opinion.<br>
<br>
This government is a business, and we need to run it as such.  Sometimes eggs are broken, but in the big picture, they're doing what they NEED to do to preserve our way of life.  Period.  What I think sucks, is the fact that they have to do everything underhandedly because people don't understand that if we're not THE super power on this planet, turmoil would be much more rampant.  Bottom line is, there is no country around run better, and no way of life that works as well as ours.  No political system, etc.. etc..  I'm not willing to give that up, but some people won't see it that way.  They think that if we did do some of the &quot;underhanded&quot; things we did, the world would be a better place.  I guarantee you that if we didn't, some nations would decide that their ultimate rule would be better then the way this country is run.<br>
<br>
What is this country?  I'll give you a hint.  It's NOT a democracy. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Your point?<br>
<br>
I think a lot of the lies told are of the &quot;little white lie&quot; type... the vast majority of Americans believe, probably because they want to, that we are somehow morally superior to the rest of the world... the Good Guy, so to speak.  This is silliness, of course.  We are citizens of the United States of America, not the world... we work for our own interests.  We always should - that's one of the reasons I hate much of the UN and what it does.  Most people find it hard to accept the hard truth, however... they prefer to believe that we work together for the common good of the planet, blah blah blah, good over evil, blah blah... so that's what the government feeds them.  They like it.  They want to believe it.  So they do... and it works.<br>
<br>
Least that's my take on it.  So yeah, the government lies.  Does it matter?  Not as long as they're doing what they should to advance American interests.  I believe that people should be honest... but on the other hand, all it takes is any sort of look around you to see that such naive idealism will get you nowhere in real life politics.  It's cynical, but in a world where your opponents don't fight fair, you're dooming yourself if you try to.<br>
<br>
Politicians understand that.  As much as people rag on the media, I believe that they are largely to thank for keeping our leaders honest in this day and age... bad PR is nine tenths of the reason most politicians don't do some of the &quot;underhanded&quot;, as Jaeron puts it, things they otherwise would.  Of course, many of the nations competing with us are unhindered by such restrictions... makes things interesting.<br>
<br>
Anyone in a position of power anywhere has probably said the phrase, &quot;But can we get away with it?&quot; more times than any other.  I don't see this as a bad thing to be fixed (since it can't be), but rather as a given that must be understood and taken into consideration when planning any political action. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

I'm merely pointing out that you'll never hear the other perspective because the media is so biased.  But the fact is, this country is leaning more and more towards left wing point of views.  Not because they make more sense, but because they're pushed on us so hard by the media that we're becoming influenced.  What does frighten me is the thought of having a left-wing country with left-wing media reporting it, with left-wing beliefs and structures replacing what was balanced with a very liberal country. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
I read today that on 9/9, two days before 9/11 for you math scholars, Bush was going to sign an agreement of some fashion that was the beginnings of an international declaration of war on Al Qaida.  For some reason he got caught up in something and didn't have time to sign it (golf game went late or something).  So if Mr. Bush wanted a war there it is.  Now you tell me why he would feel destroying 2 very large expensive buildings that are possibly filled with thousands of Americans would be necessary to fulfill his political and historical agenda.  I suppose we shouldn't overlook that the Pentagon was also crippled and his own house, where his dad was at the time, was also a target.  But he knew and let it happen.  That's a tough pill to swallow.   Excuse my vague knowledge of the facts.  I wish my memory were better. <p><img src="http://bhdonoho.home.mchsi.com/Everquest/images/high_hit.jpg"><br>

Filtering the bullshit, the only thing that could have been reasonably done to prevent 9/11 is racial profiling.  That is the only reasonably solution to our current crisis.   Political corectness has us frisking blue haired grandmothers in wheelchairs while allowing young middle eastern muslims to pass through security without so much as removing their headdress.<br>

<br>
It is anything on the order of selling our most secret weapons and plans to the Chinese?<br>

Is it anything on the order of gutting the military and castrating our security forces?<br>
<br>
&quot;Calling senators unpatriotic for doing their job is blasphemy in my mind.&quot;<br>

In this country we have freedom of speech.  Senators are free to make accusations, and their opponents are free to call them on it.  As a card carrying member of the PC thought police, perhaps you think only your side should be allowed to speak their views.  I am of a different opinion.<br>

How name calling is anywhere near blasphemy is beyond me.<br>

<br>
The current administration has, or has included in its budget proposal, significant increases in military spending... unfortunately this boost covers only the bare minimum needs, considering the large expense of the Afghanistan war.  Evil baby-killing war hawks like myself who actually value national defense would like to see the number raise by a couple hundred billion more, and the military restored to the two-front war state of readiness that it is supposed to be in. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

I am 100% for free speech. I do think there are lines that should not be crossed for moral reasons. Calling a senator unpatriotic because he questions the Presidents actions is very, very wrong imo. In fact I think it would be unpatriotic to not question authority and how it is applied.<br>
<br>
Just like our legal system is built on the adversarial model, so is our government. It is what checks and balances are all about. While they do take partisanism too far at times, it is still one of the gears that keeps our form of government legit. It is not perfect by a long shot, but it is better than most other forms of governments imo. <p><br>

Im pretty sure simply being arabic is still legal in this country (for the time being, we'll see how we all feel after the next attack), but if the FBI did thurough background checks on all adult males (especially single adult males) of middle eastern decent i don't think anyone would wonder why.  another lesson learned in this:  Don't leave it up to INS. <p><img src="http://bhdonoho.home.mchsi.com/Everquest/images/high_hit.jpg"><br>

Hmm..and this guy is suspected of being involved with a terrorist cell in france.  Hmm...and today &lt;checks watch&gt; Sept 10th all these shady figures are meeting in Boston.  And today (watch says Sept 11th) 5 arabs with flight training and a possible history of militant training are boarding the same flight.  Oh and 5 more are on that flight.  &lt;cell phone rings&gt; Oh, 5 more are boarding that flight.  and 4 there.   Maybe I need to get a hold of some people and have the flights held so i can detain these people.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's a farfetched scenario, BUT that is how we stop stuff like this, and have in the past.  You don't need to infringe on people rights by throwing them all in jail cells while you figure this out (other than delaying their flight, but under the circumstance, i doubt they would care in the long run).  The FBI has its flaws tho.  Maybe all that would have been necessary, if that memo was seen, is to tell that field agent to investigate further.  he might have found some similar conclusions, maybe even pieced it together when some of them got together in Florida to brew some anthrax, and maybe his next fax would have had a much larger priority.  Because you see, it goes from a vague report that got overlooked to a seriously specifc wake up the president type of memo.  But it didn't happen that way.  Point is, all it takes is a little investigating by people with the information.  You don't need to lock up everyone.  9/11 fell through every crack.  That is why it happened.  It could have POSSIBLY been figurd out and prevented here, here, here, here , here, and here if someone would have just said &quot;Wait a minute...&quot;  Not the case here.  it's unfortunate.  but i have less interest in why 9/11 happened and more interest in what is being done to stop this busy mall from blowing up or this chemical agent from being found in the air surrounding Chicagoland, or even what is being done in England or France or Australia or Germany to keep those people safe and sound. <p><img src="http://bhdonoho.home.mchsi.com/Everquest/images/high_hit.jpg"><br>

Its just like trying to get a restraining order against someone. There has to have been a threat made and a law broken before one will be issued. It matters not that someone maybe capable of a crime. It only matters if they have committed a crime or made serious threats too.<br>
I am a conservative. So in a serious politically heated battle my words will have a conservative spin on them. A liberal will have liberal spins on their words. Its times like these we need to stop and ignore the political spins and rhetorics. We need only look at the laws and look at the USA as the free country it is to understand how these atrocities are allowed to happen.<br>
Its not that the Republican President failed us. Its not that the preceding Democrat President was a pussy for 8 years and allowed the al-queda to gain strength against us.<br>

Pre 9-11, if someone found out you were investigating every arab american because arabs are known to hijack planes, you'd be screwed.  How would you explain digging into their personal information without a credible threat?  &quot;Oh well you see, we received notice that terrorists might be training at flight schools, and since arabs are terrorists, we decided to investigate these men who are legally here in the US.&quot;  It wouldn't have worked in a pre 9-11 world.  Would that have stopped it?  Maybe, in fact, likely.

<br>
Politics has changed little in two thousand years.  Systems of government have changed and adapted greatly, however... things like the checks and balances which Loegan speaks of prevent many of the abuses of power that were present in the Roman Empire.<br>
<br>
The fact that the United States government was built around the central belief that government is always to be questioned, distrusted, and kept in check is one of the reasons our Constitution has lasted for so long.  We have the slowest, most cumbersome system of lawmaking in nearly any first world nation... which requires a great deal of legitimacy to stay in power, of course, but I'm not going to bore anyone with an essay on comparative politics.<br>

<br>
This may have been posted here, I can't recall... but there was recently a study done funded by some government agency, to determine if racial profiling was the horrible problem everyone thinks it is.  The end result - they discovered that yes, a minority group (in the case of this particular study, blacks) DID appear to break the law by speeding a statistically significant amount more than whites.  The agency sponsoring the experiment went nuts, said it was obviously invalid, and is dishing out more cash to redo it.  I await the second results with glee.<br>

And before anyone goes off on me, no... I don't have anything against African-Americans (as the PC term goes)... except mebbe gangsta rap, ugh. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

There was a study done on that.  The study was done because of one thing, and one thing only.  The FACT that more African-Americans were being pulled over then any other race.  It was felt that this was due to profiling, and in order to prove them wrong, the state police did a study and found that in 55 mph zones, African-Americans did in fact speed more then any other group.  This pissed people off, but in my opinion, only because it proved the critics who said there was racial profiling going on wrong.  What does all of this mean?  Does it mean African-Americans are bad bad (wo)men who break the law more?  No.  Does it mean they have less regard for the law?  No.  Does it mean there is no racial profiling in the traffic stops?  Honestly, no.. I can guarantee there is.  But, does the fact that more blacks got tickets then whites prove there is racial profiling?  Nope.<br>
<br>
Secondly, an essay on the comparison of politics yesterday and today would be an interesting read, not a bore.  The simple fact is, there is much to be learned from the mistakes of the past.  Because people today would be able to understand better the reason things work the way they do, if they are shown examples of whats failed in the past. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Here is an example:<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
FBI Memo to Fox Mulder, Head Director Guy<br>
<br>
July XX, 2001<br>
<br>
Mr Mulder:<br>
<br>
Our agents in the field in our offices here have found that there is a high possibilty of middle eastern men linked with terrorists groups are attending flight school in our domestic flight schools.  Waiting further instructions...<br>
<br>
***END MEMO***<br>
<br>
Response from Fox:<br>
<br>
If terrorists from the middle east have infiltrated our flight schools, you must investigate everyone.  That means whites, african americans, chinese, latin americans, antartic, russian, eurpoean, and also middle eastern natives.  to single out the middle eastern men would be political suicide.  please do not investigate them specifically.  take as much time as you need, as national security is probably not at stake.<br>
<br>
<br>
-_-  That doesn't happen!  Never did!  Although if the memo were looked into and said investigation had taken place then golly gee whiz i bet someone would have been mad then!  shame on you FBI for narrowing down the field.  well that's their job, and that's how they do work.  they dont solve crimes by saying &quot;the suspect is white, so be sure to question any african americans you come across.&quot;  that would be ridiculous.  the ball was dropped, or lost, in this case.  no one got the chance to &quot;profile&quot;, or as i call it, zooming in on the facts. <p><img src="http://bhdonoho.home.mchsi.com/Everquest/images/high_hit.jpg"><br>
