<br>
Admist the hallowed walls of his &quot;Chapel&quot; ...Vlaye sat quietly in his stone granite chair. Never having been much for comfort the office remained somewhat bare, despite a few flowers here and there, and of course his staff leaning against the fireplace that was never lit. It was dank, and very very faintly illuminated, even now in the darkness of the night...Vlaye wrote upon the desk with only the light of a nearby candle, refusing to use any light stones or the such. &quot;Death comes naturally, if perhaps I find a dead willowisp that contains the lgithstone...then it's rightfully mine...&quot; he'd tell that to himself over and over again....he was a logical man...of few words vocally, but of many words written. Letters poured out from him, day in and day out for blessings....from everyone....that was his strange practice..that was what ....made him write this specific letter...announcing that he will be going on his own personal crusade.<br>
<br>
See....even now...the pequliarity ((can't spell....)) of Vlaye came out as the Blue and Green ((Mariner and Pickclaw) Goblins approached him.....standing...his blackened robe falling to straighten itself...he offered his hand...and ..well...a smile....<br>
<br>
Vlaye offered his council to anyone, and many of the Goblins sought this. They weren't mean creatures...though many questioned their motives....Vlaye was reluctant to lay a hand upon them...<br>
<br>
&quot;M' love, here...&quot; The pickclaw patted the Mariners hand now affirmed a she...as he held it's own arm intwined with it's mate. &quot;She's afraid that...it b' 'gainst natural order....for us to wed....is this right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vlaye stared at them....eyebrows crinkling a moment...<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you love him...?&quot; to the mariner<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes...of course...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then there is no problem, seek Erollosi...&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning Vlaye grasped a book from one of many others....he gave it to them &quot;Read...and be happy....now leave me sight..&quot;<br>
<br>
The goblins were angered a moment.....thinking he was shunning them off..until they read the title &quot;Love shall conquer all&quot; ...a ....very very strange goblin giggle erupted from the couple as they seemed to almost skip off.....leaning over...Vlaye grapped his letter he was previously writing..and nailed it to his door....open..so all may read.<br>
<br>
Dear all my students and the like:<br>
<br>
Time is short....who am I kidding....time is far far too long....and it was time that I went on my own personal crusade to better myself...in these times that try over and over again...I shall give council to those who get none...even a tier'dal deserves a chance at their own happiness...as long as it doesn't hurt others...you will understand in time....you always do....<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>
<br>
Vlaye D. Esperatus<br>
Priest of All <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Vlaye was already on his way..having grabbed his staff.....he'd come back for the next few days....gaining strength slowly...then after which..only to read his scriptures...it was time that he sought out to help...instead of waiting for them to come to him...he shall go to them...followers of the true god.....all of them...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
((Summary: Vlaye's quiet, brunt, he believes all gods are the right god depending on your situation/soul he listens to all problems and refuses none....He is not your typical priest...that's the hidden story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Give a tell if you want to confess yer sins! ))<br>
