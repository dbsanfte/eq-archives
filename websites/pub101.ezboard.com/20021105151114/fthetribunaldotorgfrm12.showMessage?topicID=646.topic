Nice try at a half-assed attempt at Bandwagonning the Vazaelle R&amp;F. Ok, not really, but at least you know how to cuss a little I guess.<br>
<br>
Tribanal R&amp;F is like watching old people fuck, it starts up slow, and ends quickly without much sperm-slinging in the middle. I hope you play EQ better then you attempt to flame, cuz from where I'm sittin all I can see is you giving each other blowjobs over an orc pawn raid.<br>
<br>
Looks like you didnt have much to say, KrackAss, except that you know how to click on a link. Good job Private DICK! Reading your post on there was like you giving yourself a rectal exam, the only thing that came out was shit.<br>
<br>
Although I have to say, Vazaelle R&amp;F isnt much better at the moment. Emarr flames are much more amusing to me.<br>
<br>
Oh, and in case your Board Bitch tries to edit my post, I'll save a copy so she cant get her ass stained claws on it.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

You are a fucktard and a goddamn moron from hell Tardman. When i have bragged about having a train of retards backing me up. Let me spell this out for you so maybe you can understand it. I_AM_A_STAND_ALONE_PERSON_! The only train of retards around here are the ones you get pulled down upon you when you attempt a post.<br>
If you had half a fucking brain you would know that CreepiCrawli is none other that BIRCH himself. Birch is VCC's equivelant to you. Nothing more than a dumbass with a one track mind whos brain de-railed before the trip started. Being flamed buy Birch is like being flamed by you. Its fucking meaningless.<br>
The ONLY reason I even bothered to reply to this thread is to let CreepiCrawli know he did not fool me. I know who he is. And to let you know that you have once again proved yourself to be the Tardman EVERYONE calls you.<br>
I didnt die for a noble cause. I am still alive and well. You on the other hand shoot yourself in the foot everytime you open your mouth. Please aim a little higher next time.<br>

<br>
This fuck came over here most likely because no one on his server gives him any attention anymore.<br>
<br>
People who walk over to the boards of others to troll do it because they have issues in real life - maybe mommy or daddy won't recognize their existance, so they come here to get some sort of attention, they are so starved for attention and personal interaction due to their social diseaselike mannerisms that they have to find it anywhere they can.<br>
<br>
Don't play their games - You post that they are lame whores with not the slightest bit of intellect - we all know this.  All you are doing is catering to them.  The best way to deal with impotent fucks like this one is simply to not acknowledge their existance. <p><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/mccannk/tag2.bmp></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www228.pair.com/judygale/Gsmile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 586<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/27/02 12:42:18 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SydesJokes/files/Pictures/h/homer_simpson.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tribanal Flameboard?

The fact that I can go cross server and exploit the retards of this board while exploiting their retards just burns your ass huh gimpwad. It just re-inforces the fact that you have always been nothing, you are nothing, and will remain nothing the rest of your fetid life. <br>

Speaking of shrunken sacks, anyone read that post on the TZ board about that fight? Half the comments on it are about 'OMG Red people are so much better than bluebies'. You'd think they all thought they were 'straight outta Compton' or something. People who makes RL issues out of game shit, or even in-game issues out of flameboard shit deserve to have a boulder tied to their cock and pushed over the side of a cliff.
