He was 30 years old.<br>
<br>
A cause of death has yet to be determined. <br>
<br>
The Dallas quartet was on tour with Ozzfest when Williams' body was discovered. Ozzfest had played the Verizon Wireless Music Center in Noblesville, Indiana, on Tuesday.<br>
<br>
Wednesday (August 14) was an off day for the tour. Thursday's Ozzfest at the Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia, will go on as scheduled, according to a manager for the outing. <br>
Bolstered by the hit single &quot;Bodies,&quot; Drowning Pool's debut album, Sinner, has sold more than 1.2 million copies since its release last June, according to SoundScan.<br>
<br>
Drowning Pool were the breakout band of last year's Ozzfest, beginning the tour with an a.m. set on the third stage and eventually getting bumped up to a more respectable second stage slot by the middle of the trek. Near the end of the tour, as &quot;Bodies&quot; was omnipresent on hard rock radio and video outlets, Drowning Pool had played select dates on the main stage.<br>
<br>
For this year's Ozzfest, they were promoted to the main stage for the entire tour. <br>
<br>
Taking their name from the 1975 Paul Newman film of the same name, Williams, guitarist C.J. Pierce, bassist Stevie Benton and drummer Mike Luce formed Drowning Pool in the late 1990s. Williams, who was nicknamed &quot;Stage&quot; by Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell for his incredible stage presence, was the last to join the group.<br>
<br>
The band's career started its ascension after Drowning Pool's demo tape wound up in the hands of Atlanta quintet Sevendust, who tapped them to open their tour. Tours with Kittie and (hed) p.e. followed, and the band signed with Wind-Up Records, which released Sinner.<br>
<br>
In between Ozzfests, the band hit the road with Disturbed, Adema and Stereomud on the Music as a Weapon Tour. <br>
<br>
&quot;He was the sweetest man you'll ever come across in your life,&quot; Disturbed singer David Draiman said Wednesday. &quot;[He] didn't have a bad bone in his body, just very kind-hearted, very good-natured, very genuine, always trying to make everyone around him smile. [He was] always trying to bring some life to the party with his own little dramatic flair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone loved him,&quot; Draiman continued. &quot;I don't know a single person that has ever met Dave Williams and not just instantly fallen in love with him. He could charm anyone to death. He was a very special guy. It's shocking.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Drowning pool was from the area I live in. The bands music was an inspiration to many and to myself.  While at a concert a man about to leave to fight the war in Afghanistan, got a chance to go back stage and meet Dave. He told Dave that he was leaving in a few days and served in the Marine Corps. Suddenly members of Pantera walked and started to talk to Dave. Dave told them he would be with them in a few minutes but first he wanted to spend some time with the Marine who as soon to leave to fight for our country. This was said today through tears of the marines that shared that moment with Dave. It is sad to see someone like this, who was so down to earth, have something this tragic happen his family, friends and fans. Dave will be missed deeply. May you rest in peace bro.  -Mcbeth Dupree<br>

PUBLIC MEMORIAL PLANNED FOR DROWNING POOL SINGER DAVE WILLIAMS ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 18, 2002<br>
DROWNING POOL MEMBERS OFFER COMMENT<br>
<br>
A public funeral service has been planned for Drowning Pool singer Dave Williams. The event will take place on Sunday, August 18, 2002 at 2:00 P.M. sharp. The Plano Centre, located at 2000 East Spring Creek Parkway in Plano, Texas has been selected as the location. The event is open to all those who wish to pay tribute to the singer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Surviving members C.J. Pierce, Stevie Benton and Mike Luce shared the following thought: <br>
<br>
We lost a band-mate and a best friend today. Dave Williams was one of a kind, and a friend to everyone he met. He was a good man, and a giving person. Not a day went by when he wasn't giving somebody a little present, and touching everyone around him with his passion. He was full of energy until the day he passed, and undeniably full of life. To the end, we were having a great time. We will miss him.<br>
<br>

McKinney, TX-75069<br>

Anything other than flowers, send to,<br>

No.<br>
<br>
Caring about and idolizing people who dont even know you is sorta strange to me. He wont be missed by me. He wasnt killed in some tragic event that effected a nation, he died most likely from indulging in too many drugs. You never even crossed his mind but yet you make three posts to somehow point out this person.<br>
<br>
Why will he be sorely missed? cause he wont make anymore music? who will sorely miss him? I hope only his family.<br>
<br>
Keep holding that lighter up. I will post when my pappy dies, perhaps they will hold a memorial for him and people he didnt know about will boo hoo over him. We spend way too much time focusing on stars and idols.<br>
<br>
It just boggles me, when an average person is so quickly forgotten but we must celebrate the life of a celebrity. Why am I am calling them average, why is there life have less value in people's eyes. Cause someone can sing, act or scream in a mike for a few hours we must all stop when they overdose and fuck up their life. Screw that. If ya want me to show some saddess, you are barking up the wrong tree. I would rather shed a tear over someone I know then someone I dont know. <br>
<br>
When you die, you want people to overlook your death because you werent a celebrity? <p><center>

<br>
I can only assume you are either very young, or you have had so much pain in your life that you are totally immune to the passing of another life, maybe the guy meant nothing to you, but he meant something to someone.<br>
<br>
I've never heard of the band, I've never heard of the guy but I'm not on here having a pop at one of the posters.<br>
<br>
By the sounds of it he was down to earth and to some people out there he will be missed, I can only urge you in future to keep your opinons to yourself<br>

He does make a good point too.<br>
<br>
 He may have confused me with someone that idolizes these guys because I showed remorse.  I showed remorse because someone who had someting going for him died, that's all.<br>
<br>
It bothers me that what he did had going for him is in the entertainment field.  It as a shame that they make ungodly amounts of money and reach god like status in the eye's of kids for something so petty.<br>
<br>
Music should be something to make you happy after a hard days work, or pick you up when you're blue.  A distraction to pass the time, nothing more.<br>
<br>
If you are a hardore music fan, listen to me.  Stop litening to the music, and start listening to your head.  This death shows you yet again that these guys are just kids too.  They got lucky, the made tons of cash and didn't have enough in them to control themselves.  They're not worthy of being idolized, and if they're being honest they will tell you the same thing to your face, but being idolized is their cash cow so they won't be honest.<br>
<br>
Music keeps the true thoughts in your head from being heard.  That's nice for a brief time when you need a break, but you need to listen to your head more. <p><br><br><br><br><center><img src="http://home.dejazzd.com/tombern/Personal/Jeffs/Enzo2.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1285<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/16/02 8:14:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1985.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dave Willians of Drowning Pool will be sorely missed...</span><hr size=1> Or maybe it's just the people you pick. One of my favorite bands is Pat Benetar. She and her husband have been married over 20 years, they have kids and they support efforts to stop child abuse.<br>
<br>
This is a couple (her husband Neil is the guitar player) that has been together in a crazy business for over 20 years and raised decent, normal kids. Not all performers burn out.<br>
<br>
Also, when Waylon Jennings died, I posted a goodbye. I am not a huge country fan, but his music held a place in my life. What's wrong with feeling the loss? So what if he wouldn't be at my funeral, he has no way of knowing me. I knew him through his music. Maybe not the real him, but the part of him that he put into music. Music is a VERY powerful medium that influences almost all of us. Anyone not a remember the song that they danced with the high school hottie to? Or the song they heard on the radio right after they lost that hottie a month later? Anyone not have a song that can pump them up before the game? Or make them feel better after the lose a game?<br>
<br>
And yes, Waylon had problems with drugs and alcohol, but know what? There is alot of stress in a performers life... hell there is alot of stress in every day peoples lives. Who am I to slam on him unless I have walked in his shoes and lived in that world? If he went around glamorizing drug use and burning out like some performers, then maybe  there's a reason to criticize, but he didn't. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I see nothing wrong with recognizing performers who effect us as long as it is in perspective.<br>

I don't even think I heard of them, guess I'm not that up on stuff. I kind of knew who Ailalaahheiyiiaha was because she had started getting film roles.<br>
<br>
Waylon died? Wow.<br>
Ahah pat benatar rocked when I was in high school.<br>
<br>
The thing is people are always going to die who make or do things you are interested in, while everyone else isn't a lot of the time. Its going to happen more the longer you live. If you mention someone dying at Verant or something it is more connected with what this board is about.<br>
<br>
The one time that something to do with culture outside of EQ was of interest to me on an EQ board, was the morning I got up out of my slacker bed around 9 am (unusually early for me) and saw on my guild's board something about an airplane hitting the world trade center. This sent me into a 4 day blur of watching MSNBC and CNN continuously.<br>

Oops, can't edit. Then I was watching live after i ran over and turned on the TV and saw the other plane hit. An hour or so later one building after the other went plop. This was probably the first thing in a generation x'rs life which happened that was semi noteable at all since there have been no real wars or what not. I'll probably remember it when I'm 90, like older people do pearl harbor today... but iimagine how much more they'd remember if they saw the whole thing live on CNN and MSNBC. <p><center><BR>

But I care because they were just a local band playing in Dallas clubs just over a year ago. Just Like the toadies started out in Dallas. Many of the people in Dallas like to hit the local music scene. If this had happened to the toadies and I liked their music as much as I do DP then I would go to their memorial too. And not because I am friends with the lead singer of toadies cousin. But because I am a fan of the band. Right now on the drowning pool website msg board there are ass holes posting that they are glad he is dead and that the band sucks. Nice way for people treat people and fans of the band. Did I know Dave personally no. I have friends that have meet him, and my ex-girlfriend works with people that used to go with him on tour when they first got a record deal and had their first demo played by the local radio station 97.1 The Eagle. So yea maybe I went out of line here and posted. Maybe someof you dont care about the band. And some don't know of the band. but if your just gonna talk shit about the band, or dave. Then you obviously have nothing better to do then to gloat about someone elses misfortune. To me this means the end of a great up and comming band. If you have never heard of the band or their music goto there website, download some mp3's of &quot;Bodies&quot; or &quot;Tear Away&quot; This band is not for everyone I know. They are an alternative/rock band. I for one would like to go to the memorial. The only thing bad about it is they will have the body for viewing to the public as well. I do not know if this will be a good idea but I think it is his family's and fellow band members wish to allow the fans to see and say good bye to Dave.<br>
