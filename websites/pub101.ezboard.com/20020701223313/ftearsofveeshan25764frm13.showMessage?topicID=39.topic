After a long day of fishing and drinking, he had eaten a light repast and headed to his room for a rest, and now woke up in the evening darkness.<br>
<br>
Grumbling, he stood up and rummaged through his nightstand for a lightstone, his light sleep shirt flapping against his hairy legs. Finally finding it under random dungeon keys and various items reminding him of his former life as an adventurer in the Champions of the Light, he lifted it above his head as it blazed to life in his hand, illuminating his spare room.<br>
<br>
His eyes flicked across his belongings - a tinkered fishing pole that was a gift from Julep, his armor and weaponry adorning the walls, a small keg of ale. Nothing out of the ordinary, until his eyes lit upon a small folded slip of paper sealed by wax that had been pushed under his doorway. His brow scrunched up in thought as he padded towards it, his socks making dull 'thomp' sounds as he crossed the hardwood floor.<br>
<br>
Grabbing his sword from its sheath on the wall, he slowly unlocked his door and glanced outside into the dimly lit hallway. First right, then left - but nobody was nearby. And if the walls had even seen anybody - well, they were keeping their secrets. Closing and locking his door, he picked up the slip of paper, which almost slid out of his grasp. It felt slightly greasy, and had almost a faint smell of brimstone on it.<br>
<br>
Hardolar grunted, and then looked closer at the paper. The wax seal (which had an unfamiliar sigil on it) had a faint blue aura around it - indicating that it had some kind of ward on it. Grunting, he threw it upon his study table which was already scattered with notes of his own from his past adventures and grabbed a tankard of ale from the keg sitting beside the desk. Sitting down at his chair, he began to try to dispell the magic that was on it.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Six hours later, and the sun was peeking over the mountains. Hardolar sat eating breakfast in the Inn's common room, looking at the note sideways. It sat in the center of the table, still unopened, mocking him. Toying with it, he eventually gave up and decided to send it on to Gnostik Gnollhugger - who probably was still in Kaladim's clerical halls at the moment. Leaning over, he rang the call bell and the innkeeper's help was at his side almost immediately.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, sir?&quot;, the innkeeper said, breathlessly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need ta have this note taken, under extreme confidence, to Gnostik Gnollhugger in Kaladim&quot;, Hardolar drawled in his thick dwarven accent, &quot;Do we have a messenger leavin' fer Faydwer today?&quot;<br>
<br>
As the Tiger's Roar was effectively owned by the Champions, they had messengers leaving the inn almost constantly, taking guild messages and missives to other halls throughout Norrath.<br>
<br>
The innkeeper nodded, his jowls shaking like jelly. &quot;Aye, sir, that we do. I can give it ta one who is due ta leave within the hour, if you like.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hardolar nodded, and sealed the note within a missive scroll. Sealing it with wax and enabling the magical ward on it, he handed it over to the innkeeper who dropped it within the messenger pouch behind the desk. An hour later, it was on it's way to the far off continent of Faydwer - via the Wizard rings of the Karanas - the messenger was heartily sick of boats, and wanted to see some of the moon called Luclin.<br>
<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Gnostik turned over the missive scroll in his hands, shrugged, and broke the seal. The folded note dropped out, along with a description of Hardolar's of how it came to be in his possession, and what he tried to do with it.<br>
<br>
Gnostik's brow furrowed as he looked at the Hardolar's note. The aura around it seemed to almost..slick to his sight, as if he was viewing a fish through oily water. Picking it up, he turned it this way and that. At the frayed corners of the note, however, the aura was sharp and clean. Gnostik grinned slightly. This spell on the note only notifed the one who had placed it there that it had been opened - sort of a 'receive notification' - however, the manner that it was received by Hardolar required more careful scrutiny.<br>
<br>
Gnostik left his quarters and headed to the spell practice area, held for the clerics of Underfoot to practice their spells without worry of interference by those blasted Stormguard warriors or other inqusitive individuals. Checking the first few rooms and finding them occupied by beginning clerics who flinched at his presence, he muttered stifled apologies and finally found one of the larger rooms that were normally used to teach group combat.<br>
<br>
Closing the door behind him, he activated the magic absorbing effects of the walls and ceiling around him - this ensured that any magic used would not penetrate past the solid rock around him, thus protecting those others that worked and lived above, below, and beside the area he was in.<br>
<br>
Preparing himself mentally for the task he was about to perform, he meditated for a minute, and cast defensive and protective spells on himself. Grasping the frayed note at the corners. Raising it above his head, he cast Cancel Magic as he pretended to rip the note open.<br>
<br>
A slight sparkle shimmered across the room as he did so - and then the walls turned cherry red, bombarding Gnostik with wave after wave of elemental heat. Gnostik frowned, his own protective spells protecting him, turning the now opened note in his hands. Apparently, his Cancel Magic had instead reflected the attack spell bound to the note to the walls instead - and did not nullify the notification, which seemed to have triggered anyways. The walls crackled briefly, and then the amount of heat began to diminish as the protective spells kicked in and drained the spell of its mana force.<br>
<br>
Apparently, opening the note without the use of a cancel magic (or, Gnostik reflected, the use of a protective shield and room) would probably cause massive heat to be released, charring those around it in a malestrom of titanic fury. He shuddered slightly, glad that Hardolar had sent it to him. If Hardolar had opened it, it would have changed the geography of High Hold Pass a great deal - and would have melted the Tiger's Roar and the rock around it like wax in a flame.<br>
<br>
Flipping over the note, Gnostik saw an undecipherable scribbling travelling across the paper. It seemed to have no meaning. Peering at it closely, he saw that the writing itself was rearraging into a regular script. Flinching, he peered at it closer. It seemed to be a mishmash of languages, spreading from, of all things, Elder Tier'dal to the Common Tongue, with some Iksar and Elder Dragon thrown in.<br>
<br>
He read the note through, and then clenched his other fist in sudden anger - and fear.<br>
<br>
The note read:<br>
<br>
Four ride away from the Light,<br>
Innoruk's hand be upon them.<br>
Hatred is, Hate comes, Hatred is what will be.<br>
<br>
A friend's hand turns to killer's touch,<br>
Cazic-Thule hunts their souls,<br>
Fear is, Fear comes, Fear is what will be.<br>
<br>
A spectre beckons from a far tower.<br>
The undead howl in delight.<br>
Which will be the one chosen?<br>
Who shall become the Blessed?<br>
<br>
In time, one shall become part of the Darkness.<br>
<br>
