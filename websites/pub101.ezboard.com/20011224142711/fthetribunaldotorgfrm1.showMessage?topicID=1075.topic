The luclin files are not copied to your hard drive next to the Orignal EQ files. So after patching to the Servers and downloading the updates (which ARE copied to your Original EQ files) Your hard drive is working twice/sometimes 3 times as hard to keep locating and loading the files necessary to continue running the Video that EQ needs to produce framerate. It is a recommendation fo sure. Hope it helps for all of you. Also with the memory leak that keeps occuring with EQ I would suggest manually setting your system Page file swap size to a minimum of 100MB and a maximum of 1gig if you can afford the Disk space. THis should help with the memory leak until VI fixes it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Let Them Eat Cake</span><br>  Posts: 308<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/01 3:59:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Defrag for Screen freeze/Desktop Crash</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your hard drive is working twice/sometimes 3 times as hard to keep locating and loading the files necessary to continue running the Video that EQ needs to produce framerate<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Umm... nope. If your hard drive is working that much harder, it's because you don't have enough RAM. Your hard drive should only be grinding while something is loading, not while you are running around in a zone... if it the hard drive is busy while you are just doing stuff in a zone, you lack RAM. It's a good idea to have 512 megs RAM or more -- the prices of RAM are currently so low you're crazy if you don't have that much yet.<br>
<br>
Also your swapfile settings won't make much difference. A 1 gig swapfile is a complete joke anyway, you would never use that much or your machine would grind to a halt. And a fixed swapfile (setting the minimum and maxiumum to the same) is better in Win98/ME, I dunno about XP yet.<br>
<br>
Defrag is always a good idea. But it's hardly likely to fix a screen freeze or crash to desktop -- that's more likely to be video related. <p><br><br>

The everquest dbg file shows a log as it loads where there are about 5 files not being opened. This is the same thing people are posting on the Everquest support site. Supposedly they are working on a fix and it has to do with Directx 8.1 and AMD K6 processors. I will say I am not impressed at all with VI support. If anyone knows a work around please post it.<br>

<br>
let me guess... you have an AMD chipset processor and your motherboard uses the VIA chipset.... go download the new beta 4in1 drivers...<br>
<br>
there is a problem with some nvidia gfx cards and AMD chipsets in XP that causes all directx apps to go into an &quot;infinate loop&quot;.. nvidia keeps pointing the finger at MS and MS points it at nvidia as to why this happens, but VIA has recently stepped up and pointed the finger at nvidia, as well as fixed the damn problem themselves (they're a good company unlike some nowdays)<br>
<br>
but anyway, heres a link to an article discussing the problem..<br>

I have the problem of crashing to the desktop with an out of memory error.  The game appears to try to be read/writing something to the RAM that it cannot.   It happens mostly on raids (every 20 minutes or so, I'll go LD).   It also says to have more than 200 MB hard drive avail, but wtf... I have 19 gigs free.  Also says let windows manage the Virtual Memory, uhh yeah, it is.<br>
<br>
Also,  every now and then, while exp hunting, my screen will lock up for 5 to 10 seconds.   Even more so on raids if I have the new models on.  If I turn everything off or to low, it isn't as bad, but the problem still pops up, and will crash my system back to the out of memory error.<br>

I tried EVERYTHING I could find to fix this crashing/freezing problem. The only thing that has worked for me so far was to REMOVE the Geforce cards and go back to my original config. which was TNT 2 16meg cards, I can still use all of the new models but I have to put texture quality to low. It gets pretty laggy at times but I stay connected.<br>

<br>
It's not an nVidia card problem since it can be repro-ed using ATI and Oxygen Lab cards as well.<br>
<br>
It's not an XP problem since it can be repro-ed using Win2K + VIA's AGP driver.<br>
<br>
It's a VIA problem since it's their chipset that cannot handle the aggressive DMA data transfers which causes them to corrupt the data along the way causing things to break.<br>
<br>
XP + nVidia can more easily expose the problem since XP + nVidia's latest 21.xx and 23.xx drivers are extremely agressive in how it handles data transfers between databuses.  <br>
<br>
VIA's &quot;fix&quot; for this using the beta drivers is to simply disable the MWQ timer (ie., can't fix it so let's just slow it down so things don't blow up).  Of course, being beta drivers they got the MWQ timer registers wrong for the KT266x chipsets (whoopsie).<br>
<br>
For now, the only confirmed workaround appears to be to set the AGP settings in your BIOS to something other than 4x.  At 2x + latest BIOS + 23.11 Detonators, things appear to be fairly stable (well, as stable as can be expected given the absolutely retarded memory leaks in EQ).<br>
<br>
It should be at least a month or so before VIA and the various MB vendors manage to get a tested patch out.  Of course, in a month or so, folks may just end up buying SiS/nForce based motherboards instead... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urygor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rygor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33zard</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/10/01 12:45:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Defrag for Screen freeze/Desktop Crash</span><hr size=1> Ok one question on setting the AGP in bios.. my video card is PCI not AGP so would this help.

<br>
I think Koshy nailed it pretty much. Just one detail : IMHO it's not the DMA channels that are involved, but the crossbridge between the AGP and southbridge PCI bus (which is very often a Via chip, especially on the AMD based motherboards). Am going to try the beta 4 in 1 drivers tonight and see if i can patch my BIOS / AGP settings some more...<br>
<br>
I have been trying all sorts of things lately and I am having the same problems with other "intensive" games. DAoC was the first one, took me some doing before i could run it for more than 2 hours without crash. Then Wolfenstein. Was "playable" with my old board, swap a GeForce 3 and it crashes every other minute. New EQ : i just cant stay logged for more than 5 minutes. Yes - this is a joke...<br>

Intel boards with no VIA just don't see these problems.<br>

Add to that the fact that AMD isn't nearly as demanding as INTEL when they certify hardware as being compatable and you soon find that that extra 25$ for going Intel instead of AMD or VIA is money well spent.<br>
