Just a heads up.  There's a new patch too..  even if you got the patch for the Blaster attack, I'd suggest downloading the newer patch from Microsoft.  I betcha the fertile young minds of our world's virii brewers are already hard at work.  Within a week there'll be another Blaster-type out there.<br>

Most copies of XP automatically patch themselves for critical patches, unless you've (stupidly) turned that functionality off.  I know when XP first came out, people were paranoid (whaaa i don't want my PC contacting Microsoft without my permission!) but the benefits of auto-patching critical bugs FAR outweigh any paranoid delusions that Microsoft is out to steal your hard drive that I think most people have that turned on now.<br>

Someone said something earlier in this forum concerning hackers I believe, I do agree with them, they have become really lazy if they have to wait for a security update to be posted, before they try to even find it for themselves.<br>

Name one virus/worm in the last 5 years that came out and exploited machines *before* the vulnerability was disclosed.  Hell, name me one that exploited machines before the fix was released.<br>
<br>
As for relying on firewalls, yes, firewalls are good.  Having firewalls and patching your machine is better.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, security isn't some binary switch you turn on or off.  It's basically a layer after layer after layer of obstacles that keep malicious twits out of your system.  <br>
<br>
With just a firewall and an unpatched machine, your only line of defense is that firewall.  If I can find a way to circumvent it, your machine can be exploited.  And no, I don't have to attack your firewall directly.  Hell, even firewalls can have flaws in their code allowing for remote attacks.  However, if you have a firewall and a patched machine, not only would I have to get through your firewall, I would also have to find a different vulnerability on your machine to exploit it.<br>
<br>
The more layers you create, the better the security model.  Ideally, we would create an ungodly number of layers protecting every single byte of data.  Unfortunately, that tends to become expensive and unmanageable very quickly.  So the end result is a compromise.  In most cases, the cost of patching your machine is very low relative to the benefit it provides. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1240<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/03 1:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> On top of my head, though i certainly dont remember the chronology : when were the Lovebug / Melissa flaws announced ?

It's very true that the auto patching is a good idea though - even if i keep doing mine by hand (hard to break old habits...)<br>

Email viruses don't count for the most part.  If you email an executable to someone and they double-click on it, you've not exploited a security hole, you've exploited human stupidity.  Calling systems &quot;insecure&quot; because people receive and launch email viruses is stupid - sadly, however, microsoft has basically had to disable certain functionality from Outlook since it was clear that too many users were too stupid to ever catch on that an email saying &quot;CLICK ME&quot; isn't a good idea to launch.<br>
<br>
The ONLY exception on that one I can think of was someone who found a way to make Outlook trigger the exe even without you having to open it.  THAT was deadly, and I don't know if MS had patched it before the worm spread or not.<br>
<br>
Koshy - I know there have been a few that caught everyone by surprise - Code Red was one, wasn't it?  I know SQL Slammer wasn't, but there was some high-profile bug that was only exposed once it was exploited. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1241<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/03 1:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> Hmm wasn't Lovebug doing that ?

Where Netscape mail you had to actually open the exe file.<br>
<br>
Nimda also took a vulnerability in the MS IIS system.<br>
<br>
The IIS patch WAS posted on MS site for a good year before hand, but available via a patch and not windowsupdate for a good while.<br>
<br>
From what I remember some fool brought his infected PC to work and it spread a bit here on systems that had the latest patches using windowsupdate. I remember that very well cause one of my machines I had just finished updating for a test enviroment became infected and I was pissed after words.<br>
<br>
Koshy is correct and I have always kept up to date but I do it by hand after I review every note for the patch so I am aware of the situation and why it needs to be applied. I was hasty in my other reply to point out there are other methods used or can be used so that the sys admin or user can review the impact and effect the patches can cause to the system. This auto patch is good for the novice users that do not care about such things. <br>
<br>
Technically in the process of finding the security hole it was exploited at least once on the machine it was found, but technically we are not speaking. I do not think I could name one exploit based on your criteria without having the time to actually do some research, I am sure there is at least 1 though.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koshyoftribunal>Koshy of Tribunal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/03 6:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> Melissa and Lovebug are macro viruses and require direct user intervention to spread/infect.  Nevertheless, the corrective patch was available quite a bit before they started spreading wildly.<br>
<br>
Code Red was around mid July of 2001.  The fix for Code Red was available mid June of 2001.<br>
<br>
Nimda spread around Sept of 2001.  The fix for Nimda *was* the fix for Code Red which was available mid June of that same year (Nimda was basically a single worm which attempted to exploit several pre-existing flaws to spread--it was effective because it used multiple attack vectors.  The cumlative patch for Code Red would have stopped Nimda in it's tracks.)<br>
<br>
Remember, these are *fixes*.  The disclosure of the exploit is usually a few days before the actual fix is released (disclosure at least to the security community).<br>
<br>
Face it, these so called &quot;hackers&quot; are just not that smart (if they were, don't you think they would be doing something more meaningful).  The VAST majority of what you think of &quot;hackers&quot; are script kiddies.  They take code published in security flaw disclosure documents and copy/paste them to &quot;hack&quot; systems.<br>
<br>
The simple fact of the matter is that the truely talented hacks in this business are people you never hear about.  They often work for security companies spending hours trying to crack systems and once they find a breach, they work directly with the vendors to fix them.  Unfortunately, that sort of thing isn't very glamorous and doesn't make for good Hollywood movies (nor for that matter the evening news).<br>

I think there are a couple problems that cause the messes we see, some Microsoft's fault, some consumers.  Microsoft's monopolistic gouging of OS prices would be my #1 complaint against the company - this makes it ill advised for the average Joe to upgrade to the most recent OS's.  Don't believe me - how many of you just bought Window XP this last year?  Get ready for Longhorn...<br>
<br>
The second Microsoft screwup is the default settings in XP installations.<br>
<br>
The third Microsoft screwup is that they have NO free human to human support.  They are like the only mass consumer market product company in the world that I know of that is like this.  <br>
<br>
Grandpa and Annie, the single mother of two, are not going to find the MS KB and wade through all that crap.  She's more likely to ask a friend who may or may not have a clue.  With some of these viruses that are non destructive in nature, a lot of people have no idea they even have them.<br>

Oh, how about a prediction.  MS will buy one of the larger Virus companies in the next two years and integrate it into the OS. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://kot.jellopit.com/rowe/rigerprance2.jpg" style="height:211;width:117;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

MS being able to automatically read system info. and push changes to your OS (be it anti-virus updates, security patches, etc) is something that a certain small but vocal segment of the marketplace rallies against it seems. It's a great idea for 95% of the home, small office, etc. users however.  I could see them doing this in XP Home, but not XP Pro (or making it an option there). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koshyoftribunal>Koshy of Tribunal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/26/03 7:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Microsoft's monopolistic gouging of OS prices would be my #1 complaint against the company...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think you need to do some research since your claim isn't supported by any of the facts available.  Here's a start:  Check the price of MS products prior to them having market dominance and check the price after.  You'll find it interesting.<br>
<br>
For example, I recall when I bought Microsoft Office 4.x (the version that included Access) for $500 ($495 without shipping and handling--don't remember if it was MSRP or it was discounted retail price) more than 10 years ago.  Today, Office XP Professional (which includes Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Access/Outlook) is MSRP-ed at $496.  A whopping $1 increase in over 10 years.  Keep in mind MS Office 4.x was hardly the market leader that Office XP is today.  Infact, at the time the general consensus was that WordPerfect was a better WP and the only dominant product in MS Office was Excel (I don't think I need to mention MS Access 1.1 here...).  Of course, given the relative buying power of $500 in 1991 vs. $500 in 2003 it could be argued that MS products have actually gotten *cheaper* over time. <br>
<br>
Generally, when I hear about someone pissing and moaning about how MS is using their market dominance to abuse prices of their product, what is really comes down to is that it's no longer as easy to pirate MS products. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The second Microsoft screwup is the default settings in XP installations.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It would be nice if you were a bit more precise on this.  While there are aspects of the default XP installation that I don't necessarily agree with, most are merely personal opinion (i.e., I don't care for the eye candy and certainly not that silly green Luna theme).<br>
<br>
If you're referring to things like firewall, auto-update, IIS etc... keep in mind something:  Firewall is enabled by default if you turn on networking, you have to explicitly turn it off.  Auto-update is also enabled by default and again, you have to turn it off.  Ditto with IIS, it's not installed by default, and you have to install it manually.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The third Microsoft screwup is that they have NO free human to human support. They are like the only mass consumer market product company in the world that I know of that is like this.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The only?<br>
Once again, you need to do a bit of research there.<br>
I'm hard pressed to find any mass consumer market vendor who provides any higher level of support these days.  The simple facts are for the consumer market, support is a cost center (meaning, it's not a revenue generator).  That means almost every major vendor today will choose the most cost effective (read: cheapest) support infrastructure that they can get away with.  Microsoft is not really that much different in this respect.  Used to be, that MS had one of the best support offerings available (go back a few years and check the support available whenever you bought a MS product).  Now it's certainly not the best, but it's support level is no way the &quot;only mass consumer market product company in the world&quot;.<br>
<br>
I would advice you to actually check this out if you don't believe me.  Give a call to Sony support and see what you find.  Sony is almost synonymous with consumer electronics.<br>

The original idea was that it would be an option for all systems.  However, the default is to allow it and it would require certain specific actions by the user to &quot;opt out&quot; (with the requisite &quot;YOU GONNA DIE IF YOU TURN IT OFF!!!&quot; message wrapped up in technospeak as to keep the non-savvy users from accidentally turning it off).  It was scrapped for the obvious reason (note Rig's complaint about the &quot;default&quot; installation of XP--if this was put into to effect at XP's RTM, Slashdot would have fucking exploded from the orgy of foaming at the mouth Penguinistas jerking off at the prospect). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1261<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/26/03 8:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> Actually...

NFS is easily the most brain-damaged of all file systems ever conceived.  You're aware of it's history I assume?  It was largely born out of the fact that Sun was unable to keep their servers up and running.  Consquently many of the design constraints of NFS was absolutely idiotic for a network file system.  Since it's inception, it's been one ugly assed hack after another to make it &quot;fit&quot; into it's role as a network file system.<br>
<br>
I hope to hell NFS NEVER makes it way into the NT source tree.<br>
<br>
As for drive letters, NT doesn't need them at all.  All DOS device names (including drive letters) are symbolic links in the kernel's name space.  You can change these links at any given time.<br>
<br>
The only required name space entry is the initial mount point (similar to Unix's '/').  Typically this is the C drive.  Even that can be altered if you absolutely wanted to--although, it would require you to drop in a IFS driver to keep various components from breaking.<br>
<br>
For the other drive partitions, drill down through the Disk Management snap in.  You'll see the option of mounting partitions to specific mount points rather than drive letters.  Combine this with DFS and you have pretty much the same thing as any network based file system under Unix.  Infact, my workstation has three harddrives, it however has only one DOS drive partition--drive C.  All other partitions are mounted off directories off C.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>c) it offered a decent shell natively (tcsh for instance)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Tcsh is decent?<br>
Nevertheless, a more functional command line shell is in the works.  It's been a low priority for Windows development so it's late in coming.  Longhorn will include a new command line shell which will provide far more than the STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR piping of Unix and current NT command line shells.  You will be able to &quot;pipe&quot; higher level constructs between processes.  <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>d) had a more refined process control<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You're gonna need to be more detailed in this.  If you mean a utility like 'nice', I recall writing something like that a long time ago (NT 3.5 era) and not finding much need for it so the code base has since stagnated.  Hell, even standard process signaling tools like &quot;kill&quot; have been ported to NT several years ago.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>e) it came with a C/C++ compiler and the MFC / D3D libraries weren't so damn messy (and yeah i am really not buying into this C# stuff yet)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sorry, free compilers aren't that common outside of gcc (which ironically is available for Win32).  Of course, gcc is next to useless without the necessary libraries and headers--unless you want to implement your own libc among other things.<br>
<br>
Simply put:  WinXP isn't an OS whose primary target audience is a programmer.  The typical user for WinXP has no need for a compiler nor the necessary linker, libraries, headers, etc...  <br>
<br>
Developers for Windows have a TON of resources available to them.  Some freely available (SDKs, MSDN library, various tools) while others aren't (IDE, compiler/linker, etc...).<br>
<br>
As for MFC, it has it's birth in Windows 3.x era (16-bit Windows--check out all the stupid references of PASCAL, FAR pointers).  Given this, it carries a lot of kruft from that time frame for legacy support reasons.  VS.Net's MFC is certainly cleaner, but quite frankly it's too heavy weight for anything other than full blown Windows app using all the damn widgets.  WTL does a decent job of providing a leaner framework but it still not perfect--fortunately, you have the source so you can modify it if need be.<br>
<br>
As for D3D, what's &quot;messy&quot; about it?  And no, I won't accept that COM makes it messy.  COM is no worse or better than other ORB implementation.  Having cut my teeth on CORBA and having done some work with OpenDoc (anyone remember that?), I see nothing really messy about COM.  The whole religious argument about inheritence vs. aggregation, is just that, a religious argument and nothing more.<br>
<br>
Lastly, what does C# have to do with this?  Do you perhaps mean .Net Framework?  C# is merely the language, the .Net Framework is more analogous to MFC/D3D (well sorta, it's not a direct replacement--not yet anyways).  Sun Microsystems notwithstanding, get used to the idea that programming language will be largely meaningless.  It's the underlying technology and frameworks you need to deal with.  Don't like C#?  Fine, write managed C++.  Don't like C++?  Write VB.Net.  Don't like VB.Net, write J#.<br>
<br>
Any half-assed developer should be able to pick up a new language in less than 2 weeks.  The underlying technology...that's a whole different ball of wax. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koshyoftribunal>Koshy of Tribunal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/26/03 10:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I said OS and you offer me an example of MS Office?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I said do the fucking research.<br>
OS prices followed the *SAME* pricing guidelines.<br>
The reason why I brought up Office is because I never &quot;bought&quot; a copy of MS Windows for MSRP.  Infact, of the 4 or 5 licenses I owned, every one of them came with a machine I bought.  Which is generally *the same case with most users today*!<br>
<br>

Are you asking why an application written two years earlier could not import a document written using features and object streams that didn't exist before?

I'm sorry but I'm not following the gist of this.<br>
I just checked Adobe (is that consumer enough for you?), and their support options are actually worse than Microsoft.  Adobe will give you free phone support for installation/defect issues.  But all other support is on a charge basis.  Microsoft will give free support for installation/defect issues and also give you 2 incident calls for free.  <br>
<br>
Keep in mind how incident calls are defined:  If it's a flaw in the software, it doesn't count towards the 2 freebie.  If it's a setup issue, it doesn't count.  If it's PEBCAK for non-setup issues, it counts.<br>
<br>
As for Sony, it's software support lines are basically redirects to the original vendors of the software--go to Sony so you can talk with Adobe, yay!  As for their electronic device support, good fucking luck.  I assume by your comment you don't own or never owned a Vaio (or at least if you did, never had issues with it). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1262<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/26/03 10:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New avenue of attack for Win 2000K and XP</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
yup - i been looking but i haven't found one yet that does just what i want. if you have ever used Irix, you'll remember what i mean : when you minimize an icon, it doesn't go to your taskbar (yeah ok it's there all the time...), but it drops as an icon on the desktop and you can move it around. Every time you minimize again, it will go back to where you left the icon last. I know it sounds silly... but when you have LOTS of stuff running, alt tabbing doesn't cut it and a taskbar with more than 10 things in it is about useless. organising your icons on the desktop on the other hand is a good way to organise your work. maybe you've seen one of those ? i have been looking on the linux side for the same thing too - no dice yet. and yes i am using virtual desks (i think i have 8 open and in use right now)<br>
<br>
&gt;Hell, if you absolutely wanted to, you can replace explorer.exe with progman.exe and use fileman.exe to manage your files.<br>
<br>
actually i don't have any particular gripes with the file manager other than it can get a tad slow on big directories. for heavy duty file management i go back to the command line anyway most of the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Since it's inception, it's been one ugly assed hack after another to make it &quot;fit&quot; into it's role as a network file system.<br>
<br>
i'll still stick to that hack : at least it supports symbolic linking.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;As for drive letters, NT doesn't need them at all.<br>
<br>
yeah but i am talking XP here. afaik you can't have a unified file tree. you're still going with folders and drives. <br>
<br>
&gt;The only required name space entry is the initial mount point (similar to Unix's '/'). Typically this is the C drive. Even that can be altered if you absolutely wanted to--although, it would require you to drop in a IFS driver to keep various components from breaking.<br>
<br>
yep all this stuff comes in all nice and logical and simple with the mount &amp; links strategy though.<br>
<br>
&gt;Tcsh is decent?<br>
<br>
sure beats &quot;DOS command prompt&quot;... it wouldn't hurt to offer the 4 or 5 leading shells on top of the DOS one. bout friggin time they give us a decent one heh. took them how many years to give us deltree and move in DOS ?<br>
<br>
&gt;Sorry, free compilers aren't that common outside of gcc (which ironically is available for Win32). Of course, gcc is next to useless without the necessary libraries and headers--unless you want to implement your own libc among other things.<br>
<br>
yeah i know - that's more like the icing on the cake. i do next to no development on XP anyway, mostly porting stuff over once in a blue moon. on the linux side, GTK is far worse than MFC anyway (yes it's possible...). GTKMM++ is probably one of the examples of how bad open source can get. Call me crazy... but i did like motif back in the days.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;C# is merely the language, the .Net Framework is more analogous to MFC/D3D (well sorta, it's not a direct replacement--not yet anyways). <br>
<br>
first of : i don't see what C# brings to the table that we need so badly (just like Apple's objective C - why bother extending a perfectly valid language with redundant cruft that tends to breed bad coding). <br>
<br>
second: the .net framework scares the living shit out of me because it looks far more like a contractual trap than an actual solution to a problem. it builds in far too much dependency on MS for my liking.<br>
<br>
&gt;get used to the idea that programming language will be largely meaningless. It's the underlying technology and frameworks you need to deal with. <br>
<br>
they have always been. having said that, there is such a thing as the appropriate tool for the circumstance. I do keep an eye on the newer stuff... but so far i haven't seen anything in recent years that offers any significant benefit over my good old C++ without some kind of significant set of pitfalls. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i'll still stick to that hack : at least it supports symbolic linking.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Slight correction here, NFS supports mount points.  It's a network file system, the counter part for this on Windows world is DFS.  However, if you mean symlinks on the local file system (such as ext2fs) for mount points, WinXP supports it.  Like I said, drill down to the Disk Management snapin, you'll see what I'm referring to.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>yeah but i am talking XP here. afaik you can't have a unified file tree. you're still going with folders and drives.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You can.<br>
Mount points, or what NT/XP calls Junction Points (hmmm, wait they may have changed the name before RTMing...) do exactly what you're talking about.  It will provide for a unified file tree.  Do a search on XP help files for junction points and it should take you to what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i don't see what C# brings to the table that we need so badly<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It brings to the table the same things any higher level language does.<br>
<br>
And there's no such thing as a language breeding bad coding, bad coders will code poorly regardless of the language.  I've enough experience in dealing other people's code in at least half a dozen different languages to know at least that much.  One of the nice thing about higher level languages like C# is that you stop worrying about plumbing details and spend more time thinking about design/architecture.  If anything, I would argue that helps improve your coding standard since it allows you the luxury of thinking more about design.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the .net framework scares the living shit out of me because it looks far more like a contractual trap than an actual solution to a problem. it builds in far too much dependency on MS for my liking.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think you have a misunderstanding here--not surprising since marketing really fucked up big time with the .Net This and .Net That nonsense.<br>
<br>
.Net Framework is Microsoft's implementation of CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).  The CLI is actually an open standard.  Anyone can create their own implementation of CLI on any platform of their choosing.  That means .Net Framework doesn't lock you into Microsoft.  Do a search on something called Mono.  It's the open source implementation of the CLI.  There are obvious cross platform issues on things like GUI and platform specific APIs, but then that's the case with any cross platform framework.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but so far i haven't seen anything in recent years that offers any significant benefit over my good old C++ without some kind of significant set of pitfalls.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The only thing keeping C/C++ around anymore is the fact that there's so many people comfortable using it and reluctant to try something new.  Hell, the productivity increase in using something like C#/Java can't be argued it's just too damn dramatic.<br>
<br>
Is there an overhead in using languages like C#?  Of course.  However, the benefits provided by languages like C# FAR outweighs the ~5 to 20% performance penalty you pay (those are numbers we determined based on internal profiling of our code ported to C# from C++, a port I might add that took one dev about a week and half to do for fairly decent sized project).  I wouldn't recommend writing kernel level modules in C# just yet, but I suspect it won't be long until even that is possible (recall when C++ wasn't suppose to be used for kernel modules because of it's overhead?).<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, if you still perfer C++, by all means stick with C++.  As I said, language is irrelavent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=888.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=888.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=888.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=888.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=888.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=888.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=888.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
