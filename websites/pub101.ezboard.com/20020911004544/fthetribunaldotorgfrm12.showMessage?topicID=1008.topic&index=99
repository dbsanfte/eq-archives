<br>
I disagree. While melee classes are heavily dependent on eqipment, casters are only dependent on resist gear. Most casters already exceed the AC softcap and the additional points, while they look nice on your Magelo profile, mean diddly squat as far as performance.<br>
<br>
Mana gear? Well, yes to a degree, but even the best mana gear only affords 2 extra casts of most high end spells. Besides, if you have C3 up, mana regen negates alot of the need for mana quantity.<br>
<br>
Focus items? Well, if you are raiding you have a mage there. Perma items are nice, but summoned will work just fine.<br>
<br>
HP? HP gear will help somewhat to negate AE damage, but no caster is going to stand up to direct melee for more than 2 or 3 rounds. Use LoS and resists as they are much more effective than HP.<br>
<br>
So, while I agree with you on melee, casters simply require the spells, good resists and some raid smarts imo.<br>

<br>
AC - While there is no concrete proof, I believe most people would agree that there is an AC softcap for each class, beyond which you gain little if any return. For druid that is estimated around 750. I think most druids, uber guild or not, not can attain 750AC.<br>
<br>
Mana Gear - Click on my Magelo profile and you will see I have 920 mana from items. I realize that is not top gear, but it is well above average for most druid. Now what will that 920 mana do for me?<br>
<br>
2 extra Starfire of Ro's for 2250 damage.<br>
<br>
Or 2 extra Moonfires for 2200 damage<br>
<br>
Or 2 extra Winged Deaths for 2574 damage over the course of 2 minutes<br>
<br>
Or 5 extra Chloroblasts for 1925 HP<br>
<br>
Other spells are not time sensitive, so the mana regen would cancel out the mana pool. The one spell I see that might benefit signficantly from the extra mana is Chloroblast, but given that it heals only 385 a cast it does not keep up with the damage of end game mobs anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
HP - I have 585 HP from equipment. This is enough to help me on -some- AEs, however any end game mob will easily do 585 damage in two rounds or less.<br>
<br>
Focus Items - If I have a focus item it saves the mage from having to summon one at the raid. Otherwise there is no added benefit that I can see.<br>
<br>
<br>
So you tell me. Other than wisdom (which mine is maxed anyway), how important is the gear? Are my extra 2250 damage or 1925 healed HP going to seperate me from a druid who only has 750AC and 200 extra mana from non-end game mobs? I don't think so.<br>
<br>
What will make a huge difference is high resist gear. If you resist the AEs, it is a major impact for the healers (I know this from being a healer and having members in my group who have medium or low resists).<br>
<br>
Now I didn't take manaburn into consideration, but other than that, I think the above would hold true for most casters. Yes, it's nice to have perma focus items, but a mage can summon them if you don't.<br>
<br>
FT items are another matter and there is not much I can say to argue that other than that FT is not on most of the items in game anyway, so only a very small percentage of players have any real amount of FT numbers I am guessing. <p><br>

An extra 2200 damage means alot then as does having more HP. BUt what we are discussing is raids and that extra 3% damage I do over a druid with a regular mana pool is not going to seperate us. What will seperate us is:<br>
<br>
Resists<br>
<br>
Connection Lag<br>
<br>
Hardware Lag<br>
<br>
Spells we possess<br>
<br>
And most importantly, playing our character well.<br>
<br>
Take two melee and have one in sub par gear and one in top end gear, and I don't care how well the sub par gear melee knows his class, he just can't compete with the top gear one.<br>
<br>
Put me in ES armor and as long as my wis is maxed and I have good resist gear, I can keep within 10% performance of the better equipped druid. Being a caster is more about raid smarts than gear. <p><br>

Resists are almost useless in Luclin, simply because the majority of Luclin uber mobs don't have an AE worth resisting, and the few who do, have DoT type AEs that typically last for 2+ hours - so once you get once by them, it doesn't matter if you resist every AE from then on, you still have the effect. A good comparison would be the Vulak AE - no one ever bothered trying to resist his AE because it would eventually land, and it goes for 3 hours, or more. So everyone just puts on their AC/hp/mana gear (depending on class). Most Luclin mobs are like this - note: I've no idea how VT bosses compare - resists may become important again in VT.<br>
<br>
Add the length of the average fight against a top Luclin mob (20-30mins, or more) and you get into a situation where the only thing that matters, as a caster, is how fast you are regenning mana, because this equates directly to how soon you can cast your next heal or nuke, and have a net zero, or at least very small, mana loss over that time.<br>
<br>
I will agree with you that caster gear that boosts hp, AC, resists and mana is not super crucial. However, gear that boosts mana regen is so crucial its not funny. Practically every decent caster loot that drops off a top Luclin uber mob has a healthy chunk of FT on it - eg. FT 5 robes and tunics, FT 6 shields, FT 3 and 4 Range slot items, FT 6 rings, and so on. In 2-3 kills (of mobs like Burrower and Cursed esepcially - hell, Cursed even drops a ranger *only* weapon that has FT 4 on it =), you can easily see a total of over 15 FT &quot;points&quot; drop.<br>
<br>
Mana regen is where its at in Luclin - you need very decent amounts of it to last through the marathon battles against Luclin's uber mobs. Caster gear, specifically FT gear, is very, very important against Luclin uber mobs (and I'm talking about the top rank here - mobs like AL, HP, Cursed, Emperor, Seru, VT I imagine). Luclin gear can now make a big difference between casters, just as Velious gear made a huge gap between those melee who had ToV N/Vulak/ST loot and those who didn't.<br>

Ladmo you aint got anything you fucking moron, you might need to fall back to flaming me about Razzine, since thats the one thing you can hold on to that you think I give a damn about. I dont a give a shit, I aint with her now, I havent talked her in almost half a year, but yeah, feel free to keep trying to use that a flame, it only shows that yer flames lack any real gumptation or insight. You are the retard of this board that throws an occasional statement now and then that might be funny. Keep pretending your life doesnt revolve around this board.<br>
<br>
<br>
Krickett I must say how sad it is, you cannot even produce any viable flames of your own, the same old shit, oh god not another Razzine reference, omg, whatever shall I do, he hit me where I dont care. I do notice that the board campers like you and Ladmo often take what they think they know and harp on it like they have an inside tip. You spend all day trying to be part of my world, you know I was involved with Razzine, you know I draw pics, you know I am in EV. Hell the only thing I know about you is you claimed you were the best healer on the server or some shit I got from earlier in this post. I dont care about you, but apparently you care about me, so much you have all this supposed knowledge of me. You are such a fanboy of me son. Its okay though, keep pretending that you think I am stupid and evil, its a good cover for your hurt feelings. The more you protest the more you prove me right.<br>
<br>
So I expect a flame about me involving:<br>
<br>
My Artwork-<br>
    How it sucks, How I used it to get into EV and win favor, How I draw boobs too big, I draw noses too big, My artwork is too cartoonish,....etc<br>
<br>
My Old Relationships-<br>
    How I talked to Razzine on the phone over a year plus ago, How she is in a wheelchair and how you are intrested in people with two legs, How we never met but apparently we had sex, How I fucked her everyday when she lived on the otherside of the country, How I was the only one she fooled and ignore the other dozen plus guys on this server who got fucked over by her also....etc.<br>
<br>
My Guild-<br>
     How me being EV makes me a better player then everyone, How my guildtag is freepass, How I dont contribute to my guild, How I kiss up to my guildmates for loot with pictures, How my guild is mean and how can anyone respect someone in EV.....etc.<br>
<br>
My Posting Style-<br>
      How I quote people and reply, How I interpret things and apparently its twisting things around because people dont understand that words can be interpretted by different people different ways, How I am mean, How I get personal and dirty...etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Seriously if thats the best ya can do, ya better come a little stronger, I have been around a long time, and from what I can see you two bitches are just hanging around sniffing yer own finger hoping to get someone else to smell it too, thinking its a brilliant thing you do. Oh look, a retired poop slinger and noob buff slinger, I am terrified, they might make empty flames about shit they know nothing about....I am shaking girls, really I am.<br>

For wizards, gear WILL make or break you. There is no more drastic of a change to a wizard's ability than can be achieved with a rend or conflag robe. Do melee get large boosts from AC/HP, sure do. But as Sorran is pointing out, for casters in luclin, its all about SUSTAINABLE DAMAGE. When you see a caster posting 120+dps and 80k+dmg to luclin ubers with ac that makes monks and rogues look like paladins, you will realize why gear makes a difference for wizards. *note not saying all casters*<br>
<br>
Because without a nuke robe, and a chunk of FT, that wizard will not come close to those numbers. Give that wizard a rend robe, and watch his DPS skyrocket and become very sustainable while also being inflated. A rend robe makes more of a difference in a wizard's DPS and TDPS than primal makes for any melee. 56 *raw* and instant DPS/TDPS inflation which is indefinately sustainable is more on its own than most melee can achieve on any end game mob in luclin.<br>
<br>
Now, for simple reasoning, have that wizard just rotate the rend robe and ice spear. You will see his DPS, and more importantly TDPS, break 100+ and you will see that same wizard be able to sustain that longer and longer as his mana pool grows. Making mana another important key. <br>
<br>
Now, add in the mana regen factor Sorran is talking about on top of this fairly simple example. The rend robe takes 14 seconds to cast, that means you get 2 full tics of standing regen every robe cast, and pic up a bonus tic every 3rd use of the robe. Never sitting, this wizard will need as much standing regen as they can get. C3, potg, epic, gfam, mc3, chorus of repl. and FT. The more FT, the closer that wizard can reach to the equillibrium of mana usage. The more nukes he can add between each robe usage, pushing his DPS/TDPS up that much more.<br>
<br>
Quick illustration, for a wizard with low mana pool, no FT, and no nuke robe compared to one with 4300base mana, ft5(low even), and a nuke robe.<br>
<br>
60 non uber wizard, most efficient nuke, Ice Spear. <br>
<br>
Ice spear, 1200dmg 300mana 13sec recast, 3.4 second cast with focus ring.<br>
<br>
We will assume, since this wizard needs to sustain this damage for 25+minutes he will cast no other spells (concussion excluded cause of insignificant cost) but Ice spear.<br>
<br>
Focus bracer will be excluded from this example as a way to counter the exclusion of resists and fizzle loss.<br>
<br>
1200dmg/16.4 sec = 73 DPS <br>
<br>
Used 300mana, regained mana for 2.7tics standing (wont sit due to added aggro).<br>
<br>
C3 14, BoF 3, GF 4, Potg 6, MC 3, Bard 18(with IM3) = 48 standing regen...<br>
<br>
<br>
2.7 * 48 = 131 mana regained for a net loss of 169 mana per round.<br>
<br>
3500mana pool from 3100base pool, c3, and familiar.<br>
<br>
3500mana pool/169mana used per round = about 21 rounds<br>
<br>
21 rounds at 16.4 sec each = 5 and a half minutes of sustainable 73DPS before running oom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now compare that to a wizard with a nuke robe, and a bit more regen, and larger mana pool.<br>
<br>
Rend robe = 784dmg 14 seconds for 56TDPS<br>
Ice spear, 1200dmg 300mana 13sec recast, 3.4 second cast with focus ring.<br>
<br>
1984dmg in 17.4 seconds = 114 DPS<br>
<br>
C3 14, BoF 3, GF 4, FT 5, Potg 6, MC 3, Bard 18(with IM3) = 53 standing regen...<br>
<br>
17.4 seconds = 2.9 tics of regen for 153.7 mana regained.<br>
<br>
300-153.7 = 146.3 mana used per round.<br>
<br>
4700 mana from 4300 base pool, c3, and familiar.<br>
<br>
4700/146.3 = just over 32 cycles.<br>
<br>
32 cycles at 9.2 minutes <br>
<br>
That has boosted this wizard's dps by 41 points, and made it almost twice as sustainable.<br>

Now, this was a very very simple breakdown. When you add in the effect of Spell Casting mastery 3, and a focus earing you will see those sustainable times increase quite a bit. Then take in the use of MR2 and the bonuses from mind wrack regen and those numbers extend even further. Just wanted to keep things simple, and this post is already long.<br>
<br>
I am not saying all casters, I don't know about all casters. I know about wizards, and you included me in that blanket statement. Wizards are very gear dependant and it will show in their efficiency.<br>
<br>
Look at those numbers again, the difference between the two wizards. 41dps variation, almost twice as long endurance meaning that much longer before needing rods and that many fewer rods needed to sustain that can now be used by clerics. Not to mention the wizard with the nuke robe could use no more rods, and continue nuking at 56dps with just the robe while standing and regening at a higher rate. <br>

Actual damage done<br>
<br>
Non Geared Wizard<br>
<br>
21 cycles at 1200 damage for a total of 25,200 damage before needing rods in the example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Geared Wizard<br>
<br>
32 cycles at 1984 damage for a total of 63,488 damage before needing rods in the example.<br>
<br>
So, the geared wizard will output 60 percent more damage, while taking twice as long before needing the use of MR2s in the example.<br>
<br>
At the very least you need to concede that gear will make as drastic difference for wizards equalling the difference in gear between a uber/nonuber monks/rogues/other dmg dealing melee (only ones to really compare them to since they are melee equivalents). Stay away from blanket statements bro. <p><br><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22676" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://4.65.47.107/mandosig4.jpg" border="0"></a></center>

<br>
I don't remember anyone having those statistics pre-Kunark. Back then it was a miracle to have 1000 AC. Also, Oneton and Pigg were in TA in those days, while EV warriors had better equipment. I think the most senior TA warriors had AC in the 900s. The best-equipped warrior on the server would have been Crush.<br>
<br>
Ogre warriors had more hitpoints in those days because other warriors did not max their stamina. AC was considered more important as nobody had discovered a soft cap and the concept of MTs with CH chains had not yet developed.<br>

BTW great posts by Mando and Sorran. Those posts really show how an &quot;uberguild&quot; is about advancement through improving all members' characters. <p><br><br>
