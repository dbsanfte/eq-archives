<br>
I just would like to say, I believe that professional basketball games are a very fixed business. It used to be a sport, but now, they consistently push the most money making teams to the top. The Lakers dont deserve to be in the finals, I watched them foul their way through the Kings who outplayed them. Kobe Bryant practically decked Mike Bibby and the foul was called on Mike Bibby which helped the Lakers get the go ahead score.<br>
<br>
Shaquille O'Neal is a piece of shit, no talent freak of nature, who often whacks people with a quick elbow to the jaw to clear them out of the way and he doesnt get called for it. He also camps the lane and  3second violations arent called. Anyone his size could do what he does, add to the fact he is a complete moron, you ever hear him speak about things, he makes no sense.<br>
<br>
Most of the Lakers fouled the hell out of the Kings and werent called on it, and it helped them get their last two victories to push them into the finals. Even the announcers saw this, but they know if they say the refs are calling a bad game, they can get fined by the NBA. <br>
<br>
It is no longer who is best, but who can bring in the biggest ratings. The Celtics were supposed to be in the finals, until the rumor started to float about Jason Kidd beating his wife and being called on it, so that upped viewership and got more people watching the Nets. New Jersey is also the underdog to the Super Lakers who are pumped up by the NBA and given alot of wins by the refs. <br>
<br>
Its a business, and it was a farce to watch, I thought I would tune into something entertaining and a true competition, but it wasnt, the refs clearly called the game to help the Lakers and continue to do so. They might as well just give the Lakers the trophy now and run more Shaq Nestle Crunch commercials and Kobe Bryant shoe spots. I hate the Lakers.<br>
<br>
I might as well watch some college basketball, at least then you see some real competitions. <p><center>

I don't watch much sport on TV (except WWF - er, WWE, but I don't consider that a sport, but more of a Soap Opera with lots of fighting), and that might be because I am a woman, but also because it feels wrong for me to encourage someone into getting more money on one night than I will in a year... <p><center>

<br>
As a basketball player I tended to model my play style off of the finesse fundamentalists like Pete Maravich and Larry Bird.  As such, it's not too much of a surprise that I find NBA basketball to be a completely different game nowadays.  I have no problem with big business, but when you start changing the rules of the game to cater to it (and I don't just mean time-outs and commercial breaks), you know there's something wrong.<br>
<br>
I pretty much stick to watching NCAA basketball.  I find it much more exciting to watch.  The people in the game generally play with a lot more heart and determination.  Most of these guys won't get a chance in the NBA, so they make their college career as rewarding as it can possibly be.  Even though they don't have to risk losing millions of dollars of income on a playoff loss, what they are playing for is far more valuable imho. <br>

All of these &quot;drug induced&quot; homeruns??? Come  on now. From the start of Baseball until 1995 there were a total of 50 players who had a 50+ homerun season. Now in the last 7 years we already have 50 players with 50+ homeruns in a season. The games are being &quot;cheapened&quot; to give the fans what they want to see and rake in the most dough.<br>
Ted Williams was the last player to hit over .400 for a season. I look for that record to fall soon and suddenly become just like the homerun record. Cheapened by lack luster pitching and batters that are 'roided up.<br>
Face it folks. We knew for years that wrestling was fake. Now its coming to light that all proffesional sports are faked to some extent or another. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

Luckily it has squat to do with EQ so I believe your reputation is safe DM .. <br>
<br>
<br>
concerning baseball.. <br>
<br>
The fact that we now have half a dozen people active who have hit 50 homeruns..  and nobody has approached .400...  can be used to prove that drugs are the reason... Drugs can improve your strength..  but not your coordination or your vision..   If people were hitting these homeruns because the hitters are better.. or because the pitchers are worse..  then the batting average record would fall along with the homerun record.. <br>
<br>
<br>
It is very suspect when the STRENGTH related categories have risen along with our understanding of steroids and drugs..  But the batting averages remain about the same..  <br>

Or it might be the sucky inner city guys who would rather dunk then learn how to shoot. The sad part is all the european players coming into the leauge can actually shoot and are making the low free throw and feild goal percentage shooting bastards look bad.<br>

Oh and Baseball sucks anyway, boring as shit, the only team I cheer for is the Red Sox but voting for them is always a let down.<br>

Which would make the players stronger, allowing for more home runs, but not necessarily have faster reflexes, which would allow them to hit more.<br>
<br>
  Though there is no denying that drugs are rampant in professional ( and to a certain degree college ) sports, it isn't the only reason for the increase in player quality ( the NBA is a fine example, look at how tall the average player is now compared to 10 years ago ).<br>
<br>
  That being said, I would have to agree about the pro game though, it definitely sucks ( Basketball ) and baseball sucks at any level outside of a backyard game <br>

<br>
Strength and conditioning training is more advanced today for professional athletes then the Saturn Program was that landed a man on the moon.  Yes Steroids are used/abused by many athletes.  So it means the 50ish% of them that use steroids may hit 40 home runs an average of 425 feet instead of 35 home runs an average of 415 feet.  *twirls finger in the air*  <br>
<br>
Steroids themselves will not make you stronger.  It still requires weight lifting even if you're on &quot;the juice&quot;.    <br>
<br>
Really though, the bottom line though is your average successful high school, not pro or not even college, football player does more weight room work in 1 off season then a major league baseball player did in his entire career in th 50-60s.  And it's not just football, it's all sports today. Flat out, both the players who are and are not on steroids today are vastly stronger, better conditioned athletes then they use to be.<br>
<br>
Now as far as what the professional levels are pushing... yeah Basketball is more of a business today because of the large effect officiating has on the game.   Baseball and football it's not nearly as much.<br>
<br>
But if you wanna see how to run a successful business, do a case study on the NFL.   There was a excellent article awhile back in Newsweek I believe around the time of the Super Bowl about NFL Nation.  <br>
<br>
Hehe really neat facts in there.... More people watch NFL football on Sundays then attend church in the United States.  It is a Religion after all.   Didn't you know it? =P    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 565<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/8/02 11:57:19 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~jakecj7/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Basketball isnt a sport, its a business</span><hr size=1> Are you trying to tell me Babe Ruth wasn't in shape?

As much as I hate the word &quot;dynasty&quot; when referring to basketball, the fact that in the 80s so many teams consistantly fielded the same players for many years in a row added a lot to each and every game.  Now over the course of three years a team can go from worst to first to worst again because of players chasing the biggest paycheck, which consistantly breaks up a team's chemistry.  There's seems to be no concept of &quot;team&quot; anymore, as compared to the teams in the 80s.  They're just a bunch of well paid guys jammed together who are trying to stumble on the right chemistry that makes them win games.  I would hate to be a head coach in the NBA today.  <br>

Football, is i think many would agree the most poplular of the pro sports.  <br>
When you think why, you think of the action but look at schedules.  Football ONCE A WEEK 16 GAMES A YEAR.  You cant just catch the next game, there arent very many to choose from.  Baseball not popular at all anymore 162 GAMES A YEAR. Who wants to watch a slow boring game when you can watch another one the next night and the night after that etc.. Basketball and Hockey are right in the middle at about 82 84 games each i think.  <br>
Watching the hockey last night, going into 3 overtimes is pretty damn exciting.  Its sad although when the fact that there are no commercial breaks makes it harder in OT for the Canes who were only running 3 lines.  <br>
<br>
In Basketball, if you score, oh well chances are the other team will score now on their chance, and its not a big deal.  In Hockey if you score, thats a big deal.  Most games arent that high scoring so a goal is very important and i can be nervous about it the whole game rather than the last 30 seconds like Basketball.
