Bah.. where's the fun in that?<br>
<br>
Actually... EQ and DAoC *ARE* two entirely different games.  I came to realize this the first night I was playing DAoC.  EQ, for all basic pretenses, is an arcade game.  Everything about the game smacks of Quake-style, adrenaline pumping, video-game'ism.  But that in no way is to detract from how good EQ is.  Don't get me wrong here.  EQ and DAoC are, in my twisted and humble, ableit loudspoken, opinion are equally strong in their own rights.  DAoC gives me the feel of an actual old world style D&amp;D game when I play it.  It lacks the first person luster that drew me to EQ so long ago.  Even though I may have come across as such, I'm not here to bash EQ in any real fashion.  My point was trying to touch on how people have shifted as DAoC approached release and the few weeks following it.  Just seems to me though, that people are quick to flame one another and other platforms when their little corner of the virtual landscape is rattled a bit.  God forbid anyone think of the day when EQ does go to the digital graveyard.  What will you all do?  heheheheh  No more will you be Elitist, Vagrant, Companion, Shining Path, Ethereal Honor, etc... you will be another bunch of forgotten zero's and one's collecting dust on some harddrive somewhere.<br>
<br>
Here's food for thought.  When all is said and done, and the possible conclusion to this reality is you do go to meet your maker and be judged for the actions in your life, will it make any less difference if you screwed someone over in a virtual world rather than real life?  hehehehe I can see some people now, &quot;WTF do you mean I ruined their fun?  It's only a game.&quot; hehehe I know that's completely off the topic, just a random thought as I start looking over my desktop to see where my DAoC icon ended up.<br>
<br>

I did it, had a great time, it ran it's course for me, and I quit but still keep in touch with most of the friends I made. <br>
<br>
I don't really see DAoC being any different, so it'll probably be the same cycle there. But whether it's different or not, it's NOT EQ lol. Personally I still love MMORPGs, I just dont want to play EQ anymore. I think it's pretty safe to say that we all love this genre of game or we wouldn't be here, therefore if you quit the only real alternative at this point is DAoC. I will never be back to EQ except to say hi, but that's not to say I have any real loyalty to DAoC yet and wouldn't dump it in short order if their suck factor gets too high or if something a lot better comes out at this point as the time investment is still pretty low. There's probably a lot of other people in that same boat so the question of which is better is moot IMO.<br>

yes, they closed the server count and have a renewed interest in events and customer service. but thats just common sense.<br>
<br>
 i dont think even you are dumb enough to leave your doors and windows unlocked during a crime spree are you? <br>
<br>
since subtlety is obviously far beyond your grasp, what i am trying to say in my previous post is that the trends and statistics you have been using to justify why DAoC &gt; EQ have been present and observed on the release of all new MMORPGS into the market. <br>
<br>
to put it is even simpler terms <br>
ITS FUCKING NORMAL YOU N00B, SO WTF IS YOUR POINT ?!!!! <br>

if you are going to waste our time with longwinded, statistic filled pieces of turtle crap at least make sure they bring something new and relevant to the table.<br>

<br>
I can't speak for everyone who hasn't bailed for DAoC (like you seem to be), but I'm not tired of EQ, not in the slightest.  I still look forward to logging on on my days off and spending time doing something I enjoy, while also spending time with my wife and good aquaintences.  Perhaps it is because well after two years my highest character is only 44 (well, it was before the Blood Reaver) and I don't have to deal with the petty squabbling and guild politics others do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;While you stumble about in an ethereal stupor believing that Luclin will somehow revitalize EQ enough to bring the veteran players back, I'm laughing my ass off leveling in DAoC.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I could care less if people come back or not, if they stay away that means less lag for me, which is a great thing. Also means there will be more places/spawns open if you have a preset group of people you wanna hunt with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Because without a shadow of a doubt, DAoC has something that EQ will never be able to regain; a sense of newness.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Can't argue with that, it's a new game, but how long will this sense of newness last?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;People have put up with Verant's BS for solely 1 reason and I clearly stated that. Only because at the time EQ was the only game in town that was worth a damn.&quot; <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Once again you're trying to talk for everyone.  I know of people who loved AC, and still do.  I thought AC's avatars looked like ass, so I chose EQ.  But then DAoC's avatars just look bland, either being a human of some type or an elf (and all of the non-human races just look retarded, not to mention that they look like stretched or resized and recolored versions of one another).  But the trolls look cool, kinda like Badrock from Youngblood.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;If you need anymore examples of how bad EQ is doing just look at the recent changes.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How are these changes bad?  If it took DAoC to finally shake VI out of their Vision and give players more of what they want, then awesome, score two for Mythic- by not only making the servers less populated, but by making Verant make EQ a better game.  And on this point, I hope Verant does more copying of DAoC (such as the horse deal) because that means I get some of the good things about DAoC without having to start all over in a new game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;EQ's rash at going back to GM events. ROFL, gimped lame events at that.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I like the GM events I have witnessed. And I've never even seen one that has a story to it, just the ones where they change a zone for a while.  I'm sure I'd enjoy the other type even more, if I played during peak hours.  <br>
<br>
Personally, the best roleplaying-ish atmosphere that I have witnessed in EQ was playing on Sullon Zek with my shout and ooc channels off.  And after playing on a red server  I can understand why DAoC's higher levels are PvP.  It's more fun.  It's a totally different environment than a blue server and far less monotonous.  Even in the high levels of EQ, although the mobs have different abilities and characteristics, they all have the same AI to my knowledge.  But playing versus another person, now that is a challenge (not to say in any way that the ubermobs aren't challenging) not only because they can totally change their plan of attack depending on yours, but because there is a potential for there to be so many of them.<br>
<br>
Now, I've not played DAoC so I can't bash it.  But some of their &quot;features&quot; are things I'd rather not have, such as item decay.  I don't care if it is miniscule, if I had to fight and earn something, I don't want to have to take the time and money to keep it's condition.  That in my mind is downtime, which people bitch to no end about in EQ.<br>
<br>
All in all, though I won't be playing DAoC, I'm very glad it came along. And can't for the life of me understand why people want to argue that one game is better than the other.  The better game to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is the one <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> enjoy more.<br>

all the people that i've met on gawaine / midgard who came to daoc from eq have no intention to ever play eq again.  thats probably 2 dozen people, roughly.  there's probably a trend there, ya think?<br>
<br>
daoc is a fun game.  that's the most important thing.  and it has a dynamic that everquest doesn't - something new and exciting for high level folk - realm vs realm.  its not boring pve.  i'm looking forward to participating more now that my character is in the 30's. :) <p><p>

I know I will.  I am *not* optimistic about it, though, as I once was.<br>
<br>
The reason being is the lack of the PVP option in Everquest.  Sure, I could start all over on a PVP server and wastea ton of time getting to a high level, but I really can't see putting such effort into that, especially since EQ was certainly not designed with PVP in mind, and the dynamics of it subsequently suffer because of it.<br>
<br>
The other night I decided I was going to go mess around with some PVP, solo, in Midgard's Yggdra forest.  I play an Albion Infiltrator, level 28, who is specialized in his critical strike (backstab and other such attacks) and to a lesser extent in Stealth and Thrusting.<br>
<br>
I'll spare the intricate details of the journey there, but even &quot;running the wall&quot; (something most MMORPG players are quite used to) there were dangers I had to use various skills and timing to get past.  I had to be aware of monster scout classes who see very far and fetch friends before attacking you.  I had to sneak through a nest of Wyverns (bad bad for a level 2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  strategically placed on the wall to hinder players running through what is normally a 'safe' area.   It was a long run, took about 15 to 20 minutes, and I had to constantly be alert for enemy players hiding behind trees on the way, which they frequently do to ambush invaders such as myself.  I was constantly afraid of death and I was constantly afraid of being attacked, not because I would lose my gear or because I would lose EXP or anything foolish, but because I didn't want any Midgardians to get the satisfaction of killing me.<br>
<br>
Finally reaching an area with a large lake and a road around it, I proceeded to come down from the perceived safety of the wall and run slightly off of the road, stealthed, looking for prey.   3 People came running down the road, purple to me, and I ducked behind a tree, hidden, and watched as they ran past.  Close one.  Running along the road further, I saw a lone Norsemen, yellow con (about even level with me) sitting on the side of the road.  I sat and watched him for some time.  He was not fighting but was running around trees in a repeating pattern (typically used to find people such as me, hidden behind a tree, stealthed, waiting for a victim).  I saw my chance and made a move to one of the trees he was running around and waited.  As he drew closer my heart beat faster.... something that has not happened in EQ since Plane of Fear 2 years ago, and I got ready to kill, knowing that my element of surprise was critical.  He reached my tree, and halfway around it was right in my face, at which point I likely scared him for a moment and he paused and took a step back as I hit a special attack of mine, Perforate Artery (can only use while hidden AND in front of an enemy, very hard to pull off except in instances where you are waiting for the person to come to you and you are not sneaking up on them), and hit him down about 40% of his health.  The fight starts.  He's a warrior using slashing, bad for me as he gets a bonus to his attacks against my leather armor, and hits me for 25% of my hitpoints in one hit.  I'm a bit frail as an Infiltrator, and his 2 hander hit me hard.  I hit him with 2 quick attacks before his slow weapon can hit me again.  Garrote, which is a bonus to damage and snares him for a short time, but uses up about 20% of my stamina, and Achilles Heel, which slows his attacks slightly and chews up 20% more of my stamina.  He is now at 30% health, and hit next hit takes me down to 50%, evening the gap between us.  He hits me with some kind of special attack, causing me to bleed (a low damage but over time, painful DOT). I hit him normally for a measley 20, and 32 damage. Hardly denting his health.  We are dead even, both at about 25%.   I get lucky and his next attack I evade.  I fire off Hamstring, which can only be used after you evade, and hit him with both my weapons and both critical strikes for a total of 117 damage, and cause him to bleed.  His attacks are slow and I know I can fire off Hamstring again, but I miss the attack.  His sword hits me again and we are both at 5% health.  He is still bleeding as am I, yet his is worse as it is newer.  Unfortunately for him, the next 2 attacks are mine and since he is snared, low health, and unable to do much of anything, I get off 2 stabs and he keels over.   15 Realm points are mine.  Not bad for one kill : )<br>
<br>
A message goes out to the zone that I have killed him, and since I figure that people will be coming by soon to help, I re-stealth and wander off into the woods to heal, keeping close enough to watch his corpse for anyone that might pass by and decide to rez my fresh kill (that's a no-no  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   While healing I have to be aware of the monsters wandering near me.  If one turns towards me while I am stealthed, I have seconds to react and move before they uncover and attack me.   All the while I need to heal up quickly and watch my kill's corpse for any of his friends that may show up.  It takes me 30 seconds to get full stamina back, and another minute and 30 seconds to regain full health.   Nobody has passed the corpse yet and it looks as if nobody is near.   I wander down to the road.<br>
<br>
Green con kobold is running up the road in the distance, an easy kill for me, and still worth realm points being green.  I wait right in the middle of the road for them between them and my kill's corpse.   They approach but stop with me in the middle of them and the corpse.... they've seen it and are looking around for danger.  I wait patiently.  The kobold sees no danger and starts heading towards me again.... right for me....  they get within melee range and BAM   I fire off perforate artery again, and they die in one hit to my special move.   I'm fairly sure now, that help will be on the way.  Two PVP messages within the zone usually causes alarm, and sure enough a blue con troll and dwarf are running up the road.   Confiden that the dwarf is the healer, I position myself off to the side and wait to strike.   The troll runs up, patrols around the corpses while the dwarf hangs back....  bad move leaving your healer alone.  I begin sneaking towards him.  The dwarf is staring at the corpses, allowing me to sneak up behind him and fire off Backstab II.  It knocks him down to 40% health.  I fire off Thingh Cut (a combo used off backstab II) and the dwarf is down to 10%.  Before his troll friend or even he knows what happened, he is dead, and I am re-stealthed and waiting patiently a bit off the road from his dead body.   Trolls, being dumb in RL as well as in game, it seems, comes running over and sits by the dwarf's corpse.  Smart.   I sneak around in a wide circle, move in, and backstab him while he sits, instant killing him because of the max damage done while sitting (same as EQ) and the resulting critical.<br>
<br>
There are now 4 corpses on the road, and I am 30 realm points richer.  Getting cocky I wait right with the corpses (but far enough so they can't see me as corpses : P )  and see a green dwarf coming, again, right up the middle of the road.  Perforate artery when he gets close enough and his dead corpse keeps on sliding down the road while he dies mid-run, face planted in the dirt, and me remaining stealthed.<br>
<br>
I laughed my ass off.  It was one of the funniest things I have seen in a game short of Meeo getting gangbanged by scarelings or Quiz dying over and over getting monkey-punched in the nuts by Shiverbacks.<br>
<br>
Well, I should have moved back out of sight, but I didnt.  I got cocky and hung out right in the middle of the road again.  Not wise.  A red troll bard comes running at high speed up the road, zigzagging across it, obviously aware of my presence and trying to seek me out.  Red= death for me unless I can find them wounded, and I try to make it off the road, heart pounding, running slow as hell while cloaked.<br>
<br>
Too late, he finds me and hits me once for 212.  Ouch.  No pansy EQ bard type here.   My heart racing I hit sprint and dash for the monster infested woods.   I can't restealth, he's right behind me but just out of melee range as I run further into the woods zig zagging around trees trying to shake him.  At one point I go left, and he goes straight and I am able to restealth and semi-hide in a low standing pine tree.  He runs around looking for me, is eventually aggroed by a monster and is forced to run from it.<br>
<br>
I live.<br>
<br>
I make my way back towards the corpses.  They are all gone.  DAMMIT someone was able to rez them in the time I spent running from the bard.   I see the group of them down the road.  Purple troll with them.  I sneak in for a closer look to see what forces they have, aware that there is little I can do but watch them at this point, until or unless they do something stupid.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden WHAM I am hit for 382 damage and I spin around to see a nasty purple to me troll with a big ass hammer hovered over me.  There is nothing I can do.  In my carelessness and interest with the main group I forgot to look for scouts, and they were aware that I would likely be near, and had a couple high levels searching for me.  I can't run, as my HP are at about 10% so I hit attack, pitifully miss the troll, and receive another smash from his hammer which kills me.<br>
<br>
Throughout the above experience, I have to say that I was glued to the PC for those 2 hours.  EQ never did that to me, even in it's finest hour.  The challenege and strategy needed to fight PVP is far greater than that which is needed to fight a dragon or other large monster in EQ.  There is no adrenaline rush as far as EQ kills go.  No heart beating faster, no real sense of victory when something dies unless it is the first time killing that monster.  It's you VS the computer, and if you play enough it ends up all being the same, just a bunch of 1's and 0's that rely on &quot;the vision&quot; of the complete heal spell to kill.<br>
<br>
For those asking where the content is, it is and will be made in significant amounts by the players themselves.  The challenges will be far greater, and the level of difficulty will vary on each and every battle.<br>
<br>
Consider other games and their progressions.  Is it more fun to play a real time strategy game against the computer AI or against another player?  Is it more fun to play Quake in single or multi player mode?  Now consider is it more fun to play co-op or deathmatch.<br>
<br>
I am sure that some will say co-op is more fun, and some might even prefer single player, but a majority of players once they have tried all three, will choose a deathmatch game.  Human opponents will test your mettle far better than any AI, and as such victory is that much sweeter, and game play that much more exhilerating.<br>
<br>
DAOC does have a bit of everything with the focus on RVR though.  There are monsters that take multiple groups to kill at the high level, and every class can solo to some extent.<br>
<br>
This is not to say EQ sucks and DAOC rocks.  I had fun in EQ.  I just think that DAOC is more exciting.   It's kinda like riding the merry-go-round and then riding a roller coaster.  If all you've ridden is the merry-go-round it might still seem exciting to you.  Give the roller coaster a try, though, and you'll likely not go back : )<br>

While I wouldn't play on an EQ PVP server, some of the BEST frickin' times and stories I have from my text mudding days were PVP encounters.<br>
<br>
Like the time on a Wheel of Time MUD that I took my Blademaster on a mission with a group of Tower Guards to rescue an Aes Sedai from the Whitecloaks... and I snuck into the room where she was and attacked them all and killed most of them (and their guard NPC pets) before my group waited the 5 seconds to charge into the room behind me.<br>
<br>
That was a rush.... 4 players, 3 pets each... 16 targets.... one hell of a fight.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to RVR in DAoC... always wanted to have large guildwars in EQ but didn't think it could handle it.<br>
