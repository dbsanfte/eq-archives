It is the culmination of one of the main subplots. Once again- enjoy<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Saeleos strode through the threshold of the chamber,  every step poignant in its emphasis on his anger. The very clud of his feet on the stone floor fueled his rage. As Saeleos mounted staircase leading to the dais, he drew his blade and donned the shield. The dais was enchanted so that it was shrouded in darkness. However, as Saeleos drew nearer, the enchantment faded, destroyed by Saeleos’ essence. As the shadows receded, Saeleos was greeted with a floor blanketed in blood. Blood of the innocent; blood of those who could not protect themselves. <br>
        As the throne was uncovered, Saeleos finally laid eyes on that which he sought. A corpse lay there at rest, now barely more than skin and bones. The eyes were sunken and had long ago receded back into the face. The hair, long and matted, cascading down over the carcass’s face and onto its shoulders. The skin, waxy in its consistency, was ghastly pale, and the fingernails were yellowed, crusted, and grown into claws. The body was dressed in a magnificent suit of armor, spikes protruding from all of the joints and Shiravak’s clan emblem emblazoned on the breastplate. The armor, large and unforgiving, stood in stark contrast to the carcass, which looked as though it might crumble at mere touch. However, despite its weak looks, Saeleos was not deceived. While he could cause intense pain to Shiravak in this state, Saeleos knew that he could not kill the being that was Shiravak unless that being inhabited the body at the time of death. <br>
        “Shiravak!” he shouted, “Show yourself!” As if operated on strings by a pupper master, the corpse rose, its gray misty eyes staring blankly in the direction of Saeleos. A voice, hoarse yet unmistakably powerful, issued forth.<br>
          “You have come,” it began, “you have come to end my very existence. You have come to end this wretched, tortured existence. I would almost thank you, but for the fact that now… you must die.” With that, the arm that clasped a mighty pike swung forward, the momentum carrying Shiravak to his feet. While his head still flopped weakly like that of a dead man, Shiravak stood like a live man, tense and ready for combat. Without warning, Shiravak’s pike flew forward, seemingly carrying its wielder in its wake. Saeleos dodged, lashing out in a backhand stroke with his blade as his nemesis passed by.  The blow hamstrung Shiravak, a wound that wound have greatly hindered most fighters. The vampire, however, paid the wound little heed, though it did cause a slight limp. <br>
        The sight reassured Saeleos, as it asserted that Shiravak was vulnerable to physical attack. Shiravak spun around, thrusting his pike forward. Saeleos was ready, and not only blocked the blow with his shield but also drove forward, the pike wedged between Shiravak’s chest and the shield. Saeleos dropped, for an instant releasing the pressure. Shiravak tried to readjust, but couldn’t in such a short period of time. Before he knew what was happening, Saeleos had driven the shield up into his face, and as the spike scraped off of the corpse’s cheekbone, Saeleos fired…. Too late. Fired a millisecond earlier, the blow would have entirely incapacitated Shiravak. As it was, it merely left a gaping wound across the right side of his face: the upper jaw, fang and all, was exposed, the eye socket was partially shattered, and the ear was entirely shorn off. Shiravak swung his head, his blood drenched hair whipping at Saeleos and partially coating his face with gore. As Saeleos clawed at his face, Shiravak seized his chance.  He brought his pike back, intending to end the fight by spitting Saeleos upon it. The strength of pure evil behind him, Shiravak drove the weapon forward with a force that wracked the frail body, which looked as though the force inside might truly break it.<br>
        Saeleos had no chance. Try as he might to get his shield up in time, he was unsuccessful and the blade drove straight through his chest guard, lifting him up in the air. Saeleos lay suspended in midair, impaled upon Shiravak’s pike. The force doubled his body over, causing him to curl up into a ball as his chest was pierced. As the paladin held this position, Shiravak began to feel a vague foreboding that rapidly grew more powerful. Within seconds, his mind was engulfed, echoing primal fear throughout his thoughts. Sure enough, as Saeleos’ body came out of the position, he lived. Shiravak had watched Saeleos die, had felt the dying shudder as it rattled the shaft of his blade, yet somehow Saeleos lived. Only now, Saeleos was much different. He had undergone a metamorphosis, and was now unmistakably an avatar.  As his body spread out, majestic, pure white wings spread out, sending a gust of air that staggered his murderer. The blood that ran down the shaft was a shining, metallic silver. As a drop fell to Shiravak’s wrist, his flesh was seared. A hole was burned right through his hand, yet he hardly noticed, transfixed as he was by the sight. Saeleos’ features, once so human, were now something more. His skin was paler than Shiravak’s, yet was perfect, unscarred and unblemished. The pupils were gone from his eyes, which were now silver orbs. Even Saeleos hair, silver lining his normal brown, seemed to glow, radiating purity. As a pillar of light engulfed the Avatar that was Saeleos, Shiravak burned. <br>
        He screamed until he could no longer, for the corpse collapsed to ash, the armor boiling. Saeleos, fading into the light, could barely be seen. All at once, flame erupted outward. Flame, the bane of vampires, engulfed the city of Shiravak. Vampires turned to ash, their buildings and coffins to soot.  With a single blast of holy flame, Shiravak, his followers, and even his city, were all as nothing.<br>
<br>
        Mere miles away, Gahar and a few of his men took up the rear of the retreating party. Gahar stared sullenly at the twisted palace, wondering what Saeleos was doing. Suddenly, a pillar of light reached down from the clouds into the middle of the palace. It grew wider, until, all of a sudden, an arc of flame shot outward. Gahar alone had witnessed the event, and the sudden flash of light blinded him. The other men, feeling the searing heat, spun around. Some uttered exclamations; most were too amazed to speak. Regardless, there was a sudden panic, and the men all ran forward. Gahar ran with them. No longer having his eyes to guide him, he tripped on the hill.  In their haste, nobody noticed. Maimed as he was, Gahar simply regained his balance, leaning on the sword that had served him so well in his fighting years. In that instance, despite his sixty one years, despite his grayed hair, and even despite his blank, sightless eyes, Gahar, standing tall in his family armor, looked like a warrior again. <br>
        He stood, silently praying for Saeleos when he heard it. The methodic dragging of semi functional limbs rustled across the grass: There was still a vampire patrol out, and the patrol had found Gahar. His senses honed from four decades of warfare, Gahar took his stance, a formidable fighter still, even without his sight and youth. Not a sound issued from his lips and he coldly took two steps forward and brought his blade crashing down on the skull of his first victim. Backing up, he sensed movement to his right, and flailed his blade outward. The tip of the blade sheared into the vampire’s temple, killing it. Wizening up, the last two vampires came at him at once, one from in front and one from behind. Gahar arced his blade, slashing through the chest of the first vampire and shattering its ribs. As he completed the swing, the other vampire reached forward and clamped its claws down on his left shoulder, grasping around the shoulder pads. Gahar issued a vague grunt, groping back behind his head. The vampire leaned forward, sinking its teeth into the General’s throat. As death came screaming towards him, Gahar drove his elbow back. It impacted with the skull of his would be killer, and, after years of decay, the beast’s head gave. It sunk to the ground, dead, as Gahar held his throat, his very life flowing between his fingers. He tried to speak, but couldn’t, and sunk to the ground. Gahar died the way he had always wanted to die: as a warrior.  <br>
