<br>
valor USED to be the motto of comps- the &quot;do not say anything unless you have something nice to say&quot; rule. i remember when people used to say, &quot;those comps are great, they hauled my ass outta the fire, thx comps, k la~!&quot; i guess that was back around the time of &quot;ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!&quot; damn, we, (as i was one of them at the time) were cool.<br>
<br>
and now? what are comps now? a whole lotta nothin', as my mom would say. mostly i hear about the loot. sometimes i hear about some 'achievement', but not so much about the goodness of people. <br>
<br>
used to be i was real proud to say i was once a companion. now i have to preface it by saying, &quot;yeah, i remember comps back in the old days.&quot; sometimes i miss eq, and i think i might like to reinstall it, get the latest expansions, learn wtf i'm doing again. and then i realize-<br>
<br>
nothing stays the same. you can't cross the same river twice.<br>
<br>
-and-<br>
<br>
simply put, things, including the companions, will never be the way they once were. <br>
<br>
so regardless of the level of suck, that's just the way it is, i'm afraid. <br>
<br>
i'll say this though, and it'll be the end of what i'm saying: had the companions been like they are now, back when i had first joined them, i wouldn't have joined them at all, and i feel fairly confident that many of those that were there then, could say the same.<br>

<br>
Mainly because how people (ex-comps) who haven’t even been active in the guild for months, comment upon what The Companions has ‘become’. They simply don’t know what goes on in the guild because they don’t even have a tag, and no daily contact with us.<br>
<br>
Kinv, I’ve really no idea why you are posting all of this. You started off by your angry flame about recruitment, “zerg recruiting” as you put it. I guess this is because you were our previous recruiter, and think it’s totally went downhill since you left.<br>
<br>
It’s quite common knowledge we lost several core members recently...Anyone with half a brain knows that when you lose people, you need to replace them. Anyone with half a brain also knows that your core members take more to replace than someone who doesn’t raid as avidly.<br>
<br>
Anyone with slightly more than half a brain and a little experience in PoP, knows how hellish the flag system is, and that if you want to recruit, you gotta do it in batches unless you want to reflag everyone individually.<br>
<br>
And Kinv, you need to wake up and smell the coffee. No wonder you are seeing so many wrong things in comps (even though you aren’t even on the server), when you immediately think someone that “loves” you is flaming you on the FlameBoard. You instantly turn around and call her two-faced. You didn’t even apologise to her for it (unless it was done privately).<br>
<br>
Finally, it wasn’t Chatja who banned you from the board, it was me. I’m not going to let some ex-member randomly flame my guild and it's leader and still be able to waltz in and out of some of the forums. I don’t see how you could think anything else would happen. You’re the one that chose to talk here, not me.<br>

Like I said, I simply misread Karenne's name. You know that I understand recruitment and you know I understand recruiting in batches and weeding out the bad one's since that was something I had suggested long ago... along with certain standards of play time etc. Where did all that go? Right where I knew it would go when I left. You've known for a long time how I felt about things in that department unless you didn't have time to read all those messages I sent you. To do the PoP content means you need skilled players who play alot and have a respectable amount of AAs. The equipment comes soon enough. I fought for high standards because people who apply to the Comps always say they want to join to see the high end game and play with the best. Sufficed to say that the term &quot;zerg recruiting&quot; was used to cover much more than numbers. <br>
<br>
I don't need to be guilded or on the server right now to know what makes a good leader. Nobody faults you for letting go of that role. You did it far longer than most and I understand how trying it can be. The fact remains though that I also am very aware of who Chatja is and what he is capable of. <br>
<br>
Someone told me today that they're confident that Chatja won't &quot;ruin&quot; the guild. Not because he's a good leader, but because there are other people around that will be there to do damage control. <br>
<br>
I'm really sure that none of my opinions here come as a shock to you, other than the fact I have expressed them here. Some of the changes that former members were hoping for have been implemented now that they're gone... which says to me that the guild now concedes they were right all along. This is no different man. Just because someone is &quot;committed to the guild&quot; or has 90 percent raid attendance doesn't mean that they are equipped to handle the leadership positions. <br>
<br>
Long story short, I couldn't stand by idly while the future of the guild is given to people who can't do the job well. Be angry that I posted here about it, but it can't be said that I'm disloyal or don't care otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to post anything at all. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587400">Kinvaras</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dinars666>Dinars666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/03 11:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oag how about a spoon</span><hr size=1> oag go fuck a goat or something i am at school everyday. and if i wasent.. why da fuck would you care anyway? and i know my english isent the best but i would like to see you writh english if you were from sweden. fuck off <br>

I pay my own bills, my own account, my own internet, my own food, actually all my own stuff. So dont come say stuff about me when you dont know me in rl, cause i never talk shit about you. And if you count me to the younger generation swedes, do that, if younger generation is 20 yeras for you. But you should have 1 thing sure, ive been living alone almost 3 years, and always take care of my own stuff, so dont fucking do a flame about me that we dont care of anything else then a computer with everquest on. Cause i have my own computer. And if you hate us swedes so much, take it with a officer or something then.  Or dont say anything at all. Its peps i dont like to, but i dont say anything about it, cause i dont know those guys in rl. And i dont know you in rl and you dont know me in rl. So fist think about  what your saying about me next time. Yeah i agree we might been like kids on the flame board, but was ,more like joke's, o well. But thats not what i mean atm, what i mean is just what i told you oag. I never talk shit about you in game, and flame a a guy in same guild, thats to much for me. Next time, if you dont like us and all we do for guild is wrong. I mean yeah, we saying things on swedish like Sjogren, Joda.. since you dont liek this, cant you just tell it to guild leader or a officer then ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So dont come say stuff about me when you dont know me in rl, cause i never talk shit about you. And if you count me to the younger generation swedes, do that, if younger generation is 20 yeras for you. But you should have 1 thing sure, ive been living alone almost 3 years, and always take care of my own stuff, so dont fucking do a flame about me that we dont care of anything else then a computer with everquest on. Cause i have my own computer. And if you hate us swedes so much, take it with a officer or something then. Or dont say anything at all. Its peps i dont like to, but i dont say anything about it, cause i dont know those guys in rl. And i dont know you in rl and you dont know me in rl. So fist think about what your saying about me next time. Yeah i agree we might been like kids on the flame board, but was ,more like joke's, o well. But thats not what i mean atm, what i mean is just what i told you oag. I never talk shit about you in game, and flame a a guy in same guild, thats to much for me. Next time, if you dont like us and all we do for guild is wrong. I mean yeah, we saying things on swedish like Sjogren, Joda.. since you dont liek this, cant you just tell it to guild leader or a officer then ?  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No, he's not old sk00L or anything, but he contributed enough (both in 'hours played' and all sorts of things which contribute to a guild beyond just showing up for raids) to feel justified in his opinion, and this is all stuff he was saying internally for close to a year before he left.<br>
<br>
That said, he doesn't know what the guild is like 'today' and what it's like under Chatja.  He doesn't even really know how much went into running it under Temurik, Zenra, Sashanna, Aauminki, or Slannesh (or Nyrkl, but I wasn't an officer under Nyrkl so I don't either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Some of what he's saying was true of the guild at one point, but all guilds go through cycles - in my 2 1/2 or so years of active playing in the Companions I saw it go through numerous near-meltdowns and recoveries, all on the strength of the leaders, officers, and memebers who contributed more than just their DPS (later formalized in the 'policy council').<br>
<br>
When Kinv left things were pretty down - to say they're not today is not my place, of course - I'm not involved or online any more than he is.  if things really are a lot better - GREAT!  if they're not.. well, dirty laundry getting aired isn't such a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Guilds all go through these cycles - as was stated before - and the ones with the most dedicated members and leaders come through them.  People who still play tell me things are going really well right now - that's all that matters.<br>
<br>
To Xanta:  yeah, I joined a family guild that was able to raid planes and kill dragons (&quot;uber&quot; guild!) too.  That's the Companions I miss, too - but EQ changed.  You wouldn't have survived Velious without getting real serious and organized in raiding - it required planning and direction for the first time, not just &quot;pick a zone to raid&quot;.  The guild evolved, and left some people behind.  As the game got more raid-focused on the top end, my interest waned - but I didn't try to hold back the guild as something it was in 1999/2000 when the 2002 content dictated raiding 5 days a week to stay ahead.<br>
<br>
Would I still be playing if it were today like it was back then?  Doubtful.  But regardless, I don't begrudge them changing to something I was less interested in - I just moved on like you did (in my case, out of game - in yours, to a new guild).  <br>
<br>
When Kinv left, I agreed with much of what he was complaining about, and a lot of what he is saying here was true of that guild - but that doesn't allow that things may have changed.  Seeing a group of people go to Vazelle does not imply that all is horrible - perhaps it is possible that they're all just very close friends who wanted to stick together, more than stick with their guild? (isn't a guild after all just a collection of friends?)<br>
<br>
So - Kinv - your points were valid when you left, but neither you nor I knows what it's like today.  Xanta, even more true of you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pyrezipyromaniac>Pyre ZiPyromaniac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/15/03 5:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTF is up with the Comps?</span><hr size=1> Wow!

Maybe i didnt leave the guild like i should of, but at least when i was there in the guild i gave 110%.<br>
<br>
My acct now resides in the hands of a RL friend, goes by name of Vixxy, and if so i wanted i could logg on my old chars at anytime, but EQ is not for me no more. But just thought i would stop by and say hello to the old school troops like Nautie,Sollid, Aaumimkie, Mandoman, Bacris, Zenra and the other many names i forgot, you know who you are.<br>
<br>
All i know, is when i was in Comps, i seen more gods/dragons and the such fall at my feet then i can count, Kinv has some valid points, but atm in time i cant even begin to comment on how the guild is or is going and i will leave it at that. But when i was in there, we were some bad ass mufo's and destroyed anything in our path, Nuff said! <p>Proud Clan member of the 7th Panzer Division &quot;Ghost Division&quot;<br>
