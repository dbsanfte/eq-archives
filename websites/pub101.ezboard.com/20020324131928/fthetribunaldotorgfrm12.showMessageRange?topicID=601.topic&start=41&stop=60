<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lets see what was said:  <br>
<br>
Legendary was pulling EL to RF camp for exp.  Some SP supporters went AFK and got hit a time or two so half a group said they decided to Kill Steal the pulls.<br>
<br>
Guide comes in and says roll for the camp, one of the clerics who had been camping the spawn for over 200 hours in the past 8 weeks didn't want to and is forced to roll by said Guide.<br>
<br>
GM shows up and said it is FFA spawn.<br>
<br>
at hour 50 Legendary had 15 members between level 54 and 60 and a group and a half of 50-51 &quot;friends&quot; in position to kill RF if he should happen to pop.  SP had 11 with one member of Comps at this time.<br>
<br>
Was SP wrong to kill RF?  NO, by all means they got the spawn, they had to call friends and kill RF, Congrats on new Clicky stick.  Boo to the methode used to attain the final mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
what did I miss?<br>

Keep waffling, this is entertaining.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First you set out a buncha facts that have nothing to do with getting the RF spawn, then you  complain about getting tells to leave (conduct).  <br>
Then you complain that SP shouldn't have spawned him cuz you think they didn't have the forces.  <br>
Then you tell me it's not that they got it, it's the conduct of two people.  <br>
Now your saying it's the method they used that matters.<br>
<br>
<br>
...and THAT is what I was addressing in the first place.  Most of the derogatory comments have to do with HOW shining path won.  How they won doesn't really matter, they won.  Congratz and shit.<br>
<br>
They had the balls to spawn him knowing they could kill him and you've got a bad case of penis envy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for the facts, they were just that Facts.  Nothing more nothing less.<br>
<br>
All you had to say was &quot;this flame is about Conduct used to get RF spawn&quot;  <br>
<br>
All in all It really didn't matter to me either way, I just hate spending 50+ hours after every Naggy kill trying to help my friend get something he has worked hard on for a long time.<br>

We have in the past let another cleric from another guild hand in the item when they had a sufficient force present.<br>

Herbal by not flamming shows the class that this man has.<br>
The fact that we had +15 members there to assist Herbal, shows how we like Herbal, and how important getting the epic for Herbal or any Legendary member, is important to us.<br>

For someone screaming facts, you sure aren't adhering to your own advice.  Just to enlighten you, the above quote is an OPINION.<br>

2 groups can easily kill ragefire if they were of the appopriate level/class.  Shrug, they killed him.

<br>
My beef was that I clearly saw members of Legendary repeatedly attempting to train AFK people that were standing in locations that were clearly out of the way of Legendary's initial pull.  It is one thing if you run past someone, it is quite another when you repeatedly run over them with mob after mob -- especially when they are well out of the way and have AFK behind their name.<br>
<br>
My other complaint with their pulls was the fact that every single pull was going through stone spiders where Walkabout was attempting to XP.  It would be one thing if it only happened once due to them not knowing he was there.  However, every single time Legendary pulled EL he had to ask again in /OOC to please not pull through there.<br>
<br>
You are right Lothorsis, we have known each other for a while now.  You should know that I have always gone well out of my way to help others and be as considerate to other people in game.  This is why I decided to stay up all night and wound up being an hour and a half late to work helping a friend of a friend.  I am not a member of Shining Path, so I was not privy to any strategy sessions, arguments, or discussions.  I only know what I saw first hand and I know that it was very clear to my group that should Herbal turn in first, we would be bowing out gracefully.  I had also been reassured that once Rage spawned we would have all the firepower needed to take him down.<br>
<br>
My biggest concern that night was that both Eienye and Herbal would turn in their pearls simultaneously and thereby lose one in the process.  The decision to make it a turn in race was completely idiotic.  Through this all, Herbal has remained very stoic and level-headed.  I have volunteered to assist him in bringing down Ragefire the next time he has the camp and I am looking forward to it.<br>

<br>
I just saw them kill the spiders infront of me (I was watching the spawn as well) so I don't know where they pulled them to before that.  If they pull across AFK people on purpose then Shame on them.<br>
<br>
as for Walkabout in SS, this was unknown to me, when I moved from zone in to RF a few times.  They should not have be doing this and if they did again Shame on them.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this kind of thing doesn't happen again, it is to much BS.<br>

<br>
how does a Enchanter go about spawning RF?  This I would like to know.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once again cuz you are really kinda slow...<br>
<br>
They spawned<br>
They killed<br>
They broke no rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is Penis Envy?  You have been playing this game WAY to long.<br>

&quot;I'm sure they will lose little sleep tonite because you happen to not like their methods.<br>

?   I don't care if they lose sleep or not.<br>

Is this the best you can do?  Come on I expect more from you.<br>
<br>
Where is it that I am upset about losing the spawn?  I have repeatadly stated the conduct of those involved is why I am mad.  <br>

Why would you expect more from me?  How could you have any clue of what to expect from me?  I don't even know who you are.<br>

Where is it that your upset about losing the spawn? <br>
<br>
Count your posts and then read your own words about how you are tired of camping this spawn for your friend for so many hours. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quit asking stupid questions.  Instead, answer this one...<br>
<br>
If you had 3-4 groups in Fay waiting for everyone to arrive for a sky raid, and I ported two groups up from fay and started killing the key mobs because I wanted to raid sky, would you call me gimp??<br>
