<br>
I have aligned myself with a specific set of beliefs, outlined in the Bible.  I listen carefully to those who, imho, best interpret it and explain it.  Does this constitute control?  Am I a &quot;mindless sheep&quot; for committing myself to a particular document, a particular set of words in a row outlining a particular worldview?  I believe deeply in the validity and rectitude of the Constitution of the United States of America, too.  Does that mean that Thomas Jefferson et al. have an iron grip on my mind?<br>
<br>
You have certain beliefs and ideologies.  You have formed them just as I have, over the years through observation, instruction, and thought.  You no doubt identify strongly with particular figures or people, most likely those who closely align with your own positions.  You probably don't agree with everything they say, but in general they speak your language.  Right?<br>
<br>
It's funny - your belief in relativity is every bit as rigid as mine in absolutism.  You're an absolutist too, in your own way.  That was my point on the other thread - you cannot accept even the possibility that I'm right, because you simply can't live with that possibility.  Why?  I don't know.  But you are just as convinced as I am that you are right.<br>
<br>
So where is the difference?<br>
<br>
You say,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>there are only minor differencies in how far you're willing to go do impose those values on others.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are, apparently, not willing at all to impose your values on other people, regardless of the circumstances.  I regard this to be naive and foolish, much in the same vein as total pacifism.  I also believe that you are fooling yourself.  You hope, and indeed actively promote, your own relativist values!  You label people like me as &quot;dangerous&quot;, and then you claim that the world will be such a better place when we're all gone, and everyone is a happy relativist, realizing that they shouldn't impose their values on others.  And you can't even see that the whole time, you're trying to impose your values on me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the first bit.  You say the only difference between me and a Muslim fundamentalist is the degree to which we are willing to go to impose our values on others.  Obviously there are significant doctrinal and moral differences, but I'll ignore that for now.  Imposing one's values on others is &quot;evil&quot;, right?  Before I continue, I need to ask some questions and see your answers.  Under what circumstances would you support imposing one's values on others, a la Iraq?  Why do you believe this war to be motivated by religion?  You have expressed contempt for alternative explanations, such as those of national defense and humanitarian concerns despite the bits of evidence and assurances of many men from many nations, yet you are so eager to believe that this is all an effort to illegitimately convert the Muslims by the sword...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have no problems with you or anyone else being a christian. or muslim, or hindu or whatever.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You say that in the same breath that you condemn all religions for not only their propensity to enforce their own values, but for the opportunity they provide for opportunists and demagogues to gain power (as if there were no other opportunities available as well...).  Let's be consistent.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have a problem imposing your ideas of rights and wrongs on *others*, and that's what &quot;liberating iraq&quot; is all about, and this is where religious leadership comes in.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Are all ideas equally valid?  Is Rwandan genocide a-ok if they think it is?  Wouldn't you be imposing your values on the Hutus and Tutsis if you stopped the slaughter?  What's the justification if not a moral one?  It has no economic or political impact on you and your nation...?  Ok, so you claim that human life is objectively valuable since it is impossible to value anything if life is not present.  So, what about torture?  Rape?  Your utter commitment to relativity reduces you to impotence, you admit responsibility for yourself and yourself alone.<br>
<br>
I think Muslims are wrong about a lot of things.  I think some of the ideas which have spread throughout Muslim thought foster political and economic repression and stunt the growth of their societies.  I don't think Islam itself is necessarily the problem, but the way many Muslims interpret or twist what they find in the Koran and then preach it to their fellows is a major part of the problem in the Middle East.  But as long as they're not hurting me - hey, it's their region, their country.  The problem came with 9/11.  It's about Al Qaeda, sure.  It's also about something much deeper.  Something which our invasion and rebuilding of Iraq will help to quell, as part of a long-term effort to eliminate the threat of terrorism to the United States of America.  Please note!  We are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trying to convert the Middle East to Christianity.  That is not a goal of this war or the Bush administration.  What we are trying to do is change some ideological structures currently present in Middle Eastern thought.  These structures were put in place by Islam, yes.  That is no excuse for them, however, nor their remaining in place - they threaten us, they threaten our way of life, they threaten our people.  They will be changed.<br>

Listen to yourself.  Religious demagogues like medieval inquisitors or Jesse Jackson are evil, no doubt about it.  I'd love to have them cut out like the cancer that they are.  Condemning &quot;religion&quot; as a whole because of them is quite frankly ridiculous, however. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 778<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/26/03 4:06:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Evils of Religion</span><hr size=1> &gt;Jesse Jackson is evil<br>

The fact that he claims to be a Christian and even a Reverend is just icing on the cake to me.  Evil religious demagogues are bad enough when you're not a member of the religion which they twist, warp, and misrepresent for their own avaricious ends.<br>

I suppose its unfair to place the blame squarely on the shoulders of Islam.  Local custom and culture have a great deal to do with what goes on in those nations, and more often than not such customs are justified with dubiously interpreted passages of Koran, ignoring the much more clear ones which seem to go against them...<br>
<br>
Twisted interpretations of Islam are part of the problem.  Tribal culture and various practices and methods of thought are another part.  Regardless of the source, it's keeping the nations of the Middle East poor and politically retarded. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 3/26/03 9:19:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 514<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/26/03 9:50:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think some of the ideas which have spread throughout Muslim thought foster political and economic repression and stunt the growth of their societies.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Two words.

Once &quot;western&quot; (read: post-Roman) society finally broke away from the death grip the christians had them in (easy to control your sheep when they're uneducated and tortured/murdered for questioning the church... sound familiar?) we had the Renaissance, the re-discovery of education, free thinking, art, and culture.  Those things you hold so dearly now the Church tried with all its might to repress.<br>
<br>
I won't claim to speak for Walkabout, but I suspect that his point is that almost ALL religions to varying degrees will use tactics like this to enhance their own power and control.  Islam in the middle east today perhaps has yet to have its &quot;renaissance&quot; , where the people finally begin to shed the most repressive of their beliefs.<br>
<br>
However, keep in mind, Islam has been defending itself from those who would try to &quot;destroy&quot; it for at least 1000 years (judaism, btw, for far longer), and it's so ingrained now in their beliefs that it's easy for power-hungry &quot;leaders&quot; to call for violence against &quot;infidels&quot; and &quot;crusaders&quot;.  It's rhetoric that was probably used during the Crusades still being used in the 21st century... scary stuff to me, and probably most &quot;westerners&quot;, but the devout followers are still content to be sheep.<br>
<br>
Caledhon, you're a rare/dying breed in the western world, as someone who still is willing to forego free thought and sit comfortably in your cocoon where you can assume you have all the answers because a higher power told you so.  Bush scares the piss out of me because I think he's the same way.  Europe has almost COMPLETELY let go of these values, however, and America had as well (Dole lost in '96 as much for embracing the religious right's platform as anything else).  There's been a minor resurgence since 9/11, as the more weak-minded go back to needed their crutches, but it'll pass.<br>
<br>
Religion as a cultural influencer is something I respect tremendously.  Judaism for the most part has become this - most jews I know don't believe in god or anything else, but they hold the traditions &quot;sacred&quot;.  Islam also is a religion of peace at its core, and from a society standpoint and a cultural one has a lot to give us.  Christianity is a religion founded on the principals of converting others, and as such, is a disturbing plague on free thought.  However, its jewish half (old testament) does contain the moral teachings which still hold up in today's society (nothing wrong with living your life by the principals of things like the 10 commandments, if not to the LETTER of the commandments).<br>
<br>
Relgion as a tool for people who want to dominate others (&quot;convert to my religion or DIE!&quot; or &quot;Only my views are right because i have a god who tells me so&quot;) is probably the one thing holding us back from a global community at this point.  While the Church no longer has its influence,  you need only look at some of the more fundamentalist islamic nations to see what sort of repression can be brought about by those who wish to have a docile flock and retain power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 780<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/26/03 10:50:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> You beat me to it... <br>

I tend to view dogme as a memetic virus : self-reinforcing replicating information. Almost all religious dogmas are crafted along the same lines. A core overriding command : &quot;OBEY&quot;.  It is self-reinforcing because it has been &quot;revelated&quot; to us : it cannot be questioned or modified (hence must be preserved from heretic perversion). Accepting the revelation placing you &quot;above&quot; the rest, it is obvious that the information will then spread until contained or superceded by another meme. It doesn't take a genius to generate that kind of virus for profit : proof lies in the myriad of weirdo sects around the world. <br>

Oh great, another person trying to be smart.  Look into the Bible to learn what a Christian is.  Anyone who claims to be a Christian and does not follow the Bible is NOT a Christian...its plain and simple.  Why?  Because the Bible IS the description of a Christian.  Everyone else is a wannabe in order to either abuse the title, or to make it look bad.  The Dark Ages are perfect examples of non-Christians claiming to be Christians.  Selling indulgences, religious oppression, anything else negative...its all NOT in the Bible or even something that is against the Bible.  <br>
<br>
Remember, Christianity doesn't make people look bad or be bad, bad people put the Christian title over their name and make IT look bad.  Something to consider is that the Bible teaches that none of us are perfect, that we are ALL sinners, therefore how could we ever make it look good by our own personal means?<br>
<br>
One thing that I would like to point out is that discussing, opening an arm with a Bible to a person, and other such means are not &quot;imposing&quot; nothing.  If you call it &quot;imposing&quot; then every ounce of education you have ever learned in any school, from your parents, or from ANYTHING other than yourself is imposing onto you as well.  Well, with that description of &quot;imposing&quot; we get nothing achieved in this argument.  So, for the sake of argument, lets leave &quot;to impose&quot; at a description in which one person forces their beliefs onto another person...via some sort of restricting their personal rights if they do not agree to it.  Where is your being &quot;imposed upon&quot; now?  Remember, the constitution says &quot;freedom of religion&quot; and not &quot;freedom from religion&quot;.  You have no rights when it comes to a religion possibly becoming part of your life...regardless of how small/large of a situation it is as long as it doesn't violate your other rights.  That is why I think its unconstitutional to remove any such words in the constitution or declaration of independance that involves &quot;God&quot;...because thats what our founding fathers believed in...and they are the ones that wrote the damn thing.  We are a nation &quot;of God&quot; (in which they don't specify any particular god) and aethists are just as welcome to live here as any other person, but that doesn't mean we aren't still a nation &quot;of God&quot;.  Aethists do have to accept this (not that the nation is ACTUALLY of God, but that others do believe this and that it was founded in such a manner and is upheld in the declaration of ind. and const.), and it by no means violates their rights given to them under the constitution, heck it doesnt even undermine them in society.  Its not something particularly hard to accept.  If I lived in Turkey, I would still be a Christian...in a Muslim society.  It would be acceptable and fine to me, as long as my beliefs aren't restricted.<br>

Heh, you really need to rejoin the rest of us in reality.  They were Christians by their interpretation of the bible just like the current Christians claim to be, based on their more &quot;enlightened&quot; interpretation of the bible.  By your logic, American capitalists are not really capitalists because they do not follow free market economics to the letter, Soviet communists are not really communists, nor socialist, not marxists and muslims are not really muslims either because they dont follow the Quran to the letter.  Jews are not really Jews because they derive the interpretation of their faith from the Torah as much as they do from the Talmud.  It's stupid nitpicking on your part because you're such a devout Christian and understandbly you dont want to be associated with the &quot;burning-at-the-stake&quot;, &quot;drowning-in-the-river&quot;, &quot;torturing-in-the-name-of-God: delightful Christians that lived in the Dark ages.

Tuwene is right on the money, the only thing is thatit can be argued that the Muslims already had their Renaissance.  Then you can debate during which time period it happened, the emergence of the first Caliphates in 700's or 1200's-1300's when Islam was spanning the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 662<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/03 1:07:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Evils of Religion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Two words.

This is not accurate<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Tuwane</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->(edited misappropriation of quote, Sorry Merton). Several factors were involved in the Renaissance and the Church was only one of many, but it played a much more complex role. Don't forget it was the Monestaries and Universities founded by the Church during the Dark Ages that kept a lot of the knowledge from the ancient world alive. While people point at Gailieo, this was actually an isolated incident. And religion did not disappear. If anything, the Reformation increased religous fervor amoung the populace.<br>
<br>
The Black Death, increased trade outside Europe and greater political stability (rise of the state) were larger factors in the Renaissance than anything. The Black Death eliminated between 1/3 to 1/2 the poulation in 3 years. This sounds bad and it is, but it also meant that the survivors were 1/3 to 1/2 more wealthy. Lack of labor drove up wages and generally speaking everyone who lived through it were much better off. Wealth and more free time are more condusive to learning than a situation where everyone is breaking thier back 14 hours a day just to survive.<br>
<br>
Increased trade again added to the wealth but also expose Europeans to the learning of the Middle East and Asia. And Political stability allowed for security to take hold.<br>
<br>
The church was niether the genesis nor the nemisis of the Renaissance, it was just one actor. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

No no, you need to join those who actually understand the Bible and its history.  They were not Christians by any religious interpretations, but strictly by ethnicity which this world dubs so often.  There were no mis-interpretations.  You show me where the Bible can be mis-interpreted to mean &quot;yes its good to sell indulgences because thats one way to get into heaven&quot;.  Instead, you are just making a counterargument without ever backing it up.  The Dark Ages had low literacy, which allowed many people to be manipulated into thinking that the elders knew what they were doing and that it was Biblical.  Instead you have a bunch of elders/leaders who had never even read (or ignoring it) the Bible claiming to have religious authority.  If you want to claim &quot;enlightened&quot; or &quot;interpreted&quot; then you need to show where its plausible that the acts committed in the Dark Ages *could* POSSIBLY be misinterpretations.  Until then you are just as full of bull as the next Joe on this board who does not know what he is talking about but yet trying to prove somehow his bent views are less bent than another's.<br>

<br>
Plutarch, &quot;On His Own Ignorance&quot;:<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand, none has so much weight as the fact that, though I am a sinner, I certainly am a Christian.  It is true, I might well hear the reproac once launched at Jerome, as he himself reports: &quot;Thou liest, thou art a Ciceronian.  For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.&quot;  Then I shall answer: My incorruptible treasure and the superior part of my soul is with Christ; but, because of the frailties and burdens of mortal life, which are not only difficult to bear but difficult merely to enumerate, I cannot, I confess, lift up, however ardently I should wish, the inferior parts of my soul, in which the irascible and concupiscible appetites are located [Platonic references], and cannot make them cease to cling to earth...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...In the meantime I do not deny that I am given to vain and injurious cares.  But among these I do not count Cicero.  I know that he has never done me harm; often has he brought me benefit.  Nobody will be astonished to hear this from me, when he hears Augustine assert that he has had a similar experience...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... If to admire Cicero means to be a Ciceronian, I am a Ciceronian.  I admire him so much that I wonder at people who do not admire him.  This may appear a new confession of my ignorance, but this is how I feel, such is my amazement.  However, when we come to think or speak of religion, that is, of supreme truth and true happines, and of eternal salvation, then I am certianly not a Ciceronian, or a Platonist, but a Christian.  I even feel sure that Cicero himself would have been a Christian if he had been able to see Christ and to comprehend His doctrine...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... Augustine relates also that in his time most of the Platonists had become Christians and he himself can be supposed to belong to their number.  If this fundament stands, in what way is Ciceronian eloquence opposed to the Christian dogma?&quot;<br>
<br>
Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, &quot;Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;:<br>
<br>
&quot;... Then let us fill our well-prepared and purified soul with the light of natural philosophy, so that we may at least perfect her in the knowledge of things divine...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... Once we have achieved this by the art of discourse or reasoning, then, inspired by the Cherubic spirit, using philosophy through the steps of the ladder, that is, of nature, and penetrating all things from center to center, we shall sometimes descend, with titanic force rending the unity like Osiris into many parts, and we shall sometimes ascend, with the force of Phoebus collecting the parts like the limbs of Osiris into a unity, until, resting at least in the bosom of the Father who is above the ladder, we shall be made perfect wiuth the felicity of theology.&quot;<br>

Throughout its entire history, the Church experienced swings of policy and practice, just as any government or large organization will.  There were periods of particular cynicism, during which the Church hierarchy was misused horribly.  Institutional problems plagued it, as did moral problems.  These were solved at times, patched at times, and worsened at times through the actions and ambitions of men, who are fallible and often evil.  Doctrine has evolved over time, even (and especially) in the Catholic Church.  You cite the Inquisition, the Crusades, etc. as examples of the evils of the Church.  I point to the fact that in the vast majority of cases of such abuse of power, these abuses of power were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>noted and criticized harshly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from both within and without the Church.  Read Erasmus!<br>

<br>
How did the Church change with the advent of humanist thought?  How did it change when Erasmus applied philological methods to the Bible, providing the basis for modern translations and getting away from the Vulgate?  Advances in thought, in technology (e.g., the printing press), in politics, in all areas of life affected the Church in various ways, and the Church affected them.  It was never a force purely for good (and thus wholly justified in all cases), or purely for evil and manipulation (and thus to be utterly condemned and eliminated).  I, however, have never claimed the former; you claim the latter.  You would do well to educate yourself more fully on the complexities of the Middle Ages and Renaissance before you make these sorts of claims.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However, keep in mind, Islam has been defending itself from those who would try to &quot;destroy&quot; it for at least 1000 years (judaism, btw, for far longer), and it's so ingrained now in their beliefs that it's easy for power-hungry &quot;leaders&quot; to call for violence against &quot;infidels&quot; and &quot;crusaders&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I find that insulting.  I do not forego free thought any more than you do by committing yourself to a position which you believe in.  Or do you believe in anything?  Unless you are willing to be completely relativist, you cannot logically condemn me for taking a stand.  I support our invasion of Iraq first and foremost as the means by which we will ensure the safety of our own nation and citizens; if it did not accomplish this goal, the situation would be completely different - from there we would be into the realm of comparitive evil; do we stop Rwandan genocide?  Do we go into Kosovo?  Do we go into Indonesia to stop the violence and killings there?  When the element of self defense is gone, the issue is changed completely.  You may argue that invading Iraq does not serve the interests of national security.  You are, however, being intellectually dishonest by painting me and other Christians as wacky zealots seeking to impose ourselves on others because we, coincidentally, hold views about Islamic/Arab culture which are negative in particular ways.  These ideas are, first of all, not peculiar to Christian thought - some Jews and even Arabs hold them as well.  They are important regarding the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>methods</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and goals of the invasion, but not the casus belli.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Judaism for the most part has become this - most jews I know don't believe in god or anything else, but they hold the traditions &quot;sacred&quot;.

Christianity is a religion founded on the principals of converting others, and as such, is a disturbing plague on free thought.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your analysis of various religions reveals an ignorance of them as well.  You utilize the logical fallacy of hasty generalization to claim that Judaism is mostly harmless, and then in the same breath, another logical fallacy of cliche to defend Islam.  You then proceed to make a point about Christianity which reveals an enormous amount of ignorance regarding Christian doctrine, and draw the conclusion that Christianity is a &quot;plague on free thought&quot; from that simple uninformed point.

<br>
Which is the cause, and which the effect?  Do people who desire to gain power and influence use religion to subvert the minds of followers?  Or do religions like Islam and Christianity actually call for universal conquest and imposition of values?  It is not a simple question, and it is not one which can be answered without a very, very careful study of religious texts, interpretations, and real-life applications.

Rational thought can, and does, still occur of course.  Christian philosophers, theologians, etc. are not stupid people, nor are they incapable of intelligent and thoughtful analysis.  The only difference between you and I is that we have committed ourselves to different viewpoints (or perhaps you have committed to nothing - fine - but how can you expect others to then do the same as you without assuming the exact universalist arrogance which you claim to so despise?).  I believe I am right, and I will tell people so.  I will not force them to accept my beliefs, but if I perceieve that they attack me or pose a threat to me and my beliefs, I will react to protect myself.  If a third party, not sharing my beliefs, does not perceive that threat... well, I'm sorry.  But their skepticism does not make me any safer, and I am not willing to let myself become a victim in order to please the philosophical bent of others. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 3/27/03 10:03:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 947<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/03 10:16:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Here's a pre-emptive strike for you:<br>

Too busy to tackle your essay on religion and renaissance, but there is a lot to argue in there...<br>

<br>
Two or three things I'll throw back.<br>
<br>
1) I didn't mean to directly insult; for that I certainly apologize.  I think this is an interesting topic to debate, but (pardon the pun) I don't mean to make a &quot;holy war&quot; of it.<br>
<br>
I would ask that you re-consider once again some of the other stances you've taken on this board, though, which have caused some rather... lengthy... threads.  Your inability to concede that your morals are not the ONLY morals led me to conclude you are closed-minded.  Further, your justification of your morals as &quot;because god told me so&quot; (bad phrasing, but that's the gist) is where I came up with the cocoon of religious belief you're living in.  I guess i'll end this by reiterating I didn't mean to insult, but if you don't want to be thought of as closed-minded, don't tell others &quot;I'm always right because I say so...&quot;<br>
<br>
2)  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your analysis of various religions reveals an ignorance of them as well. You utilize the logical fallacy of hasty generalization to claim that Judaism is mostly harmless, and then in the same breath, another logical fallacy of cliche to defend Islam. You then proceed to make a point about Christianity which reveals an enormous amount of ignorance regarding Christian doctrine, and draw the conclusion that Christianity is a &quot;plague on free thought&quot; from that simple uninformed point. I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It's a debate.  I make a claim, in this case a VERY broad generalization, and state my reasons why I think that's the case.  Do I *really* believe Christians to be a plague on intellectualism, any more than all Jews are athiests and Muslims are peaceloving?  Of course not - but I will stand by my generalization that christianity AS A RELIGION exists mainly to propogate itself onto others, whereas judaism seems to exist more to protect its culture from outside contamination.  Christains go on crusades, whereas (conservative and orthodox) jews won't let you in unless you were born in.  I'm painfully ignorant of islam in this regard.<br>
<br>
3)  As to the rebuttals of my generalization that the renaissance was a direct result of the Church's grip being lessened, I would say I agree with Rig's post.  It was by no means a direct relationship - I think entire classifications of &quot;historian&quot; as a profession exist just to study/analyze the causes and effects of the dark ages to the renaissance.  It is undenyable, though, that the church at the time had a rather vested interest in keeping the population of Europe uneducated, and DID *resist* the rebirth of &quot;intellectualism&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you're going to argue that the church of that era was more corrupt than it is today, I'll agree 100000%.  Frankly, I don't think the RELIGION is any more evil/corrupt today than it was back then - but as with the 10th century, the LEADERS of the church derive their POWER from control over the followers of the religion.  The religious right today (idiots like Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed) is just as power-hungry and greedy as those who sold indulgences; fortunately, they have relatively little power overall compared to when inquisitions were convened to quell dissenters.  <br>
<br>
A lot of the arguments I've seen from Walkabout focus on his &quot;fear&quot; that Bush is a man with a LOT of power *and* the mindset of a Pat Robertson.  I think that WA overestimates any one man, including the president's, ability to really influence the US, but it does scare me as well, because this man also gets to appoint attourney generals who consider dancing sinful, FDA heads who consider abortion murder, and federal (and supreme) court justices who are so deeply stewed in christian morality they won't even answer to congress how they feel about issues (knowing it will get them kicked out rather quickly).  Unfortunately, decisions like these mean that people who don't subscribe to &quot;dancing is sin&quot; views will be forced to live under them (and yes, that's an extreme example, but it carries the point).<br>
<br>
For fear of responding to an essay with an essay, I'll cut this off here and see where we go.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Countic, SERIOUSLY dude, read what you write a few times before you hit ADD REPLY.  Last I checked, being a *christian* meant you accepted Christ as the savior.  Or do you propose that all people reading from non-catholic bibles are not christians?  Worse yet, any bible that isn't in aramaic (even the latin bibles were translations, and its well known there are conflicting english translations as well)? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=554.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=554.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=554.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=554.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=554.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=554.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=554.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=554.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
