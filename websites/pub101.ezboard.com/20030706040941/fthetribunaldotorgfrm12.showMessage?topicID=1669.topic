There used to be true flames that people had to actually take a minute and think about before composing.  Yes, composing is the proper word for this, because any chump can come back with a snide one liner or a &quot;am not, you are&quot; comment.  Granted there are a few that can do the one liner thing well, like Ladmo, in which provides actual humor not just idiotic &quot;am not&quot; posts. There used to be true works of art when it came to flaming. Now, we may as well be in the remedial reading class with the complexity of the flames.  With the majority of flames today, both sides tend to come out looking like moronic ass's rather than anything else.  True flames takes thought and the ability to understand of what might be coming in retaliation.   People go off half cocked far too much, which then leads to the childish bickering and all the one-liners that make you feel only dumber by reading them.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps I no longer understand the purpose of the flame board.  I thought it was here to here to bring subjects from in game to out of game where  *ehem* no one will petition you for foul language, etc etc etc... The truly good flames and topics are so few and far between that this board has become a breeding ground for the mentally inept. Posting so many threads that are nothing more than saying &quot;Hey look everyone, I'm a dumbass.&quot;  Perhaps the board should be renamed to the Dumbass Board.  <br>
<br>
People make can only make so many negative posts before no one cares what they are saying, and labeling them as having diarrhea of the mouth. I'm sure that it's not too hard for you to think of a couple like that. They have no feeling or visible thought behind any of their posts. Still, the post in such mass quantities that inevitably you become fet up and try to shut them up which is only falling into their games. <br>
<br>
All this leads me to be amazed that so many, of which many seem to no longer even play this game, read and post this Drivel. Are you people like this in real life and just blurt out the first thing that comes to your mind, or do you actually think about what you say? Are you just a dumbass that has this drivel pouring from their mouths all the time? <br>

Also writen most likely by a ghost writer for the illiterate mod of this board(Ladida) who was most likely fired from his day job, dumped by his ugly girlfriend and now cant afford internet to even read some of the worthless gems these days. But the little ass fuck has some nice pointers and I think that it should be made into some sort of EULA that you must clicky agree to even post here.<br>
<br>
Read this first and feel the inspiration eminating from it, then when you feel like posting something to stir the soul then do so with my blessing, if not dont waste people fucking time whining on how poor your reading material is these days, do something usefull and go KS someone or join Legendary, make a snazzy sig and complain on how the big bully guilds do dumb things. Be like Rynnia, run around making sure GMs are doing their jobs according tothe strict guidlines they must follow, or demand raid leaders roll for contested mobs even DUEL!<br>

Running away from mobs, and running around in giant circles... in real life people like this are tethered down with harnesses and helmets. <br>

So why don't you take the next couple weeks off, consult with your French loving, genocide supporting, helmet wearing friends and come back with something a little more clever than &quot;Oh yeah, well you're stupid and fuck you twice now&quot;<br>

<br>
Also quite obvious is the difference from what it used to be, it is both obvious and pointed out quite frequently by many.  Why you feel the need to point out the obvious quite AGAIN, when it's been done so many times before, and when the reason for the change is not an enigma by any stretch of the word, is very much beyond my comprehension.  <br>

<br>
I stay pretty much exclusivly on RSI now, unless something happens to get my interest here... and that hasn't happened much in quite awhile.<br>
<br>
I got in on the Ishtard thread and I made a few posts on threads concerning the war, but that's about it.<br>
<br>
Face it, the FB sucks now and has for quite some time. I was a long time poster here, but after awhile I realized there wasn't much changing and I finally lost interest. Doesn't matter what the reasons are for it being lame, it just is.<br>
<br>
And I am not bitching, so don't use the &quot;make a good thread if you don't like it&quot; argument. I find enough to entertain me on RSI and some threads even get heated enough to have a few slams exchanged.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what does it matter? I just think it's funny that you guys think I have made 100 posts on the FB in the past 3 months when it might be a quarter of that number, if even that many. I still read here most days, but I certainly don't post that much. <p><br><br><br>
