No, no no. I am saying that the US needs to make reasonable concessions, otherwise it's our own fault if the UN doesn't get involved. Of course I want the UN involved, but I want it to be fair to them and not just the US pulling the strings and the UN being a puppet. <br>
<br>
The UN has the right to expect to have a say in the running of Iraq if they are to share in the risks and expense of securing it. For us to expect them to do it without any concessions is arrogant and it's that type of attitude that causes the rest of the world to see us the way that they do.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 693<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/bender.jpg height=71 width=59></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> Since this is supposed to be for the betterment of Iraq and her citizens I'm not sure why who has what amount of control matters? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1476<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 6:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> Absolutely, Hayzen.<br>
<br>
The ad hominem hatred of Bush, and the senseless desire to see the USA humiliated (something I might expect from Walkabout, but not you, Loegan) have both turned me off to the point where I barely skim your posts any more, Loegan.  Which is a shame, because you bring up good points, they're just buried so deep in sanctimonious BS that it's painful trying to sift through it all.<br>
<br>
In response to the next post, which I just saw...<br>
<br>
Loegan, do you believe in standing up for your ideas?  What about if, say, you believed that a particular course of action was the best way not only to help prevent further catastrophes, but also to do a great deal of good in the world?  And, suppose a lot of people thought you were nuts, and wrong... but you still have this responsibility to the nation you serve, to act when you believe it is in their best interest.<br>
<br>
Is this such a pinnacle of arrogance?<br>
<br>
Of course, you don't see it that way at all.  It's a play for oil, or a sekrit Big Bizniz plot to rob other nations' wealth, or &lt;insert random left-wing conspiracy theory here&gt;.  At any rate, you don't think Bush *really* believes that what he's doing is really in America and Iraq's best interest... so yeah, to you, it's just arrogance.<br>
<br>
It all just keeps breaking down from there. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 8/21/03 6:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3809<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 6:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> It matters because some UN countries, if not most, will not participate unless they are given a say in Iraqi affairs.

<br>
My main point in all this is the horrible way in which Bush handles things. He slammed the UN hard last winter, which already makes their help less likely, but then on top of that, when we find out we do need their help, Bush wants it without any concessions.<br>
<br>
Everybody was cheering the tough talk last winter. It feels good to be able to play the tough guy and take shots at those who don't agree with you. But now that we have to admit we do need help, we are seeing the consequences of behaving this way.<br>
<br>
Burning bridges just for the sake of bragging is stupid imo. Now the chickens are coming home to roost and instead of taking a more humble approach to accomplish what is in everyones best interest, we are still playing the arrogant game of expecting everyone to just shut up and do as we say.<br>
<br>
Bush got one thing right in his campaign when he said:<br>

In response to your edit - it's all in how he does things. Bush does things in a manner which is divisive when it doen't need to be that way.<br>

<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
I'm still awaiting more WMD news.  I've been hearing some interesting stuff, re: the Russians among other things, but as time goes by, I do indeed begin to lose faith.  But, we shall see.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether the WMD claims were exaggerated or not, I remain unconvinced that the war itself was unjustified.  Perhaps the WMD line was exaggerated (especially to the UN), perhaps due to the fact that Bush and Co. viewed it as the most convincing and alarming.<br>
<br>
Yet if you go back and examine the arguments made way back when, you'll find many more excellent justifications for war, not least the fact that containment would be, and had been, far more repugnant and counterproductive than the war which we recently endured.  As so many have asked - where has your concern for the Iraqi people gone now?  Suddenly, the emphasis has shifted - from wanton torture, rape, terrorizing, mass slaughters, and Stalinist oppression, the sufferings of the average Iraqi are certainly no worse than those of the Cubans so fawned over by leftists (who are often without electricity themselves, although they can certainly read, just not in the dark).<br>
<br>
Edit:  In response to your edit, while I would agree somewhat, your reaction to Bush's methods in this case is FAR out of proportion to the irrationality/counterproductivity of his methods.  He is not slaughtering babies on a blood-red altar in order to raise the DOW index.<br>
<br>
It's rather interesting... I'm reading a novel at the moment, although it's far too historical to even call it historical fiction.  By Solzhenitsyn, who some of you may remember... it won the Nobel Prize for Literature a while ago.  At any rate, its treatment of the tale of Prime Minister Stolypin is first rate, and I think there are sufficient parallels, especially regarding the 3rd Duma session and the western zemstovos, to the situation with Bush re: methods, to make it worth bringing up.  If anyone knows what I'm talking about, please feel free to comment.  If not, well, the book is a damn good read, hehe. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 8/21/03 7:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3812<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 7:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It feels, to me, like everything was spun and dumbed down, rather than truly explained, but of course most people wouldn't understand anything *too* complex in this soundbite era anyway... right?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps. But it still doesn't negate the fact that this war was sold on the basis of an imminent threat. It was hammered to us time and time again that we couldn't wait for the UN because every day we delayed Iraq was closer to have a nuclear weapon. &quot;The smoking gun would be a mushroom cloud&quot;. It's not so much that we wouldn't have had to confront Iraq eventually, it's the fact that it was hurried with scare tactics to shorten the time we had to debate and examine the situation.<br>
<br>
I just don't see how there wasn't time. Even if we had to wait another year, I think it's clear now that the threat would not have increased significantly. And the mass graves we have found were years old, so our rush was not to stop a genocide in progress. Wouldn't it have been of much more benefit to have had UN backing? Or at least to have been able to show we exhausted that avenue fully before going to a full scale invasion?<br>
<br>
As I said, it's not what Bush does so much as how he does it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I remain unconvinced that the war itself was unjustified. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I think the war was unjustified, but if we can deliver a more stable Iraq than it was under Saddam, then good will still come of it.... alot of good actually. I keep hearing from analysts that our window of opportunity is closing to stabilize Iraq though, and I believe that to be true. If we end up making things worse instead of better, I think we have alot to be sorry for and will pay a heavy, heavy price, along with the rest of the Middle East.<br>

Although all civilian deaths are of course tragic, I do believe we did strive to limit the number in the actual combat phase. I have huge problems with how things were handled afterwards (not securing hospitals and delayed medical supplies due to supply lines being unsecured) which is unfortunately why alot of these deaths occurred. <br>

<br>
Minimum deaths. This is the same as the maximum, unless at least two of the listed news media sources publish a lower number. In this case, the lower number is entered as the minimum. The minimum can be zero if there is a report of &quot;zero deaths&quot; from two of our sources. &quot;Unable to confirm any deaths&quot; or similar wording (as in an official statement) does NOT amount to a report of zero, and will NOT lead to an entry of &quot;0&quot; in the minimum column.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Seems good on it's surface, but look at the sources they can use and ANY two of them can create a &quot;verified&quot; death count.  I'd discount this as propaganda based soley on the fact that Al-Jazeera and any other Arab news agency.  Can say 2000 died in an attack and it instantly becomes the maximum.  They're clearly just looking to inflate the account.  Their refusal to cooperate with similar projects speaks volumes too.  What do they have to hide?<br>

I've been on the wait to see list.  I had hopes that they'd find caches of weapons and report them immediately.  I've become disappointed in that not panning out.  But I'm still waiting to find out why Saddam's regime was holding out and not fully cooperating with UN demands.<br>
<br>
No matter what, I wasn't willing to support any action that would have the situation placed on the back burner for another 5 years before it was resolved.   As I said 6 months ago, it was my desire that Iraq did fully cooperate so that we could withdraw our forces from Saudi Arabia, and lift the sanctions on Iraq. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Mor, It's nice to see that fresh honesty about not caring whether they have WMD's or not.  That makes sense.<br>
<br>
Yet I beg you to know that &quot;Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses&quot;.  In other words, he would not and couldn't have been in power without the support of the majority.  The people wanted him there, that's why he was there and for so long.  It was not a police state where the majority had guns to their heads, as much as we want to believe that.<br>
<br>
Killing him off becuase we think he's wrong for the Iraqi people is telling the Iraqi majority that they are all mindless sheep and we know what's best for them.<br>
<br>
That's why all the trouble now.  There's a quote I don't know who said, &quot;Never underestimate the power of humiliation&quot;.  The Iraqi people are now very humiliated and extremely dangerous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=838.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=838.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=838.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=838.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=838.topic&start=101&stop=105>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=838.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=838.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=838.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=838.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=838.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=838.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
