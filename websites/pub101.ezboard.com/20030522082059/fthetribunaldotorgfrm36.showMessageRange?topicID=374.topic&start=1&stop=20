<br>
&quot;I refuse to purchase products made in China myself, but I don't really expect the Chinese economy to collapse as a result of that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I am aware of the &quot;Buy USA&quot; trend that is going on in America. I can even understand the toughts behind it altough is cracked me up to see that Bush aides had hung a screen that displaying cardboard boxes that said Made in USA in front of a stack of boxes that said Made in China when Bush did a television speech from a warehouse. <br>
<br>
Buy USA is one thing, not buying Chinese products is something completely different and I was wondering what Americans in general think of China made products and, if there are a lot of people boycotting China made products why, en how. <br>
<br>
I myself was never aware of the fact that some Americans boycott Chinese products and fail to see the logic behind such actions. I am aware of the fact that China made products have the reputation of being cheap, extremely low quality products. IMHO this is mainly caused by the complete lack of marketing strategies by Chinese Manufacturers and not because Chinese products in general are low quality trash. <br>

I've owned 8 American cars and one Toyota, and the Toyota was the best car qualitywise out of the lot of them by a long shot. That was a '91 celica GTS, so i figured after a decade jacking around with fairly shitty cars I'm just going to go Japanese from now on. I just bought an '03 honda accord coupe. Looks good, hauls ass, I dig it. For a day. The next day the a/c fan starts just shutting off intermittently. Then I discover the windshield washer flat out doesnt work. Then I discover there's something rattling around inside the drivers door and when I turn the stereo about about 1/3 the back deck starts buzzing like a pissed off hornet. Needless to say I take it back to the dealership with the obvious WTF questions and in passing told the guy my american/japanese car story. Then he looks at me and says &quot;You know they make these accords in Ohio right?&quot; <br>
<br>
Guess I shouldn't have been surprised. So are American autoworkers so fucked up that they can't even put a car made of Japanese parts together without muffing it?<br>

<br>
Not to totally side track a good original post - but I'm fairly anti-union and I think our autoworkers (at least in the past) are a sad state of affairs.  That said, I think late-90s American cars really turned around in quality, and I'd put many of them on-par with some of the Japanese cars.  I think, however, the Germans (Audi/VW, BMW, Mercedes) are putting out far superior product for the money right now.  If I had 40k to spend, I'd sure get an Audi A6 or BMW 330i before a Chrystler 300M or a Lexus ES300 (just examples, I don't know specific cars that well =P )<br>
<br>
Back to the original post - the issue with China is somewhat of a &quot;support america!&quot; thing, and its often sung that way by the marketing/PR drones.  HOwever, in *LARGE* part, at least from the corporate/trade point of view, the rampant piracy that goes on in China would seriously put a dent into our own trade.  If you could get illegal chinese knockoffs of American products for half the price, regardless of relative quality, many people would do it.  In order to protect businesses and trade from this, I think there is a backlash movement against Chinese goods.  That'd be my guess, anyway.<br>
<br>
TONS of stuff is made in China and sold in the US anyway - its not like there's a MASSIVE backlash against it, like your original post sort of makes it sound.  At least not as far as I can tell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 1976<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/03 9:14:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Looks good, hauls ass, I dig it.

My first car was a Buick, my second car is a Toyota which I bought 3 weeks ago (2000 Corolla) and I dont think I will ever bother buying an American car again.  I remember my brother bought a second car about 2 months ago, a '98 Malibu or some such.  My mom drove to his house (in her Toyota) and spent 3 hours telling him what a dumbass he was for buying an American car.  My brother's 28, so its not like he cant make his own rational decisions.  But the fanaticism in my family towards Japanese cars reaches absurdity sometimes.<br>
<br>
As far as consumer goods like electronics... back in the 1960's, &quot;Made in Japan&quot; was the scarlet letter of inferiority and poor quality.  They turned it around in a decade and by the 1970's, Japanese electronics were regarded as some of the best in the world.<br>
<br>
Seems to be the same deal with China, but they dont seem to be preoccupied with shaking off that stigma.  If I am buying something that I intend to last me over a month or more - I definitely try to stay away from Chinese and to some extent American products.<br>

I didnt want to insinuate there was a massive backlash against Chinese products in the US, I was just suprised there were people not buying China products in the first place and was just wondering why.  <br>
<br>
It is true Chinese companies have verry little original products Most of their products are OEM products. This means a distributor/wholesaler located in Europe/US or Japan sents the Chinese factury the blueprint, a picture or a prototype of a product. After the Chinese manufacturer is told how much the product may cost he will make it. A distributor who sends in his own design, will get his design produced a lot cheaper then he would when he manufactured the product in the wesern world. A distributor who sends in a Leatherman tool will get this same item produced a lot cheaper then Leatherman can do it themselfes. <br>
Chinese manufacturers dont copy products on their own initiative and then dump them on the American market. Its Western companies that copy a design, sent it to a Chinese manufacturer who then produces what its client asks him. The client then dumps it on the American market. To rally against all China made products because of this is a bit stupid imho.<br>
<br>
As for China being an evil communist regime and not wanting to buy China made products because of that. Well, that just doesnt make sence to me. <br>
<br>
Assuming that China`s regime is actually so bad as you think, why dont buy products made there? The working conditions in China based factories and the wages are low to western standards. However, compared to what those workers would earn while slaving in their rice paddies it is a big improvement.  Historically, drawing people from their traditional farming societies to the big towns to work in factories has only triggered, or speeded up their movement towards capitalism and democracy. Keeping those same people in the rural areas and in poverty wont change China`s current regime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1587<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 5:27:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> At the risk of sounding insensitive, I'd much rather my money go into fellow American pockets than another country's.

IT Outsourcing to foreign countries.  Why do companies do this, for the same reason Ladmo wants to buy his stupid knives from China.  Cuz it's cheaper.  This isn't really a problem when it is just a momNpop small business owner like Ladmo, but when it's large global companies like Royal Dutch Shell relocated their IT support to Guada Lupe or whatever and SAP relocated it's helpdesk to Scotland or some shit and it's CSC relocated it's support to Canada and the list gets bigger everyday.

Make an inferior product, for more money then your competition, and then say you're a traitor for not buying it.. brilliant marketing strategy.

Went to one store, they didn't have anything that fit me that I liked... I did notice that almost every shoe was made in China though, which annoyed me a bit.  But no matter!  Drove over to Academy... found something decent finally... Made in China.  Looked at all their shoes.  Made in China... every single one of them.  I figured, what the hell... I need shoes, I'll just buy some.  But then... lo and behold!  A box, my size, extra wide, and decent looking... who would have guessed?  I took a quick glance at the label, and noticed immediately that the country of origin's name was too long to be made in China!  Hallelujah!  Then I looked closer...<br>
<br>
Made in Vietnam.<br>
<br>
Hehe..<br>
<br>
As for the logic of it all, it's a very simple matter for me.  Chinese industry = Chinese government, basically.  (No, I don't need a lecture on their semi-capitalized economy, thanks).  Chinese government = evil (No, I don't need a lecture on moral relativism, thanks).  I don't want to support them with my money, so I don't buy products made there.  It makes me happy, so I do it =)<br>
<br>
Except when I'm buying shoes. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

If I can make something better than you and cheaper than you, people will buy it from me INSTEAD of you.<br>
<br>
If the chinese can produce better product for less for American companies... more power to them.  It'll either force american companies to compete or die trying.  I'm in no way against Nike having their shoes made in Indonesia... the vast majority of the money you spend on new sneakers goes to Beaverton, Oregon - not the Indonesian goverment or its workers (other than the share they negotiated and agreed upon with Nike well ahead of time).<br>
<br>
Outsourcing of IT makes perfect sense if you're SAP (a german company by the way... buying SAP is *not* supporting America... heh) or some major customer of SAP.  If GE can increase its profits by cutting its IT costs... great for them.  Its once again the american way. <br>
<br>
When I hear about SAP consultants who are used to taking home $150/hour complaining that Indian outsourcers are doing work for $30/hour, I have to wonder if that isn't just market pressure taking effect.  From the contractor's point of view, it sure sucks... but from the company hiring the contractors... I think it's not such a bad thing.  If you owned a company, what % higher would you be willing to pay to get equal work done, but keep it with US folks?  Would it really be 500% more? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 1027<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 2:15:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/Sphynx5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> It's always been my understanding that China boycotting is not so much an anti-communism effort (like Cuba) but more of an expression of displeasure with their government's humanitarian violations against its own citizens. Personally, I've never heard of anyone boycotting China products until the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Spying allegations, the missile crisis in the Taiwan Straits in 1995-96, human rights violations like Tiananmen, religious persecutions and the government's crackdown on the China Democracy Party are what got China noticed by my generation.<br>
<br>
Of course, I fully expect to hear a &quot;But the US does all that and worse!&quot; arguement, and that's fine if you want to believe it. I wont argue. You are free to not buy any US made products if you don't support what we do. Boycotts are a wonderful tool to express your views. <br>
<br>
I like Japanese and Korean products, but I stay away from China made goods if I can help it. It's my right as a free consumer and I take full advantage of it. Luckily, in the US there are no tanks ready to run me over if I don't agree with everyone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 481<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 3:07:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> /nod Arleanna<br>

Of course... it's also almost universally true that Communist regimes oppress their people, to various degrees.  I would likewise not buy goods from Cuba or North Korea, but if I had been an informed consumer when East Germany or Communist Hungary was still around, I wouldn't have had as much of a problem with their products (assuming the USSR let them export any to the west).  Which isn't to say that human rights violations didn't occur... but there were mitigating factors (Soviet imposed regimes) and the abuses weren't nearly as egregious as in China, North Korea, and Cuba.  Anyway, I didn't claim it all made perfect sense, and I don't pretend to be perfectly fair to every nation in the world based on their regime type and behavior, but certain nations in particular just piss me off.  China is one of them, for the reasons Arleanna mentioned. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>
