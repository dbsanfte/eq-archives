Wow, ok so they are all still your friends, everyone is so happy, yep no animosity here&gt;&gt; U are clearly just putting off the huge mistake you made. Bringing sarcasm into it, rather than truth.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;f they are all still your friends and you aren't fighting with them why are you looking for new ones so hard?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Im not fighting with them, i'm bringing up what happened to baigly. Um, im always looking for new friends. So hard? What are you talking about. How do you know? Do u go to my school.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I'll waste some time tomorrow when I come back to work with you again Calypso&gt;&gt;<br>

Um, ok if you want, even though this is a &quot;private thread&quot; now. WASTE TIME? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT. YOU HAVE A LIFE ALREADY REMEMEBR? people who have lives cant waste time about things they dont really care about.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You prove my fucking point with everyone of you assinine posts&gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
What fucking point? what's your point. I dont like to argue with people outside of the boca area. Because they dont seem to understand what really is going on down here. I'm not whining. This was suppose to be a funny argument. Cause its bringing alot of humor to my friends.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You keep shouting to anyone that hasn't put you on ignore yet&gt;&gt; Im not yelling at u EQs. Im critcizing baigly. IDIOT.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;doesnt have as much time to felch you anymore&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
my world never revolved around baigly, stupid shit il lsay it again, shut ur mouth bout things u dont understand,\<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; If they are all still you friends then go fucking do something with them&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
I actually saw die another day with them. How do you know if I do something with them or not? Shut ur mouth bout things bal bla again.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;instead of piss and moan on a forum full of people that play the game that you are damning&gt;&gt;<br>

I don't. This doesnt concern me? I was a factor in why you stopped playing. If we were friends of course it concerned me, YOU WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW GAY IT WAS, AND NOW YOU PLAYED IT AGAIN. so ok. sure. I think it does concern me. You're just mad. You're right, im not that smart. I admit it, and you're not eitheiir. Admit it. IM NOT TALKING SOPHISICATED. You're trying to tell me I learn how to speak by movies and games. I dont care if anyone thinks im smart. Alot of people already know your address using ur &quot;ip adress&quot; they know you live in boca. It doesnt matter if I use your name, no ones coming down. You lose that million dollars, when the hell did i never look you in the eye. All those times u talk back to me and i tell u tell get up and come to my face and look me and they eye and say it again. You say no. Ill put a million on that. Now whos talking big and tough? Admit defeat, admit what you did wrong. And ill stop. I've been waiting for that. ADMIT IT ASS! Admit that, and that I put you in your place. You can't back yourself up so you just talk about how it is over and how i think im so smart. Changing the subject a little?

<br>
Let's stick with this 6 year olds arguing over toys thing. Let's just say that there are two 6 year olds arguing over the latest happy meal toy. With their limited intelligence they can only use words like &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. Well, that last one is only for scuffles over computer, so ignore that one. But anyways, they're &quot;making fun&quot; of each other and perhaps one or both are trying to get attention from their other friends or family or whatever.<br>
<br>
Now, mother comes over and joins the argument. She lets them both know that they are idiots and need to shut the hell up for the day and go to sleep. Does joining, sharing her thoughts on, and attempting to stop the argument &quot;make her any better for joining in&quot;? YES, YES IT DOES. She's the older and wiser mother that knows when she sees stupidity at work.<br>
<br>
Your logic is flawed. He is not a hypocrite. He's the older, wiser mother. Your friends are the 6 year olds that get their kicks by watching someone that doesn't play chutes and ladders start a post on a message board about one friend who said he was through with chutes and ladders but ended up playing chutes and ladders again, even after he himself said what a moronic game chutes and ladders was. <br>
<br>
He does understand the situation, quite well. What's to understand? The posts are in good humor? Fine. Still doesn't change the fact that this is the most horrendous thread made on a flameboard in the entire history of flameboards... going all the way back to the early 1980s! It does not matter what the true intentions of these people are. The result is still quite the same in the eyes of the public.<br>

Bravo! I know of no one else that could do that.<br>
<br>
And yes, EQ came out in '99. But, you know, the internet and its earlier forms have been out for a bit longer than EQ has... you see.<br>
<br>
This being a great thread isn't the reason I keep posting in this thread. Idiots, is the reason I keep posting to this thread. This is the flameboard  mister. I know you're probably not entirely hip to what goes on here, but the huge amount of idiots that frequent this place is the main reason for this forum's success and all the threads that are more than 3 pages long.<br>
<br>
And don't worry about me, I'll just continue standing here, or whatever. You folks &quot;down there&quot; can continue acting like idiots. It does me no harm.<br>
<br>
And Thumpus, oh constantly confused one. &quot;Older, wiser&quot; were the words I used, did I not? Yes yes yes? Adam Sandler is older, smarter and wiser than these folks also. But is he more mature in regards to his personality and choice of jokes and humor? I think not. Age and knowledge do not equal maturity. But he'd still be able to use his superior knowledge that came by age and experience to know that you guys are quite screwed up. As would Adikt. Both may use a few gay jokes and maybe ask that you kill yourself but I'd still regard them more highly than I do your &quot;down there&quot; friends. It's not so hard to understand. Adikt is attacking, by argument, their moronic reasons for arguing. He is not just simply arguing real life matters for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>attention</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and a boost in self confidence and joy as a 6 year old would do, like some people in this thread. Notice the difference friend? You've my sympathy if not. Honestly.<br>
<br>
This is like bashing my head on concrete over and over and over and over again. Please make it stop <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adiktdask>Adikt da SK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/4/02 6:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: fdsfds</span><hr size=1> OK  Calypso you are the funniest thing cooking down there in Boca, you and Thumpus are rolling down the hallways of your school laughing your asses off, in fact you and all your friends are having a great time. But wait Baigly is your friend isn't he? He doesn't seem amused by this, in fact he asked that you stop and just talk to him tomorrow in person. Man what a hell of an idea. Like Telk said I am here telling you to nock this stupid shit off, you say that you don't like arguing with people that don't go to your school 'cause they don't know what the real deal is? Then what the fuck are you doing here, arguing on a public website where there may be 3 or 4 people that you go to school with? And if this is such a private thread why did you make the title &quot;I'm attacking Baigly McJohnson, Come in for a laugh, NERD!!!&quot;<br>
Telk has this entire thing pegged with the Candyland analogy, i know cause i have friends that don't play EQ too. At one point I quit this addictive game and started hanging out with them allot more, then when I started again they were all pissed too, just like you. Unlike you though they were mature enough to say &quot;Fuck it, he wants to play EQ. I'll just do something else for a while&quot; I still talk to them and when some of my EQ playing friends and non EQ playing friends get together they bitch when we talk EQ too. Difference is they dont launch a web crusade to mock people for going and playing EQ.<br>
So like I've been trying to say, stop posting your hardly legible flames here, no one wants to read them. No one but you and Thumpus give a shit if Baigly said that EQ is stupid and then came back to playing. And as for my comment about wasting time here what I mean is that the flameboard is what gets me through my horribly boring help desk job. I do have a life theres just not allot of fun to be had when you need to work to support yourself, you'll find that out in a few years. <p>&quot;You gonna do something, or are you just gonna stand there and bleed?&quot;<br>
