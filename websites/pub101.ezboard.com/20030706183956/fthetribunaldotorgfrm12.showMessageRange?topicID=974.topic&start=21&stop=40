<br>
Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show. She has said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet. <br>
<br>
Dear Dr. Laura:<br>
<br>
Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. <br>
<br>
I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them.<br>
<br>
1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br>
<br>
2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br>
<br>
3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual cleanliness from Lev.15:19-24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br>
<br>
4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?<br>
<br>
5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br>
<br>
6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?<br>
<br>
7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br>
<br>
8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around, their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?<br>
<br>
9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br>
<br>
10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10<br>
<br>
11. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev.20:14)<br>
<br>
I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging. Your devoted disciple and adoring fan. <p>Aradael Venomsmite<BR>

<br>
Human beings created god to try and explain their pathetic miserable lives and aleviate their fears of death.  Human beings wrote the fucking bible in order to control other human beings.<br>
<br>
Don't throw that demented mythology at me.  If you think being gay is immoral, then don't be gay. Don't accept it, I don't give a flying fuck.  As for your statistics, I can make up a bunch of bullshit figures too.<br>
<br>
Heterosexuals are 85% more likely to commit murder<br>
Straight males comprise 90% of all child molesters<br>
And Christians are 100% more likely to push their religion off onto others as the only right way.<br>
<br>
NONE of it means a fucking crap.  It's my never to be humble opinion, and it's not gonna change your mind, I'm sure.  But we're all gonna be dead within the next century, the sun's still gonna go nova and I don't give a rat's ass cause as long as I'M alive I'm gonna enjoy my existance to the fullest, cause when the neurons in my brain quit firing I will fucking cease to exist.<br>
<br>
So why should I be all pious and behave according to anyone elses standards cause I sure ain't gonna be able to any of the things I like after I'm dead.<br>
<br>
Nothing I say will change your beliefs, nothing you say will change my beliefs.  But except for this post, I have never gone around and tried to make anyone feel like shit for what they believed or how they behaved.<br>
<br>
I don't go complain about something on a public channel, bitch about how unfairly I think I've been treated, and then say &quot;that's so christian&quot;, or &quot;that's so napster user&quot;.  But every fucking time I play, I have to hear someone in ooc shout or some other channel say &quot;that's so gay&quot;.  Well, fuck them.  I don't care if they truely hate gays, or if they're just ignorant, insensitive bastards.  I'm sick of hearing it, and if I ever see those people in a bad situation where I could cast a heal, or a stun, or whatever and save them... or help them find their corpse that's gonna rot in the next 10 minutes, I can just walk away.<br>
<br>
As for your little article about the 13 year old boy, a) what they did has less to do with their sexual preferance and more to do with the fact that they had no respect for the rights of another human being, b) I couldn't have prevented that any more than I could have prevented the attack on the world trade center... you wanna blame gays for that?  Too late, Jerry Falwell already did.  And finally, where were his fucking parents and why did they leave a 13 year old boy with people that they obviously didn't know well enough?  If one parent can't make enough money that the other parent can supervise and protect the children, then maybe they shouldn't have had them.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is people are too fucking concerned with how other people live and many think it's ok to hurt anyone who's different.  We're all gonna have different opinions and beliefs, but that's why the society has laws and rules.  Basically those laws and rules are designed to keep people from bringing harm to each other.  If you think something is harming individuals or the society, there's a system in place to make it illegal.  Last time I checked, in my State and many others, being gay was not illegal.  I'm not hurting anyone, so I expect not to be hurt by others.  And yes, verbal abuse hurts.<br>
<br>
I have a tough skin, I usually ignore it.  This is really the first time since  EQ started that I've made a fuss.  This will also be the last time, because I'm going to go on with my life regardless of what anyone things, says, or does to me.<br>
<br>
If my opinions or statements in this post have hurt or offended anyone, get over it.  I have.  If &quot;that's so gay&quot; shouldn't effect me, then nothing in this post should effect you.  It's just words to prove a point, and in the final analysis, they don't mean a thing.<br>
<br>
Now go back to getting the power up and winning the game.<br>

It's not like the angel of god came down and handed this nice carefully written manuscript to someone and said, &quot;Read this! This is what God wants you to do!&quot;.<br>
<br>
I love how some people call the bible (new, old and sometimes both) the instruction manual for the human soul. It's the most complicated, hipocritical, contradicting book I've ever read. If it really is the words of God I would hire the guy to write an instruction manual for a bottle of shampoo. He'd fuck it up so bad we'd all be putting conditioner on before the shampoo. The bible is either the worst interprative job ever made, or God is just seriously confused. It's the original conspiracy theory. A bunch of nameless old men trying to control society by telling them if they don't practice the outdated writings of men who had what would now be considered a 3rd grade education, we will surely suffer forever in the afterlife.<br>
<br>
What we need is updated religous dogma for the masses to calm and ensure themselves that they will be chosen to live in heaven with big breasted naken women for all eternity. The only problem is anyone who claims to have spoken with angels in a cave, talked to a burning bush, or found a golden tablet written by Jehova himself seems to skip right past the having--message-joyously-spread-throughout-humanity part, and goes directly to the having-house-surrounded-by-ATF-firebombed-into-nothingness-martyr part.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I think maybe the earth is a giant game of Populous and god went AFK for the last two thousand years. Maybe when he's done with his homework or whatever he's busy with he'll look at the screen and see that the population is in serious need of some earthquakes, floods, and other hand of god shit.<br>
<br>
Hold on, theres an angel at my door. He wants to discuss this golden tablet I found in my backyard. Be right back. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

The death of Jesse Dirkhiser was a horible and tragic event.<br>
But the reason it received less notice in the press is for the same reason 100's of other senseless deaths like his don't..motive.<br>
I notice you aren't listing those 100's of other names and asking why no great press coverage. Why not?<br>
I'll tell you, because the perpetrators were not homosexuals.<br>
The motive behind his death was sheer viciousness and had nothing other than that to make it newsworthy unless you want to gay bash.<br>
On the other hand Matthew Shepard was killed by otherwise normal guys SIMPLY because he was gay.<br>
Did you really need this pointed out to you or are you just finding a reason to bash gays? <p><center><i>

The 2 adult males who sedated, confined and sodomized a 13 year old boy repeatedly for hours were not homosexuals?  I'm guessing NAMBLA aren't homos either, neither are the 'precedent-makers' who are trying to introduce gays into position with the boy scouts?<br>

To me, it seems the motive was 2 adult pedophiliac faggots got their jollies by tormenting an underage, defenseless kid with homosexual acts.  <br>
<br>
So, your reasoning behind why this one didn't receive media attention is that the 100s of other 'similar' crimes weren't perpetrated by homosexuals.  Guess what, that doesn't make any fucking sense.  Let me dumb it down for you:<br>
<br>
Atrocity A:  Two hetero guys, sickened by a display of fagism (not sure if that's a word, if not I just coined it so fuck off) decided to have some fun and rope their queer and drag him till he was dead.   2 heteros killing 1 fag = Media diving all over it and hershey-highway travelers making speeches<br>
<br>
Atrocity B:  Jesse Dirkhising, an innocent 13 year old kid, is doped up, tied down, and repeatedly sodomized over a course of hours by 2 faggots until they noticed they'd killed the kid.  2 queers tormenting a hetero kid = Media conveniently unconcerned<br>
<br>
Atrocity C:  Assmedaily explains this obvious media bias brought up by Dumai by touting '100s of other brutal stories' that don't receive coverage like the jesse story, but AREN'T perpetrated by homos.  Similar by motive he claims...but it seems to me that normal men don't go around sodomizing 13 year old boys, do they.  So...they're so similar that they don't involve the same class of degenerate humans with twisted motives -- yeah how are they similar again?  That they got no coverage?  Then that really has nothing to do with anything does it.<br>
<br>
Hmm, you make no sense -- quick, fall back on the 'homophobia' defense!  Fear? No.  Sickened? Yes.  Tired?  Definitely...go parade around for your sphincter buddies so you can take camping trips with dozens of underage boys in the woods.<br>
<br>

The two homosexuals did not kill Jesse because he was straight. They killed him simply because they were sick fucks which had nothing to do with their sexuality anymore than any of hundreds of sick fucks, straight and gay that commit senseless crimes every day.<br>
IF those two had killed Jesse BECAUSE he was straight, then you would have seen similar coverage.<br>

You're telling me that isn't what happened? He didn't die because he was straight? Because it seems to me if he was a lil' flamer like the big boys they wouldn't have had to drug him, wouldn't have had to tie him up, and wouldn't have had to gag him with his own underwear, right?<br>
<br>
Oh, and how were they sick fucks if it had nothing to do with their sexuality? Not like they were kidnapping him for ransom and he died due to being tied up waiting for the payoff -- seems to me it directly dealt with their sexuality if they were using him as a donkey punch-ing bag.<br>
<br>
Seriously, it's shit like this that prompts the treatment that queers like you get -- rationalize their guilt out of it if you want, but it still doesn't change what happened. Way to try out a mom flame though, that's a definite point of attack when the 'homophobia' defense fails.<br>

<br>
Facts: Homosexuality can be observed in nature, non-human animals have been seen to exhibit homosexual tendencies and they run on instinct. Homosexuality was also fairly common in Greek culture and a few other succesful ancient cultures. A zillion other things I don't feel like looking up.<br>
<br>
Obviously it is a natural thing. Now I personally am not homosexual but I don't give a flying piggy what the hell someone else does if it doesn't harm me in any way. Generally i have found people who are homophobic to be bible-thumping, half-witt, idiots who take their frustration at having little in the ways of a penis out on a social group that, since the introduction of the whole Judea-christio-islamic belief systems, has been looked down upon by the majority. Granted, I didn't read alot of the replies before this, but from what I did read, I saw alot of homophobic feeling, then again, maybe I misread. But all I can conclude is that people who have to screw around in other people's business are generally A) Idiots, evolutionary dead ends, who will eventually walk in front of a bus and die or trip off the edge of a cliff cuz they're fucking no-brainers B) bible thumping, wannabe savious ignorant fools who have been so brainwashed by whichever of the worlds &quot;lovely&quot; monotheistic religions that they can't think for themselves and must rely on the teachings/sermons of a select few who became religious leaders most likely because they were ill-equiped to go into any other occupation or C) Angry people who have no life and have deep rooted problems. I don't know, maybe these people have an inferiority complex and need some feeling of security and self-worth. Either way, if someone looks down upon another due to their sexuality/race/religion/etc. then they are not worth the time because the only reason to look down upon someone is for their inteligence or lack there of, or their inability to use the inteligence given them. Stupid people angre me, smart people who act stupid angre me more. You have a problem with what I say? I am sorry, you can now slam your head into a wall because you're obviously too god damned stupid to comprehend, go off and walk in front of a bus please.

Cause I remember reading that was a twist put on instinctive animal behaviours by queer lobbyists.  And how does saying that it was common in another culture make it a 'natural' thing?  In past chinese cultures, it was 'honorable' to have you daughter deflowered by dynasty heads, particularly Mao Tse Tung.  His penchant was 12 year olds, and parents of daughters whose cherries he popped showed them off in a reverent way.  Obviously this makes it natural huh?  What about current african cultures where female castration is a rite of passage?  Obviously that's natural also huh.  Well shit, grab your razor blades drop your drawers and line up girls -- it's common in their culture so obviously we need to pursue this in ours.<br>
<br>
By the way, I can't be pigeon-holed into any of your little generalizations there, and I don't look down upon people for facets they can't control, such as race -- what I look down upon is people preaching for the right to take camping trips with boys alone in the woods when this same class of degenerates demonstrate tendencies to do harm in such cases, while fellow fags of their order look to dismiss such failings and manipulate public opinion.  Not to mention the things Dumai brought up, like all the money being wasted on AIDS research and on rainbow parades.<br>
<br>
At least you can speak in a literate fashion which is more than I can say for half the people on this board.

Your posts give me an image of a screaming fanatic.<br>
Since when does being a sick fuck have to be tied to sexuality? There are plenty of instances of straight guys committing the same things the two guys did to Jesse.<br>
If you don't think so you're pretty deluded.<br>
I merely pointed out why the press didn't give the Dirkhiser murder more coverage than ones similarly committed by straight males.<br>
Pause for a second and rationally if you can explain to me why any gay male is a worse human being than any straight male.<br>
Lemme see, don't bother with the bible, that's subjective based on religious beliefs.<br>
What's that leave?<br>
Hmm..you were molested by a gay man?<br>
A friend or relative was?<br>
Perhaps you're gay and you hate yourself?<br>
In any of those cases blame the individual, fine, but don't dump your misery off on those who never did anything to you.<br>
Hating all of a minority for the actions of one or a few is classic bigotry. Hate anyone else?<br>
Personally I'm hoping that you're gay and you hate yourself in the hopes you fail to bring any more blind, raging, hate filled fools like yourself into existence.<br>
And by the way, it's kind of even more sad that your hatred makes you so ignorant that you assume anyone defending folks being able to be gay and not discriminated against MUST be gay as well. I suppose with your limited viewpoint that's the only possible assumption for you to make. <p><center><i>

I didn't say being 'sick' was tied to sexuality, I said in this case it obviously is.  I can't think of a time when straight males sodomize 13 year olds, nope sorry.  Maybe prisoners would be subject to such limitations, but then again there's no 13 year olds doing hard time with blue-balled inmates, is there.<br>
<br>
As to your 'assumptions' about me, all wrong once again.  I'm not gay, I've never been molested by a gay person, nor is anyone I know gay.  I detest them...and a rational reason why?  They're degenerates.  And I don't need the bible to tell me so, I'm agnostic.  Science and common sense tells me so.  Those that defend their degenerate ways are either blindly stupid (yep, more people I hate) or closet-degenerates themselves.  Am I screaming?  Nope, calmly rational.  Just wondeirng why you eurotophobes continue to spew forth your generalizations, 'facts' that seem to materialize from thin air, and baseless assumptions.<br>

Even tho I am incapable of a coherent thought it seems to me if 2 straight guys sodomized a 13 year old BOY for hours then they really arent straight. They are quite gay.<br>
<br>
Straight men do not stick their penis' into the rectums of other males. So instead of just saying there are plenty of instances please post these instances.<br>
<br>
While I would not sling out the word degenerate like Dvinastat has I would say that the purpose of sex and the purpose of males and females is to procreate and produce offspring. That is natures intent. If you are &quot;having sex&quot; with the same sex as you then you are clearly a freak of nature. Degenerate..... I wouldnt go that far. Freak of Nature??

I have never harmed you or any other human being on this planet, and I never will. So why should I be treated any differently than anyone else because of the actions of a few individuals who DO cause harm?<br>
<br>
I don't want to have sex with boys. I don't even want to have sex with anonymous strangers. The only person I want to have sex with is the person I'm in love with. I can't help it that person happens to have been born the same gender I was. But so fucking what? We love each other, we give each other pleasure, and the fact that you hate us for it doesn't make us lose any sleep. Your hatred just hurts you. Let it go.<br>
<br>
And Krickett, there are now over 6 billion people on this planet. If you've ever studied algebra, you might have been taught that population grows exponentially. This world cannot support an infinite population. Perhaps homosexuality is Nature's way of trying to remove a portion of the population from the breeding pool. I don't know why I'm sexually attracted to other men and not women, but I do know that there's nothing that will ever make me attracted to women.<br>
<br>
As far as sex being only for procreation? If that were true, then why is it pleasurable. Why didn't nature make it more like hunger, where it became unpleasant if you didn't mate, and after mating, the discomfort subsided... that what keeps us eating... if we don't eat, we feel hungry, after we eat, we're satiated. Sex is not only for reproduction, but it's also a way to create a bond. Granted, that is meant to ensure there are parents to raise the offspring, but we are not stupid animals. Human beings are uniquely able to take that ability to share pleasure and bond and to express it to whomever they choose.<br>
<br>
This world might be a better place if more people expressed love for each other rather than hatred.<br>
