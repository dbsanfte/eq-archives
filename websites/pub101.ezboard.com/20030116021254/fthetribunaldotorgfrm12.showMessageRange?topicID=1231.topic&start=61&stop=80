Considering he has been up there for six months (long enough for the logs and such to get lost/erased then suddenly his &quot;friends&quot; show up and start flaming away, why choose Sendri as the target, she wasnt even the one who origionally posted, hmm wonder if she spurned ya (I know she won't harass me I asked, hell I begged)<br>

<br>
    You are a complete and utter fucking moron.  It's a damn shame that Remnants has stooped so fucking low as to have you for their so called guild leader.  It's no wonder that just about everywhere I go I hear OOC spam about Remnants recruiting... it's because all your good people are leaving in droves after the displays you've been putting up here lately.  <br>
<br>
If you were a guild leader worth his salt, you'd realize that your idiotic grandstanding here is doing nothing but hurting your guilds reputation, which has really been nothing but shit since about a year ago when I reluctantly ripped it's heart out.  And if you don't know what I'm talking about, ask Moonz or any of the old officers you have (if you have any!) what I'm talking about, you fucking waste of space.  Remnants WAS a guild worth saving at one time.. but I'm afraid those days are long gone, and with you at it's head, they'll certainly never come again.<br>
<br>
By the way, have you mentioned to these folks here how you gimped your way into the guild leader position you fucking retard??  Not that it would surprise anyone, since you've made quite the reputation for yourself here already.  Moonz, Zilos and even that fucking retard Locutos were by far better men than you, you cock-gobbling assclown!  My suggestion to you is to go and shut the fuck up, tuck your tail between your legs, and try to make something out of those poor bastards you claim to 'lead', because you're doing nothing here but tarnishing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> their</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reputation as well as whats left of yours... which I must say, isn't much.  Think of your guild man... think of your guild.<br>

*Puts on his dick fucking tracy hat*<br>
<br>
so Raylar=Judies? na prob not.<br>
<br>
Judeis tries to get into a real guild, cant cause his names here, hires a spaz wench to come post at first, no go, then goes thru his butt buddy list looking for someone with a semi good rep to come and retry. DING DING we have a winning theory<br>

too bad his buddy is as spazzed out as his wench was. any bets on who he hires to try again? remember jackass 3 times is a charm<br>

1. Yep was in the same guild as Judies OOA, when it broke. because of sendri breaking off and making a new guild &lt;gathering of Zeros, Mainly old OOA sendri supporters&gt; But was also in the same guild with sendri. I stayed in OOA and IW for over 2 years. So you would have to say I know the story as well as anyone.<br>
<br>
2. Is Raylar Judies.. well hell i may as well be i have been accused of being darkpaws and several other people as well. Just for stating my opinions on an opinion based Board. People have no better comments to write, and dont have the brains enough to think of a good flame so they say &quot;ohh novel idea lets make raylar=judies, yeah that has it&quot;<br>
<br>
3. Point of this thread is not Raylar. Point of this thread is to remove Judies from the POMS. Nothing More. As I stated Before I will not go away this time. If i have to  Give Guild leadership to some one else until I am done fighitng this battle and disband from Remnants I will do so and Run guildless Until  I acomplish My mission.<br>
<br>
4. I am not using my guild to Pull any wieght on this board. Period. Have you seen any of my guild post here? Not thier fight. But you have seen old, i repeat old, remnants posting here  ripping Remnants. Is it because they are Jealouse that i  have not let it fold? You say you have ripped the heart out of Remnants? Bull shit. You have taken all of the controversy and trash out of it. Thank you for helping me do what i would have done eventually. See i would have probably /guildremoved and of you . Simply because you are all selfish fucks. Not what My guild stands for. Not what Our Guild stands For. Seems to me all of the Good Decent Remnants are returning to the Guild.

Secondly, about the banning/petitioned thing, Verant wont tell if they have a petition on file against someone so you have no way of knowing whether he has a soulmark on his account, also the only way to be banned it seems is to be caught in a exploit otherwise verant doesnt seem to give a shit, ask the peeps here why there IS a PoMS board, because Verant wont do anything about it so we must police our own.<br>
<br>
DAMN I've posted here today more than I have posted in the last 6 months, time to log onto the pornboards and see if Ladmos wife has posted yet<br>

Rylar,<br>
<br>
What makes you so sure that Judeis is innocent?  Do you have any hard evidence, or is it simply your friendship and belief in his goodness of character?<br>
<br>
Let me assure you that without any new evidence, the case is closed, and no one is interested in reopening it.<br>

      Again you prove what a totally clueless fuck you are.  The REASON no other Remnants post here, is because they're afraid to be associated with you.  They don't want to get their asses handed to them on a daily basis like you constantly are.  I'm not ripping 'your' guild, a guild that you basically got by 'default' because no one else wanted to lead it... I'm sure most of them are alright folks who wish you would carry out your threat/promise of giving the guild to someone else and just leave.  I'm ripping your stubborn stupidity and inability to acknowledge what you're doing to your guild.  As it's leader, you should be protecting it, protecting it's reputation, not letting the community know that it's led by a loser like you, an therefore tainting it with your stench.  <br>
<br>
As for ripping the heart out of Remnants, yeah, maybe you're right... maybe I didn't rip it's heart out... but I certainly took the cream of the crop with me when I left.  Since then it's seen at least 3 guild leaders, Zilos, Locutos (again) and YOU.  And guess what?  Each and everyone of them, including that idiot Locutos, had enough sense to keep his trap shut about shit he couldn't do anything about.  So what's your malfunction dickcheese?  Do you honestly think anyone CARES that you DEMAND that Judeis be removed from the POMS list? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Get a grip on reality dude.  <br>
<br>
I was there when Remnants was Remnant.  I was there when Locutos disbanded it, and even know the reason why.  I was there when the 'stragglers' re-formed under Moonz and Pyronight.  I was there as an officer for 2 years after that.  And I was there when most of the people over 46 left for greener pastures, you ignorant fuck.  As for you disbanding me?  Trust me.. it would have never come to that.  Had I still been there, you'd have never even made it into the guild you cocksucker, much less gotten anywhere near a leadership position.<br>
<br>
How long have you been there?  Six? Seven months?  I can tell you that it's not nearly long enough for you to come on this board and talk shit about the &quot;old&quot; Remants which you have never met, you dick sucking fucktard.  It's funny how when people leave, it's because they're selfish and all sorts of other crap... you ever thought that it could be because of you?  Or because of differences of opinion?  Or because they're tired of being in a mid-level feeder guild?  Nah... can't because of that could it?  Nope.. they're selfish. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Keep telling yourself that you fucking idiot, and keep spouting off about proof and demanding shit.... because it only goes to reinforce what a complete asshole you really are.... <br>
<br>
Take a long look in the mirror jerk... selfish is what you're doing to your guilds reputation to defend the 'honor' and reputation of a well known POMS.<br>

Pribar your kidding me arn't you! I have this feeling you live with Sendri in the trailer home they call home?  If I was right,Sendri once said that herself!  I also am tired of seeing the same old crap writen about.. Can anyone answer any of my post for once instead of talking about someone's guild? Pribar, so you seen the logs I would take it from your, ah call her half sister, call her live in friend or whatever so than you can send it to the boards so I can see <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Proof is what I am asking for, I mean I heard it was one, now more than one with the same story but no logs.  I do know if I got one log, I would send it in to Verrant and have him banned if it bothered me! I mean, so no one has done this what so ever. THe things that I write about are truth's. See, Sendri as you know has a big mouth and likes to well, lets say type away.. So tell me Pribar, is it true that her loving mother&lt;overlooking her 25 year old daughter&gt; diovced yet cause they spend too much time on the road? &lt;She used that line on me last year to get her to join her guild&gt; You also see that she was married and I say yet again 3 times, one to a guy that plays a girl &lt;cause he likes her tits&gt; Why, why did she keep moving on. She left the server, to come back and get married three times since or within 10 months.... Doesnt sound like shes afraid of anything, infact willing to try new things out. Please, if your there behind her controls again, petition to get that name &quot;Disorder&quot; off, its not needed in this world for people who try to escape what they do have and have her parade infront of them so proudly. <br>

<br>
P.S. please I know this wouldnt be a problem with getting a few logs. Myself and others await, smart people like yourselfs must have it, it was done repeatly right??????? Did the story change again??? Na..........  Til I see the proof in the pudding, I see a revenge tactic on poor LAD and I know if she had sent along with her so called others attackie's they sent along the logs for poor Lad to see.<br>
<br>
Lad this goes out to you!  Please post the LOGS!!!!! I can write storyies all day long about what sendri and her actions with peoples names all day long but it would get her friends to hate her and cause more trouble than anyone would want. I leave it as to where is my proof!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1231.topic&start=141&stop=148>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1231.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1231.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1231.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1231.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
