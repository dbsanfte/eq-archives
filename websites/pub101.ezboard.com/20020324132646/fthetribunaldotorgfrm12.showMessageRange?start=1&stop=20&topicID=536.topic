You dont need a warning that mobs are coming, just expect it.<br><br>Its not like a zone like this is new either.  Most of these people crying about being trained at a zoneout have probably never heard of Mistmoore or only seen it with people farming the zone post Kunark.  These rookies probably have not been there when 30 to 50 people were in the zone and it was a train a minute.  For people like this they had to make a zone like karnors with two enterances/exits.  I wonder if people are whining to tell people to &quot;go right&quot; at Maiden's Eye??<br><br>Drag the corpses by another group (without training them).  Most are cool about it, let you med up and probably help you out.

Anyone who's been there know how these things ambush you in hordes. =x<br><br>So I shout train to desert zone, and even run around for a min to widen the difference between myself and the skeles to prevent the things camping the zone line and ambushing any poor bastard who zones in.<br><br>I zone into Groobash being a tard and screaming his ass off about how he died and told me to get him a rez. I have no problems with finding a rez for someone, but damn, I gave fair warning, and if you're gonna be an idiot and med at the zone, then have the common sense to get the fuck out of the way when someone says a train is coming.<br><br>I go out of my way to avoid training people, but sometimes you can't help it.

I sent you tell asking if you were planning on getting me a rez now. Altho I wanted to reach thru my monitor and strangle your punk ass, I decided it was in my interest to remain calm until I was done using you for the rez...you were quite polite, apologized for the train, and eventually did found a rez for me. So post what really happened, not your chest thumping pile of steaming horse shit.<br><br>G. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 6:42:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=536.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/_images/zrez.jpg width=132 height=96></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trainnnn...Doh that was in group still!

Sorry</span><hr size=1> Groobash, I'm talking about the shitty way you talked to me when you asked me for a rez, and then later in ooc when you bitched about how people had been training *you* all day.<br><br>tip #1, if you're gonna ask someone for a rez, do it nicely, they might not always comply if they're talked to like crap.<br><br>I was grouped with a mage at the time and was pulling 2 mobs at a time. I went out, grabbed a golem, started looking for another, and BAM got hit with a mob of skeles, quickly becoming the grey's trademark. I shouted then that I had a train headed to scarlet desert, and then proceeded to widen the distance between myself and the mobs so they didn't land at the zoneline and ambush some poor bastard zoning in. I zone into you being an asshole about it.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, I don't go around training people for the hell of it. I was about to say something to you regarding how you were talking to me, but I bit my lip and asked a friend if he could rez you. then you complained about it only being a 49 rez. Again, I bit my lip and zoned in to drag.<br><br>Next, regarding the comments in ooc. As everyone else has pointed out in this thread, don't sit your fucking ass at the zoneline and expect people to die to prevent training you. If you're gonna be stupid enough to fight there, then use some common sense when someone gives a warning. Zonelines are bad places to set up camp, and if you would've had enough brains to fill a thimble, you would have moved to one side or the other of the zone wall. But that would be too easy, because as far as I've seen in game and on the boards, you'll bitch about something just to bitch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
