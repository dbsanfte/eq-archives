Haven't read it, but saw the guy on an interview.  If he is to be believed:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Fighters and bombers had been sent to the region to the Iraq region to aide the Curds.  Clinton couldn't be bothered to stop watching a gold tournament to launch the attack, and the attack was cancelled.<br>
<br>
2) Every president since Eisenhower has carried a tiny card with codes to launch nuclear assault.  Clinton apparently lost the nuclear code card that all presidents have carried since the advent of nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, he didn't notify anyone of it for a good period of time, denying he had lost the card.<br>

There's bound to be more in the book.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ex-President Bill Clinton kept a squadron of F-117 stealth fighter-bombers and B-52s waiting to launch a critical 1996 airstrike on Iraq while he finished watching a golf tournament--dithering so long that U.S. pilots lost the cover of darkness and the mission had to be scrubbed.<br>
<br>
       That's the explosive charge leveled in a brand new book by Lt. Col. Robert Patterson, a key Clinton military aide from 1996 through 1998 whose primary mission was to carry the president's copy of America's nuclear launch codes.<br>
<br>
       ''We dispatched eight F-117 stealth fighter-bombers capable of carrying 2,000-pound bombs into the region and sent B-52s to Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, in preparation for action,'' reveals Lt. Col. Patterson in his bombshell security scandal tell-all, Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton Compromised America's National Security.<br>
<br>
       The Sept. 13, 1996, air strike was planned as the U.S.'s response to an Aug. 31 tank attack launched by Saddam Hussein on the northern Kurdish city of Irbil, a blatant violation of the 1991 Gulf War surrender accords that had an estimated 300,000 Kurdish refugees fleeing for their lives.<br>
<br>
       At the same time, Saddam's Republican Guard had executed an estimated 100 Iraqi dissidents and arrested 1,500 more--extinguishing whatever opposition the Iraqi dictator might have faced from within.<br>
<br>
       Two days before he attended the President's Cup golf tournament, Clinton had warned the world that ''action is imminent'' and that ''the determination of the United States in dealing with the problem of Iraq should not be underestimated,'' reports the national security whistle-blower.<br>
<br>
       With the F-117s and B-52s ready to take off and the cover of darkness in Iraq slipping away, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger placed a series of desperate phone calls to the Manassas, Va., golf course seeking clearance from Clinton.  But the president refused to come to the phone.<br>
<br>
       ''Sir, Mr. Berger is on the line and needs a decision about the proposed attack on Iraq,'' Lt. Col. Patterson remembers telling the president.<br>
<br>
       Clinton's response? ''Tell him I'll get back with him later.''<br>
<br>
       As mission-critical minutes evaporated, an anxious Berger called again.<br>
<br>
       ''This time he was animated, obviously upset,'' remembers Patterson.  ''Pilots were in the cockpits waiting to launch, targets were identified, everything was in place, all he needed was the go-ahead.''<br>
<br>
       The presidential military aide promised the national security adviser that he would do everything he could to get Clinton to pay attention to the mission at hand.<br>
<br>
       ''This time, the president was engaged in conversations with several people and was less approachable,'' Patterson reports.  ''I maneuvered through the crowd and caught his eye. When President Clinton saw me, he seemed disturbed at being interrupted again with something unimportant. He frowned as I neared him.''<br>
<br>
       Still Patterson persisted.  '''Mr. President, Mr. Berger has called again and needs a decision soon.'' I explained in a low tone, ''We have our pilots in cockpits, ready to launch, and we're running out of the protective cover of nighttime over there.''<br>
<br>
       But Clinton seemed unmoved.  ''I'll call Berger when I get the chance,'' he told the aide.<br>
<br>
       Less than 15 minutes later Berger called back.  ''This time he was irate,'' Patterson recalls.<br>
<br>
       ''Where is the president?  What is he doing?  Can I talk to him?''<br>
<br>
       The presidential military aide was forced to explain:  ''Sir, he is watching the golf tournament with several friends.  I've approached him twice with your request.  I've communicated your concerns about the window of opportunity and about the pilots being prepared and ready to go.<br>
<br>
       ''I'm an Air Force pilot myself, sir.'' Patterson told Berger.  ''I understand the ramifications. I'll try again.''<br>
<br>
       For the third time in an hour, the military aide desperately tried to get Clinton to focus on the mission--hoping he would appreciate that further delay could jeopardize the lives of U.S. pilots now waiting for his order.<br>
<br>
       But Clinton remained oblivious.  ''Tell Berger that I'll give him a call on my way back to the White House,'' he said, in what Patterson describes as an ''indifferent'' tone of voice.  ''That's all,'' Clinton added, in words the military man understood to mean the president didn't want to hear any more about the problem.<br>
<br>
       ''I called Mr. Berger and explained that the president would contact him from the limo,'' Patterson recalled.  ''We both knew what that meant.  We'd missed our opportunity.''<br>
<br>
       The trusted soldier says he remains haunted by the episode.  ''Human lives were at stake--the lives of American service members and the lives of our allies who opposed Saddam at our behest and were now under attack.<br>
<br>
       ''At a time when America's honor and grander principles were being challenged and the world was watching our every move ... the president was watching golf.'' <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 733<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/6/03 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=679.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deriliction of Duty - Clinton</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Lt.

Be wary of ulterior motives.  The person designated to carry those codes IS an important person and is present at most times BUT he is NOT an advisor and calling him a top aide is a misnomer and I find some of theses claims a bit much to take.  He would not have been that directly involved in most situations (though he should have been present). <br>

<br>
Anyone else see the contradiction?<br>
<br>
Unless I am mistaken, the President carries no code. That is the job of the officer who carries the 'football' - the nuclear launch codes. It is in a briefcase, handcuffed to his wrist. He is supposed to be within 100 yards of the president at all times if I understand correctly.<br>
<br>
I doubt they would let the President carry the codes loose in his pocket all the time like a credit card. That would be some piss poor security.<br>
<br>
For instance, look at the scene when Bush was shaking hands with all the servicemen on the USS Lincoln... what would happen if the codes fell out for whatever reason? In a mob like that, it would easily go unnoticed. <br>
<br>
That's not to say that having the card would make any sailor able to launch the missiles - not by a long shot. But like the saying goes - security is only as good as your weakest link.<br>
<br>
The President carrying around nuclear launch codes in his pocket on some card during normal circumstances? I don't buy it. <p><br><br><br>

Actually, I do believe that is very much the case. In fact, I've heard multiple times in the past that Clinton actually had the codes attached to other cards in his pocket by a rubber band. The book mentions this as well:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kris motioned me into the Oval Office. Clinton was seated behind his desk. He looked<br>
tired and beaten, blanched and swollen. He looked up at me from behind his reading glasses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, if you'd like, we can just change out the codes now and I'll come back for the briefing<br>
later.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That'd be fine, Buzz. Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I handed him the new card-the biscuit, we called it-with the new codes, which would<br>
be effective immediately. One of the most important symbols of military power in the history of man had just exchanged hands. He looked back down at his desk and the morning newspapers piled in front of him. I was waiting for him to respond in kind. He didn't offer me his old set of codes, however, and I figured now was not a good time to press the issue. I showed myself out of the office and returned to the East Wing.<br>
<br>
After the Lewinsky affair broke, the senior staff tried to insulate the president from<br>
further problems. Their intent was to keep him &quot;safe&quot; from women. With the president's help, the staff developed a code word for attractive females: they called them &quot;security risks.&quot; In my<br>
opinion, they weren't the only &quot;security risks.&quot;<br>
<br>
The biggest security risk was the president himself.<br>
<br>
When one of the other military aides and I returned, a few days later, to brief the<br>
president on changes to the contents-and the launch codes-of the football, we were in for an surprise. We arrived at the Oval Office as scheduled. My military-aide compatriot briefed the<br>
president on the important changes. My expectation was that the president would finally return his old set to us. Instead, President Clinton looked up sheepishly and confessed, &quot;I don't have<br>
mine on me. I'll track it down, guys, and get it back to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
We were dumbfounded-the president losing his nuclear codes. He is required to have<br>
the codes on him at all times. President Clinton normally kept the world's most sensitive<br>
document rubber-banded to his credit cards in his pants pocket.<br>
<br>
There had been one other time that he had misplaced the codes, but we were able to<br>
quickly track them down through his valets. He'd left them in the White House residence while he was leaving for a round of golf. This time, though, the codes were apparently lost.<br>
<br>
The president finally threw up his hands and said casually, &quot;I just can't find it...don't<br>
know where it is.&quot; As far as he was concerned, that was the end of the story; Podesta and<br>
Lindsey's overriding concern was that the story might leak to the press. Only the military seemed remotely worried about the national security implications of the nuclear launch codes' being lost.<br>
And they were never found.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

No way in 40+ years that NONE of the cards have ever been lost.<br>
<br>
And I still can't get how a glorified gopher(I mean no disrespect, the job is important, but his ONLY job was to carry and maintian that briefcase, nothing else) seems to have all this knowledge and NO ONE ELSE has ever mentioned it before.<br>
<br>
I put this up there with the stories of Reagan sleeping through a crisis or two.

I think it's a National Command Authority Authenticator Card that is used to identify the President or anyone who can order a nuclear launch (under nuclear pre-delegation orders, the civilian command of nuclear release can be handed off automatically to military command under pre-defined circumstances, but I am not sure if they would use a NCAAC or not). IIRC it has a Day Word, Command Word and Action Word on it. I could be wrong, but I think this only confirms the Presidents identity and does not contain any launch codes.<br>
<br>
I believe the format used for the actual release orders that reference targeting packages and timetables use 5 letter codes. That means there are 7,962,624 possible combinations of which I am guessing (and this is purely a guess) under one thousand of those are valid codes, since we are only geared towards Russia and China I believe. Even if there were only 100 codes, that's still alot of codes to pack on a card a little bigger than a credit card.<br>
<br>
There are also Permissive Action Links that require 6 digit command codes that have to be entered before turning the launch key at silos or on Trident submarines, but I have no idea how those numbers are handled, though I doubt the President has them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, even while losing a NCAAC in and of itself wouldn't enable a person who found it to launch, I am sure losing the card could cause the President to take longer to respond to a foreign launch, since he couldn't confirm his identity to NORAD or StratCom until they canceled the old card and gave him a new one. And when you consider there is only around 27 minutes from launch till impact from Russian or Chinese ICBMs and only around a 5 minute warning of sub launched nukes... doesn't seem like a smart idea to have the President carrying around the card in his hip pocket to me. Better to keep it in the briefcase along with the codes.<br>
<br>
Then again, they should know better than I what works best I guess.<br>

It should be an extremely rare event.<br>
<br>
But I am more sceptical of this guys story just because.<br>
<br>
1.  There were plenty of other, higher ranking people involved in these situations.  A lot are retired and more than a few are not fans of Clinton (particularly his ACTUAL military advisors) and no one has hinted at this before?  A Lt. Col in the Whitehouse is a pipsqueak.  He seems to me to be at least inflateing his role and that makes me leary of the rest of his story.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am just saying that just cause you LIKE what someone says does not mean much.  IF 10 years from now some yahoo writes a tell all saying that Rumsfield and Chaney ran the whole Iraq war while Bush was watching cartoons, I would be just as leary.  (Though I bet Leogan will be posting links to such a story going &quot;AH HA!!!!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

<br>
The card is changed every 24 hrs and handed to the President by the same guy who carries the 'football'.<br>
<br>
Actually Radgen, I do think Bush makes the calls, but I think anyone is crazy who thinks with Perle, Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz vs Powell, that the President is getting balanced advice on which to make decisions. That's where the control comes in. Almost all the high rankers are extreme right hardliners and thus control the flow which feeds the Presidents thought process.<br>
<br>
Believe me, I wouldn't like it any better with extreme left wingers in control. I like moderates running the show from the middle of the road. Both parties are pretty healthy in the center, but both are parties are also pretty dangerous when you get to the edges imo. <p><br><br><br>
