Wow Paimae, twisted what exactly?  I said that you took the board down in a fit of spite after you heard that some stuff was being said about you and posted a big fuck you to the guild.  So to get back at a few people, you hurt the entire guild by taking the board down with no warning.  And you have yet to contradict me on any of those points, so... let me think... yeah, I'm pretty sure I haven't &quot;twisted anything&quot; or misrepresented anything in any way.  You were paying for it? Boo hoo! No one held a gun to your head.  You didn't want to pay for it anymore?  Hmmm, again, let me think... it's early so I haven't had my coffee yet but I have this utterly radical thought forming!  How about..... you give Tat a few days warning so she can find another place to host the board?  HOLY SHIT!  What a thought!!  God, I'm staggered by the lucidity of that.... But you didn't do that, did you?  Heh, so... which part is twisted here?  And have I contradicted myself in any way?<br>
<br>
As far as Rhoas goes, you're not fit to kiss his ass.   He taught you everything you know about being a monk, he was your friend and mentor till you dicked him over.   You used him to help solve your problems, and when you were done with yours told him that you weren't interested in his problems and didn't want to hear about it.  So he called you on it.  And if he's guilty by association, then I guess your wife's guilty by association with you then, isn't she?  And to continue that reasoning, no matter how good of a person she really is, she's a complete piece of shit just because she associates with you.  Trust me, you're the only monkey wading in shit around here.<br>
<br>
And if you treat people the way you perceive them, then you must think all of RNG is shit because you treated them really poorly with the whole board thing.<br>
<br>
I could try to teach you to eat, but unless I tied your hands down, you'd have a finger down your throat right quick!   As for choking on that comment, you sure it wasn't your finger you choked on?<br>
<br>
And if I'm running out of fodder it's because you're beginning to bore me and I'm loosing interest.<br>
<br>
Oh, and camp the boards much?<br>
<br>
Gosh:<br>
Most of the reason I never gave specific details as to the politics is because they stem from a very serious RL personal conflict between myself and one of the officers.   This officer has proceeded to act against me at every opportunity and has poisoned people who were once my friends ( other officers ) against me for personal reasons.  Since I never believed that my private life should be available for people to dissect, I never made the circumstances public.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And I see that Tourysucks has finally be moderated.  I'm sorta sad about that.  I was actually enjoying watching it fuck itself over.  In the first post it told me how Miss Manners was absolutely horrified about me calling someone a piece of &quot;canine feces&quot; and how horrible I was for saying that.  In the last post I read, it called me a whore and some other stuff I can't clearly remember, including the will fuck for french fries comment.  Not to disappoint Paimae or anything, but that's possibly been my greatest source of amusement in this entire thread!!!  The flame board vets can tell me if this is true or not, but this creature totally sold out all the values it posted about in it's first post in a total of FOUR posts.  And all because I was ignoring it.... wow, now that's a power trip.... So just by ignoring someone, I made them totally sell themselves out and show themselves as a hypocrit.  In four posts.   So is that a new record or what?<br>

Most of what you said though is your perception.  You never asked me what was going on with the website thing so it's all just what you 'think' it is.  Before you pass judgement like you normally do...go check into colocation prices on T1's and pay special attention to bandwidth overages.  1 day does make a difference when yer over a limit :P<br>
<br>
 I like how you say I shit on RNG as a guild for doing that though.  Perhaps some think I did...others don't...we're all entitled to our opinions.  I definitely know I put in my 'time' there and if that goes unappreciated that's just the way it goes I guess.<br>
<br>
Anyways as far as Rhoas being my mentor...what kind of shit is that?  Is Rhoas secretely FENIE DIAMONDFISTS as well?  Otherwise stfu.  Fenie showed me the planes, etc not Rhoas.  As far as pulling pre-50 I was Holy Monk...Rhoas left Holy Monk when I was level 30 so I'm not sure when this mentoring time took place.  Pre 30 maybe? lol sheesh don't take any favors from Rhoas or Toury, you'll never live it down.  They're real quick to forget anything you do for them all the same.  Helped me solve my problems?  Just because he listened to me bitch about someone ONE time (which by the way I was just as wrong about the situation as the person I was pissed at) that means he SOLVED my problems?  hahahaha <br>
<br>
Rhoas is guilty by association but he plays the game.  He's involved.  My wife is not.  Say what you will (and you will of course) but it doesn't change the fact that you're still reaching for anything you can as ammo here.  All the while, you're showing more and more of the bitch you really are.<br>
<br>
Camping the boards? Hell yeah for this kinda entertainment.  Final words though...you're not on the Tribunal anymore...why don't you just stick to your server and play with your new friends?  The rest of this really is pointless because there is no more resolve to this situation as there was when you started the thread.  Just more animosity. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23998"><img src="http://www.ontact.com/eqpics/paimaesig.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">

Unlike others who feel the need to blab things to the closest person they can find (and no, I don't mean Tour for those that don't know what I'm talking about).<br>
<br>
Your remark to Tour's comment that was clearly directed at Gosh, and not towards you, obviously shows that 1) you have no clue what you're talking about and 2) that you may wanna rethink any comments you make about Tour looking for cannon fodder. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.jsp?num=951" target=_blank>Reverance Echoblade</a><BR>

<br>
However, I can understand your point, but lets just say noone really knows anything and leave it at that.  That's why all of this thread is so entertaining because it started from Toury being pissed about people talking shit and she didn't wanna just let it go.  Should she have let it alone? Who knows, but it's too late now.  I think the hardest thing to figure out here is why she cares what someone says to the point it would make her come to a flameboard and post about it.  Especially when it's a guild that she was removed from and a server she no longer plays on.<br>

You told RNG you'd keep the website up as long as they wanted you to.  Then you get pissed off because you're &quot;unappreciated&quot; and shut them down without so much as a hint of a warning and post a message telling the guild off and yelling at them for not bowing to your greatness.    And don't tell me about putting you time in and being unappreciated.  I embody that.  But I guess it bothers me allot less than it bothers you.<br>
<br>
As far as listening to you bitch ONE time, I guess math works differently for retards than for the rest of the world.  Because in my world 2 + 2 is 4 and you bitched dozens of times over a span of weeks.  Fenie isn't talking to you either, huh?  And your reading comprehension is as weak as your math apparently, I said he HELPED you solve your problems, not that he solved all your problems for you.<br>
<br>
As far as my statement to Gosh, I'd be deeply surprised if you knew what I was talking about.<br>

Anyway, as to getting to the bottom of it... I guess if no one's going to ACTUALLY state what ACTUALLY happened, then this is going to be an endless war of ambigous, vague flames. <br>

Hot DAMN!<br>

Again, in every point above you've added your own little zest to the real truth.<br>
<br>
Take, for example, Fenie.  She and I had a problem, yes.  Not because of anything I did or said but because I was a member of RNG.  Why?  Because of a huge misunderstanding between her and RNG and Ragefire.  I had nothing to do with any of it other than I was part of RNG, who she was furious at.   Yet, you've turned it into something totally different, trying to lead people to believe things that just aren't quite the truth.  You didn't mention the fact that she wouldn't talk to the almighty Rhoas either!!!  <br>
<br>
What you don't know is that a couple months before I quit the game we talked things out and settled our differences.  This is another classic case of how you distort things out of proportion.<br>
<br>
Why did I come out of nowhere and bust your 'balls'?  Frankly, for the hell of it.  This entire thread has been very entertaining and fun.  I want to thank you for that.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of the stuff I can summarize my EQ experience as being a couple things.  One, me working very very hard to learn from  people and be the best I could at being a monk.  <br>
<br>
Two, meeting some great minds along the way, many of which I am still friends with today.  <br>
<br>
Three, a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT as I figured out that all the stuff I worked for (besides the friendships) was taken WAAAAY too seriously and I was falling into a ridiculous trap, which I see you are still in.  <br>
<br>
In retrospect it's quite funny how I would let the bitchy things you and many others would do from day to day, ruin my experience in the game.  Funny and a shame at the same time. /shrug  Live and learn.<br>
<br>
Now, as for the rest of it...nothing has changed over this whole thread.  YOU ARE STILL A BITCH.   <br>
<br>
I applaud your stamina &amp; consistency.  <br>

Despite your predictions otherwise, we still have disagreements since you've left, and people speak their minds even when they disagree with our leaders.<br>

Wow... now I've never posted on a thread just to stir the pot, but you sure did accuse me of it alot.  Projecting a little?<br>
<br>
Paimae, has it occured to you yet that I don't care?  Or was I somehow vague in my previous post.  Your petty little life, weak little accomplishments or lack thereof, and rationalizations for your various fuckups are not relevant.  Ok, just so you can't possibly mistake it with your 6th grade reading level:  I do not care about your reasons or feelings on this or any other topic.  You are now and always will be a petty little weasel of a man that uses and betrays his friends, takes his hissy fits out on alot of people, most of whom did nothing to offend you and tries to rationalize his actions into a semblence of acceptable behaivor.    In otherwords,  you are an ASSHOLE.  Thank you.  Please drive through.<br>
<br>
Hmmm, although it now occurs to me that there was one thing I was always currious about.  Is &quot;Pam Pam&quot; your jail bitch name?  Because the only people I can think of that would have Pam Pam for a nickname are either a cute little 4 year old girl or somebody's jail bitch.  And since I know you're not a little girl, no matter how much you scream like one, you must be a jail bitch.  Interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Arlina, I'd answer you and clue you in, but RNG's problems are no longer mine.  So figure it out for youself.<br>
<br>
