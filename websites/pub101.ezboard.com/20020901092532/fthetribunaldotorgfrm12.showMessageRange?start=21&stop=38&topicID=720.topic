It takes a level 50 almost *zip* time to recover lost experience. Experience loss is much more of an annoyance at the mid levels.<br>

Camelot is getting a heck of a lot more content added. In the next couple months, there's going to be housing added. Already there has been dragons(swooping dragons! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) added, epic zones, in the next 6 or so weeks there will be extra low level RVR zones added, so you don't have to get up to level 40 to enjoy that aspect of the game. Rogue classes have finally been fixed, though that's arguable I suppose.<br>
<br>
DAoC is picking up speed again a bit now... I'd say go ahead and try it, and even those that have quit it because of lack of content or whatever... go ahead and renew your account in 3 months. It's finally getting out of beta stage.<br>

Fairly extensive RvR and PvE experience.  Midgard only, though.<br>
<br>
Here's a list of pros and cons to Dark Age of Camelot:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pros </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
- Every class can solo for experience.  Not all can solo *well* or even get *good* experience soloing, but it is in theory possible, for EVERY class.<br>
<br>
- Quest system.. The low to mid level quests are very well thought out and give extremely good rewards for the level of the questor.  Quests are very easy to complete.  All class specific &quot;epic&quot; quests (meaning quests that start at level 1 and last till level 50 - when the system is complete) can be done *SOLO* and net very good items.  For example, the healer &quot;epic weapon&quot; is better for the class than almost all other higher level items that healers can get.  Plus you can choose if you want a 1h hammer, 2h hammer or staff.  Also, there are many &quot;one time drop&quot; items that count as quests.  For example, you kill a named goblin and he drops a +5 strength ring for you, one time.  You can't get it again on that character.  This prevents farming named spawns for rare items, and allows anyone who is appropriate level to get the item.  <br>
<br>
- Monster encounters involve more than fighting higher level mobs with more hit points and damage output.  There's &quot;Bring a Friend&quot; monsters, scout monsters, and more advanced AI.  For example, if a mob is &quot;pulled&quot; and &quot;brings a friend&quot; (or two), the friends usually don't go for tank / melee types first - they attack weaker caster, archer and healer targets.  This isn't advanced ueber AI or anything, but I prefer it to EQ.  Yes, there's certainly the upgrade mobs that hit for more and have more hit points, but the differences in the encounters as players get higher level are more complex than that.<br>
<br>
- Item level system.  Discourages twinking (ha!) to a degree.  More importantly, balances twinks against other &quot;normal&quot; characters - so you don't have a twink that overshadows other lower level characters so much that only twinks are desired for groups.  Yes they have an edge, but there's an abundance of level-appropriate gear that is fairly easy for anyone to obtain from level 1-50.<br>
<br>
- Realm vs. Realm as an end game is a refreshing change from EQ.  Players have much better AI than monsters ;).  There are new &quot;epic&quot; zones, that have extremely high level monsters, and high level loot, but I don't see that as the &quot;end game,&quot; more like a means to an end - get more levels, more equipment.<br>
<br>
- Variety in classes.  In Midgard, at least, there's a variety in each of the classes.  Meaning that you could have two characters that are the same class and have completely different abilities.  There's a lot more individuality than there was in EverQuest.  A Shaman (Midgard secondary priest class) can be a better healer than a Healer (Midgard primary priest class).  One healer might be extremely good at buffing other characters and poor at healing and another might be extremely good at healing and poor at buffing.    One warrior might be extremely offense capable and deal a lot of damage (high weapon skill) or extremely defensive (high parry/shield skills).  Basically, classes aren't cookie cutters in DAoC like they are in EQ.<br>
<br>
- Spells are received by leveling or specializing in the spell line.  You don't have to camp your high level spells to get them, its automatic.  There's no spellbook, no limit on which spells you can have &quot;ready&quot; to cast at a given time.  Just open the spell list, make a hotkey for the spells and you're set.  <br>
<br>
- Buffs don't have to be recast every hour.  There's &quot;concentration&quot; buffs that are cast once and last until the target or caster zone or die.  <br>
<br>
- No zoning.  &quot;Zones&quot; are linked regions like in EQ, but the game doesn't have to reload each zone every time you change regions.  Only when entering or exiting cities, dungeons and enemy realms will a character &quot;zone.&quot;  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THE GAME IS INCOMPLETE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  There are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> severe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> balance problems between the classes, various aspects of Realm vs Realm, there's very few quests and one-time drops over level 35 (they are abundant level 1-25, then start thinning out after that).  <br>
<br>
- There's no public chat channel outside of cities/towns/keeps.  This makes it difficult to form groups and leaves out a lot of the social aspect to &quot;massively multiplayer online game.&quot;  <br>
<br>
- Monsters look the same.  There's relatively few models for monsters, so there's a lot that look the same.  I'm as sick of werewolves in DAoC as i was of frogloks in EQ.<br>
<br>
- Realm vs Realm is very unbalanced and prone to the most whining by bitchy gimps on message boards.  The realm of midgard was very strong, and healers were a good strong class.  Now, Midgard is getting owned completely by Albion and Hibernia because healers faced a HUGE nerf to their pacification line.  Several classes have faced extremely heavy nerfs because of the whining about those classes to Mythic.  There's more problems with realm vs realm than I care to post here...<br>
<br>
- Specialization is locked - once you choose a spec and spend the points, you're stuck with it.  If you made a mistake, tough shit, you can't change it.  That means all those healers that had pacification nerfed cant go back and change their skills.<br>
<br>
- Only 16 concentration buffs can be cast.  There's a concentration &quot;pool&quot; but a 16 buff limit.  I can cast 16 high level buffs and still have half my conc bar left.... er...<br>
<br>
I've got a lot more to say about DAoC, good and bad, but I'll leave it at that, for now.  I hope that answers your inquiry Loegan.<br>
<br>
For the record, I'm still playing DAoC, and I do enjoy it more than EQ.  Realm vs Realm, despite the problems, is a lot more fun for the &quot;end game&quot; than pharming phat lewts. <p><p>

My main is level 39 now, and now that stuff is actually blue to orange to me out in the PVP frontiers, I'm enjoying that aspect of it more. <br>
<br>

Misc.  Characters in Midgard and Albion, too<br>
<br>
<br>
It really depends on what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for a less demanding mmorpg, DAOC is ideal.   You can log on for an hour or 10 hours, doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
EQ is a level treadmill, too.<br>
<br>
A lot of people who talk about redundancy and it being quiet are also people who obviously power leveled.. If you take time to meet people, attend events and socialize, participate in RvR, it breaks up the monotony of the treadmill.<br>
<br>
Talamay hit on some good points.<br>
<br>
Sure there's no twinking and you do need to update your stuff regularly.. but it's not really that much of a concern.  If you play harder than most (quest, dungeon crawl, etc) You're going to have better equipment.  So, there is a leg up if you want it. (i horribly twink my mentalist--twinking isn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> exactly dead</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.  EQ  really seems to revolve around loot, where i meet people who play DAOC and their ideals revolve around strats, Fun and Adventure.   The big thing to do is RvR raids, stealing keep, relics etc.  No_loot_drops off of your opponent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  So, the people who are attracted to it seem a bit more mature.  <br>
<br>
Ahhhh!  Do you know how refreshing it is to walk away from an RvR raid with no one squabbling over loot?  No, you don't.  It's really something you would begin to appreciate. <br>
<br>
I really enjoy the ai on mobs... Talamay covered that well<br>
<br>
Yes, you're limited to 16 buffs.. as a druid, i find this annoying.. i'd LOVE to buff my melee more.  <br>
*However*  You're not spending half your time recasting buffs.  Once they're on, they stay until they log or zone out of the dungeon.  It's a small price to pay.  Also.. i have bards and wardens, in the group, who can cast my baseline buffs.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Over all, i'm just happy not to get bugged constantly for buffs.  It makes a difference.. and allows you to relax and play for a change. <br>
<br>
Like Milos was saying.  I miss some of my friends from EQ... but not EQ itself.  <br>
<br>
DAoC can be a source of relaxing pleasure or you can powerlevel and fight in huge RvR battles till your legs fall off.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I play on roleplay servers... so the level of maturity i'm talking about will be substantially less, if you pick a regular server.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it worth a Try?   Yes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The biggest things lacking are class balancing and high end content. Both of which are being worked on and are getting better. Dragons/Epic Zones have been added, no dragon has been killed yet. They are adding housing soon and a epic dungeon. The epic dungeon will be owned by one realm through RvR combat. The interesting part is that Midgard may own it and then lose it. If your in there when you lose it and the other realm comes in, could be some interesting battles. <br>
<br>
One word of advice, if you thought the Wineplay boards were a sewer of trolls and flames, stay away from the vault network boards. 1/2 of them don't play and are fanboys from other games, the other half are people who want everything their way or nothing at all. You hear all these posts about quiting yet they are still there. Guild message boards are a much better forum of information and opinion.<br>

I Like DAOC over eq due to the fact it has soo much more room to grow where eq can not. If you want rear and uber gear that only you alone can get, one patch could fix that(meaning they can give you better gear, just rare as hell to get). Xp death not really that bad, dunno what camps the other guys hunt, but with me a death and release takes me 20mins to get back in a full groups at lvl 49. You can't lose your lvl, that could be viewed as both a good or a bad thing.<br>
<br>
RvR is one thing that DAOC has done that gives this game room to grown over all the others. You want, uber, we can give ya, you content, we can give ya and expantion. But then the game says i am not giving you this all the uber gear and uber mobs for no reason, it is to get you more decked  so you can take on the bigest and badest mob in the game, another player.<br>
<br>
I liked the uber mobs in eq, till i asked my self, why do i need all this uber gear? To kill more NPC? To wait for the once a year BOTB? So the a newbie can look at me and go what's that? EQ is a good game, but i got sick of killing mobs to get better gear to kill more mobs. Kiiling mobs is cool if it's to better helped me to servive in the battle feild. But killing mobs to get gear just so i look cool when i am inspected, is no longer enuff reason for me to play. <p><BR>

<br>
I have a 42.5 Shadowblade, a 42 Hunter and a level 1 Rogue with ~875 Tailoring.<br>
<br>
Before I get started, let me say that I despise Mythic just like I grew to hate Verant.  It didnt take near as long either.  Possibly because I am jaded, or possibly because they are even more careless and incompetent.  So, stop reading if you are the type who thinks Verant does/did a good job with QA in EQ, or knows their game from their asshole.<br>
<br>
First I will gloss over some of the good.  Then I will go into detail as to what I dislike.<br>
<br>
The graphics are good, the best around in an MMORPG IMO.  The terrain, character models and spell effects especially.<br>
<br>
Melee combat is more interesting than in EQ, because of the styles.  Combat is much shorter in duration in DAoC than EQ.<br>
<br>
Tradeskills are much better here, however they are very incomplete.  More on that later.<br>
<br>
PvP.  I never did much in EQ, pretty much just the Necro BotB.  I didnt ever see a reason for it.  In DAoC, at least in theory, the game is built around the conflict among the three realms, so PvP is very much a big part of the game.  But, if you dont want to PvP, you dont have to. but again, its very incomplete.  More on that later.<br>
<br>
Soloability.  In general, its easier to play DAoC alone.  I know its an MMORPG, but for those times you have only a half hour to kill, DAoC is more accessible than EQ.  You can work a trade, you can solo for xp, you can RvR.  All with maybe 10-15 mins travel time tops.<br>
<br>
Downtime.  There is less overall, but you have to kill a *hell* of a lot more mobs to level, especially 40+.  Its misleading, early on you will feel like its much easier to level in DAoC than EQ, but starting at 41, it changes, and levels 41-50 are very much like 51-60 in EQ, ie. shitty.  Having played a Hunter, one of the best DAoC leveling classes, and a Necro, one of the best EQ leveling classes, I feel like getting to 50 in DAoC is about the same as getting to 60 in EQ.<br>
<br>
My number one beef with the game is that it is not close to being done.  There is no way in hell it should have been released in October of last year.  I still dont think its done, and there will be a lot more nerfs before they get where they need to be.<br>
<br>
There is a distinct lack of high level content, although that is finally being addressed.  Still, there are lots of zones that are unitemized, and very limited 'raid' level mobs/zones.  Quests also become very rare at level 30 on up.<br>
<br>
RvR is half-assed.  The game is sold around it, and yet there is no compelling reason to partake in it aside from pride.  Taking keeps really does nothing aside from replacing the enemies wandering guards with your own.  Relics do jack shit, which is unbelievable 4+ months after release.  RPs, points you get from killing other players, and they are not at all awarded fairly.  Healing classes dont get them for healing or ressing, and straight up melee only classes have a hell of a time amassing them in because AE spells and ranged attacks own the battefield.  They recently added BPs (bounty points), which you also get from killing players, but can be 'spent' on incredibly lame and useless stuff.  Why they need two types of points being awarded for the same thing is beyond me.<br>
<br>
Tradeskills are also not done.  During the beta, which I was not a part of and really had no clue was even going on aside from a few Legendary Euros occasionally commenting on it, Mythic really jocked the tradeskills.  Saying that playermade stuff would be superior to anything in game, blah blah.  Well, as it turns out, it simply is not true.<br>
<br>
Now, the tradeskills are much more extensive than in EQ, and you can actually earn money (good money) by doing them.  And they are more useful than in EQ, but saying they are the source of the best gear in the game is misleading at best, a flat out lie at worst.<br>
<br>
Quickly, a little background on the way items work in DAoC.  Each item has a level.  The relationship in levels between an item and your character is expressed as a color, very similar to the system they use to relate your char against other chars, enemies and monsters.  Grey/Green/Blue/Yellow/Orange/Red/Purple, from lowest to highest.  If the item is too high a level for you, the item is less effective when used by you, and degrades quicker.  If it is too low a level for you, it isnt inherently less useful, but becauase of the natural progression in damage from weps, protection from armor, etc. you will want to get rid of it in a hurry.<br>
<br>
They try to discourage twinking with this system, but it really doesnt work.  Items never really wear out so fast that you wouldnt want to use something that is high con to you for fear of it eventually becoming useless, and in general red/orange stuff is more effective than yellow stuff, because its got higher base stats, and likely a higher enchantment level.<br>
<br>
Item effectiveness is further modified by its quality (a static value from 1-100), its current condition (this is what decreases as an item is used, it can be repaired however), and its enchantment level (static, 0-25).  Ideally, you want to use equipment that is your level or slightly higher, with as high a quality and enchantment level as you can find.<br>
<br>
Two things conspire to cripple tradeskills.  One, the highest level item a player can craft is level 41, and that is limited to weapons.  There are no armors that are even level 40.  By the time you are 40, any item one level above you is yellow.  So at 40, there are no more yellow playermade items.  That sucks for crafters, because at 40 there are red dropped items which blow the doors off the best stuff they can make.<br>
<br>
And two, playermade items have no stat bonuses or weapon procs.  Dropped items are filled with them.  A new trade, spellcrafting, which would allow spellcrafters to imbue playermade objects with stats and bonuses has been promised since before release to alleviate this disparity.  <br>
<br>
As an aside, quality of playermade items almost never approaches the top quested items, which are usually 100%.  In general, playermade items are of superior quality, but it is very, very rare to get a 100quality playermade item because a master craftsman has a 1% chance of cranking one out assuming the item is grey to him/her (tradeskills use a color coded con system as well, which expresses the crafters trade skill vs the difficulty of the item he/she is trying to make.  Grey is never fail, up to red which is hard to make and you often will lose materials).<br>
<br>
Mythic also is worse than Verant when it comes to addressing issues regarding the game.  They are reluctant to discuss how skills work.  They will not comment on stats, much like Verant would not.  Etc.  Basically, since they started charging for the game, they have been getting more and more withdrawn when it comes to the playerbase.  Some people blame the posters on the unofficial official VGN forums for that, as there is a lot of negativity and flames much like what used to be on the station before Verant decided to completely regulate the flow of information there.<br>
<br>
But the biggest cluster of all is class balance.  Simply put, the classes are not balanced at all, not within the realms for PvE, and not without for RvR purposes.  Much like Verant, they have a test server.  Like Verant, they dont do as much testing as you'd expect there, and they disregard the testers comments.  They basically use it as a vehicle to test technical stability of their patches, not content balancing.<br>
<br>
So, classes get nerfed a lot.  Classes get boosted a lot.  There have been more class nerfs in DAoC in 4 months than EQ has had in its history.  Because of the dual PvE/RvR nature of DAoc, and the way you use skill points to definie your character, its a tougher job to balance the classes, and nerfs have the possibility to hurt a lot more.  <br>
<br>
Making a difficult situation even tougher, Mythic has no concept of what they are trying to achieve with balance.  There is no rhyme or reason to the changes they make.  They dont seem to be balancing against the ability to gain xp, and they dont seem to be balancing against the ability to gain RPs.  So what subjective criteria are they using?  What other subjective criteria is there?<br>
<br>
Anyway, my advice in a nutshell is, if you are bored with your current MMORPG, or looking to play an MMORPG to play for the first time, it cant hurt to give DAoC a spin.  The trial month can be used w/o having to pony up a CC.  If you are looking for something groundbreaking, or a company that goes above and beyond, however, DAoC/Mythic aint it.<br>

Dead on, too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think Mythic dug themselves into a hole during beta, and now it's near impossible for them to get out of it. So they end up changing things around constantly, balancing and rebalancing classes, nerfing and then attempting to make the class powerful again.<br>
<br>
Still, I think the game is in overall better shape than EQ was at the beginning. They are at least making a great attempt at calming down the &quot;no content&quot; complaints. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufadreslyblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fadre Slyblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 3:32:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DAoC</span><hr size=1> I think that Hazewire did a great job of showing the pros and cons of DAoC vs EQ.  Here are a few things I'd like to mention in addition.  I have to warn you that although I played EQ for nearly 3 years, I tried DAoC and love it.  I believe that they have fixed all the things about EQ that frustrated me.  I find it much more relaxing to play and I'm able to actually play in much more of a casual manner while still being successful in the game.  The basic concepts are similar but there are quite a few improvements that have been made and content is being added every week with a patch.  BTW, patch times are MUCH shorter than the typical 4 hour EQ patch that turns into a 6-12 hour patch.<br>
<br>
Someone brought up that it is difficult to socialize due to the unavailability of a &quot;shout&quot; channel or an &quot;auction&quot; channel.  In fact these channels do exist but only in the city zones.  Personally I find it very relaxing to not have to read the constant shouting of garbage comments while I'm trying to talk with friends, fight, etc.  I like this feature.  The socializing is not difficult either.  It is very easy to communicate via guild chat or just conversing within your group or immediate area.  Also there is a shout command however it is only heard within a certain radius - definitely not zone wide.<br>
<br>
A feature that I find very nice with DAoC is that there is no such concept as a corpse recovery.  When you die you have to option of releasing your corpse and repopping back at your bind point, or getting a rez on the spot.  In either case your possessions remain with you.  There is no chance of losing any items.  A gravestone is erected where you died and you may return to it to /pray and regain some of your lost experience.  Your spells are not lost from memory and are available for immediate use provided you have enough power (mana).  Like EQ there is no penalty for death until you reach lvl 5, or maybe lvl 6 - it's been a while since I was there.<br>
<br>
Binding is not a spell ability restricted to only certain classes.  There are certain locations throughout the game where you simply type /bind and you are bound there.  It sure makes it easier to do this than to sit at the West Freeport gate and shout for a bind for 15 mins.<br>
<br>
Horses are the main travel mode in DAoC.  Teleport doesn't exist nor is it needed.  You purchase a horse ride 5sp from a stablemaster and off you go.  It's also much more convenient than shouting for a port, etc.<br>
<br>
In essence I have found that all the things that take a long time and take time away from playing the game just don't seem to exist in DAoC.  I have very little down time and very little frustration in DAoC.  I can log on and either solo play or get a group together, or chat in guild, work on tradeskills, work on a quest or an NPC task and have fun.  I can log on and play for an hour and log off.  When I played EQ I would log on and I might be doing what I wanted an hour later after getting a port, binding, getting a group, waiting on the damn boat, etc.  <br>
<br>
But the best thing about DAoC is the graphics ROCK!  Especially the spell effects - they are awesome.  There is nothing like casting a DD spell and having a bright blue lightning bolt streak out of the sky far above the mob and cracking it in the head.  Except maybe casting a fire bolt spell and watching a flaming ball of fire impact and spray molten rock flames across your target, then as the fire dies down the mob is left smoking.<br>
<br>
Anyhow this is just my humble opinion.  <br>
<br>
Take care friends!<br>
