I see more evidence in the world of God's existence than of his non-existence (conscious thought, forces acting on matter with no explanation where those forces come from; such as gravity, weak and strong nuclear forces, prolly could think of lots more but its bedtime) and therefore searched for the correct way to find God and found no religious text more influential, good, and humble than the Bible.  Now that I have faith in God's word, there is no &quot;what makes you so sure?&quot; question to be asked.<br>

Funny how you are asking that to people whose tendencies are not to doubt when its a doubtful question??  Just a tad ironic.  Its important to say that before I chose to believe, I most definitely questioned and doubted.  Once I made my decision (one that took a while), it was no longer an issue of doubting (kinda like how people stick to their guild or group of people even if they think it might have done something wrong...except I don't think there is anything wrong in the Bible any more).<br>
<br>
It is also important to say that I was one of those people who did not grow up in a Christian background...so I don't exactly fit Larg's theory...although I'm not saying its wrong either.<br>

Hey, count, let's say someone tries one Canadian quarter in an American telephone and it does not work (assuming local calls still cost only 25 cents).  Should we conclude from this evidence that Canadian quarters do not work in all American telephones?<br>
<br>
No, but how do you suggest we solve this problem?  A reasonable person would say something like, &quot;Well, let's try 50 phones around the states, and if it doesn't work, then it's a fair induction that Canadian quarters don't work in American phones&quot; and the matter would be settled.<br>
<br>
Countic, on the other hand would say, &quot;OMG, that's not proof!  You didn't test every phone in America, you can't say that !!!11!!1!  I still believe Canadian quarters can work in American phones!&quot;<br>
<br>
And the reasonable people are like, &quot;Dude, countic, we tried <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>fifty</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> phones and it didn't work in any of them.  You think there is a freak phone out there is going to work?&quot;<br>

No, not even for the sake of argument.  Will you for once figure out what proof means?  It makes it a *pass*, not proof, not even for the sake of argument.  It makes it an accepted statement by both parties.<br>

No, see, you already are trying to twist things around (and you accuse me of spin doctoring?).  Is it proof? certainly not.  But you go saying in your own opinion &quot;that the matter would be settled&quot;.  Nice try at spin doctoring that into what must be against what I said.  Take a look at my whole speal and you will see that my argument, from the beginning that this started, has been &quot;and the matter would be settled&quot; (i.e. a *pass* on both parties accepting the terms).  Now, if this specific occasion was relevant to me, most certainly I would burst out and say &quot;no its not proof!&quot; (because it isn't).  However, trying to legitimate such a stupid analogy with such a relevant one has got me baffled...and your attempts at making me look stupid failing.  Leave the job of making me look stupid, to me.  I do it way better and don't need any facilitation.

<br>
About the same time I left on my mission, he was ordained a high priest. I was reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, and would come across passages about high priests and that would make me think about my dad. No, he is far from perfect. He has a wife that speaks her mond and loves to play devils advocate, 3 kids that drive him bonkers ( I prefer to think being a missionary at the time I was exempt from driving him nuts, although I have contributed to his gray hair count since then). As a youth, we were always told to personalize the scriptures and thats what I did. A high priest in the bible was no awesome guy, he was a regular joe with additional church responsiblities.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the other thing that helped was Christs comment about the Sabbath being made for Man, not Man for the Sabbath. So my view on reilgion is quite laid back, which drives people at church crazy. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Wittles 54 warrior Retired<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Naffenea 55 ranger<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Screaming 52 druid<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Vaseel 51 bard Retired</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 370<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/22/03 8:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=741.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes you believe...</span><hr size=1> You have a bad definition of &quot;proof&quot; then Hayzen.

However, its important to point out that if we were to switch definitions to fit the way you have shown them (i.e. changing the word, but not what is trying to be communicated) that of course you have &quot;proof&quot; of contradictions in the Bible, if you confine proof to mean convincing evidence.  But, you lose the definition of what I will call &quot;hard proof&quot;.  Because now that you are only trying to make your argument with &quot;evidence&quot;, its no longer a matter of &quot;hard proof&quot; but instead of personal opinion and decision.  All this time I have been arguing that you cannot give &quot;hard proof&quot; of the contradictions, when perhaps you have been only arguing that you can give &quot;soft proof&quot; as I'll call it (soft proof = definitions you are giving now for proof).  If we use your definitions, then there is no way to convince you, because its simply based on your motivation and opinion that is hyped up by evidence (yes, I agree that both sides have evidence to their claims) that you choose to take more belief into than evidence against your beliefs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 709<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/22/03 12:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=741.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/tsukasa.jpg width=50 height=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes you believe...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Now the dictionary is wrong and not you?&quot; --<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hayzen</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

While that may be true for many people, I personally think that his question refers more to those who actually are well educated and informed.  Otherwise, the answer is, as you point out, rather obvious and uninteresting.<br>

I have a basic understanding of many of the most widely followed religions.  It is silly to require an equal understanding, since obviously one will desire to know more about their own chosen (or taught) faith, but I feel that I have a pretty good grasp on the basics principles of Islam, Buddhism, Hinduiusm (not as well as the rest though), several of the various Eastern religions (often more a philosophy of living rather than a religion per se, especially in practice), and most of the various Christian sects, as well as many various Pagan pantheons and practices which I don't really take very seriously, but are still interesting (sorry, Wiccans).  Out of them all, interestingly, Christianity is the only faith which does not require self-justification.  Of course, I am also a product of my upbringing, and I believe VERY strongly in certain philosophical points that are Christian, but also transcend beyond it - that human nature is evil, and various other things of that sort.  I can identify more with monotheistic religions such as Islam that share many core precepts and philosophical underpinnings much more than Buddhism or many Eastern philosophies, simply because of my mindset.  That's just the way people, are, though... and obviously, there are also American Buddhists, and Chinese/Indian Christians, including those who were raised differently.  Taking this into account, my example above of one thing I believe sets Christianity apart would likely not mean much to a Taoist, to whom the whole redemption deal wouldn't make much sense anyway. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 6/23/03 6:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1999<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/03 6:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=741.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes you believe...</span><hr size=1> You may have a decent grasp on them NOW... but I highly doubt that you did during the impressionable time that you made your choice.

<br>
What I'm saying is that, while I see it through the lens of the core philosophy that I feel is completely part of me (and part of what I feel also drives my political beliefs), I am perfectly capable of analyzing various religions/faiths, and I am capable of changing my views based on evidence or arguments that I find persuasive.  I've done so several times already in the last few years, just not in a drastic way.  Given enough evidence or convincing, I could see myself becoming a Catholic, or Orthodox, or maybe even Muslim, should some truly earthshaking happen (although I couldn't say what).  I can't see myself becoming a Buddhist, though, but you never know, I guess.  Right now, however, all in all, between my faith and my objective knowledge, I feel pretty comfortable where I am.<br>
<br>
Your question is meaningless, you can't play hypothetical games like that, Wolvar.  It's just pointless.  How about you?  Would you be a Muslim if you were raised that way?  You'd like to think that you wouldn't, probably, but I don't think you can really even say that.  None of us can, because we simply don't know.  Too many things to consider. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1999<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/03 6:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=741.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes you believe...</span><hr size=1> You may be constantly evaluating your beliefs, but you are doing so from a position of already having made a choice.

<br>
My question is not meaningless and the objective mind *can* grasp this hypothetical situation.  It's quite simple really.  Why do you suppose that entire countries and cultures, discounting immigration and missionary projects, are predominantly a single religion?  It's because we believe what we are taught to believe... there are cases of people changing religions obviously, there are exceptions to every rule.  When I make that statement it is a generalization, but I believe it's an accurate one.<br>
<br>
Of course I would have been muslim were I raised in an Islamic country and so would you.  How can you think otherwise?  <br>
<br>
Here's a related question...<br>
<br>
How many morale issues do you feel differently about than does your family?  Are there really that many?<br>
<br>
You see... I believe that it takes a vivid personal experience to cause someone to veer away from what they have been taught.  Otherwise, they accept the moral code and religion that has been instilled to them by their upbringing.  Does this make us sheep?  No, because if we DO have that vivid personal experience, we are quite capapble of forming our own conclusions and making our own decisions.. but it takes a serious event to cut us out of the herd. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1349<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/03 6:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=741.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes you believe...</span><hr size=1> It depends on the country/religion, the societal pressures, the family pressures, the degree to which you are sincerely taught, or just going through the motions.

I agree with you, but I think you're placing too much emphasis on actual belief.  In my experience, a majority of the Faithful aren't exactly very faithful, no matter what religion you're talking about, but rather it is simply the accepted social norm.  That also means that, taken outside of their social circle, or given the possibility of the creation of or participation in a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>different</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one, possibly through a missionary community or some other device, many people would find it fairly easy to &quot;convert&quot;.
