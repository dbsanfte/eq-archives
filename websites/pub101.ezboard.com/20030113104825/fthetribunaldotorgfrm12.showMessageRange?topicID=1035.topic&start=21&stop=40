Some servers have it far, far worse, like having 4-5 guilds in ToV N *SIX* months ago as opposed to this happening on Tribunal in the last 2 months or so. Only 2 guilds who kill AoW as opposed to 4. Only two guilds actively raiding the current SoL end game and frankly, we haven't truly butted heads over a mob since SoL came out (the time zone difference and the structure of the Emp/Blood encounter means we can actually both try it without getting in each other's way).<br>
<br>
PoP will help spread out guilds that are either in Vex Thal (VT) or at least working on killing the Emperor, no question. However, I'm not so sure it will help those guilds who are currently killing in ToV N. My thinking on this is to do with the time sinks that are involved in getting into VT. I am 100% not trying to be offensive here, but the committment required to get into VT is something that *cannot* be appreciated until you have experienced it first hand. The sheer number of quest items you need to get for *every single guild member* is brutal. No less than 17 items at a minimum (4 to get Emp key, then 13 more for VT key), and 19 items (weapon + ore for Shissar bane for Emp fight) for melee (21 for dual wielders). It's actually not the difficulty of the Emperor fight that will stop people from getting into VT, because while he is very, very hard, the same has been true of every other uber mob in EQ and eventually, more and more guilds are able to kill them. It's the amount of time and effort required to even *attempt* to kill him that, I think, will deter alot of guilds.<br>
<br>
That's not a slam on the skill of other guilds or anything like that - its simply an observation that there are only so many people per server who are able to spend enough time in EQ to slog through these time sinks. Anyone other than a hardcore, and I mean *hardcore*, raiding guild will never see the inside of VT. Actually, a caveat - the fact that the VT key piece from the Emp is droppable does open up the possibility of up and coming guilds being able to get VT keys without killing the Emperor. Whether that ever happens on our server is anyone's guess =). Even if that does happen, however, the shards for VT key are still a huge pain to get.<br>
<br>

Im talking atleast twice that of Luclin. Even than while those guilds are hunting there, the guilds below them will be moving up to the mobs/zones they use to do. It also depends on how PoP is made. If PoP is not that hard compared to Luclin mobs, than spending all that time getting to Vex Thal through the Emperor in Ssara may be a waste as other guilds other than EV/Comps find lots of mobs to kill that relinquish just as good loot if not better. Or it may be a place like Vellious where faction and resists play a big part unlike in Luclin where its DPS and mana that seems to matter more.<br>

So to claim a guild that killed Vindi, had to wait for more to kill Statue, is proclaiming your ignorance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then why, did in the hour between killing Vindi and pulling Statue, did SP wait for their numbers to come from 28 to 40-45ish? SP didn't even attempt to pull statue, they sat around until they had 15-20ish more, and then pulled him (and killed him). I sorta find this backhanded, because the GM said SP got first shot, then Transcended. We had enough to kill SoRZ when SP pulled vindi, but SP waited an hour and built up their force before trying that. Guide Loweyan was wrong in his decision (imo at least). Grats SP on the kill.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone is bitter anymore, this happened 3 or 4 months ago. The problem people have, is with the Guide not allowing the guilds to  fcfs the pull, ie, pull whenever they're ready. Pulling statue after someone has killed vindi is nothing new. And at this point, SP hadn't even killed SoRZ.<br>
<br>
Yes, I get tired of the GM encounters my guild has had. Statue #1, Zland/Statue #2 (at our request), NToV, and Restless Burrower.<br>
<br>
I had no problem with the  2nd call (zland/sorz) by the gm, following Trans killing zland and gm asking trans to leave kael. We had already had a conflict over zland, and the gm was trying to prevent further conflict by allowing sp to go for sorz, since trans had gotten zland. The two calls I have a problem with, were the 1st call (sorz), 3rd call (restless burrower), and the banning of Trans from ToV. Trans had capable force both times.<br>
<br>
In the 3rd case, only a group of DV were in zone, xping in another area of AC, yet the Guide stated they had been camping the spawn. This even after a DV monk had been chewing up mod rods and a few feeble attempts at training. But we grumbled and left to kill other things.<br>
<br>
In the final case, it was an individual action by a member (who says it was accidental) that resulted in the ENTIRE guild, most of which weren't even online at the time, being banned for 24 hours from ToV.<br>
<br>
Either way, GM calls will be bad and good. The important thing is the mob will always respawn, and to not let a bad call piss you off. <p><HR>

You assumed we were waiting for more to come.  As I've been indicating, we weren't waiting for more to come.  It's been a while since it happened, so I can't give you a run down of all the events that happened in our camp, but I can assure you we weren't sitting on our butts waiting for more people.  We had plenty already.  <br>
<br>
The reason for the swell in our numbers, is because that's typical of SP.  We aren't a mandatory raid guild.  Raids generally happen impromptu, and as people log in, they generally head to any raid that is going on, especially if we have CoH.  We also don't shut the doors on late comers, as we like for everyone to enjoy the raids we do have.  I won't deny that our numbers swelled between Vindi and the Statue, but I will say they didn't swell because we needed them.  The people that came to Kael after Vindi, weren't called upon.  They weren't online til then, is all.<br>
<br>
I can see how someone that isn't in the know, might assume what you assume, that's why I choose to educate you on this.  As it appears, months after the episode you continue to go on about what happened, proclaiming your view of the situation as fact.  So perhaps, after this, you'll understand and just let it go.  If you wish to discuss this further, you can toss me a tell in game. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukaldun1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kaldun1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 8:57:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> Actually Sscaley, Transcended is very comitted to progression.

I assume you mean the Acrylia Caverns keys for Inner Acrylia?<br>
<br>
Because risk vs. reward is terribly fucked in Inner AC and the key quest is arguably one of the most time consuming key quests in the game? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131483>Merton Rtehsuq</a><BR>

I'll trust your judgement. It was still a bad call by the GM, as they are not linked encounters. I didn't mean to drag this up again, I was using it as an example to prove my point of the relatively unknowledgeable Guides. If they're going to make a decision on high end content, maybe they should know a little about that content, OR pass it up to a more knowledgable GM/Guide, assuming one is online. <p><HR>

I just have one question for the current NToV guilds - why aren't you working on the AC keys to the master rings/encounters if you want something to do? Instead you sit around killing (if they are up) the same lame mobs without seeming to be wanting to progress and explore. It would make a nice appetizer for the timesinks that PoP will bring...&quot;<br>
<br>
Cuz it's tedious... boring... not fun.<br>
<br>
Also consider that, at least as SI is concerned, we have specific &quot;raid nights&quot;  (these have had some variance lately, but they still are fairly predictable).  As such on a non &quot;raid&quot; night you might find ... 20 or so people online.   I know Friday evening around 8:30 there were 13 people online when I logged on for a few minutes, and 3 of those were me  : P<br>
<br>
There's little desire to do boring key camps.  I work in real life, and I know that many others share the same sentiment, but I'll be damned if I am gonna log in and drudge around for &quot;the next part of a key&quot; for hours upon hours, days upon days.  I do similar all day with &quot;boring&quot; work.<br>
<br>
Do we want to progress?  Certainly.  There are things SI has as &quot;the next step.&quot;  Tunare (once they fix her again), AOW, Shei, and the Burrower Parasite.  The only other things are in SSra, a keyed zone / timesink.  As a guild, if members want to camp keys, then that's great.   A vast majority of guildmembers are uninterested in this, though.  They go out on Friday and Saturday nights.   They spend Sundays with their families, etc.  And when they come home from work or school during the week, they enjoy logging in and being free to do what they like, instead of being told they must work on a key.<br>
<br>
Verant accomplished what they wished with Ssra, and that was separation of those who play mostly full time vs. those who play mostly part time.  This isn't a bad thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember Kunark?  Luclin is the new Kunark.  Think about it.  Yeah there is a bit more high level content, but it's a quick expansion, with keyed zones, mostly newbie / mid level areas (due mainly to the new Vah Shir race) and a big keyed zone at the end.   Kunark had some bigger stuff... the outdoor dragons, venril, trakanon...  but to get into veeshan's peak you had to do an annoying timesink key quest.   (and it wasn't even half as bad as this Ssra key crap)    PoP will hopefully be the new Velious.  All high level content.  Greater difficulty and rewards which rival Ssra / VT items at the high end (think NTOV versus VP gear).<br>
<br>
With that in mind.   And PoP a few months away at most... why bother with the VT push for a guild which doesn't raid 24 / 7 ?  Why bother with a push for *gag*  Acrylia keys...  =/  lol<br>
<br>
PoP will solve the problem for a time.  The next expansion after PoP will again solve the problem for a time.  Etc.<br>
<br>
The best thing Verant could do at the moment would be to make all high level content 3 days spawn time max.  There has to be some good reason they are not doing that... but it would ease much of the complaining of &quot;nothing to do&quot; from those that don't want to camp keys and key pieces, and there would be something to do every night of the week. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umakino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 11:31:38 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://roforums.dhs.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/Avatars/mage-female.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> I thought PoP will require yet again more timesinks to progress to the next plane in the sequence... <p><hr>

Planes of Power will be a linear progression of successive zones. This is an inherent pipeline that will intensify, not reduce, competition for content.<br>
<br>
Imagine what Velious would have been like if every single zone, starting from Iceclad, required you to kill a miniboss to move to the next zone (a la skyshrine key). How much competition would there be for those minibosses? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1922"><b>Thistleburr</b></a>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><a href="http://www.evguild.org"><i>Elitists and Vagrants</i></a>, Tribunal Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 12:04:48 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> Seems I'll be ducking out of EQ once PoP comes out. =) <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=81&stop=83>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1035.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1035.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1035.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1035.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1035.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1035.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> -
