As far as Mormons, they are wildly different from Christianity as characterized by the mainstream denominations, i.e. Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox.  These differ on various points of doctrine, but the basic Gospel remains the same; even the Catholic Church has recognized that faith alone produces salvation, while also stating that good works are a crucial part of the process as well in that they are the necessary proof of salvation, i.e. things which will necessarily follow.  Mormons believe something completely different, and are not Christians at all in my opinion, any more than Muslims are.  They believe, broadly, that Jesus was just another man who *acheived* the pinnacle of goodness in his time on Earth and thus became a god, the god over this universe.  We men then must strive to obey the principles of the Latter Day Saints church, and achieve varying levels of heavenly status based on how well we do so, possibly even becoming gods ourselves, although this is (of course) very difficult.  The trappings look similar to Christianity, but the religion at its core is closer to Islam - salvation through works and adherence to law.  Although for Mormons, its not salvation so much as personal elevation.  This idea can be, of course, quite appealing.  Scientology pulls a similar stunt.  Unfortunately, the LDS Church got in a good time before Scientology did and managed to acheieve a measure of legitimacy, although I rank Mormons not much higher on the totem of legitimacy myself.  At least their Church isn't as blatantly scary as Scientology - all their nasty stuff got pulled from the Official Canon for PR purposes.  Stuff like being justified in murdering your own kin if they forsake Mormonism, etc... =)  And yeah, the founders of Mormonism lifted passages and style straight from the Bible for their revised scriptures... it all started as just a big scam to get money and women for the big shots at first imo.  Of course this statement will scandalize any Mormon, but I think the facts bear sufficient witness, hehe.  Oh well.  I'm sure Arleanna, Sciek, and a vast many others would postulate similar things about Jesus and the early Christians, although there isn't quite the same evidence present as for the Utah folk.<br>

<br>
The accuracy of the Bible is not as straight forward as that.  The most commonly accepted versions of the Bible, are actually remarkably well preserved considering their age.  I don't agree with Arlenna that the mistranslations are that extreme but they do exist and they do so for a very good reason, God inspired or not.  There is no way to perfectly translate from one language to another, even closely related ones.  No matter how careful you are there are turn of phrases, words, and grammer etc. that cannot be perfectly presented in another language.  This forces the translator to make a judgement call and theire have been different ones made.<br>
<br>
Also before pointing out inconsistencies in the Bible one must remember that the Bible is not the WHOLE story and never claims to be.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you allow that some passages in the bible must be interpreted, not taken literally, you are on thin ice trying to tell people that THIS passage is literal and THIS passage isn't without SOME backing for it.  My reading of Genesis does not conflict in my mind with evolution.  The overall broad arc of the creation story matches, mostly, the overall broad arc of the progression of developement given by the Big Bang and Evolution theories. (notice I did not say creation, neither theory actually deals with creation, just what happened after).  Am I taking Genesis as literal? No obviously not.  But the important part of the story(God is THE Creator and the relationship of God to Man) is not changed by different interpretations of the nuts and bolts of the creation story.<br>
<br>
Also one little thing on Milton, Satan etc.  Milton was actually a deeply religous firebrand Protestant.  However he did not make up  the general idea of Satan the Fallen Angel up and niether did the founders of Christianity.  That came from somewhat obscure<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>non-scripture</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Jewish traditions originally(actually the same source as the general idea of Hell and Satan in the New Testement).   But Paradise Lost is a greatly expanded and embellished version of that.  Classical Myth and Dante greatly influanced this but the basic story is far older, it just was never(and still isn't) considered scripture.<br>
<br>
The idea of Jesus in Hell for 3 days is straight from Milton imagination(though one could argu he was devinely inspired) however.  That came from Paradise Regained and is pretty much a true work of fiction, even though Milton was trying to get accross a specific religous message. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

You know who proved it? Charles Darwin. Oh, you say how? 13 Different species of Finches on the gollapogos islands. All with different traits but still of the same common ancestor the finch. I believe it was the beaks and tallons that set the birds apart. <br>
<br>
Or maybe it was the lead up to the common day horse? the horse use to be toed and it is proven through fossil records and the current day horses structure that the bones slowly shifted upwards and became smaller, except for the dominant toe which formed into the hoof. <br>
<br>
Oh and well jee wiz. What about every single embryo having a tail and gill slits? Yes we all had gill slits when we were embryo's that slowly developed into the ear canal.<br>

I have a blanket that keeps me warm. The bible is some peoples blanket and gives them something to believe in something holy or divine that will turn their lives around and truly bless them.

Yes, this is a common response to the problem.  However, it doesn't solve it, it is more of a workaround.  If God exists outside of time, and see all points in time at once, then He really doesn't have foreknowledge of anything, and thus isn't omniscient.  Besides, there is nothing that really implies that God exists outside of time according to the Bible.<br>

<br>
I do find what you wrote interesting and im going to go look up and read more about that.. )<br>
<br>
alot alsot has to do with who is writing.. if a chreationist is writing a book obviously he/she isnt going to spend much time trying to prove evolution...  and visa versa..<br>
<br>
the Darwin &quot;Natural Selection&quot; theory i will never understand... it makes absolutley no snese.. that things just happen for no reason...<br>
<br>
Kind of defeats a scientific proof for me when alot is based on random occurances you cannot prove..<br>
<br>
Of course you can say.. Well you cannot prove Creationism either... nope i cant lol... its all based on a book.. that has been translated a million times.. and for all alot of us know.. some translations arent even accurate... <br>
<br>
So both theories have lots of holes in it...  to me it boils down too.. this What do you think happens to you after you die??<br>
<br>
Evolutionists would say we are dumped in a box and cease to exist... a Christian would say i am going to heaven or hell based on my faith that Jesus died for my sins...'<br>
<br>
i am an optomist mostly and really hope there is more to look forward too after i die.. <br>
<br>
who knows maybe ill get to heaven and it will be a endless life of EQ where i dont have to work anymore =p<br>

oh  yeah lol the Pope is an Antichrist figure.... Christianity is based of faith in christ.. and spending time focusing on a man made &quot;God Like&quot; figure is taking away your focus on Jesus...  <br>

It just doesn't work like that.  Like I have said before, it's purely a matter of faith, one way or the other.  You can interpret how you like to meet what you expect, and I can interpret, without stretching the words, to coincide with what I believe.  We are at an impasse.<br>
<br>
I stated that God is omniscient as a fact because that is the base assumption we are working on, along with his omnipotence, omnipresence, righteousness, etc. etc.  I assume you know at least the characteristics of God according to Christianity?  The burden of proof of each one of these is not upon the Christian; there is in fact no burden of proof because none of them can be proven incontrovertibly.  Any sort of justification or argument a Christian makes for his case inevitably boils down to the presence or lack of faith in the Christian God, so arguing about his characteristics or existence of necessity indicates that one party does not believe in Him (unless they are playing Devil's advocate for the purpose of a discussion meant to teach or inform).  This renders the entire exercise rather pointless - I'm not going to convince you of anything, or you me.  We'll just go back and forth about it with our pretty little arguments until we're blue in the face.  You claim God is constricted by human linguistic and logical tools, I dismiss such claims offhand as illegitimate on their face.  There's really no way around it.<br>
<br>
As far as evolution, Dumai is basically correct.  Evolution is, of course, a scientific fact.  The species of finch etc., that's all fine and well.  They're all still finches, even if they have different beaks or feet or what not, right?  On the other hand, did Darwin find any &quot;proto-finches&quot;?  The Theory of Evolution as an explanation of the origin of species remains a theory, nothing more.  It is a theory which is largely incompatible with most Judeo-Christian religious beliefs, although some attempt to reconcile the two.  Thus, it is commonly associated with agnostics and atheists, not in small part due to the tendency of its strongest proponents to take such views.  There are reasons that the Theory of Evolution remains a theory - decisive lack of evidence to support it.  If such evidence existed, it would no longer be a theory.<br>

This debate, as much as the issue of God's existence, relies primarily on faith.  Evolutionists have faith that evidence exists somewhere out there which fills in their missing links.  Creationists have faith that there are no missing links, and all the proto-human apelike skeletons that have been dug up are simply apes.  Thus, attempts to label one side as inherently &quot;retarded&quot; or ignorant are at best rather silly.  Admittedly, some Bible-thumpers are indeed quite ignorant of science and the theories and evidence pertaining to the origin of mankind.  Likewise, I believe that one can find evolutionists just as frothingly mad with certitude.<br>
<br>
Label Creationism a belief if you like.  It doesn't bother me.  I know very well that there is little to no empirical evidence to back it up.  That doesn't really bother me.  People believe all sorts of silly things based on faith, believe it or not... including scientists.  The fact that they have a microcosmic phenomena (adaptation) which Darwin then expanded to fit a macro scale view (Theory of Evolution) does not grant that theory any special legitimacy, imo. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

<br>
There are a bunch of answers to this question, a simple one is no, he can't.<br>
<br>
Thats when you chime in and say &quot;AHA, he isn't all powerful then! I HAVE DISPROVED THE CHRISTIAN GOD!!1!!1!&quot;<br>
<br>
Assume god creates an infinately large rock.  He has made the largest rock possible.  Then he lifts it with his infinate strength.<br>
<br>
Answer #2.  God is not bound by human logic.  He can make square circles, he can make 1+1 = 3, he can make rocks he can't lift, and he can lift rocks he can't lift.<br>
<br>
Answer #3.  You have made the assumption that an immovable object and an irresistable force can coexist in the same universe.  They are mutually exclusive, therefore the question is wrong, not the answer.<br>
<br>
Answer #4.  The question is nonsense.  You may as well ask questions like &quot;is god stronger than himself&quot; or &quot;if you cloned god, who would win in a fight to the death: god or his clone?&quot;<br>
<br>
There are lots more, but they rely on religious evidence, those should all make sense to you secular folks.  I personally like the first one.<br>

What I meant was simply that the idea of omnipotence doesn't really fit in with logic.  The short of it all being pretty much what several others have already said.  You can believe in God or whatever you want, but barring some late-breaking revelation to the world, you aren't going to prove the existance of God logically.  I'm not saying that the failure to Logically prove God's existance means a thing.  You can't prove that God does not exist either...  What's it all mean?  You either believe or you don't...<br>

Do the mormons actually believe this? Honest question, I have no idea. If so, thats freaking hilarious since by nearly all accounts Jesus didn't speak Hebrew, he spoke Aramaic.<br>

There's a movie version of it too.  Or you can read the play if you want to.<br>
<br>
It's about the Scopes Monkey Trial.  One thing that has been mentioned repeatedly is that Christianity and evolution are not mutually exclusive.  I believe this to be true also, though I find myself the eternal agnostic.  <br>
<br>
In Inherit the wind Darrow points out that according to the bible the sun wasn't created until the 4th day.  That's plenty of time for evolution, since it could be millions of years.  <br>
<br>
The creation myth was also taken from a Babylonian myth.  If you require yourself as a spiritual person to take the bible as 100% literal, you've already got bigger problems to deal with then evolution such as bears killing children for making fun of a prophets bald head, Noah's ark not being destroyed by rains that covered the earth in such a short time period, and a host of other things.<br>
