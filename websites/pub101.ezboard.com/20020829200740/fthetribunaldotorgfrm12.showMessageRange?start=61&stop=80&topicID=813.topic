<br>
A big difference is that this was an ingenious strategy that took thinking outside the box to new levels imo. This action took a very small force, minimum funding and no equipment of their own, yet the damage done was major and the effect truly global. I realize of course that Bin Laden had no idea the towers would collapse when he put this plan into action, but even if they hadn't, the effect would have still given maximum return on minimum resources and effort.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, even though he did far more damage then he expected, the operation still spawned failure. The US public reaction was an unprecedented show of solidarity, the US invaded Afghanistan with almost full global support and now  we have more influence than ever in the middle east. <br>
<br>
After 9/11, pretty much everything that could go wrong, did go wrong for Bin Laden. It's amazing how things work out sometimes... and for once it was a happy ending.<br>

Now that the patriotic ferver died down 6 months later, and you stopped wearing your &quot;We Will Never Forget&quot; T-Shirt that had the picture of WTC and peeled off the American flag bumper stickers, and the little American flag off your car antenna, now you are either keeping your mouth shut or agreeing.  I guess after 6 months, the realization of the extent of American blame for 9/11 - finally sank in.<br>
<br>
<br>
Loegan, as for 9/11 itself - I am not sure whether it was really a failure.  19 men on minimal funding cause over 3,000 deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars in damage.  The domino effect shakes the economy, people lose jobs, airline industry almost collapses, stock markets plunge.  America can do whatever it wants to Afghanistan - its not like Bin-Laden even cares at this point.  It's not his native country and it really has no religious significance.  If Bin-Laden makes it out alive, and it looks like he has, then I guess 9/11 can be chalked up as a victory for him although he did took significant damages as far as his network being disrupted and his training camps and such being destroyed and a portion of his assets being frozen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, for those crowing about 9/11 being a terrorist act - let me know how would you explain that by the end of January of 2002, American armed forces and their allies managed to chalk up over 7000 *civilian* Afghani casualties.  Over 7000 confirmed *civilian* casualties.  Yeah, thats the kind of thing you wont hear about in the Western media.  Do we declare American forces to be terrorists at this point or what?  I mean, what are you really bombing?  Some shady organization that doesnt have land, base, laws, recognized government?<br>

I thought Bush would go into Afghanistan with guns blazing and get our men killed in the mountains while at the same time throwing the middle eastern theater into chaos.<br>
<br>
I was surprised (and relieved) when he played it smart and put together a coalition before making any moves. That was a crucial factor imo, and he pulled it off without a hitch.<br>
<br>
Second, I give him credit for listening to his generals and using the northern alliance for most of the groundwork. I don't think people realized how much of an advantage terrain gives, even with the incredible technology we posses on the battlefield. If we had played it any other way, the loss of life on our side would have been enormous imo. Those mountains are a defenders dream.<br>
<br>
My only fault with him at this point is that I see another Iraqi clusterfuck starting. Instead of fighting the battle and getting the fuck out, Bush seems to want end all terrorism in one administration.  No way that is going to happen for many years because it will take a global change of attitude... a true change, not a coerced one like we have now. The longer we stay in there fucking around, the more we look like a dog chasing it's own tail. The momentum of 9/11 is fading and I hope he has the instinct to know when the ride is over.<br>
<br>
Imo, now is the time to stabilize Afghanistan, build up our forces, restock our strategic weapons and concentrate on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. If that situation draws in any other parties into it, terrorism will drop about 10 slots on our list of things to worry about. <p><br>

He is not the attacker, he is a defender and sometimes the defenders manage to counterattack like in 9/11.&quot;<br>
<br>
Osama Bin Laden:<br>
&quot;Hostility toward America is a religious duty, and we hope to be rewarded for it by God&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;We are sure of our victory against the Americans and the Jews as promised by the Prophet: Judgment day shall not come until the Muslim fights the Jew, where the Jew will hide behind trees and stones, and the tree and the stone will speak and say, 'Muslim, behind me is a Jew. Come and kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Bin Laden is a noble defender.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people who use terrorism to fight use it because they dont have the forces to fight 'normally', not because they are pussy/evil/not human&quot;<br>
<br>
So terrorism is like affirmative action for those without a military or supporters?<br>
<br>
Everyone should have an equal opportunity to fight a war--if you don't have the equipment or the balls to face your opponent, terrorize them?<br>
<br>
I don't buy it.  Put your men in uniform, put them on a boat/plane/truck and attack our uniformed soldiers.  Until then, you are a terrorist.  Those of you endorsing terrorism as a legitimate form of warfare make me sick.<br>
<br>
Yes, the US has killed civilians.  The difference is the intent of US military action is NOT solely the death of civilians.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have bioligical and chemical weapons with our own scenarios for using them. We have dirty nukes to cause massive fallout over civilian targets.&quot;<br>
<br>
Without the the threat of mutually assured destruction, we would never have made it through the cold war.  Such tools are necessary as a deterrent.<br>
<br>
By the way, we papered Hiroshima and Nagasaki for days with fliers warning them that a nuke was coming.  I don't remember hearing about the muslims handing out fliers warning of their attacks.<br>
<br>
&quot;They weren't dropped to end the war, they were dropped to test the weapon that they had been researching throughout the war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you have a source? Do you have any facts?  I do.  Here you go:<br>
<br>
&quot;Based on the experience at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, Leahy predicted that in an invasion of Japan, 30% to 35% of U.S. soldiers would be killed or wounded during the first 30 days. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;MacArthur's chief surgeon, Brig. Gen. Guy Denit, estimated that a 120-day campaign to invade and occupy only the island of Kyushu would result in 395,000 casualties. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It also saved the lives of some 400,000 Allied prisoners of war and civilian detainees in Japanese hands, all of whom were to be executed in the event of an American invasion of Japan. Above all, it saved untold hundreds of thousands more Japanese-perhaps millions-from becoming casualties of pre-invasion bombing and shelling, followed by two invasions and forcible occupation&quot;<br>
<br>
All of those were from the first link went to after a search.  They are from the following address:<br>

<br>
You want to know what I pray for?<br>
<br>
I hope that one of those extremist countries pushes Israel too far.  I hope that the US stops holding Israel back.  It would warm my heart if the full fury if the Israeli army were unleashed on those who terrorize them.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's amazing how things work out sometimes... and for once it was a happy ending.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are fucking sick Loegan.  <br>
<br>
There are 3000+ dead Americans whose families and friends would disagree with the happy ending.  <br>
<br>
There are many brave American soldiers, who have been shipped back from Afghanistan in boxes who's familes and friends would disagree that there was a happy ending.<br>
<br>
There are hundreds of thousands of Afghani refugees who would disagree that there is a happy ending.<br>
<br>
&quot;American armed forces and their allies managed to chalk up over 7000 *civilian* Afghani casualties.&quot;<br>
<br>
Confirmed by the Taliban?<br>
<br>
Even if those numbers are correct, and i note that you do not have a source, those civilians were not the targets.<br>
<br>
We are dealing with some sick fucks when we fight muslim extremists.  In Somalia, the somalis would use women and children as sheilds.   In Iraq, they stored weapons and ammo in the basements of hospitals.  At some point, you have to ask yourself are these really civilians?  <br>
<br>
And is the live of a few Afghani civilians worth even a single American Soldier?  I would say no.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll admit I was wrong on one thing Merton. I thought Bush would go into Afghanistan with guns blazing and get our men killed in the mountains while at the same time throwing the middle eastern theater into chaos.&quot;<br>
<br>
You and every other pussy dove.<br>
<br>
After being so miserably wrong about the predictions of the war, we are supposed to heed your philosophy about the validity of terrorism as a tactic in war.  You can take your ignorance and shove it.  <br>
<br>
&quot;My only fault with him at this point is that I see another Iraqi clusterfuck starting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Given your skill at predicting military outcomes and global support of US actions, you may want to just STFU on issues were you are clearly uneducated and woefully ignorant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Imo, now is the time to stabilize Afghanistan&quot;<br>
<br>
Fuck afghanistan.  Those bastards harbored terrorists for years.  They can rot.  I do not pay taxes so that we can subsidize the nurturing of a future crop of muslim extremists.<br>
<br>
&quot;concentrate on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict&quot;<br>
<br>
You know how we can resolve that conflict?  Remove our leash on Israel, and wait for the Palestinians to do something big, and you know they are stupid enough to push Israel too far.<br>

The world would be a better place if the mid-east were reduced to asphalt and oil fields.  <br>

A nation like the US has a responsibility to it's citizens and to the world to act responsibly and with restraint when possible, not run around like some kindergarten kid who just found an uzi and shoots up the playground because a bully punched his friend in the nose.<br>

Terrorism is a warfare, just like guerilla warfare. Your mind is trained to only accept tanks and artillery as tools for fighting. There are many forms of warfare and they are all a means to an end. Warfare is not about approval, so I am sure they don't give a fuck whether or not you accept their definition of war.<br>
<br>
Label it whatever you want to soothe your political nerves, but the end results and the objectives are the same.<br>

Maybe, maybe not. The press reported that Iraqi soldiers pulled the plug on incubators in Kuwaiti hospitals killing hundreds of babies. The truth was it was BS shoveled by our government to garner public support for the war... something all too common with the super secret Bush clan.<br>
<br>
I am not naive and I realize that even children are used in war. But I don't just swallow every line the government feeds me without question either.<br>
<br>
I am also aware of some of the fucked up shit our own military has pulled during times of war.

The US terrorize people also, didn't we go through this already?  Ya think the civs in Afghanistan (or any country that the US sends troops too) don't get scared when a US bomber flies overhead?<br>

Like the US didnt know that a terrorist attack was coming sometime soon.    My mother has a friend who is friends with Chaney.  Chaney told him to sell all his stock in the airplane companies a week before the attacks.  Did the US know?  Maybe, maybe not.  They probably didnt know exactly what was going to happen, but it's likely that they did kno something big was going to happen sometime around that time.  Maybe even knew it would have something to do with airplanes (read mothers friend thing~).  Yea I know &quot;IF THEY KNEW THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING.&quot;  Well the thing is there is nothing that they could have done.  If they had shut down airports to add all the 'increased security' (ive seen numerous people with a items that could be used more effectively than a box cutter as a weapon get on planes recently) or tell everyone to evacuate city x for x time or to stay away from big buildings or stay home from work for x days than the US people would be 'terrorized' already without any terrorists actually having to do anything.<br>

The civilian had no choice to be in the situation they were in.  They were most likely born in the place.  They may not even support the actions of the country they are in, they chose not to join the military of that country.

The fatality does not get added onto the list unless it is confirmed by 2 or more sources.<br>

A geurrilla is defined as such &quot;A member of an irregular, usually indigenous military or paramilitary unit operating in small bands in occupied territory to harass and undermine the enemy, as by surprise raids.&quot;<br>
<br>
No mention of mercenaries in that definition.  So maybe you should follow your own advice about not speaking.  Because to be honest so far your knowledge of warfare, and the ways and why fors of it have been wrong. <br>
<br>
September 11 should never have happened.  For quite some time experts had been warning us about how vunerable we were.  Being arrogant Americans we for the most part ignored those warnings, after all who would attack us on our own soil?  We as a nation failed to realize what fanatasism is capable of.  Our leaders also played a large role in creating the problems the brought about the attacks.  We supplied Afghanistan with weapons and supplies to fight the Russians then largely abandoned and ignored them when they were no longer usefull to us.  Maybe if we had cleaned up after ourselves and taken pains to put someone more sympathetic in power the Taliban never would have come about.  I tend to doubt that would have worked because we have a tendency of letting our lap dogs get out of hand, see Sadam.  <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> War</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1.<br>
a. A state of open, armed, often prolonged conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties. <br>
b. The period of such conflict. <br>
c. The techniques and procedures of war; military science. <br>
<br>
2.<br>
a. A condition of active antagonism or contention: a war of words; a price war. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Terrorism</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.<br>

<br>
Terrorism is an act of battle (or call it warfare) done by an individual or a &quot;small&quot; organisation, while a &quot;true&quot; war is endorsed by a government.<br>
Since they dont have the same capacities, they use different tactics and set their goals given with what they can do, but at the very base, they are both killing lots of peoples for a said goal. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://pages.infinit.net/kerosene/sigfinal.JPG"></CENTER>

Now I understand where you are coming from. Pure, unadulterated ignorance. I guess the reality that anyone would feel so loyal to their country or so devoted to their cause, that they would willingly and gladly sacrifice their life for it is beyond your perceptual threshold.<br>
<br>
I may not respect these people's beliefes, but I can at least respect their loyalty and their resolve. You on the other hand are living in an fresh off the assembly line world of make believe where there is only right and wrong, black and white, American and everyone else. A world where  a president can use the phrase 'Axis of Evil' in a ridiculous context and is actually taken seriously.<br>

You are a good little conformist with an empty head just waiting to be filled with next talking points.<br>

Why don't you get a clue. A Mercenary is a unit, not a form of warfare. There is no such thing as Mercenary warefare or Mercenary tactics. There is however Guerilla tactics and warfare. <p><br>

War is war, the cause and the reasons for personal sacrifice become irrelevant when people sacrifice their lives for a greater idea.  The act of sacrifice itself eclipses whatever political or religious connotations you would wish to tag on to it.  Regardless of ideology - when a person sacrifices their life for their ideology, they are heroes.<br>

Like in WWII when we fed the Japanese public information that in order to become an American Marine, one had to first kill his parents and eat an enemy baby.<br>
<br>
This disinformation campaign worked so well, that when the Japanese women saw our marines coming, they threw their children and then themselves off from cliffs, to avoid capture and having their children eaten. I saw films of it and I was blown away.<br>
<br>
Think about that the next time our government is feeding you information about an enemy. I am not saying that they always lie, but they are damn sure capable of it.<br>

<br>
First off Merton:<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> January of 2002, American armed forces and their allies managed to chalk up over 7000 *civilian* Afghani casualties. Over 7000 confirmed *civilian* casualties.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Where do you get these numbers? you seriously boggle my mind day in and day out, even IF these numbers are somewhat believable living in a house that holds 5 terrorists or under a weapons depot or a church that holds bio reasearch for germ warfare still makes you a viable target.<br>
<br>
They did not choose to kill certain Americans they chose everyone that they could get, so on the flip side the Taliban/Al Queda represent Afghanistan at the time.<br>
<br>
Merton, you say crap about western media and that we have no clue whats really going on over there and guess what - neither do you. You can talk all you want about cospiracies with your friends and families believing what you discuss.<br>
<br>
The Russians fought for 10 years in afghanistan and they lost many many people over that time and wasted an unbelievable amount of resources trying to win the mountain battle. The US with its technology and air dominace can soften anything they want for days, weeks, months or years.<br>
<br>
Using the Northern alliance was one of the smartest things they could ever do, let them kill themselves while you cover there backs, they know the terrain blah blah whatever. The US put Bin Laden in power, he recieved training from the US, he was supplied weapons to fight for &quot;the freedom of the people&quot; years ago in order to defeat the northern alliance and the evil they stood for (and russia)<br>
<br>
lets move on, Israel <br>
<br>
some people honestly have no clue imho, you think this country is a peace loving nation? This is one of the richest countries in the world, they have assets and interests everywhere The US has no choice but to continue a working relationship with them pretty much forever. They took land away from the palestein people, offer no resonable consessions for them to live with. <br>
<br>
The palestine people are led by one of the most vile people ever born imo, this man Yasser Arafat is the original terrorist, do you all forget that this turd tapper hijacked planes of his own 20 years ago for his cause, his goverment supplies his terrorists with weapons and resources, his military is corrupt<br>
<br>
The whole middle east is one big fuck sandwhich, and I think that the world will suffer from another world war sometime in the near future, The US should keep its nose out matters that do not include them, but unfortunatly they cannot. The old saying goes give them an inch and they take off a foot (or something like that)<br>
<br>
I am not bashing the US, i have a different view on things I believe that there shoudl be one dominant power controling things all over the world. I am Canadian, I have no qualms with the US having all the guns as long as no one else does. Pakistan is dying to push the button against india and vice versa. The un is a pile of useless turds, Imagin if Hitler had one, what a world we might be living in <br>

<br>
The twin towers did not shoot stuff at bin laden, the twin towers represented the finacial power of the US to Bin laden<br>
