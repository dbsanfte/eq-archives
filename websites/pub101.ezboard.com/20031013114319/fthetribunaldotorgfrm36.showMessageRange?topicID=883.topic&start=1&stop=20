I think this may turn out to be just as fun as Arnold in California, there's so many things to dig up...<br>
<br>
From a 1999 Guardian article:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No sooner are we told by Britain's top generals that the Russians played a crucial role in ending the west's war against Yugoslavia than we learn that if Nato's supreme commander, the American General Wesley Clark, had had his way, British paratroopers would have stormed Pristina airport threatening to unleash the most frightening crisis with Moscow since the end of the cold war.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not going to start the third world war for you,&quot; General Sir Mike Jackson, commander of the international K-For peacekeeping force, is reported to have told Gen Clark when he refused to accept an order to send assault troops to prevent Russian troops from taking over the airfield of Kosovo's provincial capital. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
---<br>
<br>
Good god. And Bush is a cowboy?<br>
<br>
Let us not also forget Clark's story that the White House had, just after 9/11, called him up and asked him to connect Iraq to the attacks. That was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> logical to begin with, of course. Unfortunately a few weeks ago he said on a radio show that it was actually a think tank that had called him up and asked him to make the connection. But not just any think tank... a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Canadian</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> think tank!<br>
<br>
And, just like Arnold, there's his &quot;spotty voting record&quot;, as the Assosiated Press puts it. I just wonder if the other canidates will have the guts to go after the general. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

<br>
As to his remark on the White House calling him, he admitted that he made a mistake and claimed it was a slip of the tongue. I am sure more will come out about it in the coming weeks, but he did get many phone calls.<br>
<br>
My position is, if this is the worst cons they can put up against his many pros, he has my vote. I think he has the experience to fight the war on terror and will pick the battles that actually matter.<br>

His rhetoric is pretty seductive; the idea of landing with both feet on an enemy is appealing to a nation that has had its hands tied so many times, like in somalia and vietnam.  The problem is that  escalation of conflict comes with repercussions, and clark is way too much of a &quot;damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot; kinda guy to trust with policymaking.<br>
<br>
Most people would agree that Grant was the right guy to win the civil war, but I doubt many would have wanted him handling the cuban missle conflict.  There are times when a guy willing to tell soldiers to sew their names into their underwear so their bodies can be identified is the right man for the job, but this isn't the time.<br>

There is more, such as where the people of the think tank previously worked, but I am not posting to make excuses for him.<br>
<br>
On the airfield thing, there was no order to take over the airfield from the Russians, there was an order to race the Russians to the field and secure it first.<br>
<br>
Now that he is running, all the details will come out (and more tales and truths I am sure), so just sit back, take it all in and then make up your mind.<br>

I thought at first what you quoted was saying the people who paid the least didn't need the money. But yes, he is for a graduated tax system where I am for a flat tax. One of the big reasons I am for a flat tax is because I feel it puts pride in a person when they know they are paying their share (even when that share may be small). It reinforces the feeling that we are all Americans and we are all in this together.<br>
<br>
For instance, when my kids first started getting an allowance, they had to do small chores. Now certainly their chores were small compared to the work Mom and Dad were doing, but it was their share and it gave them a sense of pride as well as a better understanding of what it means to be a working part of a whole.<br>
<br>
To me, a flat tax rate just makes sense. Then again, Jesse Ventura has a national sales tax that makes sense too, though I would have to be convinced the numbers work. But basically, under his plan, the more you spend and the more extravagant things you buy, the more tax you pay, but the thing is you are only be taxed on what you spend, so you have a choice. I would probably vote for a Jesse Ventura for President as well as I think the guy tells it like it is and makes decisions based solely on the merits of the course he decides on rather than owing anything to anyone.<br>
<br>
Anyways, that's a pretty long answer just to say that I may not agree with all of Wesley Clark's positions, but I agree with him overall. It was the same with Clinton. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fleviuskot>flevius KoT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All the people with custom titles<BR>

For one thing, social security tax has an income cap of 87000.  That means that someone earning 40k per year will pay $2480 in FICA tax (6.2%), but someone earning 400k will pay $5394 (~1.3%).  Federal subscriber tax on phone lines and utility taxes and such make up a larger percentage of a person's income when they make less.  Property tax (whether paid directly or through rent) is also a larger percentage of a lower income person's total income.<br>
<br>
Aside from all that, a person who spends pretty much all they earn is subject to sales and/or hidden taxes on everything that they buy.  A person who saves a significant percentage of their income pays less percentage of their income in taxes.  Also, people with higher incomes tend to participate more in 401k and IRA savings programs, which effectively reduce the income that they're taxed on.  <br>
<br>
There's also a basic cost of living that takes up a larger percentage of a lower income person's total income.  While that's not exactly the same as a tax, if you look at what percentage of a person's income is discretionary (left over after paying taxes and basic living expenses), even with the higher tax rates that higher income people pay, they're still ahead of the game.<br>

Anyway, yeah, Wesley Clark screwed a lot of stuff up in the former Yugoslavia.

<br>
I voted for Reagan too. So what?<br>
<br>
Clark has stated that he was hesitant to declare himself a democrat because the perception is that the republicans own the military. (I would hope we could all agree that is a pretty accurate statement regarding the perception) However, if you look at his views/statements, he is a centrist who leans left.<br>
<br>
What Clark brings to the table is a very good understanding of, as well as a distinguished background in foreign affairs. He is a democrat who can't be attacked on his patriotism or be accused of having no idea what it takes to defend a nation - arguments that have been levied against most of the 9 others.<br>
<br>
He is also the type who delves into the details. While that could be a hindrance in the campaign phase, it will serve the US well if he is elected.<br>
<br>
I would also point out that he was one of the few who pointed out the history of the Middle East in regards to it's occupation by European powers and accurately foretold the current situation we are facing. Of course the same could be said of Bush Sr.<br>
<br>
This guy as a new and improved Clinton in my view. If you didn't like Clinton, it's pretty doubtful you'll like Clark (unless your hangup with Clinton was his lack of military service). If you did enjoy the Clinton years though, this is your candidate imo.<br>
