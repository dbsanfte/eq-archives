To that end thought I'd do an unofficial post to see if my theory is right. How will I know?  I'll wait a week or so, read all the follow ups and see if they appear to be the same as my theory <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
New Topic: Someone is pissed off about something that happened (in fact it may or may not have actually happened but they think it did or they were just bored and made something up to see what their name looks like on the board). Most of these ramble at some length, include at least 40% expletives (think the rule used to be all posts only needed to contain 20% but the bar's been raised), but in spite of that get to some point (often well disguised).<br>
<br>
Posts 2-5: Mostly stay close to on topic assuming a point was made in the original otherwise, beginning with first response, automatically skip to later parts of the life cycle.<br>
<br>
Posts 6-page 2 or so: This is the part of the life cycle I like to call &quot;Oh yeah well my guild's better than yours and you suck and.........&quot;. This part is readily recognizable by statements such as &quot;well they all wiped trying to kill [insert uber mob name here] but my guild did it with 2 groups and half of them were level 1&quot; and the like. These posts are where the so-called uber guilds (you know who you are, or at least who you think you are) repeat the same shots at each other, saying the same things as in other posts and, generally, just get to repeat themselves early in the life cycle while people are still reading it.<br>
<br>
An interesting side to this phase is the feeding frenzy where 3 guilds attack one as if they are working together only to turn on the other omega chicken guild in another topic. It's also interesting to note if you could remove all of the posts in this section and remove the guild name from it you'd only end up with a very few original thoughts as the only thing that changes is the guild getting roasted in the particular topic. Ed note: There is a deviation here when a person in a guild seems to get confused which of the repetitive flames has already been used in the topic so they go with the I'll just say they all &quot;can [expletive deleted] a goat and can kiss my [expletive deleted].&quot;<br>
<br>
Page 3+: &quot;Self appointed Gods intervene&quot; portion of the cycle. Much like the verbal guild war part earlier, this is a repetitious, and often boring, mental masturbation among the 10-12 people who feel compelled to post a response to every topic. They don't seem to like each other and have some very interesting views of the parentage and sexual habits of the other 9-11 people. Posts have nothing to do with the original topic, if anyone was unfortunate enough to attempt to go to the last page and try to figure out what's going on they wouldn't be have a clue even with 10,000 monkeys and 10,000 typewriters. Importantly with this stage if one of the &quot;Gods&quot; post the others apparently must post their flame. Not sure the penalty if they don't, maybe they lose Sainthood or something.<br>
<br>
Last post: The death of the topic, unless of course someone like me is silly enough to come back after a couple weeks away and try to post something to do with the original topic in which case the life cycle inexplicably goes back to it's initial phase. This marks the end of the topic. All guild-vs-guild and individual-vs-individual thoughts/shots have been restated yet again. Most others haven't a clue what was going on in the beginning and have gone on to other topics. When people see 40 pages of a post from the discussion level they just avoid the topic like the plague and look for one still on its first page.<br>
<br>
General: Common to many of the posts is the use of some, how should I say this, rather colorful combinations of generally accepted &quot;dirty&quot; words. It seems there are many 13-year-olds with a mindset of &quot;if I cuss a lot I'll be cool and an adult&quot; that enter into the life cycle. To their credit they can string together an awe-inspiring series of said words without once stopping to make a recognizable sentence. All the while smiling to themselves how really clever and poignant they are.<br>
<br>
Well that's my theory. Soon as I hit &quot;Add Post&quot; my testing begins <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Author's Note: If you're inclined to waste the effort to make such brilliant comments as &quot;what are you a prude&quot;, &quot;who the F**K are you to tell me I can't cuss you're a p*ssy&quot;, etc. Save your breath/keystrokes. I use the language myself but don't feel it required most times in public to express myself. I've heard more of such language in places most wouldn't even like to think about let alone be there to use it.  It will fall on deaf ears. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatancoindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/02 12:12:50 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.nd.edu/~comet/stuff/brak5.jpg width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Life Cycle of a Post</span><hr size=1> So... who else is going to Boston? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udafuzzywabit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dafuzzywabit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Verrine makes me drip</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/02 12:18:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Life Cycle of a Post</span><hr size=1> I still like muffins.<br>

I guess, by what you seem to be saying, one can not be legitimate unless you post a couple hundred times.<br>
<br>
I also don't see me make any reference to myself as an expert. I made what I thought was a humorous observation spending about 4 hours getting caught up with my reading on the boards today. Besides, in practice alone, the purpose of the empirical method is to develop a thought on something and use experimentation to prove or disprove. At the end hopefully one becomes better, maybe not an expert, at understanding what it is they were looking at.<br>
