The tears frozen to her new face as she heard the voice within her head.<br>
      &quot;This is not a wise choice&quot;<br>
She shook her head, &quot;No mother...I must seek these ones out&quot;<br>
      &quot;You will only find pain and suffering my child&quot;<br>
slowly nodding she continued through the snow to the Necropolis, &quot;I must know why they do this Mother&quot;<br>
      The presence withdrew with a last comment, &quot;Be careful my child...with this last act I gift you with a way to where your Father's people are from&quot;<br>
      She stumbled and fell not to the snowy ground but a grassy hillside. Munisha took a long look at the small thin green spears that stuck up from the deep brown of the hillside marveling at the feel. The gentle breeze was warm upon the chilled face and the tears began to thaw streaking her face with their passage. Slowly she rose up as the Guard approached his eyes scanning the area for the blue ones...&quot;Are you in need of assistance M'lady?&quot;<br>
       It took Munisha a moment to puzzle through the language and then laughed as the guard looked confused at the reaction, &quot;Yes...yes I am&quot;<br>
       The Guard wondered about this woman only briefly before spotting an Orc about to smash the axe into the woman's head. Reacting quickly he intercepted the Orc and quickly dispatched him. Turning his eyes widened as the spot she had been was empty save for the small patch of melting snow. He shook his head &quot;Frozen rain?...I hate Wizards messing with the normal ways of the land,&quot; before he went back to his post the Woman forgotten yet the accent was still ringing a shivering note in his head.<br>
        Munisha went quickly where her fathers people had taught him the ways of spell and knowledge staying apart from the other students and outpacing her teachers expectations and sometimes shocking them at her natural ways of electrical spells. Her questions also gave them pause as she continually asked about a impressive guild and what they were all about. Her teachers could only fill in a small bit and as her fledgling training had been completed a journey needed to be undertaken. It was many adventures later that she had finally found one of the people who could help her find the ones she sought. Munisha hadn't seen one of the Cat people in some time and wondered if they even existed anymore or had they been wiped out by the nice dark skins. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There the Bard stopped and asked a question about her knowing about the Valshar. Instead of answering Munisha glared at him ,then at the drink that had freed her tongue to spill that which she kept so secret.<br>
       &quot;Have a care bard ... ask not any more questions,&quot; as the small hairs began to lift from Munisha in arcing sparks. The bard quickly took the chance to leave as Someone came in laughing and letting the chilled air into the tavern and kept running long after the Gate of the Dwarf hold was forgotten.<br>
