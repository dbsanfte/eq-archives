It may be sad that we have to protect them, but we do in fact have to. I have had to edit or delete at least 10 posts since becoming an admin a couple of months ago. Now suppose we just kept them on the general board. If we edited/deleted negative posts out of Good Time threads, would that be considered &quot;wrong&quot; by most people? Yeah, it would. So ya see we have a solution.<br>
<br>
Whether you agree that we should protect them or not is moot, because we feel that we should. We feel that people should be able to post congratulation posts and assholes shouldn't get to be assholes on those threads. You know what they can do though? They can come here and start a new thread about it if they want to flame.<br>
<br>
The reality forum was created after Aatlaar and several others grew fucking tired of the flameboard losing what it was supposed to be. What we wanted it to be. What our goal for the forum was. It isn't that big of a deal, and I am sure it is a forum you would enjoy.<br>
<br>
The only reason you are pissed is because you want to use this forum for everything. You don't want to use the other forums. You have said it many many times and now you are crying because we are forcing you too. I mean that is just fucking childish man.<br>
<br>
And the only reason you are putting up a fuckign stink about it is because it was Tanje who did it. You think Flassh would have made his little gay ass post if Aatlaar, Arleanna or myself had moved it? You think you would have felt so fucking hurt cause we won't allow you to do everything you want to do? Hell no, because we are not considered rational, fair or nice. Where as Tanje is.<br>
<br>
But none of you have any problems going after people who are rational, fair and nice. Like say Tanje. Her quitting because of enforcing a policy created by us would be stupid. Not as stupid as you quiting because you just refuse to visit the other forum, but stupid. She is a good person. A very good person, and a fair and a just moderator. And that is what makes her so open to attack.<br>
<br>
What happens if I delete a post and Aatlaar locks a few threads? What happens if Arleanna changes the title of an SI post to, &quot;My guild fucking sucks!&quot; Nothing really. Sure, people will throw a few nerf balls, but otherwise people will get gleefully excited and yell more and want blood and shit themselves with excitement. Getting mad at us or flaming us for not being fair is about as potent an attack as calling the devil &quot;mean.&quot; But Tanje is fair and just, and so you cocksuckers lick your lips because she can be &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;unfair.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which sucks, because all you will do by giving her a hard enough time is lose a fair moderator, making things less fair for you fair-happy fucknuts. WHich is Ironic, in a very sad fucking way.<br>
<br>
Another thing to ponder there Loegan, do you think Tala would have gotten sick of your favorite board if he would have had a place to stick the threads he didn't want? Do you think that would have been better than the editing/deleting/banning that caused so much shit? <p><BR>

Maybe. But I like to post my ideas and then call someone a fucking idiot if they post nonsense in response. I don't like to be sent out of the room (forum) like a little kid. I want to be in the adult forum to begin with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And the only reason you are putting up a fuckign stink about it is because it was Tanje who did it. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You couldn't be more wrong. It has NOTHING to do with Tanje or Arleanna because they do not make policy. You do. Aat does and so does fuck face Jas and snow job muse, but I didn't know they had their grubby little fingers in the flame board pie.<br>
<br>
I liked this forum because there was one rule - no anon posters. Then you added a couple more, but they made perfect sense. No spam and no monster sigs.<br>
<br>
Now you come up with a new rule about how you will judge content and decide what is appropriate and move shit around. Fuck that, I didn't change. You changed the rules in the middle of the game. I don't want to be sent to the kiddie forum to play nice and help the forum get some use. I hate this fuckin empire of forums and there was only one I would call home. Now it's not home. Fuck it, it's not the end of the world, but I had to give it a shot to keep it as was. If you want to call that a temper tantrum, fine. But you are a liar and a hypocrit, so why should I give a rats ass if you have a low view of my actions.<br>

Talamay ran a fine board where EVERYONE had contact with EVERYONE else. You couldn't flame like a moron (my dick is bigger than yours huh huh huh), but you didn't have to use kids gloves either.<br>
<br>
Know what? People talked to each other. Now here you have you nice guy section, your smart guy section, your what ever the fuck section, your bad boy section and they are all nice and seperate so nobody has to put up with each other.<br>
<br>
Fuckin Utopia man. But, hey, it's what everyone wants and I have made it clear I am willing to let it go. I will post in response as long as you want to call me out though... at least until you decide to change that rule and make one forum for the topic and one for the responses. Maybe you'll be kind enough to link them though.<br>

This message board isn't a democracy - it's run by volunteer players who use their own free time instead of playing to keep a semblance of order.  It's really not that hard to figure out how they designed the different forums to &quot;work&quot;.  If you don't like it, you don't have to be a reader/poster.  Simply because a person chooses to use only one forum for voicing all of their opinions doesn't mean that the mods and admins are going to let it slide.  In fact, by trying to avoid going to the right forum to post your topic, you have made more work for them.  They are in essence, babysitting the topics and threads that retards can't keep separated in a civil and orderly fashion.<br>
<br>
I don't flame 'cause I plain and simple suck ass at even trying.  I do however enjoy reading the flameboard as it is often highly enjoyable and good for a laugh.  However, when I wanted to give Daeja a pat on the back for her excellent FB postings, I went over to the Good Times forum to post it there.  'Cause I know that that warm fuzzy shit just isn't welcome here.<br>
<br>
I guess the FB mods aren't stirring up the pot enough if minor house cleaning like this spawns more than one multiple page thread and creates an &quot;uproar&quot;.  You guys should dick around more with the text of people's posts.  Even Ladida's &quot;Hahahahaha...&quot; additions are humorous and welcomed.<br>

<br>
What the fuck is this?  Smoke and mirrors?   Nono I didn't really swap the red ball out to a green one when you turned your back!  It was ALWAYS green, just your perception has changed!<br>
<br>
The &quot;policy&quot; as stated has not changed.  The executed policy, has, though, without changing the written one.<br>
<br>
Driving down the road, speed limit 55, you are driving 55, cop pulls you over and writes you a ticket for going 100 in a 55 zone.  You say &quot;WTF? I was going 55!&quot;  Cop says &quot;oh no no the speed limit has always been relative to the speed of the cruiser, I was driving 45 MPH the other way thus you were going 100 MPH.  Your understanding of the law was incorrect before, here's your ticket, have a nice day!&quot;<br>

It is a judgement call and this is one I would have moved too. I don't expect you to see it, nor do I feel the need like I need to define criteria to you.<br>
<br>
Loegan doesn't understand or know the rules. At first he thought there was just one rule. And he may be correct that there is only one rule, that we make them and do whatever we want. I never made that rule post. I never put it up there. Hardly see how I am hypocritical for whoever put it up there to make people know that they can't be anon. I know I never clicked on it.<br>
<br>
You guy get so used to the way things are done that you think that us not doing them is a rule violation or some shit. If we edit posts and not do it in bold are we wrong? If we lock a thread are we wrong? If we move a thread are we wrong? If we ban someone we don't like are we wrong? Please show me where it says we are. Please show me the rule that says we cannot do any of those things.<br>
<br>
Dumai has cried about biasness. Grozzer has cried about his title. Rynnia has cried about us moving posts to the good times forum. Now Loegan feels the need to bitch about us doing something that he didn't expect either. And like all of it, it will fade and you will get used to it and come to expect it and think we are somehow held to the laws in your little heads. <p><BR>

But you are right, you probably won't be around. I will most likely ban you by then just for driving Tanje to quit because of your own selfish reasons.<br>

Glad to see you are starting to learn.<br>
<br>
I can see the facts man. If she quits, it is a result of you. Would it be unreasonable if I banned you? Yeah. Now lets see if you can learn that we don't care about being reasonable or fair and that we never have. <p><BR>
