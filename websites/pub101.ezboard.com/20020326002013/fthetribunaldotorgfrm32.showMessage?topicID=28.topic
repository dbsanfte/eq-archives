Would there be anything that could really stand against such a gathering?<br>  I think you would have at least over one hundred 55+ wizards.  Probably a good number more than that.  At peak time the number of 60th level wizards is well into double figures alone, so i think my estimate is conservative to say the least.<br>  For example, let us say you have one hundred wizards between levels fifty-two and sixty.  Every one of those wizards can cast a lure.  That's 640 points of damage each.  Lol, unless you get lots of resists. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Even assuming a fifty percent resist rate you could, in theory, do 32,000 points of damage every time your combined force casts.  With that kind of damage output even the mobs with 100,000+ hit points wouldn't take that long to kill.  To help ensure your wizards survived to cast their spells you could have a couple of normal groups to act as a distraction.  That coupled with the manaskins and shields cast before the fight began should be enough to ensure a victory.<br>  You would have to do some test runs.  Say with the two &quot;normal&quot; groups and two or three wizard ones of the level range i mentioned, fifty-two to sixty.  Then you could take logs of the fights.  See how much damage your wizards do.  How long they can survive.  The resist rate for the different levels.  From all of that, it would then be possible to plan more effectively how to take the full raiding force into the fight.<br>  At the moment i feel that wizards are playing EQ in a style suits melee.  Why?  The long drawn out fight isn't what a wizard is good at.  So why are we allowing things to be like this.  Part of it is that strategies have been formed that people know work and another part is that you enjoy playing with people of mixed classes.  However, the current raiding style isn't, in my opinion, good for wizards.  It is not how we fight.  The fast burn is our style, not the long fight.<br>  Would people care to try this kind of thing?<br><br>Talinath.<br>58th level Evoker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uatomsmashur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atom Smashur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I failed physics</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/18/01 7:33:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What Could The Combined Might Of Wizards Do?</span><hr size=1> You thought about lag yet?

There would be link deaths certainly, but i still think it could be done.  I think it was the post about the Avatar Of War being killed that mentioned the guilds involved having more than one hundred people involved in the fight.  So it is possible to have that many people for the one fight.<br>  As a side point, it would be fun clearing the way to the &quot;big&quot; mobs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Just think of it.  Assists wouldn't be that big of thing if you were in a zone that had lots of named mobs like Kael.  With groups made entirely of wizards, all you would need to do was ensure that everyone knew their group number.  Then it would just be a case of calling the name of the mob and the groups that are to blast it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Lol, pulling?  What's that? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  You could use leapfrog tactics to advance.  First two groups kill mob A.  They sit down to med.  The other fifteen groups move on.  Groups three and four blast mob B.  They sit down to med.  The other thirteen groups move on to the next area.  Four mobs here.  Groups five and six on mob C.  Seven and eight on mob D.  Nine and ten on mob E.  Eleven and twelve on mob F.  Force moves on.  Groups one and two have regained their mana and have caught up again.  And so on.<br>  With that kind of firepower in one place, each wizard would likely only be casting the once, so it wouldn't take very long for them to get their mana back.  So you could clear your way through a zone at a great speed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  One argument about such a force/guild would be that it never offered much to the wizards involved or the or classes supporting it.  I disagree. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Getting a armour drop for the dwarf quests in Kael would be slow.  With one hundred plus wizards in the force/guild there would be a long list.  However, if you cleared it from top to bottom on a regular basis, how long would it take to get the armour drops?  It wouldn't happen overnight, but within what i would term as a reasonable amount of time the majority of you force/guild would be equipped with the dwarf quest armour.  Lol, or dragon quest armour if you are doing ToV. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  For the non-cloth classes things would be amazing in such a force/guild.  True, you would not be performing in your traditional/accepted fashion, but you would still be a much needed person.  There is also the fact that since there wouldn't be that many plate/chain classes in the force/guild the competition for those armour drops would low to say the least.  So the melee/wis classes would be equipped with dwarf or dragon armour pretty quickly, which is all to the good.<br>  The melee style is not our style.  We have played in a way that suits melee for a long time.  It doesn't have to be like this.  If we really want to we can play in a way which suits our class.  All we need is the courage and belief in ourselves to step outside the &quot;accepted&quot; way of doing things.  Take some chances.  Experiment.  I feel that the combined force of wizards could do almost anything within EQ if we would just work together and give it a try.<br>  Would anyone else like to give it a try?<br><br>Talinath.<br>58th level Evoker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uatomsmashur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atom Smashur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I failed physics</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/19/01 12:28:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:What Could The Combined Might Of Wizards Do?</span><hr size=1> I'd want a few dozen clerics with click sticks following us around, thats for sure.

We would be trying new tactics and that will almost always have a price to be paid.  I think it would be worth while though.

Lol, or not at first anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Instead we would be a loose organisation of like minded individuals, i.e. wizards, who would gather on say a Friday and Saturday night to cause some havoc in a few zones. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  The reason for such a loose organisation is that people are in guilds that they like and you don't want to put them on a spot by demanding their loyalty.  Not only is it unlikely to work, it is totally unnecessary.  With a loose organisation of wizards, you would only really come together on those few days, or more often if people felt like it, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so people could still maintain presence within their old guild.<br>  So on a Friday or/and a Saturday night we all gather in Greater Fay.  Lol, or West Common. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We then do a quick check to find out what is available.  With people from so many different guilds, it should be a pretty simple thing to find out pretty quickly what is camped and what isn't. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We would then up sticks and go toward our intended destination.  Within a short period of time we should be there.  Then it would be a case of burning the zone to the ground. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Lol, or to &quot;borrow&quot; an old quote, &quot;Kill them all.  Let god sort them out.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  Think of it like this.  &quot;Tradional&quot; tactics have &quot;epic&quot; fights lasting for things like fifteen minutes to half an hour.  Once the Conclave of Wizards had their tactics all worked out, it would take us between thirty seconds and a minute to kill those same mobs.  Lol, at a guess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You also have the fact that prep time would be very short.  You could make it longer to get buffs from other classes, but since the majority of the raiding force would be wizards that is really a moot point.<br>  In effect what a raiding force made up mostly of wizards would be is a lot like a fast reaction force.  We don't need a lot of time to get to a location.  We don't need a lot of time buffing.  With the leapfrop tactics we wouldn't take long to get into position for the attack on the boss mob.  Lastly, with the leapfrog tactics the raiding force should arrive in a condition both physically and magically to be attack near enough instantly.<br>  The more i think about the idea.  The more i like it.  It might take a few attempts to perfect, but once it is, i think (hope) it would be almost unstoppable. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  Hmm.  I was thinking.  Is it time to raise the banner for the formation of the Conclave of Wizards on the main discussion board?

I feel that resists could be a problem though.  Depending on what was being attacked at the time.  I don't know how well enticement of flame works to be able to comment though.<br>  You made some very good points, Questin.  I would hope that more people would be willing to give my idea a try than only thirty, but the response to date seems to make thirty seem optimistic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  Personally, i have grown tired of how most large &quot;events&quot; have become so melee driven.  It isn't anyones fault, it is just that people know these tactics work and allow them to defeat what ever their target is.  A long, drawn out fight doesn't, in my opinion, suit wizards.  As i have said in previous posts.  We are a class which shines in short fights.  It is what we are good at.  At least i think so.  The raiding style i am proposing would allow us to raid in a way which would suit the wizard class.<br>  The faction question is a hard one.  Ultimately i would hope it would become irrelevant.  We would become so good at raiding together that we could and would raid zones frequently.  So you might kill the Dain one day and Tormax the next.  When you needed the faction of one side for something, you would just raid their enemies for a while to get the faction back.  Killing deep into the zones where the faction hits are higher.  It isn't ideal and i can well understand why people would not want to raid zones held by certain factions.  I think it would be worked like PoG in most guilds.  If you want to raid there great! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If you don't, fine, no problem.

Now i have started wondering. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   How would the pet classes do in this situation?  How much taunting ability do pets have?  Would the mob attack the pet or the summoner?  I would say the former, but i am not totally sure.  So would using pets be a viable alternative?

Lol, aren't i good to you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Perhaps some people from the pet classes could offer us their opinion.

Lol, that isn't even a full group! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So while i wouldn't wait for one hundred wizards saying they would be willing to give the idea a try, i do need more than have currently posted.<br>  So if you like the idea and haven't posted, then post!  If you know someone that you think would be interested in this, tell them about the idea and try and get them to visit. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This idea can only work if people are willing to give it a try.  I can only gauge the reaction/interest of people by their posts.  If i don't don't see any posts, i have to assume that people just aren't interested.  So if you are interested, please post.<br><br>Talinath.<br>58th level Evoker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 725<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/01 9:27:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visveres.com/ezboard/members/bowynn1.jpg width=118 hieght=191></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:What Could The Combined Might Of Wizards Do?</span><hr size=1> Erm.. even 30 wizards is a DAMN impressive bit of damage! <p><center><HR width=50%><table style=filter:glow(color=#000000strength=5><font size=+1><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=15566">56th Beguiler and Guild Leader of Vis Veres</a></font></TABLE><BR><A HREF="http://www.visveres.com/sigs/bowynn.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.visveres.com/sigs/bowynnsig.jpg"></A><HR width=50%><A HREF="http://www.visveres.com/bowyn"><FONT SIZE=+3>N O T H I N G</FONT></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uquestin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Questin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ufb.uoguilds.com/images/EQ/skul2.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/01 12:06:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:What Could The Combined Might Of Wizards Do?</span><hr size=1> Your idea is a neat one, and it is worth trying =)  You just have to get more interested. <br><br>Boywnn posting made some other things come up.  Wizards would love to have Clarity, so a few enchanters as well.<br><br>If you want this to happen, get the interest of the wizard community over at Graffe.com  Send them an e-mail saying you are going to organize a wizard raid on the Tribunal.<br><br>If your a wizard that is the first site you go to for anything that is for a wizard.   If you can get your Idea into the news on graffe.com you would have a lot more interest generated.  I would do that, but this is your Idea you should be the one that gets the credit.<br><br>I for one would help you out in this.  I have learned that some of the funniest things in EQ are the unexplored, the untried, being the pioneers of a something.  <br><br>The first time I do something new to me I laugh and love it all.  I may die a lot but I don't care, I went after it and that, in itself, is more then some people can say.<br><br><br>But think along the lines of 5 or so groups of wizards, and 2 other groups of a mixed setup.  They would have the enchanters, the Clerics, and the tuanters.  Our Manaskin is nice, your right to point out that, we just have to see just how much it will help.<br><br>Hope something comes from your idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uvespid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vespid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/22/01 9:27:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ns.iicanada.com/scott/ves-pimp2.jpg width=190 height=191></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:What Could The Combined Might Of Wizards Do?</span><hr size=1> Start of small.. see how many wizards you'd need to gather to bitch slap the PoD in one shot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udaemonn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daemonn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/22/01 12:11:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:What Could The Combined Might Of Wizards Do?</span><hr size=1> PoD is an interesting target.
