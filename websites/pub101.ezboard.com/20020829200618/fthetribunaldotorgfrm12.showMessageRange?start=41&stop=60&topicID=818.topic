I was trying to be NICE.  The only comment about your clerics that I made was in reaction to your unwillingness to join forces.  I was clarifying the results of your refusal and making sure you understood what it meant.  <br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 24 11:37:12 2002] Ravlow tells you, 'so by refusing to join us, you are giving your clerics no shot at king which we don't really need'<br>
<br>
Because THEN I was under the impression that you were being fucktarded because you wanted to lead and I wanted you to understand what that fucktardedness was costing your guildmates.  <br>
<br>
NOW I understand that you are just a fucktard in general and you thought that I was a 9 year old nazi and you'll be damned if you'll let a 9 year old nazi give you any help.<br>
<br>
you didn't misrepresent the facts?  You don't know what the facts are even now.  You flat out lied to members of my guild about what I told you and we've posted the logs to prove it.  How can your &quot;democracy&quot; make a decision based on interpretation from a fucktard?<br>
<br>
Yo Charlinkey, you should go to law school.  With intuitive deductions like those with absolutely no knowledge or even slight reasoning behind them, you would make a brilliant attorney.  Don't try that hitler shit on the judge tho.  <br>
<br>
BTW are you related to Fucktard and his sister?  If you are, shoot me an email and let me know if she's any good in the sack.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  Most of the lemmings are not even close to fucktards.  I've spoken with quite a few of them lately and they seem like really cool players who are amazed at the total lack of diplomacy from fucktard. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>

---------------------------------------<br>
You told Winthorsom, 'only thing said in guild was that you were claiming king, and not wishing to join forces, and that we are not to res you =/ beyond that, no clue =/'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'we are ion raid...we were willing to lert you guys do king ansd queen'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'but now rav refusing rez and saying we must join your raid'<br>
You told Winthorsom, 'I think Rav is afraid trying to join ALL our forces is too much, that's why he wanted to take just the folks who needed, tightly cramped down there'<br>
You told Winthorsom, 'me, I have no say I'm just a lacky =/'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'no my friend I dont weant to do it that way...'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'then who does beside Rav'<br>
You told Winthorsom, 'Rav is Guildleader, he's the main one to deal with'<br>
You told Winthorsom, 'other officers online are I think Gurv, and ...'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'then prepare for hell'<br>
You told Winthorsom, '=/'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'thats being nice'<br>
Winthorsom tells you, 'just so you know...your guild is acting real crappy and rest assured we wont assist you at all and may even hinder you alot'<br>
<br>
_________________________________<br>
<br>
So are you saying Charlinkey that CoL's raiders came to an agreement and asked Wint to deliver the message to us to &quot;prepare for hell&quot; and that &quot;we (CoL)...may hinder you (KoT) alot&quot;? I could pick out other choice quotes too, but the logs are back for everyone to read for themselves. The point being, although others may have participated in the decisions CoL made that day, Wint was putting his own nasty slant on things. <br>
<br>
If Wint was just to deliver the message to us that CoL was politely declining KoT's assistance, I doubt anyone would have had a problem with that. You guys could have gone about your CR and we could have gone about our business. Instead it was Wint's piss in your face attitude that stirred up all these hard feelings. I highly suggest that CoL put a bit more thought next time into who they allow to be their messenger. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www228.pair.com/judygale/Gsmile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 692<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/26/02 11:32:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SydesJokes/files/Pictures/h/homer_simpson.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Decent Flames that dont even make this Board</span><hr size=1> This was one of my favorite lines from the whole thing.<br>

#1. Everyone knows that the only people who benifit from the cleric epic is the clerics. So why in the hell should a cleric have an epic. ROFL. The whole damn guild benifits.<br>

#2. I have been teaching the new members of my guild that raids are dangerous endeavors that puts many at risk to benefit a select few. But by foregoing exp and possibly even losing exp to the benefit the select few we are building a stronger GUILD by building stronger individuals.<br>
<br>
I personally think that Lemmings dropped the ball on this one. Dropped the ball big time. Hopefully they will learn a hard lesson and next time eagerly accept a helpful hand.<br>
Its time for the Lemmings leadership to admit they were wrong and apologize to their members and to Wolvar and get on with life. <br>

One is that Wint, for whatever reason, distorted what we actually offered to your guildmates.  Whether they made the decision or not, they were making it based on misinformation.  The second one is that not only did Wint turn down the offer, he threatened to hinder our raid.  THAT is what cost you guys rezzes, whether you wanted them or not.  THAT is primarily what caused hard feelings.<br>
<br>
What I told our guildmates about what happened was backed up by the logs, what he told your guildmates about what happened was misrepresented.  It appears to be an inability to communicate on his part, which is not something that you want to see in a raidleader.<br>
<br>
You guys can turn your nose up and think we play differently than you all you want, but we were just like you once.  I can guarantee you that if I had told my guildmates not to rez you guys cuz wint is a fucktard and I don't like him, they would have not only laughed at me, but would have rezzed you anyway.  That doesn't sound like a bunch of nazis to me.   <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>

Taverian, if your flames are any indication of your fuckin I can see why Wint would be having fits and tension. <br>
<br>
Way I see it Tav is 80% of the problem. Wint is just a man who can't get his women to put out half decent, and so he can't control his impulses. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukezmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kezmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 5:28:43 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bullshitjob.com/officespace/milton.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> can i get a definition of the word &quot;fucktard&quot; please lol<br>
