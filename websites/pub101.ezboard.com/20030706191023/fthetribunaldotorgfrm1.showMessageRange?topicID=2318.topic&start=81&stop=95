<br>
I think EQ has been, in general, a positive influence on my life.  I've made friendships that have lasted and some have even been extended into RL.  I've learned a lot about myself and about other people. <br>
<br>
In the beginning, as you delve deeper and become more addicted to the game, it's very hard to get your priorities straight.  Over time I was able to balance myself out and just play EQ for pleasure rather than to continue to fuel the addiction.<br>
<br>
EQ has really helped me mature a lot.  I don't know where I was in relation to most kids when I started, but I can certainly say that EQ has been a great boon.  I was shoved into more than one leadership role during my EQ &quot;career&quot;, and it helped me understand management and behavior.<br>
<br>
Back on the general topic - I think EQ can be good for a teenager if he/she takes the right approach to it.  Certainly, and this has been proven over and over, EQ can be devastating for people's real lives, if they let it control them.<br>
EQ was kind of like class and recess for me.  Learning by socializing, combining both elements.<br>
<br>
Also, I learned to read through school and am now a very avid reader.  I wish that I had been taught to read earlier, and I think that if everyone had relatives like Merton's, we'd all be a whole lot smarter and certainly have a better sense of culture.<br>
<br>
I don't really want to get into the spanking issue.  I don't think it's wrong, but I think that sometimes it isn't necessary.<br>

you say you know how to raise children from watching others and having your own childhood ?<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHA thats funny     <br>
<br>
until YOU and only YOU are responsible for another human life 24 hours a day 7 days a week for years on end will you have any idea at all about what this is like<br>
<br>
<br>
your like the visiting relative that sees the kids for a few hours plays with them thinks they are lovly then you go home<br>
<br>
meanwhile mum and dad now have to try and feed there kids clean them get them ready for bed  all the while they are hyped up on all the junk food and sugar that the visiting relatives gave them.<br>
<br>
All this new age bullshit about not spanking kids is complete crap<br>
<br>
take a look at society what do you see ?<br>
<br>
it is degenerateing at a rapid pace into crap<br>
<br>
because we now have generations of people that have not been taught disciplin in anyway what so ever except a stern talking to.<br>

<br>
Would I let my son play EQ? I don't know. It would depend on how he grows up and if he can be more mature than his parents with how he intergrates it into his life. At present it isn't an issue. The game is pretty pictures and not much more to him than something that takes too much of his parents time. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41075">Adwene Holyhands</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

What i was trying to point out was most of the people that freak out over a game are the same people that would freak out or trash there lives over just about anything. It just struck me that you where saying a group of people (the roleplayers) where the ones that where screwd up. I may have been wrong if so i hope you will take it as that. <br>
<br>
I understand that there really is no one way that is better then any other to raise a child. The reality of it is you try teach them the right path give them love and careing and hope for the best. To be honest im so happy that i get to be a Dad mostly because i didnt have one. My goal is to give my son Logan everything that I didnt have.<br>

As for swearing, growing up we had a 2 tier rule. We couldn't say anything that we didn't hear our father say (mom wasn't included because she used to cuss up a storm), and if we were caught swearing, then we had to pay money. If we didn't have the money, then we had to work it off doing chores around the house. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Wittles 54 warrior semi-retired<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Vaseel 51 bard retired<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Screaming 52 druid<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Naffenea 52 ranger</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chantci>chantci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/12/02 8:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: discipline and stuff</span><hr size=1> I was maybe over disciplined as a child but looking back on it I would rather have it that way.  I have seen kids that were not spanked and only talked too.  Alot of them are having a hard time with the real world.  Authority issues, and people in general consider them, rude is the best word I can come up with atm.  <br>
<br>
 Until you have kids you'll have no idea how you should discipline them.  Maybe you will get lucky and have one that just needs talked to.  Each kid is diffrent.  My daughters get spanked, not all that often but, enough to bring them back to reality when needed.  When they hit the rebellious stage saying NO and talking back, telling them your dissappointed is just not going to cut it.  However, I don't think spanking is the cure all; grounding my oldest (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  is usually more effective she will actually asked if she can be spanked instead.  I don't use spanking to hurt them just giving them a reality check and trust me it works well.  I can also say I spend way more time hugging and cuddling with them then I do spanking them.<br>
<br>
 Growing up I hated my parents for discipling me but now that I'm grown up I'm very thankful.  No one likes to do it, but it is another parent job.   <p> <HTML><BODY>

I should come to GenDis a bit more often.<br>
<br>
A few things:<br>
<br>
1. Hitting your child while angry is absolutely wrong.<br>
2. Some children don't need spankings... Some are born just to prove you wrong.<br>
3. If you don't have children (plural) don't talk about child raising, you really don't have a clue.<br>
4. I let my kids play EQ while sitting next to me, but that's it, and very restricted time-slots.  <br>
5. Teach your children to read young and they will love you for it.  Reading is so much more fulfilling than TV can ever be, and it will help you throughout life.<br>
6. Yes, you can read pretty darn good books in a day or 2 if you learn to speed-read properly.  Not everyone can, some can.  If you are reading, and you hear a little voice in your head reading along... you aren't &quot;reading&quot; you are listening, there's a difference.  The human mind is much more impressive than some give credit.  You can actually go straight from written-word into comprehension, it's just the methods of training reading make it hard to make the transition.<br>
<br>
Now, more about spanking.  Yes, it is possible to not spank... However, only for certain children.  Some will actually respond to being sent to time-out, having stuff taken away, etc... Then, there's that one child you get that will prove you wrong (this is what people are referring to OnceDelight... the one that makes you humble).  <br>
<br>
The one that you've successfully gotten 2 kids to age 7/8 with very little or no spanking, but all the same techniques on the next one just fail and they look at you as you talk to them, and just smile... you take away their toys and they just smile... Yeah... that's the one.<br>
<br>
The one person that is worse than someone with NO kids, is the one that has one, and they are the &quot;angel child&quot;.  If you have multiple children, you know that one too... They always listen, they are happy to read, clean-up, help out whereever possible.  You barely had to do anything to make them so well behaved.  And the parents that rolled the proper dice and got that ONE think they OBVIOUSLY figured out child-raising, and they are going to tell everyone the great secret that you don't have to spank children or even yell at them.  (BTW, I do believe there is no reason to ever yell... but life sometimes interjects).<br>
<br>
But, sorta like everything else... since nobody ever talks about proper discipline, such as never doing it angry, etc... people just feel so guilty the first time they have to spank their children they &quot;sometimes&quot; figure they already failed.  Add on all the other stresses of life, and you have the possible beginnings of an abuse cycle.  <br>
<br>
Also, some of you are doing that o-so-famous liberal tactic of bringing up the worst cases of obvious physical and mental abuse and trying to show &quot;See, this is why you can't give your kid a little bop on the backside, because if you spank him once it's obvious you will eventually pick up a bat and beat your kid to death&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, in closing... when you do have children, and you are so frustrated with a kid that isn't listening... talk to other parents, lots of them... figure out all the methods they used to control their children (and look at the children that resulted) and see which ones work.  You'll probably have to make it up as you go along anyway, but don't be afraid to ask others that have done it. <br>
<br>
Also, OnceDelight, that exact quote &quot;I will never hit my children, period&quot; is the most dangerous there is... Those are the ones that let their frustrations build up way too much because they have  hard-line limit, regardless of reality.  Start out with &quot;I will only use it as a last resort&quot; will actually improve your chances of never using spanking.<br>

<br>
As a child (i'm only 17 now), my parents spanked me.  And every day I praise God that they did.  I've seen too many kids turn out to be rotten, spoiled brats because their parents never spanked them.  They got the &quot;talking to&quot; and the &quot;time out&quot; and all of that jazz, which is definitely a good tool to use.  But to say you will never spank your child is a bit extreme. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=intriguedbyu2>IntriguedByu2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/15/02 4:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Children and EQ</span><hr size=1> Great post Fabmatil!
