The national average for the amount of taxes going to welfare is between 20 and 35%.<br>
<br>
As for what people get on welfare....I have an entire side of my family living off of welfare (my mothers side i.e. uncles/aunts).  They all smoke, they all do drugs, they all have 2-4 kids, they all continually move from house to house, none of them hold a job for over 2 months, they all go to jail, they all eat out/order in, they all have video games, they all wear name brand clothes, its ALL TRUE.  I lived growing up with that entire side of the family almost 24/7 when I was a kid.  So obviously your view is skewed.  Its time to rethink your view, not continue to question the flip-side.<br>
<br>
Tatania, i found your post on germany interesting.  Just curious though, you stated that they have immigrants running the &quot;lowly&quot; jobs and they didnt mind, are they not considered &quot;citizens&quot;?  Because then germany is really no better than the U.S. since all the same jobs are still there, just filled with different people.  The reason i bring this up is because i remember once reading about how according to this national survey how americans were really low on the list of the smartest people in the world.  I.E. the test was an IQ test of sorts and every country had to have a bunch of people take it (at different age levels).  Countries like britain, germany, and japan all were in the top 10 but the U.S was like number 40 or something.  Everyone that read that article would have thought americans were stupid and it was a total bias, why?  Because of the selection process.  The U.S. completely randomized the entire population who took the test, all you had to do was be the right age and a citizen.  However, countries like britain and germany were ONLY allowing those people who were the right age, a citizen, AND a person who went to a high level university.  The U.S. got totally screwed.  So it may all look nice on top, but I don't think any country can claim to be what you stated considering the richest country in the world is switzerland and their per capita income is like 42k$ a year. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/15/02 12:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re</span><hr size=1> Its not a fantasy world, I am 21 and during the summer i have to find places to live as a college student.

Didn't think so.  So you really have no room to talk about how buisness is done.  It works similarly to dealing with a contractor.  The contractor buys parts and equipment then expects the owner to reimburse.  Have you priced airplane parts recently?  You can't go down to the local Napa and get what you need.  <br>
<br>
So my dad did some work for some people under their corporation, expecting to get paid for the work.  When it came time to pay the corporations were &quot;broke&quot;.  <br>

No, I don't understand the dark underbelly of the airplane repair world.  I do, however, know enough about business in general to know that there are ways to reclaim what you are owed for services rendered and equipment even if a business goes under.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that one mistake can't ruin someone financially.  Even a several thousand dollar mistake.  Unless your dad got repeatedly hoodwinked and never attempted to claim his due.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think you are full of shit.  I think your father, like you, is a rock stupid whiner.  And i think this story of the wealthy abusing your poor father is a bunch of bullshit he has conviced himself and you of, in order to not take responsibility for his substantial shortcomings.<br>

The whole issue of who could get German citizenship was very complicated and took lots of filling out of various papers, with many different &quot;beamten&quot;. Both during the Cold War and now people flooded in claiming refugee status and if you could prove that you had German ancestry on either side you would be granted citizenship (that included the many German enclaves in the Black Sea area of Russia, the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, Schwabenland in Hungary etc. and myself, who's family came from Silesia - which ceased to exist after WW2, when it became Poland) So basically you got it only thru descent.<br>
<br>
For the many millions of Turkish immigrants, who did the jobs the Germans didn't want to do, the story was quite different. They were usually consigned to their own 'slummy' neighbourhoods and were often discriminated against. Though they lived there for many years obtaining citizenship was possible only through a complicated and lengthy process of<br>
naturalisation. <br>
Germany finally changed it's laws last year to make it easier as, in any case 50,000 Turkish kids a year were obtaining citizenship by being born there. Now there are about 600,000 Turks with German passports. <p> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com/flash/tatSig/SigSingle.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com/flash/tatSig/SigSingle.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/19/02 6:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re</span><hr size=1> Yea but you said they were happy to do the sloppy work.

There's a real hierarchy with the worst paid and most unpleasant jobs done by 3rd World workers. Yet when I asked one of the laundry guys from the Phillipines (who worked 7 days a week, most of the day for about 80 bucks a week) he said it was better than what he would get at home. The casino staff got about 10 bucks a day and tips but they all said it was better than no job at home. <br>
Lots of countries brought in 'guest workers' in the past to do stuff like build railroads or cut sugar cane and though the work sucked it was better than no work (esp. when there's no welfare, hehe). And once in the country, these workers often ended up staying and bringing in wives which is what happened in Germany. Whatever the conditions, it must have been better than the home countries.  <p> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com/flash/tatSig/SigSingle.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com/flash/tatSig/SigSingle.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wickednessthrashmetal>WiCkEdNeSs ThRaShMeTaL</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon25.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/20/02 5:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/PIER3778/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/PIER3778CustomImage0773132.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Ok, so it's everyone's responsibility to raise the kids of poor people that decide they don't feel like using rubbers? Fuck that. Their kid, their responsibility.

<br>
This is a situation where a third party places responsibility on another third party because they did not step in to help the people that are suffering in a situation in which NEITHER third party is involved in the situation.  This is, of course, a battle of morality.  One person thinks that if a random person they do not know is in trouble that they not only should help that person but are also obliged to help that person.  The other person thinks that perhaps they should help the person in need but in no way is obliged.  When it comes to a battle of morality its a draw, both sides are right (in their own mind).  Therefore, when such a situation arises and has no definite answer you can only do your best to fit the desires of both parties.  The way to resolve this is to NOT have welfare or any means of support through the government that the people as a whole do not approve of (i.e. vote on).  If person A (the person who feels its his duty to help others out) wants to give more support he can always go to private organizations and give his money there.  However, oppressing your views and beliefs on another person is not acceptable.  You cannot tell someone that they HAVE to help someone who is in need because materialistically and logically it is NOT their responsibility.  Only morally can one try to place this responsibility.  If you want to think less of a person who feels he doesn't have to help others then fine.  I personally think less of people who are ignorant towards other people's opinions (when in fact its an opinion and not just a false fact).<br>

   First off, to all of you spouting off about people giving the poor their hard earned money, let me put it to you in a form of a question. How many of you willingly give away your PP in game to noobs who aren't a skilled as you?<br>
<br>
  Secondly, in regards to those wanting to abolish welfare, you're on the right track. However, I have an idea that I'm surprised no one has thought of. Why don't we turn welfare into a type of loan? I'm not talking about a true bank loan, but make welfare recipients fill out a form give them an interview and decide how much they actually need. The recipient in return will agree to pay back the &quot;loan&quot; within a certain amount of time or apply for a deferment with no interest hits. It seems like a fairly simple concept although I do not think so highly of myself to believe it's without faults.<br>
<br>
  Third, to those who do not believe that welfare recipient do not live &quot;well off&quot; here's how they do. They receive food stamps (take that off the list of things to buy) WICA (for mothers with infants to buy baby items. Check another item of things to buy) and welfare. What do they have left to use their welfare money on? $200 for their gov't house which lately have included water and electricity. and whatever else they feel they &quot;need&quot;. So you see how it's not hard to live well off the government you just need to know where to go.<br>
<br>
  <br>
  This final statement is for Lilum. In regards to your father, You have no clue what you are talking about. Plain and simple.<br>
Before you say that I don't know anything about airplanes, My father (just recently retired from the police force) took over the management of our local airport (mind you it's not a commercial airport) I have been around planes all my life and can tell you that either your father was paying too much for parts, was buying too many parts in excess or quite simply didn't know what to charge for his work. Don't boo hoo about your dad's hard luck when you prolly don't know the business either with the exception of what he told you. If you think I'm full of shit go tell daddy dearest to go search AOPA magazines for Lancaster Ohio.<br>

Choose the lesser of two evils when voting, both have their flaws.  I am more on the Democratic side, but it doesn't mean that they have been told what to do by God himself.  They don't have a plan that will work out for everyone, but I don't care, in my OPINION(these are what most of you pass off as 'the truth') these are who I agree with the most.  Thank you, and calling Lilum's Dad a &quot;fucking moron&quot; was just a dirty shot to sound threatening, but I guess it's hard to be threatening when you need a stepstool to bite my testicles.

It's a flameboard, halfwit.  Lilum brought up his dad's own stupidity, if you do that here, be prepared to suffer the consequences.  I was just calling a spade a spade.<br>
