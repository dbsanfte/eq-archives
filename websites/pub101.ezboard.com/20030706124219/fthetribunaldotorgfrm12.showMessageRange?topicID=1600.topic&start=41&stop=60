what a joke, you sir are a complete lego (sorry harsh i know) for even suggesting this. basicly your saying the good old US of A could stand up to the world. impossible considering your country has NEVER faced a super power in full born war. i wouldn't count WWII, mister i show up 2 years later. Cold war? ya right. The only thing even close to that was your civil war... slightly different from todays standards. i challange you to correct me if you can.<br>
<br>
Again i'll quote you. <br>
<br>
&quot;American has the most powerful military in existence.&quot;<br>
<br>
hey remeber Nam? you know the one you lost, China is a hell of a lot bigger then that and better equiped. Their regulars sure don't drive go carts. The shear numbers would be overwelming.<br>
<br>
fortunatly for America, China vs USA will never happen Bush may be dumb but he's not THAT dumb. Didn't Ladmo vote for him? <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong i'm not saying that America is weak, and i do have alot of American friends despite the fact that they are.... well American but in my personal opinion America needs to stop acting like a spoiled bully and sort your selfs out.<br>

China has a Mandatory Enlisment, Much like North Korea, They are not proffesional soldiers, Of course you probably knew that right?<br>
<br>
A few small facts to know about China.....<br>
<br>
1.) They are agricultarly Based, More then half thier citizens work on farms due to the lack of Modern farm equipment, This is due to China's stance on &quot;agriculture first&quot; made back in the 60-70's. China on a whole can not support its &quot;full&quot; army away from thier country, Hell its doubtfull they could support a full fighting force in thier own backyard.<br>
<br>
2.) China is mostly Desert, With a living area only a bit larger then California. Almost all the 1 Billion Chinese live in this region, And it is because of that fact they are  suseptable to sustained atacks in said region. If war did get Ugly the U.S. is fully capable of carpet bombing almost all of Chinas Inhabited Areas, Fortunatly China can not stay the same.<br>
<br>
<br>

1.) France Suplied them with a nuclear reactor as well as Arms....<br>
<br>
2.) Germany sold them more Weapons then the U.S.<br>
<br>
But lets not speak about them right? I mean The fact that France was only Vetoing the U.S. because it wants Iraqs oil  means nothing right? Its only bad if the U.S. does shit like that right?<br>
<br>
Your double standerd of the world you live in shows me you have been painted with Ignorance and Hatred for somone you know nothing about, Please by all means Kepp scarfing down those Big Macs while watching your rap/rock/country Video on whatever version of MTV you chose to copy and thinking &quot;God I am glad I am not like those Americans!&quot;<br>

1.) Nam was never  a war, It was Classfied a &quot;Police Action&quot; It was more of a Political Pissing match with Russia then Anything, Hense why we did what we did in Afganistan.<br>
<br>
2.) U.S. Soldiers has a 5 to 1 Kill Ratio in Nam, And our Army was Very much Capable of Conitnuing the Fight, You obviously now even less then me on this Subgect and I must admit I have not read very much on it.<br>

And relize you are the way you are because we chose to breath life and money into you, Because we protected you for all these years.<br>

Your Economies, Your cities, Your entire way of Life was preserved because the United States, And while there was a threat to these things (Russia) You could not wait to stand in line behind the U.S. Now that the threat is gone you are like a spoiled teenager Rebelling against its Parent.<br>

Theres nothing that can hurt you now so why do you need the U.S. right? I am glad we now know how most of the world thinks, And I hope with all my heart we Never become like you. <br>

You Americans are so incredibly ignorant of your own history.  I don't care if you can name the capital of Canada (its Ottawa btw - not Toronto like Time Magazine recently called it) but you should at the very least understand the historical roots of the conflicts that you become involved in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Iraq</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein was brought to power in a Baath military coup in 1968 which was covertly supported by the CIA.  The United States had been supplying weapons to the Iraqi military complex in order to fight Kurdish rebels for the previous four years.  The same Kurds that the US is going in to &quot;liberate&quot; now - isnt that nice and ironic?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Panama</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Manuel Noriega was on the CIA payroll from 1966 when he was trained at the US Army run &quot;School of the Americas&quot;.  He remained on the CIA payroll until his &quot;arrest&quot; in the invasion of Panama in 1989.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Vietnam</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Ho Chi Minh was on the payroll of the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner to the CIA) who supplied him with arms, materiales and training in order to fight the Japanese in WW2.  The only reason the US got dragged into the Vietnam conflict was because it tried to prop up a shitty little French colonial outpost (the domino theory was later concocted by apologist historians).<br>
<br>
Im not going to bother to get into Guatemala or Chile or Cuba.<br>
<br>
There are few hot wars that the United States has been involved in the past 25 years that werent the direct result of the US meddling in the affairs of other sovereign nations and general fucked up application of foreign policy.  Iraq is just another in a long list.  <br>
<br>
For your sake I hope the war is short because if it comes to house to house fighting in Baghdad its the soldiers on the ground that will pay the ultimate price for your bumbling foreign policy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nizzix>nizzix </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>What does the color purple taste like?</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/03 12:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: run for your lives sand niggers, its your turn to die.</span><hr size=1> shit man I live in rural usa, nuke the godam yankees and cali freeks, fukin A, we've got to stomp the shiat outa somebody every decade, or else our military/industrial complex loses impetus=/<br>

<br>
Yes, the US supported him in his war with Iraq.  But we did not supply him with half of his weaponry(Russia).  I know the concept seems difficult to you, but here are some <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>facts</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  France is Iraq's largest European trading partner.  It is also the third largest supplier of arms to Iraq(right behind Russia and China).  And at least we're trying to remedy our error, instead of that opportunistic egomaniac sleazeball Chirac, who ran for office to stay out of jail, and is all too eager to let Saddam get back to shredding dissidents(quite literally, there are accounts of Iraq's secret police dumping prisoners into industrial chippers) so that he can buy cheap oil from his buddy in Iraq.<br>

9/11. Time for a little reality. <br>
Drug money is used to beef up the profits of corporations. Especially banks- every $1 cash given to banks is valued at 10x its worth due to your federal reserve. A bill was passed to make laundering of cash legal as long as the cash comes from wallstreet. Drug cash is a profitable business for major US corporations especially those affiliated with banks. It has a steroid effect on their profits. Where does most heroin money come from? Afghanistan.<br>
SO: The year before 9/11 the Taliban in Afghanistan burned all their heroin crops. This was an act of major economic war against the USA. The USA realized they needed to remove the Taliban but needed a sellable way to do it- they needed a hysterical and terrified public. So they organized 9/11 and planned it. Your own government killed those people. Not the congress level- the higher level of Government, the ones for whom Bush (and clinton before him) is a puppet. Secret service, CIA. It is provable-  go to www.copvcia.com for more research verifying this as provable. <br>
The CIA has long been provably involved in drug trafficking in the USA. <br>
The USA knew about 9/11 before it happened. They were informed by Germany's secret service when one of the people planning the attack warned the secret service two weeks before 9/11 happened. All this information is starting to emerge, but it is kept quiet as your mainstream media has close ties to oil and banking corporations, and cannot shoot themselves in the foot by revealing the whole truth. So they sell you an easy to believe, good-guy/bad-guy situation to help you all sleep easier at night.<br>
I hope you're not too concerned that your democracy has been dead ever since Kennedy was assassinated. There's not much you can do about it now anyway. The New World Order is here now, it's a simple matter of time until it collapses. In the meantime watch your civil liberties slowly erode as the powers that be fuck your asses harder and harder until it's too late for you.<br>
Analogy: You can't cook a frog in a boiling pot- it will jump out. You have to put it in luke-warm water first, then slowly turn up the heat. You guys are in luke-warm water, right this second. Whatcha gunna do about it? Call me anti-american and forget about it until you're cooked. I don't care, I don't like you anyway.<br>

Certain tactics were expected from the general and he went a different route, using suicide attacks on ships and such. The whole point was to test new US tactics against regular scenarios, and that's what the US planned for, but the general wasn't interested in the regular stuff expected and destroyed any hope of a US win in just a few days. It's not realistic to think the US would be caught so off guard in a real war, especially when considering &quot;Iraq&quot; destroyed most of our ships and killed most of our troops within days by using suicide attacks over and over and over again. <br>
