Question, what happens to the wizard portal that's in Cazic thule?<br>
I'm guessing you didn't clear the area around the portal site out.<br>
<br>
-Eban Stormbringer<br>
<br>
The portal isn't really any more dangerous than it was before. The same precautions work as they did before. Sure, if you were going to get wiped out in the old CT, you'll get wiped out a little faster now. But the portal is pretty much just as usable as it was before.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
So that establishes that it wasn't made harder when they upgraded the zone, now I'll find the old message that says it was made safer before hand.<br>

There were originally four mobs planted in that room that were removed.  There was a post that specifically said in order to balance the wizard class it was made easier.  They also specifically said that the change was made because the original reason for making the wiz ports more dangerous but more convenient was a class balance thing.

Of course if you were high enough level most of the mobs wouldn't attack you, but for the levels meant to hunt in CT porting in there was near certian death.  <br>
<br>
When they did the revamp it wasn't just wizards who had a fit, quite a few rogues did too.  Since rogues doing their epic quite often use CT gate potions when trying to retrieve the book from PoH.  Insta cast gate potions are quite handy when one of those stupid specs unexpectedly turn around (specs see invis).  Unfortunatly after the revamp, the CT portal became useless for that purose since you were trading sure death in one spot for sure death in another.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujaeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 12:15:04 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wtf</span><hr size=1> The day of the revamp, I got myself a port to the wizard spire, and hide/sneak'd my way out.  I remember seeing a couple of mobs that could see invis, but I went around them.  I spent an unbelievable amount of time in CT to get a full suit of rubicite armor back when it was the cream of the crop, so I knew it inside out.  I had a TON of those potions from the golem, and never could use them because the second you ported in, the lizards around the portal would attack you.  And this is going back to before invis carried over into the zone you zoned into.  It was totally impossible to zone in there without being able to take a few lizards.  Which wasn't that hard if you're with a full group, they were all green.  When they made that change, that potion became highly sought after for a while, but I kept them all because I figured they were better used then sold. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Of course the game isn't supposed to be &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;safe&quot;, that has nothing to do with it.  Tell ya what, let me find an exploit that let's our guild get into an area that we aren't able to kill things in normally AND then let it have the potential to wipe out YOUR raid.  Then let's see how fast you start a 50 page thread flaming me for both gimping an area I shouldn't be in(sound familiar) AND potentially wiping your raid with my gimp ass.

They changed it but there was still a single lizard there. It was never completely safe. I believe the lizard roamed the base of the platform. Even at level 60 if I ported in there I would get aggro from him, I was doing this up until the revamp as I farmed golem metal wands for ToT3, then later on for personal use (thanks nerf to those =/). The zone was then revamped, and all the sudden the level 30 liz that roamed around the portal became quite a bit tougher =0 ) The zone in at the portal was not safe, nor was the evac point that put you smack dab in the middle of 2 level 50+ lizards. As has been said over and over, a lot of wizards bitching = they made the portal area 100% safe and moved the evac point away from the 2 lizards at the door. <br>
<br>
So, although Jaeron is right in that they made the portal SAFER by removing the added lizards that were in that area, he is WRONG in that it was completely safe at any point prior to the moving of the abscond point and removal of all mobs in the area of the spire. Which was done about a week after the upgrade to the zone. <p><br><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22676" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://4.65.47.107/mandosig4.jpg" border="0"></a>

How much time have you even been playing again?  I've been around since 99, so if you're gonna argue stuff, I seriously hope you have too.  Otherwise, stfu, gtfo, and understand that the only reason Xavre jumped in was because he wants to make up for doing me wrong.. he stole your mother right out from under me.  I didn't care really.. but you know how guildmembers are.. he feels all guilty and crap.  The points I'm arguing are:<br>
1) The portal started out with multiple mobs standing around to kill you.  <br>
2) The portal was made easier to zone into to help balance the class.  <br>
3) The difficulty of the porting in wasn't altered by the zone upgrade unless you count the mob that might see you being higher level.  (Can still hide/invis and be safe)  <br>
4) The fact that someone is pulling to there doesn't hinder your ability to invis and continue forward.<br>
5) You're an idiot Wolvar. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
Let me try another tact...<br>
I can give a complete fuck about what they did in the distant past to make the portal SAFER.  It has absolutely ZERO bearing on this.  <br>
<br>
They recently made it COMPLETELY safe to allow for safe travel NOT because of class balance, because PEOPLE COMPLAINED. WHY did they complain you ask?  Because upgrading the zone DID INDEED make it MUCH harder to portal into.  There are SEE INVIS MOBS IN THE MAZE YOU DUMB FUCK and you were getting aggro immediately which made the portal absofucking useless for what it was intended.  So they fixed succor and made the pyramid  mob-free.<br>
<br>
Someone fighting there can most assuredly hinder your ability to &quot;move forward&quot;.  Obviously ya needa few trips into CT to find out why.  <br>
<br>
Yer thick dood, and ya gots no friends else they woulda looked at the names in this thread that are contradicting you and told you to stfu.  Keep arguing with me tho, don't read anything else and by all means keep stickin yer foot in yer mouth. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhazewire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hazewire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 3:14:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> STFUW</span><hr size=1> in memory of Vortigern, STFUW. <p><p>
