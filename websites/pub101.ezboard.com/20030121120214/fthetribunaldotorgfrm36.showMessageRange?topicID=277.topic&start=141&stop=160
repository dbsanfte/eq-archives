<br>
You can cloud this issue with morality, but it is a stupid argument. At least the Catholic church, who is against birth control and abortion, help support the children that are born due to those stands.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand are like a citizen who screams for a new public park to be built, but ten refuses to pay extra taxes to fund it. You want the party, but you don't want to pay for it.<br>
<br>
It is despicable and the height of hyprocisy to be pro-life but yet want to take away welfare and socail programs. I have about as much respect for you as I do the women in Africa who has a child starve and then goes and has 3 more just to watch it happen all over again. <p><br>

Anyway you're beating a dead horse. To repeat it just one more time for you; YOU think its murder, OTHERS don't. There is no absolute, there is no answer - just because you believe it doesn't make it so. It's a grey area. That abortion is generally approved around the world ought to tell you something. Don't you think this has been debated and thought about by people much smarter than you and I countless of times? And don't give me the &quot;most people thought the earth was flat once&quot; etc. because if you can't tell the difference and think in context you aren't worthy of this discussion. <br>

You can look this this up in medical and biological books, it's in there. Human being as in the species, that is. Please stop trying to debate this issue, it's really absurd.<br>
<br>
What makes a person? Well, that is a more subjective term. Everyone has their opinions, and a person can be defined any number of ways: religious, biological, philosophical...it goes on and on. I would venture to say if you asked 100 people to &quot;define a person&quot; you would get 100 different answers. But, this is really irrelevant to the whole argument. The life of a human being (as in the species) should not be judged on whether or not someone defines it as a &quot;person&quot;. Back in the 1800's, african americans were not considered people. People back then believed they were property, much in the way you guys believe a fetus is something other than human. Nevertheless, they were biologically human (as in the species).<br>
<br>
A few of you say when a fetus can survive outside the womb, then it becomes a person. I gather that you all are against partial birth abortions then. But, I would like to know, at what moment does this excactly happen? Can you test for it or something? This was asked in another thread, and basically was never answered. <br>
<br>
At what point in time does a fetus become a person to you all, and should this be used as the cutoff point for when abortion should become illegal? It seems that the pro-death people are much more imposing their moral views and opinions on us all then the pro-life people. Pro life people simply believe in the destruction of innocent human life (as in the species) is wrong. Pro Death people arbitrarily decide this at some point in time.<br>

You want to force me to support a child that is not mine and i had nothing to do with bringing into the world.<br>
<br>
You don't want to force a mother to support a child that she chose to bring into the world.<br>
<br>
You will counter by saying that is her choice to do what she wants with her body.<br>
<br>
But this fails to pass the smell test.<br>
<br>
When I work and am taxed to feed someone elses child, I lose control of my body for all those hours i worked to pay those taxes.<br>
<br>
Why is it right to force me to care for someone i have no responsibility for and had no choice in creating, but it is right to give a mother the option?<br>

<br>
No I don't want to force you. I don't bitch about my tax dollars going for that, because I have compassion for children. I don't care if their parents are fucktards, it's not the childs fault and the child should not suffer. I consider every child born to be everyone who has a hearts repsonibility. I may not like having to spend money on it, but I am not willing to sacrafice a child for money. You are.<br>
<br>
This is what makes your pro-life stand so dispicable. If you would be willing to help support these unwanted children and give them a fair shot at life, I could respect your views despite whether I agreed or not.<br>
<br>
I have no respect however, for a mother fucker who is so anal as to cause more children to be born only so he can wash his hands of them.<br>

Doesn't matter - it's the woman's body and she can refuse to use it to incubate a fetus.<br>

<br>
No argument here, but I would point out that nobody can have a right that infringes upon anothers right. The fetus can't fulfill it's rights by infringing on the woman's right to control her own body. Now if you can fulfill those rights without forcing the woman to use her body, no problem.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>3) Therefore the mother could not morally OR legally kill the developing person </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The woman does not have the right to kill the fetus, she does however have the right to remove it from her body and refuse to use her body to sustain it. The death of the fetus is a side effect of these rights. If the fetus could survive in an incubator outside the mother, then it would be murder if it wasn't given that chance. <p><br>

What other issues, other than the ones you brought up earlier which were thoroughly debunked without breaking a sweat.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you don't see where he is lashing out at me personally, then just leave it be.<br>
<br>
<br>
About all your &quot;facts&quot;, well you can take them and shove them. Facts are NOTHING without proper argumentation. I could supply plenty of &quot;facts&quot; as to why Bin Ladens cause it valid - but it would be hard to defend it with argumentation. This is where you fail Dumai. You supply &quot;facts&quot; any 5 year old with Internet access could supply, but you fail to support your facts with viable points. Instead you lash out at others facts, saying you've gunned them down (when in fact you've done nothing), but ignore our argumentation (Is anything but facts too abstract?), and then just continue to stick with your &quot;facts&quot; vs ours, even though its been made clear that it's not about facts, it's about ethics and definition. <br>
<br>
Kelliane makes a good case, mixing facts with argumentation - take notes Dumai.<br>
<br>
However I don't agree with her. Arguing that just because something is human by species it should be protected by the same laws and ethics means nothing to me. Without the things I mentioned earlier (personality, intelligence etc.) a human is but a shell. If someone removed the brain (or lost their active brain capacity) I would not consider it a person - a human being (by species) yes, a person - no. This is why we allow doctors to pull the plug on patience (if the family consents) like that (at least where I live), because they are only a burden to society and not themselves capable of anything - they are dead IMO.<br>
<br>
Much the same way I see a fetus. It's life yes - just like an animal (humans are animals too), but doesn't have what defines a person to me. If it's not wanted and would only become a burden on the parents, and most likely have a poor childhood and a much lesser chance at success, I see no reason why the parents should not be able to decide whether to have their baby or wait till the times are better. Animals have it easy - they can only be impregnated at certain times of year, when the chance of the baby succeeding in the world is greatest (natures own birth control), and many species can automatically abort should the conditions turn unbearable, because it's the right and best thing to do from a logical and rational point of view. <br>
<br>
You say its murder, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">I say it's not</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, but even if it was (still not saying it is) it's sometimes the best and right thing to do, just as war is sometimes is, and we accept then that people will die.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

This thread blew up.<br>
<br>
Hayzen, Dumai, Kell....<br>
<br>
Your position is that once an egg is fertilized it is human, and should be granted protection.<br>
<br>
Well it's a fact that the Birth Control pill does abort feritlized eggs.  So toss your chits in with Nite's group of people, if you are so head strong on your "final answer" position.<br>
<br>
If you doubt that fact, Elche's wife had a child with birth control.  If a woman is able to have a child with birth control, then it can automatically be concluded that other fertilized eggs were aborted, and is probably more commonly done than a fetus surviving.<br>
<br>
So while you two haven't said you stand with Nite, your arguements do.<br>
<br>
Dumai, if you believe that everyone will have to go to California to have an abortion, you're wrong.  Look at the history of this issue, there was a time when abortion was illegal.  Look at where women went to have abortions during those times.<br>
<br>
Also you can drop the whole "Pro-Abortion" crap.  There are few people that are "pro-abortion".<br>
<br>
Just because I will defend the rights of a Racist to speak his peace, doesn't mean I agree with how he used his rights.<br>

<br>
No, they do not when it concerns birth control.  If you think otherwise then feel free to quote my arguments which you believe supports such a stance.<br>
<br>
Hormonal birth control pills are not the only form of contraceptive there is.  Not only that, but it has yet to be shown that these pill can cause abortions.  No sources or evidence have been presented to substantiate that claim. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A> at: 11/26/02 8:11:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dooksdooks>Dooks Dooks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/26/02 8:58:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion, how many support this..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The death of the fetus is a side effect of these rights.

I was unaware that fetuses are in general removed from the mother intact and given the chance to survive in an incubator.  Unless of course you consider injecting the amniotic sac with a saline solution giving the fetus a chance to survive outside the mother...<br>

<br>
That's because unless it is done in the third trimester, there is little to no chance of it surviving, at least to the best of my knowledge.<br>
<br>
Hell, even kids born a mere month early tend to have lung problems and need to be kept in incubators. <p><br>
