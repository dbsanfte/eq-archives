&quot;Well sweetheart, if you are that damn interested I, apparently, know of a good prison that gives good deals on gang rapes!&quot;<br>

That giant flapping anus of yours is a testament to thier prowess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just let me know Bowynn, and I'm sure I could help you out.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I were looking for someone suck off my pet chihuahua, I'd call you right up, buddy. <br>
<br>
&quot;If cunt happens to be the next word in the series of 'Bowynn's Big word listing',&quot;<br>
<br>
No <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Unlike your kind of braindead monkey spooges, I can flame quite effectively without jsut unleashing a stream of vulgarity and called that a kick-ass flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure I can throw a few more fuck this and fuck that his way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aww shucks, you don't to go through all that for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;It may be obvious I can't flame,&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;May&quot; be obvious?  Forrest Gump could flame better than you.<br>
<br>
&quot;but after reading some of your posts, one thing is obvious; I can never compare the flame god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't feel bad.  Few mentally retarded people can.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will gladly stand by on this ever-sinking fucking ship as it goes down and people continue to berate the hell out of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Feels like home, eh?<br>
<br>
&quot;I will, in turn, learn as much as I can from this flame and only hope I get half as good as you people!&quot;<br>
<br>
The ability to learn is most often evidenced by a marked change in behavior resulting from new information.  Considering your childlike tirade that has continued for days now.. I really doubt you are capable of learning.<br>
<br>
Don't feel bad though.  If you can swing a mop, you can be a jizzmopper.  They make decent money, I hear.  You certainly seem qualified.  Just think, no more being yelled at for burning the fries.<br>
<br>
There is hope, little man.  As Ladmo so eloquently quoted Journey &quot;Don't stop believing...&quot; <p><CENTER>

Yes, I do believe you grouped with him Karry &amp; RF, although I think he was playing his female character then. That was when he learned he could pretend to be a chick and cyber for Phat Lewts. Yes, he loves the cock (but only if you give him plat or uber loot) <br>
<br>
My apologies to all of you. I know this person as well as his retarded compadre in RL. If I could turn back time and close Pandora's box, I would. Alas, I can't. So hopefully he will just crawl back under his rock and stay there. <br>
<br>
And he has yet to mention who his main is. He does not have a 53 shaman  or a 53 anything for that matter. If he does, it's because he bought them off of ebay or player auction. <br>

Perhaps you should leave the FB alone and just play the game. <br>

<br>
Tildain/Telemundo,  it appears the vast majority of your post on me was just drivel.  Why you bring me up I don't know.  I rarely log onto Tribunal and even when I did post on this board <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> rarely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, it was never enough to get me noted.  Can't really get famous off of a person few people know.<br>
<br>
Now, boggled as I am with why you spouted bullshit about me earlier, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I'm</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> not the one pissed about it.  I couldn't give a fuck (no more than to post this).  If I was pissed, I would reveal the name of your characters, let the people here fuck with you in game.  Although I figure few of them would because they realize that while things from the game are ranted about here, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  the Flameboard is not shit that you bring in game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  What goes on here for the most part stays here.  Kinda like truth or dare.  Plus I don't reveal your name because I don't really give a fuck about the rules here.<br>
<br>
If you plan to stay, here's some advice:<br>
<br>
(1) Just make an EZboard account with even a true alt's name, though main is preferred, if you wanna skulk about like a little pussy then at least put a true name to yourself.  Even people that got made fun of for weeks on end (Octracula;Krickett) got through it and achieved at least some level of acceptance (couldn't think of a better word).  But being a weak little shit and not even posting your name won't give you jack or shit (just banned- and you only got 2 places to post from to my knowledge).<br>
<br>
(2) Except in cases of Ebay, RL doesn't belong on the Flameboard.  The majority of the people here don't know who the fuck I am (other than being the husband of Daeja- who also held waaay back on you for my benefit) and don't need to.  Although interesting, the RL adventures of EQ people (stealing computers with squeaky wheelchairs; fucking over one EQ boyfriend to go live with another friend from game then fucking that person over by fucking someone they voiced attraction to) really aren't appropriate or necessary here.  It is the Flameboard true  'nuf, but EQ is the tie that binds here- keep it relevant.<br>
<br>
(3) It's gonna take a lot more than strings of profanities to mean anything here.  You need a purpose.  If your purpose is to stir shit up for no apparent reason, you are just another anonymous troll.  Nobody gives a fuck, seriously.  If you are here to be known, or even to be known for an opinion, then post a name cockwhore because otherwise you are just another waste of space on this board.  Don't post unless you have the balls to back it up with a name, shit, Frank does that much.<br>
<br>
(4) And finally, you are in your 20s (RL <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> IG)- shouldn't you be spending your time levelling?  And if you're at work, then work.  You're getting paid the big bucks because you don't get to sleep through your shifts and slack like me.  Those lil recruits don't push the papers to go home themselves. <p><center><hr width=450 color=330033 align=center><center><font face="morpheus" size="3" color="#333333"> Wiik Bloodtithe <center><font face="duke" size="2" color="#336633">Firiona Vie Server</font>

<br>
First and foremost, alot of people play female characters. Unlike your statement, I have never done any of that. If I had, trust me, I'm sure Wick would have been the first to know. I thought we were pretty close, in RL and in game. <br>
<br>
Secondly, I didn't come here to flame anyone in particular. I thought it was fucked up how people continue to steal threads and stray off topic; much like they did on mine. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, I am told not to bring RL circumstances in to the flameboard that aren't relevant. Not that I care about what I do, but I'm sure talking about what I do in RL on here isn't relevant. And that coming straight from the horse's ass in the previous post! <br>
<br>
I am all about shit talking and profanities, mostly profanities. Again, my point was stated earlier about this topic. That was my opinion, and it was stated clearly. Flameboard rules of anarchy and shit...well, thats gotta go. Arleanna reigns supreme was the statement I received. That should be the description. <br>
<br>
Lastly, idle threats about character names and the like shouldn't be made, by any means to scare someone off; let alone to have then stop posting opinions. <br>
<br>
Whats really fucked up about this is simply this: People get too addicted to this game. It goes on and on and people lose track of what is important in life. Family, spouse, kids, work...those are all apart of what's needed to survive. I'm pretty sure EQ isn't included. People eventually become two faced, and as sweet as they are in game, I'm sure everyone knows what kind of bitch people can be in RL (Daeja is correct, I know her in RL). That petty sarcasim just isn't you anymore 'sweetheart'. It stopped being cute when you started running people's lives! Ask Wick about some of our emails to eachother, I'm sure you'll see what I mean. That in-game threat crap has just got to go though. Bull shit is bull shit, no matter what way you look at it.  (Sorry, Tom...balls to the walls on this post)<br>
<br>
So stop embarrassing us with this shit and that shit...ahaha. Please, I'll voice anything and everything. You want a main's name...You got it dear...<br>
