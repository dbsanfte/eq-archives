<br>
To start off, I will give you a little background information of myself. I was born in Hong Kong, where I learnt Chinese (written and spoken: Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghainese). I had secondary education in England where I picked up French and Latin (although I have forgotten most of it immediately after the GCSE). Now I am having tertiary education in USA (needless to say, I had the opportunity to learn and practise my English in the 3 locations).<br>
<br>
The following are the reasons, in my humble opinion, why one would want to learn any languages other than English. <br>
<br>
(1) First, from a business standpoint (for I am a business major), it is clear that being multilingual is an asset, especially if you are in managerial positions. There is a reason why one would want to put &quot;multilingual&quot; in their resume. It could help you land a job, or gain an edge in rising through the ranks. <br>
<br>
If you are in a big company, chances are some of your collegues and/or subordinates are foreigners. Knowing their mothertongue, even if your knowledge is far from perfect, can do no harm.<br>
<br>
If you are working for a multinational firm, and speak a foreign tongue fluently, you could be assigned to a foreign post. Why would you want to work in a &quot;filthy&quot; country, like say, China? Because standard of living is low there, and you, as an ex-pat, receive your pay-check in US$$$, or the much-loved greenbacks--you can live like a king there. And if you are assigned to &quot;supervise&quot; the locals, your managerial experience could bolster your resume for later job promotions back at your home, your centre (or &quot;center&quot;, if you must) of the Universe, USA. <br>
<br>
(a friend of mine got a job in Goldman Sachs in Japan thanks to his knowledge in Japanese... and yes, he is American, as in white and not Asian)(ok, standard of living is not low in Japan, but it is still nice to work for GS...)<br>
<br>
If you are working in the service industry, especially tourism, or in the import/export industry, it goes without saying that knowing some foreign languages helps. Another of my friends works for Fujifilm now....<br>
<br>
(2) Second, it enhances the enjoyment of EQ.... (yes, the centre of universe is in fact EQ, not USA). In EQ, if you look hard enough, there are so many people who do not have English as mothertongue. Messing around in their native tongue gives much PLAYSURE. la la la la....hihiihihii<br>
<br>
(3) Third, it enriches one culturally. Reading a translation or a dubbed/subtitled movie, is never as good as viewing them in their native language. Much of the nuances and subtleties are often lost. For those who care, reading the translated version of Li Po's (one of China's greatest poets) poems is a complete waste of time....<br>
<br>
(4) Fourth, you might, perhaps, maybe, by chance,  want to visit a foreign country, as a tourist(after you got bored with the four Yellow Stoneheads, Great Canyon, and national monuments such as the Vampire State Building(sp?)). &quot;Merci, domo, do-tze, krub-kroon-ka&quot;, might to your amazement, generate friendly smiles, even though they are the only words you know in their respective languages. <br>
<br>
(5) Fifth, it is always nice to know when somewhen is stabbing your back right in front of you......<br>
<br>
Perhaps, however, all of the above won't apply to you. So therefore you will be content with your knowledge that your ignorance of other languages won't affect you materially... in fact, since United States is so powerful, you wouldn't have to worry about the other nations at all (or the other nationalities, who in fact make up the United States, after they replaced the original inhabitants). Therefore one only needs to know English (which incidentally came from the imperialist England, the Original Evil Empire (tm), the last time I checked), and worry about football (the American variety, of course). <br>
<br>
This line of parochial thinking irks me. The same line of thinking leads to isolationism, xenophobia, and all evils to multicultralism. If America is so strong, when then, do you have to give a shit, literally? I don't have an answer. Afterall, I am here for education, because USA is the most technologically and economically advanced country in the world, at this point of time, and has some of the best universities in the world (the same cannot be said for its secondary education, however...). <br>
<br>
Isolationism is not new. And it is usually a sign of complacence. Being a Chinese, I know a fair dosage of that in China in the past. China, in Chinese, is &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;, meaning not medicority, but its egoistic view that it is the centre of the world. This is laughable now, of course, but back in its heydays, when it was the most technologically and economically advanced nation in the world, when neighbour countries pay tributes and mimick the Chinese (where did you think the Kanji in Japanese come from), it was certainly not laughable. Who needed trade and exchange of ideas? WTF is multiculturalism? China was self-sufficient and happy with it. The same happened elsewhere in the world, such as the Togukawa-Japan. <br>
<br>
But this is not so much an ode to China's former glory, as it as a cautionary tale of why not be complacent. Isolationism, in both cases mentioned above, led to disastrous results, as we now know. Japan was lucky that its Meiji restoration was so successful, that it caught up with the West almost at a blink of an eye (in historical timescale). For China, there is to be much more hardship (To put it into historical perspective, the entire period from the founding of US till its dominance today, can be easily contained one of China's many dynasty).<br>
<br>
SOOOO, WTF is this to do with learning languages. Ok this is really tangental, but what I am saying is that the world order does change. This is not to say China is going to take over the world--it can't even take over Taiwan--but roles of nations are almost certainly going to change within most of our lifetimes, and knowing some foreign language might be a good &quot;hedge&quot;.<br>
<br>
(A closer example for you could be Great Britain, or United Kingdom, or that island off the coast of continenal Europe)(which a while ago, was like, dominating the world)(and watch how the former basket case of Ireland is doing economically now)(much to the astonishment (and ire, haha) of many Brits, I am sure :P)(for you Americans, it's like having the Canadian economy grow faster than yours, by a large margin, eh).<br>
<br>
One who sticks his head up his isolationist trap stand to lose many opportunities. Europe, while we all agree are inferior to America in productivity, are catching up. The people are the same--the differences are purely structural--and such differences can be and is changing, accelerated by the formation of EU. <br>
<br>
China, even though much dodgier, communist (in name), and packed with corrupt officials, is changing too. An article in the Economist predicted that China's economy would reach parity with USA as early as 2040 (with if, buts, and many qualifications, of course)(by then, supposedly per-capita income will be the same as Portugal now)(the economy will be in parity due to the much larger population). The bottomline is, there will be growth. A much higher growth than a mature economy such as USA. Growth means opportunity. The opportunity to make lots n lot o money muahahaha (and to lose it too). The same applies for other emerging markets. I know one thing about doing business in China--if helps soooo much if you know how to speak it--take my word for it. <br>
<br>
So there. In the tradition of a good flame. Fuck you all yankees, respectfully. <br>

Fucking gooks don't even know how to flame. And YOU are under the impression that you have a decent grasp of the language? <br>
<br>
STFU and bring me my kung pau chicken, before I bitch-slap your slope ass and make you build me a raildroad. Jebus. <br>
<br>
A fucking chink come here and explain that it is bad to not know more languages, hay, yeah that makes sense. Does the rice farming chinaman need to learn French, English, Spanish? No. He does not. Why? Because he farms rice. No benefits will come his way from just learning another language. Similarly, does a high-tech worker (let alone blue collar worker) need to learn other languages? No. He does not? Why, because the changes of benefiting from it, is very very small, compared to the effort it takes to learn it. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, it's not bad to learn something. That's good, always. But not learning it, isn't necessarily bad. You'd get a far better off from taking a couple of horus and reading something as banale as Carnegie's &quot;How to win friends and influence people&quot; fer fucks sakes. <br>
<br>
There are many things wrong with this country. No country is perfect, all evil, all good. <br>
<br>
But nationalism is the last resort of the retard. <br>
<br>
I mean, doesn't China have a slightly spotty record on human rights and suchlike? Uh? Yeah, there's Ruby Ridge, Waco, and whateverthe fuck else, but all countries got a bit of that shit. French blowing up Greenpeace boats in Australian harbors, killing innocent people, Mossad agents assassinating innocent arab kebab stand operators in Norway, thinking he was a PLO badboy, Libyans employing a Norwegian fire-guidance system to successfully knock down one of the US planes that tried to kill Quaddafar, there's all these wild little things going on. <br>
<br>
Well, lemme see... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;We cut their ranks to pieces; enemy dead were strewn all along the platoon front. Our LMGs were red-hot, firing longer and longer bursts of grazing fire from point-blank range. I thought the machine guns would melt before we ran out of ammo, and that, I felt sure, would happen before the columns ran out of Chinks. But then they stopped. Suddently the Chinese broke off their attack on our well-armed position, leaving only their dead to litter our front in scattered mounds of broken, twisted bodies.

That's the difference, you see. That's why any western, civilized nation -- for all our ignorance, racisism, or whatever fault you may find here -- are better than the primitive, neanderthal, chopstick-wielding slanty-eyed motherfuckers 3rd world fucks -- who's ignorance and racisism by FAR surpasses even the most inbread trailor dwelling waste of air that lives here. <br>

why dont americans care? why should we care? for the last 55 years, the us has subsidized western europe, struggled to support the fucking latinos down south, rebuilt and later competed with the japs and koreans. other then japan who trades with us, the mexicans that supply our cheap labor, the canadians with comedy and the aussies with the crocodile hunter, what the fuck has the rest of the world done for us? we supported the chinese, but then they chose communism over democracy, we tried to bolster vietnam, but those guys just didnt give a crap, so it all went to pot there. when i was in bulgaria, everyday not only did i here about the fucking 500 years of the turkish yoke, i also heard about what motherfuckers truman and churchhill were for leaving them to the russians. the rest of europe doesnt give a rats ass about how the us saved them 2 times from germany, and once from soviet union. what kind of gratitude is that? only the brits have any kind of decency about it, and are all but our vassal state anyways.<br>
<br>
maybe isolationism isnta good idea, but for fucks sake, let the rest of the world stand on their own two feet. but wait, we cant do that, cause if we dont do anything, were damned, and if we do do something, were damned for intervening in others affairs. so how about this? the rest of the world admits they're a bunch of fuckups, especially the middle east and those shit head korean gamers, and just apply for american statehood. <br>
<br>
heres my last thought. all you foreign fuckers that wonder why joe blow from podunk iowa doesnt know where grendlefuchtme blowhemia, or why he doesnt know the latest political scandal in the eu, is because we have our own continent full of countried to worry about. we have 50 states that are for all intents in purposes countries, and we need to learn about our own slice of the world before we can bother to learn about your shit hole. and to top that off, we have the fucking easterners(my eastern friends are exempt from this category) seem to think they know about us westerners, and try to tell us what we can and cant do out here. hells bells, we may have representation, but its still 2000 miles away in bumfuck washington. i wont mention southern california, thats just a disgrace. but i digress.<br>

<br>
In the situation I described you would also be given living quarters of appropriate size for your family, and possibly a servant at no charge. The cost of living there is odd. Somethigns are crazy high in price, and some are are low. For example, a can of coke cost 1 Rhyal. But a restaurant of any quality is going to cost you some bucks.<br>
