It definately does not follow the same pattern of when Blix revealed Iraq had missiles that possibly went beyond the allowed range. He asked for more time for inspections but kept the most damning evidence he could have reported buried in a massive report for journalists to spot and reveal the next day. There's no argument that can say this ain't a bit odd. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 3/8/03 7:48:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

It would be responsible, fair and objective. Telling the security council and the world at his required UN presentation that Iraq has been providing &quot;substancial cooperation&quot;, &quot;real disarmament &quot; and that there is no evidence to support much of Colin Powell's intelligence presentation, while ignoring the discovery of a drone that matches Colin Powell's intelligence description exactly is not responsible, fair, or objective. It is leaving out impacting evidence to further his own chances of lengthening the inspections process. That is not his job. His job is to report what he sees in detail, reveal all suspicions that need to be addressed and let the UN security council debate the facts and suspicions presented and make the decision themselves.<br>
<br>
He is not balanced. I had no questions of his intentions at his presentation last month, which effectively destroyed much of the United State's wish to launch a military strike without stronger than expected opposition from France, Russia and China. That was a fair report of what he had observed and it fairly leaned towards the intentions of further inspections. This report did not. His own view that inspections need to continue on for months got in the way. He didn't want to report in the actual presentation something that would have gathered a hell of a lot more support on the spot for a possible invasion. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hans Blix has been pretty balanced.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, has been. When he disagreed with Powell's evidence he was balanced. When he revealed Iraq's illegal missiles he was balanced. When he said there was no evidence that suggested Iraq knew where the inspectors were headed hours beforehand he was balanced. When he said there is a strong chance that Iraq still posesses a large quanity of anthrax that they never declared he was balanced. Yesterday, he was not balanced. He showed he is just as politically motivated as anyone else in the UN. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 3/8/03 5:44:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

No one cares if he fails to report a squirt gun found in one of Saddam's palaces that has the potential of squirting VX in someone's eyes. This is quite a bit more serious than that.<br>
<br>
Seriously, this is as close to a smoking gun outside of minor missile violations as we've gotten. It's the same friggin drone that Powell mentioned at  the UN in February. You know, the evidence that everyone dismissed as fabricated insignifigant lies.<br>
<br>
Esmann, the brand new discovery of an undeclared Iraqi drone that has the strong possibility of crossing Iraq's borders, in direct violation of the UN, with the stronger possibility of carrying out chemical attacks, all of which Powell said his intelligence suggested way back at the beginning of February <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hidden info at the security council meeting. There is no reason this should have been treated any differently than the Al Samoud discovery. Iraq's missile capability was revealed  and well known info since before 1998 as well. Colin Powell's copy, which he stated he was going to read from, did not contain the information and he was not even made aware of the the newly added information until much later on.<br>
<br>
This is not 1998. Resolution 1441 created new requirements and responsibilties and the discovery of this drone illustrates Iraq shrugged it off once again, but it was not stressed in Blix's address. That's the issue here, not what  was already known.<br>
<br>
It was Blix's job to directly state the discovery to the security council and not let them have to wade through the  167 pages 12 hours later to decipher by themselves the severity, the importance, the danger and the possible implications of the findings. Things have changed since '98, finding such a drone in March 2003 that Iraq was supposed to have declared in its 12,000 page weapons declaration in December is a serious problem and cannot be passed off as &quot;previously known&quot; information that's buried in a 167 page document. It's like announcing the slight progress made in a cure for cancer at a internationally televised press conference then handing a 167 page document to the press, with a 100% successful cure for AIDS announced on page 150 like it's some sort of nonevent.<br>
<br>
It ain't spin, it's a justified beef with Hans Blix. As time goes on, as bribes get handed out, as bugged rooms and phones get revealed, as dubious presentation efforts of Hans Blix surface, I lean more and more towards the UN is already irrelevant camp. It's the most dysfunctional and corrupt organization in the world yet all the world's problems are expected to be handled correctly and fairly through it. What's the point? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

<br>
For the sake of argument lets say they dont violate the resolution requirements. If blix had come out and made a big deal out of this discovery before he verified it and the US used this as a pretext to declare war on Iraq only to find out later that it didnt violate the restrictions. Where then would blix's responsibility lie?<br>
<br>
I am not trying to excuse Sadam here. I do however think questioning Blix's profesionalism over this is unfair to a man that as far as I can tell is making every effort to acomplish a very difficult task as profesionaly as he can.<br>
<br>
The US is clearly looking for any reason to start this war. Blix carries a verry heavy wieght on his shoulders.The whole world is basicly hanging on what he says to make their decision on what to do. If you were in his position would you be so quick to start a war on unverified information?<br>
<br>
Do you really believe he had any illusions that people wouldnt pour over his report with a fine tooth comb? That he thought for a second that this information would be overlooked?<br>

<br>
uhh yeah, all the more reason to confirm Powell's intelligence report that had been denied by Iraq and butchered by various commentators. And the missiles were declared but their distance was covered up and then... discovered. There's little difference here. And what BS propaganda? The first AP report I read on this said simply, &quot;Also in the 173 page report, Blix expresses his concern over an undeclared unmanned Iraqi drone discovered by inspectors on March 4.&quot; There was no mention of &quot;outrage&quot; from US officals, but the flag went up in my head immediately as I knew this was an odd thing for Blix to ignore in his oral report.  Just as I was about to post this thread I found the Times article while searching for a link to the AP article, which said that US officials were baffled as well. The &quot;propaganda&quot; did not affect me.<br>
<br>
Yes, Blix's job is not to make the case for war. It is to verify if Iraq is complying and to state in his oral presentations the areas in which Iraq is complying, possibly complying, not complying and possibly not complying. It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> clear that this drone violates resolution 1441 in at least one area... it was not declared. He neglected to make mention of one very major instance in which Iraq did not comply by not declaring an unmanned drone which is said to have been test flighted at a distance of up to 500km.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If blix had come out and made a big deal out of this discovery before he verified it and the US used this as a pretext to declare war on Iraq only to find out later that it didnt violate the restrictions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When Blix first mentioned the Al Samoud missiles it was not clear whether they were capable of exceeding the UN's limits. He verified nothing then, he reported his suspicions even though not one test or calculation had been completed. Blix was suspicous of the missiles, he said as much in his oral report and said testing would soon be done to determine the missiles' capability. He is suspicous of this unmanned drone. He did not say as much in his oral report. Unmanned drones fall under the exact same limitations as missiles. Why make mention of possible missile violations which were not confirmed to have been able to exceed UN limits in an oral report but choose to bury an undeclared unmanned drone that's just as suspicious and no less dangerous than the Al Samoud's distance in a large document?<br>
<br>
He doesn't have to make a &quot;big deal&quot; out of it. He needs to report his findings in his oral report. It's simple. It would have taken 45 seconds to state this undeclared drone had been found, review the intelligence UNMOVIC has receieved about Iraqi unmanned test flights exceeding the 150km limit and state that testing will need to be done on this undeclared aircraft.<br>

Given that a &quot;big deal&quot; does not need to be made about this find in the oral presentation, you contradict yourself with these 2 quotes. Ask yourself this: Why did Colin Powell not know of the find until the report was handed out hours later when he made it clear that he was going to read from this report at the security council meeting, why did Blix go a completely different route with Al Samoud missiles, why did Blix not want to state in his oral presentation that inspectors had found <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>anything</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that was undeclared by Iraq when he has done so mulitple times in his past oral presentations?<br>

No one deserves a break in matters as serious as these, Esmann. Not Hussein, not Bush, not Blix. Blix has now demonstrated clear negligence on his part.

This issue is different. The world was unaware of the drone as of this last report.<br>

However starting tomorrow the white house is going begin to press the issue hard, but til then the theory that I'm just buying into a biased media report of the situation is neither probable nor logical.<br>

<br>
Blix broke the story about the possible missile violation, not the press. You can read the archives at the UN website and cross check the dates with a google search if you wish. He said little of them but did express the concern, as far back as January(perhaps earlier?). There was no hubub at that time and the media did not get into the full swing of things until shortly after Powell's report to the UN, only reporting blurbs prior to that. There is absolutely no difference between the drone suspicion and the missile suspicion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also there were plenty of issues he addressed in his report that were not addressed in his speech.27 issues I believe my number may be wrong. here is the outrage that he didn't address the other 27 issues?(or whatever the number is)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Those 27 issues were in the hands of every UN member present during the meeting. Those 27 issues did not involve any major new discovery of a huge lethal undeclared aircraft. Those 27 issues involved requests, contradictions and requests unfulfilled, not discoveries. It's not comparable, the drone find was among a 6 page addendum which covered other areas not related to the main intention of the document, rather it was an odd stuffing of various discoveries and suspicions into a large document mainly directed at outstanding issues and cooperation.<br>
<br>
Read Blix's transcript. Colin Powell and Jack Straw also went over these issues after Blix briefly outlined them. No outrage is justified in that respect. Also in that addendum is stated suspicion that Iraq may still possess undeclared anthrax and more missiles that violate UN limits, but that was not hidden during Blix's oral report. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thing that didn't have at least half a sentence devoted to it that was mentioned in the 173 page document were the discovery of an undeclared Iraqi drone. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“It’s incredible,” a senior diplomat of Angola said regarding the discovery of the undeclared drone. “This report is going to have a clearly defined impact on the people who are wavering. It’s a biggie.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ya know about Angola? Their vote for the 2nd(err 18th) resolution was unlikely to be in favor of the US, Britain and Spain. To them, this is a big deal. What's a big deal to members of the security council deserves to be given at least a few <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>seconds</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of time during an oral presentation. You don't see anything extraordianary about this omission, but even countries that are weary of the US do, and the uproar over it by senior administration officials from US and Britain has not even started yet.<br>
<br>
His job on March 7 was not to disarm Iraq. His job on March 7 was to report the progress and issues related to the disarmement process. Because he wants inspections to continue for months more he pushed his own agenda by making light of a serious issue. He's a sly lawyer and knows how to work the people. The burying of a major discovery to understate the severity has worked at least on you.<br>

I'm assuming you mean the addendum and its contrast to the rest of the report. <br>
<br>
This is an excerpt from Jack Straws' response to Blix's oral report:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If anybody in this chamber or outside has any doubt about that conclusion, I do commend to members this so called 'clusters' report, the outstanding issues which as a member of the Commission behind UNMOVIC I've already had the privilege of reading. I have read, Dr Blix knows, all 167 pages of that report in every particular. It's a very painstaking piece of work. I thank Dr Blix for publishing it. But it's also a chilling read about the failure of Iraq to comply with successive resolutions of this Council over each day of the past 12 years. There's not been active co-operation in the matters that matter. UNMOVIC, because of that, have not been able to resolve the substantive issues outstanding from 1998.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The 167 pages, which Straw said he had read, covered cooperation and the like, basically a series of questions. It also went over, in great length and detail, Iraq's past, covering Iraq's lies and inspectors' discoveries from years ago.The 6 page addendum, which Straw was not yet aware of at the time of this response, covered UNMOVICS suspicions and speculation of undeclared, unaccounted for anthrax, warheads and the drone. It's an odd 6 pages to attach to a document covering cooperation, questions and Iraq's past.<br>
<br>
The relevant bit from Colin Powell which covers this, at the time, 167 page document:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I also welcome the compilation of outstanding issues that Dr. Blix and his staff have provided to some of us and will make available to all of us. UNMOVIC [U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] put together a solid piece of research that adds up, when one reads the entire 167 pages, adds up, fact by chilling fact, to a damning record of 12 years of lies, deception and failure to come clean on the part of Iraq.<br>
<br>
This document is in fact a catalog of 12 years of abject failure, not by the inspectors, but by Iraq. We have looked carefully at the draft given to the UNMOVIC commissioners and which will be available more widely after this meeting, and we found nearly 30 instances where Iraq refused to provide credible evidence substantiating its claims.<br>
<br>
We have counted 17 examples when the previous inspectors actually uncovered evidence contradicting Iraqi claims. We see instance after instance of Iraq lying to the previous inspectors and planting false evidence, activities which we believe are still ongoing.<br>
<br>
As you read this document, you can see page after page of how Iraq has obstructed the inspectors at nearly every turn over the years. Just by way of example, we've talked about the R-400 bombs. The report says that during the period 1992, Iraq changed its declaration on the quantity it had produced, changed the declaration several times. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And now from Blix's presentation:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Unmovic, Unscom and the Amorin Panel did valuable work to identify the disarmament issues which were still open at the end of 1998. Unmovic has used this material as starting points, but analyzed the data behind it and data and document post-1998 up to the present time to compile its own list of unresolved disarmament issues, or rather clustered issues.<br>
<br>
It is the answers to these issues which we seek through our inspection activities. And it is also from the list of these clustered issues that Unmovic will identify the key remaining disarmament tasks. As noted in the report before you, this list of clustered issues is ready.<br>
<br>
Unmovic is only required to submit the work program with the key remaining (inaudible) to the council. As I understand, several council members are interested in the working document with a complete cluster of disarmament issues. And we have declassified it and are ready to make it available to members of the council on request.<br>
<br>
In this working document, which may still be adjusted in the light of new information, members will get a more up-to-date review of the outstanding issues than in the documents of 1999, which members usually refer to.<br>
<br>
Each cluster in the working document ends with a number of points indicating what Iraq could do to solve the issue. Hence, Iraq's cooperation could be measured against a successful resolution of issues.<br>
<br>
I should note that the working document contains much information and discussion about the issues which existed at the end of 1998, including information which has come to light after '98. It contains much less information and discussion about the period after 1998, primarily because of paucity of information.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It doesn't matter how easily defended against the weapons are, it's whether they violate the resolutions or not.  Every weapon system is a stepping stone to the next more advanced model.  As for a drone being detected and intercepted, while I don't have any experience flying in other countries, I do have experience flying aircraft in this country.  I don't believe there is much of a difference, except for perhaps countries like Israeli that are on constant high alert.  If a drone was launched it would be &quot;detected&quot;, but largely ignored.  A radar controller has no ability to tell the difference between a civilian aircraft that is not in contact with ATC and a drone. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Squirt guns?  SQUIRT guns?  Oh you mean squirt guns that are loaded with Vx NERVE gas.  So why shouldn't we be using tanks against such weapons?<br>
<br>
It's apparent that you have no idea what kind of weapons we are talking about.<br>
<br>
As far as when I'd shoot someone, well I certainly wouldn't be shooting someone for simply slapping me, but I certainly would shoot someone that has pulled a knife on me, or even pulled out a squirt gun filled with a chemical agent... that is other than water.<br>
<br>
I'll question your motives whenever I find them to be in question Loegan.  If you find your stance of providing excuses to the Iraqi government to be unpatriotic, that's for you to sleep with.  I wasn't even thinking of your patriotism, I was just thinking of how sheepish you are, and liberal.  Moving the blame is something that liberals are rather good at.<br>
<br>
Comparing military weapons designed to spread chemical and biological weapons over a large area... to slapping someone in the face.  That must be the mother of all worst analogies I'd ever read.<br>
<br>
PS: Your &quot;Don't question my patriotism&quot; defense is rather old as well.<br>
<br>
PSS: You know, I'd bet good money that the Americans that went over to Iraq to be human shields feel that they are rather patriotic as well.  I'm glad they aren't here telling me off when I questioned their patriotism. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
