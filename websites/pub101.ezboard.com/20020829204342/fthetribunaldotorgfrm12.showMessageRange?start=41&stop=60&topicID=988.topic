<br>
Hihi, YOU ganked the mob from them assclown.<br>
<br>
<br>
As to the guide telling you to not engage the statue, I was there when that happened, and can tell you exactly why you didnt get it.<br>
<br>
In order to kill Statue, you have to go through vindi, who was up. Therefore, the guild that killed vindi had the right to kill statue first. Something about linear encounters I believe.<br>
<br>
Before your monk decided to have fun with vindi, there was a guide in the zone watching. Guide saw you train vindi on the sp force, then NOT attempt vindi yourselves. When sp rez'd and rebuffed, they got the kill, at which point you started moving for statue. <br>
<br>
Guide stops you. Oh, the verbal abuse to Lowyen was a nice touch, you should all be proud of yourselves. <p><div align="center"><a target =  "new" href ="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=77387"><img src="http://publish.hometown.aol.com/barraind/myhomepage/barrsigpic.jpg"></a><br>DS Ho and Dont die yo of <a target =  "new" href ="http://pub8.ezboard.com/btheelitists"> The Elitists and Vagrants </a><br>Head Paladin of <a target = "new" href ="http://pub5.ezboard.com/btribunaltrades"> Tribunal Trades </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhazewire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hazewire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/02 10:14:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> what the fuck guild is &quot;dark virtue&quot;? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uprenn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 402<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/02 10:30:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thanks for playing, Shining Path.</span><hr size=1> Wolvar.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Vindi/SoRZ incident </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Stick your head a little farther up your ass Wolvar. We didn't train SP. We got there, there were about 20ish SP in zone. we moved to right arena. We had 30ish and they had 25ish. We start buffing. SP starts buffing. SP attains 30ish while we have around  35-40. Dooks goes LD (I think it was dooks). We hold pull. SP pulls Vindi. we say no biggy, they don't have enough for statue, buff and we'll pull if they kill SoRZ.<br>
<br>
SP has petitioned in advance, Guide Loweyanewbie shows up. He states that SoRZ &amp; Vindicator are a continous spawn. Gives SP first crack at SoRZ, even though there are 40 buffed Trans waiting in right arena. SP is given little over an hour, in which they bring in 15ish more people, buff, and finally proceed to pull SoRZ. SoRZ goes down. Grats SP. Wolvar, you also notice Trans didnt come flame SP for that bullshit either. You know why? because we felt it was the GM that made an ass call.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How can you tell he meleed one of you guys first Merton ? And ...<br>
<br>
Merton&gt;Zland physically meleed at least one of us before SP got enough aggro on him to get his attention<br>
<br>
Why would they want his aggro when they according to you intentionally trained him on you guys ? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
2 seperate incidents. SP trained us, but they apparently weren't ready/meant to train us. I lean towards the 2nd option honestly. We were able to come back and buff &amp; kill zland.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Zlandicar incident </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Treefoot tells the guild Zlandicar is up. most of us were bored and in the Bazaar arena having some fun with phalanx/si/some other people. We immediately group up and port to CS. Someone says Dark Virtue is in DN. First Transcended enter DN. DV has around 3 groups in DN. About 5 minutes later, /w 'Dark Virtue' shows 2 in zone. SP bard zones in. I run to WW/SG zone to start ferrying a couple of KoS to DN. I see 10 SP in SG/WW.<br>
<br>
Trans obtains around 24 in the zone and we start moving towards lair. Someone tells the guild that DV has said they're not going for Zland. We clear down to rat tunnel, and reach the water. SP &amp; Trans both have around 30 people in zone, which is plenty for Zland, and SP starts moving in. We cross the water and buff. We move up around the left wall into the alcove prior to Zland. Start to finish up buffing. Someone sees a rogue run past us into Zland's lair. Next thing we know, Zland is on top of us. camp out non kos clerics down hall. rest of us proceed to die, as we had afk/unbuffed people and we were finishing up CoH.<br>
<br>
Clerics come back, rez us quickly, and we finish buffing as CoH closes. At this point there are about 35 Trans in zone, and around 45 SP. Wildien calls engagement in 10 seconds. Vanadin turns corner for run into Zland's room for positioning. From the hallway towards the Waterfall, SP appears. For people that don't know, Zlandicar is a line of sight dragon. if hes facing the hallway and sees kos cross his LoS, he will agro. Charges out of room and attacks Transcended (using melee). We respond and attack Zland. SP opens up with nukes and Zlandicar runs from us to SP. Massive LD on both side from 90+ in DN. Zlandicar GATES (roflmfao, sad that 2 guilds couldn't prevent him from gating) and I am the first to run back into his lair as my group of rogues dies. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I engage, as Trans/SP come into lair. I die, and a Transcended group locks corpse.<br>
<br>
All Droppables looted, Dar Brood Talisman is awarded, rest of loot is awarded. SP rezzes by waterfall, Trans rezzes in Lair. SP filters out of DN. Thinkness logs on and tells us SoRZ is up. We group up and port to WL. Someone says there are 12 SP in Kael &amp; another 17 in WL, with 15 trans in WL and 7 or so in Kael. We zone into kael, to find that REQUIEM is already in arena, attempting vindi/SoRZ.<br>
<br>
Guide, who monitored the Zlandicar fight (btw, we WERE first to engage, otherwise guide would have awarded it to SP) tells us to zone out of Kael and let SP fool with Statue. Most of Trans doesn't care, and some hear HoT is open and head there. Imo, if anyone deserved first chance on Vindi/SoRZ, it would have been requiem. I'm not sure who got it, as I logged for the night.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Lejina, it wasn't pulled thru them. Zlandicar aggro'd SP's raid force early and rushed SP while they were rushing through Transcended's medding force. They got hit with AE. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Wolvar, just one question. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW? You weren't there, fuck, I don't even think you have an idea of what Zland/SoRZ is like. You know exactly jack shit about both of these situations, yet you come here and jump on Transcended because you dislike Merton/Est/Me/The guild as a whole. When you kill Zlandicar or SoRZ, or show me on my logs that you were in zone at both of these incidents, then something you say might be worth more than the 2 cents your mom gets for turning tricks.<br>
<br>
Barr: Transcended monks there were Quaichin, Dooks, and Merton. No one Trans fucking trained SP, at least 2 members of SP have told me theirselves.<br>
<br>
I have never had a problem with SP, and I like a number of the people in the guild, but I'm fucking torn when events like this happened. I'd rather have Trans OR SP get these mobs cleanly before the other even knew they were up, just to prevent clusterfucks like this.<br>
<br>
That is what happened, to the best of my abilities to recall the Events. I would like to hope that my word holds enough value that I don't have to pull out logfiles of last night. Of course, even then people would just argue that they could be doctored. <p><HR>

<br>
Something else you'd be surprised at, is that SP DIDN&quot;T train Transcended.  Your own people did.  Not only once, but twice.  Doesn't matter tho, it's not like you guys are ever willing to admit when yer  wrong.  Keep spinning fairy tales, I know the truth and so do many others.<br>
<br>
Bottom line here is that SP engaged first and your whole guild knows that, not that they care in the least, obviously.  Totally lame, totally expected.<br>
<br>
Not gonna debate the Kael issue because I got that information from a Guide and I'm not sure if it was firsthand.  However, I'm hardly gonna believe Aeadin's story about Kael over a Guide's after listening to this complete bullshit about Zlandicar.<br>
<br>
Gratz on yet another KS guys.  You guys are leet fucktards aincha?<br>

Wolvar: The man of many disguises, the man of many faces.  Is it Val Kilmer's &quot;The Saint&quot;?  Or is it CarrotTop?  <br>
<br>
I know I am surprised that you know your head from your ass.  I'm sure you're surprised as well.<br>
<br>
You are probably referring to Mindee who was there.  But unless you were playing Mindee and I dont think you were - then you'd you would have to be playing either a Trans or a SP member!<br>
<br>
Uh oh!  Crazy mishaps ensue, like a bad Three's Company episode!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Or maybe you are just talking out of your fucking ass as always.<br>
<br>
<br>

Oct:  There is no corpse locking feature per se.  Transcended group got the xp on the kill and promptly dropped the knee on it.  And held it there, as loot was quickly rattled off, droppables were looted, and the no drop stuff was quickly decided on.<br>
<br>
Cause after having our asses hugged, trained and leapfrogged - I wouldn't put it past SP to try and ninja loot the corpse for an encore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoctraculapinkerton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Octracula Pinkerton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 907<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/4/02 12:51:21 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bullshitjob.com/officespace/peter.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Damn, and for a sec I actually thought that VI had finally smartened up and put in /corpselock (groupleader only, locks looting rights to targetted corpse that the group has got exp on) and /lootrights ~name~ transfers looting rights to named person.<br>
<br>
Or just put in /lootrights and make all corpses unlootable by people that didnt get exp. Of course that would lead to a mess when on a raid groupleader goes LD after they get exp, and nobody can loot.<br>
<br>
Still, something like that has to be implemented. <p><center><img src=http://www.hellfire.com/versus/images/chocula.gif </center>
