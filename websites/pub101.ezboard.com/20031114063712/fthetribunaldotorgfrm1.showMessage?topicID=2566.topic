Not really anyones fault and I am not pointing fingers here, I just basically outgrew them.<br>
<br>
So I did some research on my own, as to what guild suits me, my play style, and my schedule.  I came up with one, applied, but unfortunately they have no need for a 62 Shaman with &quot;only&quot; 18 AAs, not enough pieces to the VT or emp key, and only limited flags.  <br>
<br>
Fine, so be it.....<br>
<br>
My conflict lies herein, I am a social butterfly, not having a guild to yak at, other peoples convos to spy on and/or requests for help to fullfill I found playing Kul as boring as watching a baseball game on TV.  So I retired Kul, and started playing my lvl 40 warrior, problem with him is, he ain;t guilded either, and when I find xp groups for him, I end up in groups of noobs (yes REAL-LIFE, first character, playing for 6 omnths or less NOOBS) and honestly, I can't tolerate them or killing in the same zones and putting up with the same crap I went through 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
SO what do I do? <br>
<br>
I went to Rallos Zek, started a bard, hes lvl 25 now, but MAN, that server SUX - the idea would be to PL his ass(on my own) to 50+ but you die so often and lose so much damn gear, that lvling fast over there is outta the question.<br>
<br>
SO............ log Kul back in, problem is, I don't like XPing, and even if I did XP, the silence of no /gu would kill me.  so I guess I am looking for a guild again.  All my reasearch led me to believe that none (that need a shaman) are right for me, but I may be wrong.<br>
<br>
Here is what I am looking for:<br>
<br>
Raiding guild(without a whip): Ssra, NToV, ST, CoD, Tactics or better, are the targets I am looking for.<br>
<br>
Loot system: could care less, I am happy with my gear.  I raid cause thats whats fun about the game for me.  Nothing else.<br>
<br>
Raiding times: 9AMpst to 4PMpst and 7PMpst to midnight.  Either or would do , but thats when I can play at this time, most likely the nights will disappear and I will be only available to login during the day.(but thats not certain)<br>
<br>
Raiding Policies: <br>
-These I am very picky about.<br>
-If you are online, and will be for the next hour + then you come to the raid, no questions(just let the raid leaders  know if you have to leave early) .This is an acceptable policy for me.<br>
-If we schedule a raid/kill, then you better damnwell login for it or you are gone. This is unacceptable to me.<br>
-If you are online, and don't feel like coming or feel like playing an alt: Go for it.  This is also unacceptable for me.<br>
-If you are online and questing or assisting a friend with something that you had to work your way into (maybe a single group plane bust in for an epic piece or RoF or something) than finish it, and then get your butt to the raid. This is also acceptable to me.<br>
-If you are at a raid and don't feel we have the force, or just don't feel like playing anymore - go ahead and leave without checking with the raid leader. This is also unacceptable to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Treatment of others both in guild and out.  I need a comfortable place to spend 10-14 hours of my day so in-fighting in /gu and foul language for the sake of foul language is totally unaccepltable to me. I mean bitching that you missed a spawn in/gu is only gonna piss off everyone and is useless right?  saying WTF or Holy SHit I just Crit for 200(if your a pally that gets you excited) is fine and dandy with me.<br>
<br>
As far as treatment of others goes: Getting into spawn and zone fights at this level of the game and with this many spawns and mobs avaialble is absolutely ignorant and I won't be a part of it, so if your guild makes a habit of getting into it with other guilds, mob hopping, causing wipes, mem-wiping mobs etc etc, I am not for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like I said at the top, my own research led me to believe there were no guilds that suited these requirements, save one, and they don't need me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So, if this is your guild and ya'll need a shammy, let me know, I am chomping at the bit to get back in the game.<br>

<br>
as a recruitment officer of a raiding guild... even if we &quot;close&quot; recruitment for a class, if you take the time to get to know us, and attend raids with us for fun... magically a door can open.<br>
<br>
also, with a raiding guild.. really the guilds gotta come first. without a damn good reason for not being at a raid, in particular if you're a needed class, i label you in my mind as a raid dodger. do this a few times and youll end up paying the concequences for it. its part of being in a strict raiding type guild. you get the raiding experience from it, loots, see new zones whatever... and whats it cost you? loyalty first to your guild, and your time.<br>
<br>
i know your playtimes dont match up with dv at all, we're pst-late pst. sigh i could be wrong but id suggest looking into sp and da, possibly rng but i suspect they've got enough shamen. maybe even legendary if your timezone matches up there more. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.darkvirtue.org" target="top">[<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.iinet.net.au/~arc/pictures/ezboard/kowie.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kulvinnawazzentme>Kulvinna Wazzentme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Respect, Honour and Above <br>All Else Don't Steal My<br>Captain's Camp</span><br>  Posts: 546<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 7:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> thx for the advice Kodimoo. Great reply, but here's somehting for all you recruitment types for your guilds to consider: what's a lvl 65 shammy with lvl 62 spells? a 62 shammy <br>
<br>
This is my dilemna, I can only get specs and runes in one place - BoT, so as you know chance of getting a named or tower boss kill is slim and none, so getting 65 with no chance of getting spells till I get into a guild that kills grummus-the behemoth and AD to gain me access to more places where I can acquire the spells I require is sorta foolish, not to mention, asking a 62 guildless shaman to get 65 just for the sake of getting levels is pretty foolish in itself.  <br>
<br>
Like you said getting 65 is easy, and really I could do it in about a week, if I so chose to, but workin on AAs, that have an immidiate payoff now(and prove a MUCH greater use to any guild), and worrying about getting levels when you have access to get the spells that go with the levels makes a little more sense to me.  PLz explain to me the reasons for the desire for a 65? the difference between a 62 shaman with all spells to that point and a 65 shaman with all 62 spells is like the difference between a lvl 10 warrior and a lvl 10 shaman, negligible. <p>Kulvinna of the nexus - Oracle - Tribunal</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nitzen>Nitzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 8:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> I agree with kodim<br>
<br>
65 is the way to go. You agree it will take you a week max to get it and the percieved diffrence of 62 to 65 is huge. Specs are very easy to get. In fact I have 20ish on me most days. Runes are still rare but thats only 1 lvl of spells you will be missing.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of casual guilds that raid and aren't the #1 guild of E/V, but I suggest you look for a guild of people that you connect with. Grouping in high level zones can make you some friends and that would be the best way to get into a good guild you could call home <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeydee>Jaeydee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 8:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>what's a lvl 65 shammy with lvl 62 spells? a 62 shammy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have to disagree with that.  You only have your 62 spells now...get the lvls and the guild you get into will help you get the spells sooner or later.  Levels mean a lot.  Fewer slow resists, bigger mana pool, more hp etc etc.  I'm lvl 65 and have none of my 65 spells.  I'll get them in time, but I got 65...so now I have more chances to get runes when they drop.<br>
<br>
So, no, asking someone to get to 65 is not very foolish at all.  Whichever guild you decide to go with just might have those spells sitting in the bank just waiting to be scribed. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=226786">Venerable Jaeydee</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Prophet of the<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://kot.jellopit.com">Knights of the Tribunal</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bagazanlfgorafk>BagazanLFGorAFK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 9:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> Jaeydee is right.  With level 65 you'll get much fewer resists on virtually every mob(ie, won't need to malo some the ones you usually need to malo now).  You'll have more HP, More mana, more chances to resist 'X' AE, etc.<br>
<br>
Getting into BoT isn't very hard at all, hell, if you have the right people you can one group the entire quest in about 1-3 hours.<br>
<br>
Your perception of where runes drop though is kind of jaded.  I have never seen a rune drop in HoH.  And I have also yet to see any runes drop in CoD.  Tactics you used to be able to get 1-3 runes an hour in the right spot, but VI ninja-nerfed that pretty quickly so you might see one every 10 hours now(my experiance).  By far the best place for an exp group in tier 3 would be BoT, but not off the tower bosses.  The wing bosses(one groupable) can drop runes/specs/loot, and those would be your best bet.<br>

But ya, if you want to find a raiding guild, definitly get 65, then AA's, then start trying to farm for specs/runes.  Like I/Jaeydee mentioned, you get more HP, Mana, resists, more likely to resist AE's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sciekspellbottler>Sciek Spellbottler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 9:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2566.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am conflicted, plz help or make some suggestions</span><hr size=1> There are rune droppers in HoH but you're not likely to be killing them with a single group...

spells schmells. i dislike guilding anyone not 65, and gripe at guilding 63-65 even though thats the levels we kinda aim at. with higher levels youll have more mana, less resists.. all the stuff mentioned by the above posters. aside from that, i want my guild average at 65. no less. we are at around 64.8, and it looks pretty cool. cant wait for 65. youll get more group invites at 65 also. as for specs and such...<br>
<br>
i guess it may depend what guild you are in, but in dv.. officers take all parches, and atthe end of the day we have oh, shit i lost where i was up to.. stupid aim message. at the end of the day we have 4 or 5 runes, the same or more specs, and a bunch of etherals. we discuss between us which people need their spells. we do this to ensure we have at least a few copies of each type. brells, bo9, hov etc. after we have the spells in the hands of the most active people from each class, we usuallty get a few backup copies.. and then it just gets to the point where everyone is getting their spells. almost at the point where we only need runes. as you can see... if you want your parches, join a guild and play a lot, work for them, be part of the guild. theyll fall your way eventually when you level. we dont give parches to people who dont have the levels to go with them. kinda like we dont aim to get a group spell like bo9 if someone doesnt have mgb. do the work first :&gt;<br>
<br>
its a circular thing. if you want to raid, you need a guild. to join a guild, you need levels, you wont level till you have spells.. and to get spells reliably, you need a guild. solution? level <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
and gah dont do aas. complete trash. turn the evil things off till 65, and then get some aas, not before. unless you're a rogue or somesuch and get a class defining ability like shrowd of stealth.<br>

Get 65 and the rest will follow.  You seem willing to XP grind for AA's anyway and AA's dont come any faster at 62 then they will at 65 and once 65 that's one less hurdle to leap.<br>
<br>
Spectrals drop like candy in BoT so if that's where you're playing then sooner or later you'll have all your 63-64 spells.  The Bazaar and fellow shammies can also be a great source for spells if you don't mind spending some coin.  Once you do find a guild that you accept or accepts you, you'll probably find yet another source for spells within and find that your spell book is full in no time.<br>
<br>
If you do find a guild you like, be prepared to work your butt off for a week or two (with your posted play time should be easy) to meet the requirements.  Then play with them, get to know them and like someone above posted, a closed door can magically open if enough of the guild members take a liking to you.  Don't just post on the recruit page, &quot;waaa, poor me, I guess you just don't need me&quot; and sulk off, not a good first impression for those that don't know you.<br>
<br>
In the mean time learn PoP zones and necessary mobs for flagging.  Alot of the lower mobs (Grummus, AD, MB) can often be tagged along on if you have a friend or two in a guild since most guilds killing these mobs no longer need to flag a full raid, and by tagging along you just may get to know a few more people in that guild.<br>
<br>
So... get your level, get some flags and/or keys, make friends the old fashioned way and everything else will come to you. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=430768" target="top">Krokk Tamer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

and I already had a chat with the poster of my new nickname.   SHe had no idea how bad she was burning me, and we good.   But yeah Witzo, you hit the nail on the head, I figure since this is the first time I have been guildless in about 3 years of playing, and it seems all  guilds get jealous when a player has the &quot;audacity&quot; to apply for more than one guild (at their page) at a time.  So I sat down, made up a list of what I want from a guild, and yes considering I am choosing a guild not vis versa I can do that, and thought I'd post it here.   The funny thing is the tells I get now in regards to this post.<br>
<br>
I have recieved tells from ex-guildies saying I burned them by putting this up, but that was not my purpose at all, just that things I experienced while a member there I personally don't want to have to go through again. <br>
<br>
I have recieved tells from lower lvl players telling me I have no right to &quot;demand&quot; that from a guild. I am not demanding anything, most guilds offer what I am after, i just thought this was an easier place to gather information than independantly from 10 differetn guild websites.  BTW - Dark virtue your website isn't listed here.<br>
<br>
I have recieved tells from many member of high level guilds with suggestions of particular guilds that offer what I am looking for, and to those people - thank you. That's the kind of feedback I am looking for.<br>
<br>
I mean really - I think there should be a &quot;looking for guild&quot; forum here at the boards.  You think about it.   At the moment, there is no place for a member LFGuild to gather info about all guilds and display what they have to offer to a guild in one place.   I mean - why are those that are guildless the ones that have to do all the legwork.  wouldn' it be easier for people to come here put up a post that says:<br>
<br>
<br>
______________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
62 shaman looking for raiding guild that plays PST evenings and is also available for daytime 10-4 raiding.  I have been playing this character (almost exclusively) for 3 years and have over 150 days of experience.  I am a dedicated guild member who believes in respect to all and honesty and honor before all else.  I will not join a guild that is into creating conflict with others on the server or that is militaristic to a fault in policing member activities and/or raid attendance but IS interested in a guild that raids alot and has an unwritten policy of raid attendance. <br>
<br>
At the moment I am working on Cann5-MGB-and attaining lvl 65, I am also attempting to complete emp/VT keys as best I can not being in a guild.<br>
<br>
I currently hold PoV-PoS-BoT(+tower) flags - Seb-HS- and am trak tooth away frmo VP key.<br>
<br>
Always willing to raid - /tell me if you want me to come out to a raid as a trial member to get to know each other better.<br>
<br>
______________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
And then recruitment officers just come here - check out whos LFGuild, talk about the classes they need and the particular applicants amongst each other and invite those they want along ro their events.  There would be no animosity about - but you applied to them first, or you applied to 10 other guilds as well. there would be no need for retraction of application at 8 boards after one guild accepts yuou, no need to &quot;defend&quot; your reasoning for applying to E-V and the Comps at the same time.<br>
<br>
I think this is a good idea.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways -- still looking for the right fix - see ya in Norrath - or the planes - or the moon - damnit all to hell see ya in-game.<br>

i think recruiters assume that you have been doing your homework and that you haven't made the decision lightly. if you have reached the point of officially requesting trial tag, it is assumed that you already have good friends in the &quot;family&quot; and have a reasonable understanding of the guild's culture. by applying to several guilds, you implicitly admit that all but one are &quot;not your first choice&quot; and that you aren't fully commited to give your best to the guild you really want to join. that's the reasoning that Companions recruiters used to practice. <br>
