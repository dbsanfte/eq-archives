Coaches don't win games imo...players do...coaches help make teams not lose..if you understand my meaning.<br>
<br>
A coach ..or a good coach will teach his team how to not lose.It is up to the players to execute what is taught..therefore winning is up to the players, unless the players suck ass.<br>
<br>
Any coach in the NFL can teach...at least they better be able to.Then again..I probably don't know what the fuck I am talking about.I live in Pittsburgh..so if you want Bill Cowher..you can have him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Gruden seemed to know what he was doing, and that team had some good players.He isn't going to a gimp team.Tampa has got some good players as well, it is just too bad they fired Tony Dungee because he is one hell of a coach and person.Wish the Steelers would have hired him as there head coach..dumb fuckers.<br>

I couldn't disagree more.  Especially considering what happened in this past super bowl.  The patriots, with bottom of the league talent won due to exceptional coaching.<br>
<br>
The rams, as the opposite extreme, with more talent than anyone else, lost because their coach's ego would not allow them to run the ball.<br>
<br>
In summary:<br>
Good coaching, average talent = win<br>
Bad coaching, great talent = lose<br>

<br>
Coaches have significant effect on teams.<br>
<br>
I liked Tony Dungy, I am fucking huge Tampa Bay Fan, GO MIKE ALSTOTT....but Tony Dungy is pure defensive, grind out the ball coach, he is built Tampa like the Ravens, a team that wins by defense preventing you from scoring and hoping they force you turn it over more so they can get more attempts to score. Once Tampa Bay or Baltimore or teams like that are piled under a few touchdowns, they wont come back, they arent built for it, and that is where the coach comes in, the coach effects how the team moves, what plays it picks.<br>
<br>
Dumai actually made a good point<br>
<br>
Bellichick from the Pats is considered a Defensive Genius, where as Martz is an offensive genius, Bellichick is known for his schemes that take one player out of the game completely, ( Marshall Faulk ), the coach won the superbowl for the Pats, the pats are a good team, no one gives them enough credit, but they werent super, it was good planning, good coaching.<br>
<br>
Gruden is a great coach, but all you raiders fan must know how much of a pain in the ass Al Davis is, seriously, hes an ass to work for, plus the NFL doesnt like Al Davis thus you wont see the Raiders win a superbowl for a LONG TIME ( opps that was a forward pass, not a fumble )<br>
<br>
I cannot wait to see what he does to revamp Tampa, they have a great defense that gets lazy, their offense is sub par, because Tony Dungee only went for plays under 15 yards, so I hope *Chucky* can change that.<br>
<br>
The Team to look for next year is the colts, Tony Dungy = Defense, the Colts are nothing but Offense ( Manning, James, Harrison, Pollard and a killer offensive line ), add a defensive coach, and you got a well balanced team....<br>
<br>
<br>
And the only reason they went after Gruden is because at the last minute Bill Parcells who was going to go to Bucs pulled out, there was also the rumor that the bucs were gonna be sold to friends of Steve Spurrier and he was gonna go there, but hey, Bucs screwed themselves <br>

Raiders fans are the first to acknowledge Davis as the anti-Christ, trust me, it is with him that my initial upset began (which was posted on my guild board in more detail.)  I do fear his constant lack of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> team first</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ownership as getting in the way of their success as a team.<br>
<br>
Also, on a seperate note Bill Parcels just is NOT all that.  His little traipse to NE then the Jets was enough to show us that he was not the SuperCoach they were making him out to be back with the Giants.  He was a decent coach nothing more, nothing less.  He is better suited for the polictics involved with the owners and ball clubs, than coaching imo.<br>

IMO hes the greatest coach of the modern era.  Took new england and the jets, two teams who  had pathetic records before him to the superbowl and the afc championship game respectively in 3 years as both teams coach.  The man has the best eye for talent in football.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the deal with Gruden was actually a financial decision in a way.   Gruden had only 2 years max left in oakland after that it was a strong possibility that he was going to end up in San fransisco, Oaklands competitor in their region for ticket sales and merchandise.  San fran has been dominating this aspect for over 10 years and Davis is looking to change that.  The drama between san fran and their coach mariucci (sp)  still continues and there was even talk of them going after gruden after next year.   Davis got wind of this and it appears decided to cash in on grudens popularity as a coach and ship him off across country before san fran had the chance to get thier hands on him.  <br>
San fransisco success means less money flowing into oakland.  Tis a fact.   Davis just decided to sabatoge this a little.<br>
<br>
A lot more goes on in the NFL that has nothing to do with X's and O's.

Too much talent on that team and they really found thier defense this year.  Although it does seem a few chinks have finally been found in the offences armor.<br>
<br>
The Afc still looks wide open to me although from what I have read Baltimore may lose a lot of people to free agency and retirement (/cry farewell Goose).  The colts could make a strong resurgance.   My heart still hopes to see the Steelers back on top or the Dolphins.  My money is still on the steelers, although If they could play like they did in their last 2 games I dont see anyone knocking off the Pats. I have always been a strong fan of defensive football and I was really impressed by them at the end of the season.<br>

Secondly Serpento, get a clue. Coaches make or break talented teams. Parcells coaching performance in the Giants victory over the Buffalo Bills in an of itself was mastery. Another example of maximum results from mediocre talent. That Bill team was head and shoulders, more talented than the Giants.

Patriots defense is underrated and always will be , They play a bend don't break style, willing to give up yards but not the ones that matter....(example ~ look up how many rushing touches they gave up all year including Playoffs)<br>
<br>
The reason the Rams lost is N.E.'s defense hit and Rams recievers are SOFT.  People said it all year and Im saying it again...<br>
