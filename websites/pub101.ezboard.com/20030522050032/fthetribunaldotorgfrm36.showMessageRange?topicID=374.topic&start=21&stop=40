To actuate the windshield washers, you must PULL TOWARD YOU on the stalk. This proper procedure should be done preferrably before telling the service guy your washers dont work.<br>

SAP may be a German company, but where do you think it's consumer base is?<br>
<br>
There is no import tax on IT services and there should be for the same reasons there are import taxes on every other product from other countries.  You cannot have a free market and true capitalism when you are speaking of different countries, different monetary values and different costs of living.<br>
<br>
Sure it makes perfect sense for the company, but there comes a time that if it makes sense for the company yet damages the country that provides for it that something needs to change.<br>
<br>
Foreign countries have long sense taken over most mass production markets and the American job market has long since shifted from mass production type jobs to IT.  Let's let the other countries take all the IT positions and then we won't have any money to buy their products, yeah that's real smart.<br>
<br>
Some of you are too worried about being politically correct to other countries to stop and see the objective impact of this.

<br>
About the China products = China government. Well thats not the case at all. Almost all the  companies that produce exports are privately owned. Naturally the Chinese government benefits when their population gains in spending power but thats an indirect link, they dont own the companies. <br>
Not buying Chinese isnt going to change the governments policies while buying Chinese products and making China`s Economy more dependent of the rest of the world makes it more likely their policies will reflect the concerns of the rest of the world, opposite to the time when their Economy was largely self reliant.<br>
<br>
This thread has been quite informative for me, when I started the thread I supposed Americans didnt buy Chinese because they thought the products were infirior, now I understand it is more a moral issue. <br>

<br>
And just how private are those Chinese enterprises?  I know they've privatized to some extent, but I know that the Party still retains control over the essential elements.  If you could provide some links or evidence about the Chinese economy and its development away from Communism I might be more convinced, but to my knowledge, the privatization they employ over there is simply giving entrepeneurs license to do business and thus tap into the profit motive, while the Party retains the final say in important company decisions and, as always, anything that happens in China.<br>
<br>
As for the poor Indonesian people or whatnot, one can apply the same logic as always to the sweatshop protesters.  The conditions suck, but they probably wouldn't be working there if it wasn't the best deal they have.  The problem is sweatshops taking advantage of a poor third world economy.  Such industries probably provide some of the only development the area sees, and even if they pay poorly, its more money than they'll get from subsistence farming.  Anyway, it's a whole nother cat... argue about the morality of it til you're blue in the face, but it still can't come close to the massively systematic oppression of billions of people. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

<br>
As you might know Chinese state industries are extremely inefficient and largely to blame for the huge amount of bad loans held by Chinese banks. These state industries traditionally produce products that helped China be a self-sufficient economy. They dont produce products for exports except for a handfull that has been turned around by smart managers. Most of the management of Chinese state companies are as corrupt as you can get and pocket all the funds they can lay their hands on instead of using those funds to make their factories more efficcient.<br>
<br>
On the other hand you have the Japanese and especially the Hong Kong and Taiwanese businessman. In the 50-80ies the products that now come from mainland China mainly came from these countries. As they shifted from manufacturing to service based economies the factories that were originally in these countries were moved to the Mainland (esp. Pearl river delta) The financial, marketing and sales departments of these companies are still located in HK, Taiwan and Japan but the actual manufaturing happens in the mainland. Hong Kong owned companies for instance employ more then 25% of the total population in the pearl river delta. The area in China that is responsible for about 70&amp; of all Chinese exports and that contains the 3 Chinese cities with the highest per capita GDP. <br>
<br>
Logically all these foreign businessman wouldnt build any factories in China if the Chinese government made the business decisions or any other decision regarding their investment. The huge amount of FDI that has been flowing into China year by year isnt used to build factories that will be taken over by the mainland government once they start producing their products.<br>
<br>
The chance is therefore very small that any product you buy that says Made in China is made in a state controlled factory. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 487<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/03 7:52:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I know that the privatized factories are managed and run by Chinese businessmen.  Otherwise they would not be private, and would run into the same problem of corruption etc. as the public ones.  I understand everything you posted already =)<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is, the businesses are still not free from Chinese control.  If someone wants to start a business, they can't just go out and do so - the Party must approve it.  The Party keeps its watchful eye on what they produce, where it goes, etc.  I'd be willing to bet that the people who are actually given permission to have their own private businesses are high ranking in or have high connections with the Party anyway.  All it means is that there is slightly more economic freedom - which isn't saying much in a Communist state.  Individual people can make personal profits to a greater degree than almost any other Communist system, and the only reason the Chinese allow it is... drumroll... because it benefits China.  They watched the USSR and East Europe; they know the situation in their own country.  They know how to make a nation profitable, and its not through central planning.  So they let slip the reins a little... just a little... enough to make the country more prosperous while keeping a choke hold on it in every other regard.<br>
<br>
Now ask yourself... where does the money that this increased prosperity go anyway?  If you're critical of U.S. corporations and their greediness, what about Communist governments?  I doubt the workers see any of it, while the Party men live like sybarites.<br>
<br>
Point is, the whole thing still stinks to me.  And until/unless I buy into the freedom through economic progress idea, all the semi-privatization of China means is that the Party is willing to give up small portions of power in order to increase its power overall through greater prosperity.  It's the same cynical, oppressive, power-hungry regime as always.<br>
<br>
PS - apparently the Chinese Communist Party doesn't buy into it either... they learned the lesson of the USSR well, I think, and are keeping a tight rein on personal freedom while loosening economic, the relative opposite of Soviet policy in the 80s.  If the primary cause of the massive uprisings in E. Europe and the USSR was the blatantly low standards of living, China can keep its head above water by repressing the people, keeping them ignorant, while being prosperous enough to keep the standard of living steady or on a marginal rise... <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

Also more and more companies are building factories there (ok i learned that some time ago, ok sorry i'll have to check hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) because China is a huge market to conquer, and really, i don't think that this country's  human rights violations cause much scruple to them (the companies).<br>
<br>
I'd like to have an answer about this : would such companies go there if they can't lead it the way they want? Of course they can't do everything they could do in western countries... but... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6258" target="&quot;_blank&quot;">Erlaak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, Grave Lord.<br>

It's sort of like in the Great Depression - everyone wants a job, there's only a few available, and the employer can pay a few cents an hour because if one person quits over the unfairness of it all, there's 30 waiting to take his place.  It's unfortunate and sad, I don't deny that.  The solution, however, is not to impose some sort of world-wide regulatory system forcing companies to pay more.  The solution is to figure out how the country can be developed, how the nation can rid itself of its often destabilizing and corrupt government (which is so often to blame for the maintenece of poverty), how it can become more sophisticated... how the workforce can become more educated and obtain better jobs, or unionize and demand better wages.  So then the sweatshops leave town and go somewhere else with cheaper labor... but so what?  Now the nation has something better.<br>
<br>
I make it sound simple; I know it's not.  I don't want to start a discussion of 3rd world poverty right now though, at least in this thread.  I think I've made my point re: China.  =)<br>
<br>
PS - before, they had a choice between a rotten potato and a rotten rice paddy... the work week?  You mean they weren't working their ass of every waking moment before?  Life is incredibly hard over there.  Our corporations just take advantage of that.  You simply can't apply U.S. or European standards in a place where the standards are intrinsically so different.  We can hope for improved standards... we can encourage them... but to attempt impose or superimpose our own upon them accomplishes nothing.  If you told a Thai peasant that he should only have to work 8 hours a day, he wouldn't have a clue what you were talking about.  He might think, &quot;Wow, that would be great&quot;... but it's simply not within the realm of reality for him, with or without sweatshops.<br>

Sure, the Big Bad American Company COULD be paying a union guy in Tennesee $18/hr to do it, instead - or a mexican guy $5/hr (thx NAFTA) - but seems to me everyone wins in this situation.<br>

Except the union guy.<br>

Sure, some conditions are wrong (where the indonesian country with the Nike contract then uses forced child labor to fulfill it) - but is that Nike's responsibility in the end?  Yes and no.  Tougher issue.<br>

This is why proposals such as constantly raising minimum wage more than the inflation rate, and constant union strikes for better pay, can be so dangerous.  Moving your operation to another country is a very expensive thing to do... but when it even that huge cost is offset by the fact that remaining in the U.S. means ever increasing labor costs, it becomes worthwhile.  On the other hand, maybe without artificially heightened wages, they would stay in the U.S... everyone expects to be able to have a middle class lifestyle, even if all they do is manual labor, and they expect government regulation and big unions to enforce it for them... then they complain when businesses go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
You do run into problems, of course... minimum wage is, to an extent, a good thing.  Companies shouldn't abuse their employees; they should get living wages.  Of course, people have different definitions of this.  Mine is &quot;roof over your head and food in your stomach&quot;.  A lot of Democrats seem to think that its having a nice house or apartment, complete health care coverage, TV set, nice furniture, etc. etc...  Anyway, this is part of my and Tuwene's earlier argument too - in a nation where nobody hardly even has money at all, the little bit they earn is a lot to them, and is in fact living wages.<br>
<br>
But when you start artificially raising wages and messing with the market, you get unintended consequences... like lost jobs.  Then the strikeaholic union workers don't get paid at all. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>
