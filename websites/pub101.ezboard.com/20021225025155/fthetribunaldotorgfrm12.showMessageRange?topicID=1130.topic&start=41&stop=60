<br>
<br>
in response to your first point, Valsio and Pluff were not legendary wizards paird up in the same group to get xp? Not what I was told in tells, but hey, maybe I am wrong, and I will even concede this to ya no point in arguing it )<br>
<br>
In regards to strategy? Hrmm guess you havnt ever done much strategy for Kunark dragons(ala hoshkar), or even Sont. Anyone who has will inform you of how the strats were similar. But it boils down to, a dragon with high damage output/nasty ae, but low hp... you kill it fast, it needs to hit 0hp before you do =) I never said it was rocket science, hell most of eq isnt rocket science. The hardest thing is organization, and I organized the people with me, which is what I claimed to do. <br>
<br>
Also, for your third point, reading comprehension seems to be a bit beyond your abilities. I didnt say we WERE the force, I said the people I organized were considered a force, an entity as you will as a single guild would be. Which is why the GM said it was ours to deal with, because our &quot;force&quot; got the xp on a mob our &quot;force&quot; engaged. Had they been 30-35ish but all companions, then replace the word force with guild, but its the same thing. Basic concept really.<br>
<br>
You claimed several times that we couldn't of gotten xp actually, even stating at one point that GM mobs dont give xp. When I responded we that we even got the &quot;you have gained experience&quot; in bright yellow, your next line was &quot;bullshit&quot;. <br>
<br>
and I am still unable to comprehend how the belt was 'ninjad' spell that train of thought out for me, real clear and technical like =) <p><br><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22676" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://4.65.47.107/mandosig4.jpg" border="0"></a>

No more than the one you were in Mando.<br>
<br>
It's so funny how you admit here you made a KS group, and you wanted to control who got loot...then you accuse us of doing it like it was such a piece of shit thing to do.<br>
<br>
We all wanted to form a KS group for second dragon so we could lock the corpse and let loot be decided fairly considering ALL that were involved.  Not just the people who were there sucking your dick.<br>
<br>
And Serpento's take on what happened really loses validity when he says I wasn't even there...that's fucking priceless (see my post about him needing to answer everything with &quot;Liar, Liar, Pants on fire&quot;) when I was the one shouting for everyone to stop bitching about loot and kill the 2nd Dragon...guess that makes me a 'Legendary' Loot whore right&gt;??<br>
<br>
Cracks me up how you all gotta bring Guilds into this...I didn't start this out by Flaming Comps did I??? No I had no reason to.  I didn't start this out by Flaming Transcended did I?? No  I had no reason to.  But here we go Flaming Legendary again.  <br>
<br>
I guess it's a good tactic when you have no basis for arguement to just flame someone based on thier guild tag.  <br>
<br>
In the beginning I wasn't even flaming you Mando...even said that in 1st post.  You did a Great job organizing, and even though many feel you had no right to decide who got the loot...you weren't the one that looted the item.<br>
<br>
No this was about Sylie...who knew there were plenty of Rogues there besides herself who would have loved the belt...but she managed to get in a KS group so she had the ability to ninja it without consideration for others...and she did just that.  Kinda shocking she would screw poeple over for something that is supposedly &quot;Trivial&quot; loot for Transcended...speaks volumes about the person behind the toon. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106>My Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaeadiinswordsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeadiin Swordsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/28/02 7:26:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New PoMS</span><hr size=1> &quot;first chapter of Idiots Guide to Zerging.&quot;<br>

&quot;but she managed to get in a KS group so she had the ability to ninja it without consideration for others...and she did just that.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you read anything Mando has said... she wasn't even in the kill group.<br>
<br>
And when's the last time any of you fucks believed something Merton said, why'd you start now? I'm trying to think of a belt that compares to that. Bile Etched? Dain Belt? Girdle of Dark Power? Windraider's Belt? Welp, srry, we haven't killed dain/zlexak yet frnd. And we havent gotten a Dark Power girdle yet either. We've gotten 2 bile etched chokers. You think a rogue is gonna get one over a more tank oriented melee, then maybe you should go back to your 1st/2nd/3rd tier rolling system, Eh fuckwad?<br>
<br>
No... the  only reason this was mentioned is because Legendary still has a hard on for Slyie cuz they claim she trained them. jesus, that was a month ago, You guys are in the rotation now, and she didn't even train you on purpose. When are you gonna let it drop.<br>
<br>
Or it just could be that as soon as one topic about idiots from lego dies down, another one springs up. <p><HR>

I did not put you down for making the group with valiso and pluff, I merely said it was no different than us to show that both sides at LEAST had the same mentality when they made groups. Pluff also mentioned he saw 5-6 burns hit the first dragon (implying his own later confirmed as our reset timers matched very close as we thought about ganking a kunark dragon =0 ) ), which I assume number 5 and 6 were his and valiso's? Since 1-4 were my group's. Glass houses own ! <br>
<br>
Serpento shouldn't of said anything, its not his fight. He is out of it now as I asked him to be. <br>
<br>
Its not even slyie's fight. Its mine. The thing is, the fight is over, actually there never really was one. You can be mad at me, I got no problems with that. You guys sure wouldn't be the first people in eq to hate Mandoman =) I am also sure you guys are all very perfect and fair people in every situation you have ever been in throughout your entire EQ career, remember glass houses own =)<br>
<br>
I posted my actions, I stand by them. Slyie looted because I told her to, hindsight is 20/20... I would tell her to loot the belt again, flames and all. <br>
<br>
I have stayed pretty mild with any little comments I made, as I said, I am not here to flame just to let you know what happened and what I did. Dont have to like it, keep flamming me if you will, its not going to change anything. <br>

Look over the stupid regurgitated shit you posted again and tell me who's got a hard on for what.  Seems you and a few others think that everytime we open our mouths it's just to screw Transcended over or something.  This has nothing to do with Sylie's guild tag and I have not Flamed Trans once here.  I posted that it WASN'T about that as a matter of fact.<br>

I even said for the little boners to stop insinuating that...but I guess one boner was small enough to get through eh?<br>

And give the Zerg thing a rest man...it even sounds idiotic coming from you now.  The term is a bit outdated now.  Why don't you go hang out at a water cooler and use some outdated catch phases from Sienfeld or something, I'm sure there's still an audience for that.<br>

          Few things I would like to point out, even though I really shouldnt post.. cause its just going to make this thread longer, but oh well. First off, Mando- thanks for sticking up for me and stuff, I appreciate it. Same goes for everyone else that understands what went on. Thank you everyone who went to the event and helped me get the first (apparent) GM event loot I have ever recieved. <br>
         Now for the fun part- First off.. Lothoris.. just one quick thing for you, if you have noticed your sig thing, it says: &quot;Advocating peace through superior firepower.&quot; And it seems like Mandoman did just that. Further, please don't confuse me with my evil twin Syile.. im Slyie, not Syile, so if you want to give me a bad rep or somthing, dont take it out on him. <br>
          Anyway, to avoid any more flaming.. because im trying to do my best to resist flamming lego cause well.. our relationship isnt the greatest.. im going to just leave it at that. Thanks again everyone who was there, I can assure you that I will use it and stuff.. And im sorry that Froc and the rest of legendary were not in the &quot;In&quot; group.. so to say. Maybe next time.<br>

Keep diggin sherlock.<br>
<br>
A Group (yes with Legendary members in it), decided on the SECOND dragon..to attempt to merely form an xp group.  Not so that we could give the loot to whoever we felt like...but so that all who could use it got a fair shot at it (yes even if it was a Transcended Rogue).  <br>
<br>
Damn you musta missed that whole thing about Sylie looting the Rogue belt too...did you even read pg.1-2?  Here's another prime example of how the same few turds from everybody's favorite guild seem to twist words around and ignore facts when they make them look bad.<br>
<br>
What's even more irritating is this defense of &quot;Oh I bet if a Legendary Rogue looted it then you wouldn't be complaining&quot;  That's just fucking ignorant.  First of all...a Legendary Rogue wouldn't have looted it without giving others a fair shot at it...who knows...there's probably a few rogues in Transcended that wouldn't have either.  Second of all...A Legendary Rogue didn't fucking loot it, so stop trying to turn this around and SOMEHOW (God you are reaching) deflect the focus off of the person who did loot it.<br>
<br>
This is insane...anyone else wanna come here and launch an attack on Legenday for something I didn't even say?  Come on you fucks...I know ya do<br>
<br>
<br>
Little Boner #1...Serpento----Arec says it's not a guild thing so stop trying to say it is.<br>
<br>
Little Boner #2...Aeadiin----Who obviosly didn't get it when Arec said it's not a fucking guild thing.<br>
<br>
Little Boner #3...Zerain----Who saw through 2 posts of me saying it's not about Legendary vs Trans and COMPLETLY missed 80% of this thread because he only 'gets out of this thread' what he thinks makes Legendary look bad.<br>
<br>
Noticing a pattern here...Almost like I knew this was gonna happen....<br>
