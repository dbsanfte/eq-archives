<br>
Which OS?<br>
If WinXP, which motherboard are you using?  Because if you aren't seeing the nv4_disp.dll infinite loop bugcheck with WinXP, you're one of the very lucky ones (or slowed down that AGP slot to a snail's pace).<br>
<br>
&quot;My system also runs between 20-30C. It actually keeps the area around my computer cold.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unless you're using some sort of water cooling system, an overclocked AthlonXP is not going to stay under 30 degrees C.<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW I believe most motherboards these days have some sort of protection that will shut down the computer if the CPU fan stops rotating, or if the CPU temp goes higher than a certain point.&quot;<br>
<br>
You mispelled &quot;most&quot;.  It should read &quot;few&quot;.<br>
Most motherboards don't have this circuitry since Intel CPUs since the original P5's have had thermal protection circuitry built into the CPU core.  Why would any motherboard maker bother with redundant circuitry?<br>
<br>
I know ASUS with their newer boards and with AthlonXP CPUs provide thermal protection circuitry.  Who else?  Because if I had to buy an Athlon board, ASUS isn't my top choice (infact, ASUS quite frankly sucks when it comes to AMD boards).  Oddly enough, for P4 boards ASUS is my top choice--funny how that works.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you dont want to build your own comp, or don't think you can do it, I would buy an Alienware or Falcon NW (or at least a Dell) PC.&quot;<br>
<br>
Interesting that you suggest Alienware/Falcon.  All of their AMD systems are based off the nForce chipset.  I find this ironic in two ways:<br>
<br>
1.  VIA is the most popular AMD chipset supplier--more so than even AMD themselves.  And yet, Alienware/Falcon (which aren't exactly budget systems) offer nForce, a chipset that's a version 1.0 release from a vendor whose specialty isn't motherboard chipsets.<br>
<br>
2.  nForce chipsets have a confirmed PCI write bug with their current BIOS revision (ok, so they have a beta BIOS which appears to fix this).  And yet, these custom shops uses the nForce chipset instead of other chipsets.<br>
<br>
So either Alienware people are crazy or they determined that a first generation chipset with a known bug is the best that the current market can offer for Athlon chipsets--that's a fairly sad state of affairs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hell, ya could probably just say 'I have $XXX, whats the best system I could make for gaming' and you would get a few good answers (it will be AMD no doubt ^_^). &quot;<br>
<br>
No doubt.<br>

I dont have water cooling.  I do have a nice HSF (plus arctic silver), and a lot of air flow (2 92mm high power side panels, 2 fast fans in front, 2 in back, plus a PCI exhaust bellow the GFX card, and my PSU has 2 fans for more exhaust).  Im just telling you the numbers my thermometer displays.  If it's a bad thermometer, oh well, the point is if you have even half the cooling I have (its not a huge investment, fans are cheap), you wont have heat problems when using an Athlon.  My CPU also isn't over clocked that much.  I pushed the FSB up some, but the multiplier/voltage are still the same.  The chip isnt even unlocked yet.  When I have some spare time I do plan on unlocking it and messing around a bit to see which settings give the best performance increase.  I probably will try turning the multiplier down and increasing the FSB a lot.<br>
<br>
As for the CPU protection, my MB monitors the CPU Fan (and chipset fan) speed.  It also has CPU temp monitor.  It's probably not the most acurate device - its probably a few degrees off, but its close enough that it will know if the CPU is getting a bit too hot.  Again, my MB is a Soyo Dragon+.  At the time I got it, it was one of the best (if not the best) Athlon XP boards.<br>

I didnt say get an Athlon Alienware/Falcon.  To tell you the truth, I havent been to either of their sites for a while.  I listed them because they have good reputations for making good gaming machines.  Last time I checked their sites, I remember mosta the systems being Pentium based.  I did not list them because they made AMD systems, nor did I suggest getting an Athlon system from them.  If they do infact use nForce MBs, I wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't buy from them even if they didnt.  I don't know why they are using nForce MBs, I'm sure they have their reasons, and I'm sure they run fine, but this is one of the reasons why I chose to build my own comp (and why I'd recommend doing it).<br>

It probably is right though.  If you ask whats the best system you could get with X money, then money is probably an issue for you.  If money is an issure when making your own computer, Athlon is the way to go, most of the time, because it gives more bang for your buck.<br>
<br>
This computer was the first computer I've built.  It doesn't take a computer expert to build an Athlon machine without any problems.  I, in fact, I didn't know much about making a computers, but i researched on computer sites and message boards, decided what kinda system i wanted, then researched what parts/brands would be best for the kinda system I wanted and for my price range. <p><center>

<br>
Your Soyo board doesn't have any thermal protection.  The only thing that keeps your CPU from turning into a useless (but pretty) crystal is a $0.02 piece of plastic on the ZIF socket keeping that fan attached to an area measuring about 1 square cm covered with thermal goop.  <br>
<br>
You're also running Win2K which, unless you installed the latest VIA 4-in-1 driver isn't pushing that AGP slot.  Drop either the 4-in-1 driver or WinXP and let me know how stable your system runs with EQ.<br>
<br>
My point about Alienware/Falcon is that even these guys (who do have experience in building solid systems) opt to use a relatively untested, somewhat buggy chipset for their Athlon systems.  Think about what that means for the other Athlon chipsets currently available.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you ask whats the best system you could get with X money, then money is probably an issue for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Excuse me, but I'd say functional is more critical than cost.  I doubt most people buying a computer will care much that they saved $300 when the computer starts blue screening every few minutes. <br>
<br>
&quot;This computer was the first computer I've built. It doesn't take a computer expert to build an Athlon machine without any problems.&quot;<br>
<br>
Who said building a computer from off the shelf parts is difficult?  Anyone that can read instructions and is willing to put some time into it can put one together.  <br>
<br>
The point is that Athlon systems have two very fundamental flaws:<br>
<br>
1.  CPU runs hotter than their competition and do not include a thermal protection circuitry needed to protect that investment.  This is incredibly stupid when you consider that the original *PENTIUMS* had this circuitry incorporated.  That's more than 10 years ago.<br>
<br>
2.  Pretty much every nortbbridge chipset available for the Athlon is buggy--buggy to the point where it actually impacts the basic functionality of the system.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, I would love nothing more than to see AMD actually give Intel a strong run for their money since that usually translates to price drops for all the CPUs--as a consumer that's a very good thing for me (especially given how many systems I own).<br>
<br>
However, AMD has a lot of problem that they need to fix.  Stable chipsets and the fact that the Athlon core is fast running out of breathing room (I doubt you'll see an Athlon core run much past 2Ghz without some Herculean efforts at cooling the system, whereas I fully expect a 3+Ghz P4 by the end of this year) are two most immediate ones.  Until these are addressed, I doubt I will ever buy another AMD system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwaldena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Waldena</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/flamedot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/02 4:07:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1781.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any advice on a good system config?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Who said building a computer from off the shelf parts is difficult?

I suppose using just the instructions you can tell whether a given piece of DRAM is faulty or not right?  Or whether the circuitry on the motherboard is borked or not?  Or detect a fab fault on the ZIF socket retainer?  Or determine that the numbnuts at VIA couldn't engineer their collective heads outta their asses long enough to realize their AGP bus support does NOT run at 4X as their manual instructions indicate without clobbering the transfer data headers? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umaxamaji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/02 3:51:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1781.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any advice on a good system config?</span><hr size=1> Bah, you're both fulla shyat.

they're the most well known manufacturers that don't do proprietary systems like compaq, dell, gateway, etc.  they also use the latest and absolute most bleeding edge hardware in order to win the hardware reviews.  maximum pc has reviewed several alienware systems and every single time they say something like, &quot;the fastest gaming rig we've ever seen.  9 (or 10)/kickass.&quot;  <br>
<br>
people don't care about the finer details if the system gives them the highest framerates at the LAN party, but i simply can't see how anyone could spend <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EIGHT THOUSAND</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dollars on an intel/intel compatible personal computer.  even if $3000 of that price is the monitor.<br>
<br>
i went with intel instead of AMD for my computer upgrade last year.  this year, i didn't have the extra $150+ to spend.  i cut a lot of corners and still spent more than i originally anticipated. <p><p>

If WinXP, which motherboard are you using? Because if you aren't seeing the nv4_disp.dll infinite loop bugcheck with WinXP, you're one of the very lucky ones (or slowed down that AGP slot to a snail's pace).&quot;<br>
<br>
Is that implying that one should avoid using a cheaper and better-performance-for-the-money CPU because it has a problem with Microsofts latest and greatest?  Or, because the drivers are still not perfect?<br>
<br>
So, an additional $200 for an annoying OS that requires activation and bugs users who change hardware often, and an additional $300 for a similar performing P4 CPU; all to notice no difference in EQ's performance?<br>
<br>
No thanks, I'd stick with Win98 and use the $500 elsewhere.  Heck, for $500, I could build an additional high end AMD box and use that to house a second account to PL my main, or to have mule druid.  That seems the better deal.<br>
<br>
Besides, who wants to use a bubbly OS filled with wizards and activation hassles?  Though, I did install Xp on a separate HD for a while.  Seems like a decent OS, but nothing to write home about, though the reviews are good.  It gave me no problems, though neither has Win98 in the years that I've used it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Unless you're using some sort of water cooling system, an overclocked AthlonXP is not going to stay under 30 degrees C.&quot;<br>
<br>
It really should not matter.  I've never done anything special for cooling an AMD I've ever used, and I've never had a problem with one.  20C?  50C?  Doesn't matter if it's not causing any problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like the new AMD Throughbreds aren't stacking up too well either. &quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, it looks like they are stacking up great, and doing the usual out-perform-higher-ghz-intel-counterparts.  The only issues being that you can't overclock as well as you can a p4 (ack!  who can live without that 6% performance boost; a boost that you are already getting and more, over the Intel counterpart anyway!) and the fact that the AMD is not running as cool as the Intel.  Very small deals in the big picture of 'performance for the dollar'.<br>

Or, because the drivers are still not perfect?&quot;<br>
<br>
It's because while the CPU is fine and dandy (for the most part), the supporting *chipset* does not conform to the specs correctly causing data corruption during high speed transfers.  So in essence, while the CPU may be behaving correctly, it's being fed faulty data because of poorly implemented logic circuitry on the motherboard.<br>
<br>
The statement about the OS is based on the fact that by default Win2K and Win9X (of which WinME is included), does not install the AGP driver which pushes the databus to the fullest potential.  WinXP by default does.<br>
<br>
If you stick with Win2K/Win9X, you're not getting the maximum data throughput you potentially could with a 4X AGP slot.  Unless you install an updated AGP driver for those OSes.  At which point, you'll most likely start seeing the infinite loop crashes.<br>
<br>
So in theory, yes if you stick with Win9X with it's default AGP driver, you're fine.  On the otherhand, if you actually want to run that 4X AGP at 4X, you're gonna have some pains. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukoshyoftribunal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Koshy of Tribunal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/24/02 1:09:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1781.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any advice on a good system config?</span><hr size=1> &quot;i'm curious why you wouldn't choose asus. my a7v333 is working great.&quot;<br>
<br>
There's nothing overly compelling about ASUS compared to say Abits or MSI when it comes to Athlon boards.  Infact, most of the headaches I've dealt with on Athlon boards disappeared when I swapped out the ASUS KT266A board with MSI's KT266A board.<br>
<br>
Same chipset, different implementation and yet a significant improvement in overall stability.  <br>
<br>
Could it have been just a really bad batch of ASUS boards?  Possibly.  But I doubt it. <br>
<br>
Now, this may change in the future when new chipsets are released but for now, if you want to go with an Athlon/VIA system MSI would be my recommendation.  For P4, ASUS.  Although, that &quot;legacy free&quot; Abits IT7 MAX is very nice as well (especially the 6 IDE channels, 6 USB ports and 3 Firewire ports). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uquizwhiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quiz Whiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nipple milk</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/24/02 3:20:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1781.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any advice on a good system config?</span><hr size=1> Uhh, they're aren't stacking up great when it comes to overclocking, and it's not a 6% performance boost, ALOT of people have been able to get 1.6a's to 2.4's with STOCK intel cooling.

Higher ghz Intels give less performance then the lowe ghz AMD's.  You can overclock your Intel to 800 mhz higher then an AMD to get slightly better performance then an AMD.<br>
<br>
But, that's what everyone is trying to avoid, right?  The extra hassle?  The pain of supposedly needing to jump through hoops to get an AMD to work on a given OS, or to spend more money for a lesser perfoming Intel and then mess with it to get the performance up to par with the AMD.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, to each his own.  There is no &quot;right answer&quot;.  Either way, you should be hoping AMD continues to be succesful and get larger market shares, as the competition is what keeps you from having to pay $2K for that Intel CPU instead of $600. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhazewire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hazewire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/24/02 9:06:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1781.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any advice on a good system config?</span><hr size=1> interesting, koshy.  i know several people with asus athlon boards (kt266a and kt333 chipset) who haven't had any problems on windows XP or 98.  <br>

<br>
I have been running a Gateway for about a year now. It's a P4 1.8ghz on an D850GB Mainboard, 256mb of 800mhz RDRAM and a Nvidia GeForce 3 with 64mb onboard.<br>
<br>
If I average one crash every 60 days I would be surprised. My CPU runs around 112 deg with the fan at between 3300 - 3500 rpm. <br>
<br>
Gateways are a good machines. The integrated models suck... but that is true of almost any company. If it has integrated sound or video, pass it by, because if they are cutting corners on those you know there is a good chance they are doing the same on the chipset as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have heard that Dell beats Gateway when it comes to customer support, but as far as the machines go, I am more than satisfied with mine. <p><br>

I don't think anyone here has said that AMDs do not run hotter then Intels.  I believe what some ofus are saying is: &quot;big deal&quot;.  There is a difference between running hotter and there being a problem.  When there is not a problem (which seems to be the consensus) then who cares if one CPU runs 20 degrees hotter?<br>

These threads are always fun to read.  <br>
<br>
My P3 system is having all sorts of issues, mainly it will not run EQ at ALL anymore.  <br>
<br>
My 2 other AMD XP systems witht he VIA266A chipset MBs run like a charm &amp; at the time I built them (Nov &amp; Dec 01) I saved a TON of money over P4s &amp; got BETTER performance.  <br>
<br>
To me it was about saving money.  These to machines are my 1st AMDs &amp; I am happy as hell I got them.    Saved enough money to equip them both with GF4s a couple weeks ago!  The price differnce is not trivial.   We are talking $300 a PIECE back then.<br>
<br>
If someone reading this thread decides to go with AMD, here is my recommendations:<br>
<br>
VIA266A chipset MB (rock solid, AMD 761 is old)<br>
Micron or better yet Corsair memory<br>
high quality 300watt or higher PS in a good case with room for airflow.<br>
with the money you save get a Gforce4 ti4400<br>
<br>
I got a friend who just build a P4 2.4 with RAMBUS memory &amp; is having a TON of problems, rebooting, lockups, overheating.  Imagine heh<br>
