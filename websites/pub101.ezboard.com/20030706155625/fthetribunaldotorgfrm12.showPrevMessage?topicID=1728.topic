<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And now, the winners:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fuzzeylyest</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Cleric.  (Rumored alts: Hihosilver, Necromites) Everyone has a Fuzzy story.  It has all the basic angst of a good novel - training, idiocy, scamming, despair, denial.  PoI seems to be his favorite training ground and he can be found in his private Casino in the Bazaar.  Steer clear of his ninja group invites!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>           Tabbun,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Druid. Likes to train and harrass people. A basic turd.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Markey,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> male erudite necromancer, a killstealing asshole. He is the only person on Thistleburr's ignore list. With good reason. His Markey Mark name gay as shit, but that isn't the reason why he is here. He uses the lowest methods to get what he wants including killing quest turn-in mobs for spite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Oron,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> male human ranger. Huge assbag. He recently kill-stole a triggered quest mob and then fucked his own mother.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kindas</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a male wood elf druid. He helped Oron kill the triggered mob and then helped fuck Oron's mother. Avoid these two. They are extemely fucked up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Judeis, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> human wizzy. Also plays <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Vegas, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> High-Elf Cleric, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Sigfree, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> High-Elf Enchanter, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>      Clawes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. He is a 31 year old total fucking loser. He will harasses female players of any age into cybering with him. Upon refusal, he goes ape shit on them and does his best to make their game life and sometimes their real life a living hell. Female characters have had to leave our server because of him. He is truly a twisted fuck that our world could do without.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Kaspian,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Necro. Ninjalooted some shit off of Doomshade over a dispute on the kill. Thought he was doing his guild a favor. Not surprising. But they booted his sorry ass. Hopefully he will eat shit and die.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Calabok,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Midlevel Human Warrior. Been caught scamming people in the bizarre. Recently took 15K off one dude. Don't trade with this fucknut or allow him into your guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Supernus,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Dwarf Paladin. Enjoys walks on the beach, Kill stealing, training people, and laughing about it. He played one of Biff's cronies on BTTF. Also he hates his father and lashes out at everyone to expess his anger.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natakaz</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Enjoys training people to take their camps. Likes to hang out with that jackass Supernus. He has been kicked out of at least 4 guilds for his actions. Good luck if you take him into yours.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Ialan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This twisted fuck will lure younger female characters into a bindable KOS area with promises of money or items. He will them start harassing them to cyber with him, and if they reject him, he will bind them, let their invis go out, and let them go through a death cycle. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Hogge, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Orge Warrior. Also plays, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Cebula, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Iksar Shaman, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Whood, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Halfling Druid, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Micarlin, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Human Warrior, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Magelo</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Citijys. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This tard is known for scamming/stealing from people. Has even managed to scam a Cobalt Breastplate. Also likes to scam while pretending to help with Multiquesting. Or asking to try things on. He has scammed tons of people &amp; somehow has not yet banned. He is definitely somebody you don’t want to group with and especially don’t want to ever trade with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Clarinet</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> name changed from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Poladara, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Level 60 Bard. Ninjaed two red scales off the dragon in Skyfire. Then of course went and sold them off. Then after being tracked down, makes the claim that she of course looted do to lag and then went linkdead and apparently sold them off while still link dead.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Earnhart, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Cleric. Ninja looter. Mainly has done it in midlevel Kunark areas like DL and FMs. Has ninjaed and /qed out tons of different times. So far it is just things like Forest Loops but we imagine he will get to bigger things before finally being banned.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Brianne (use to be uulluilu)-</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Ninja Looter. Female Wood Elven Druid. Has been known on more than one occasion to loot items that were not hers &amp; then /q out. Recently, she stood over a corpse for the 10th ring quest &amp; clicked on it till she could loot. Looted 4 items, some being no drop &amp; then /q out. Then had the nerve to say it was just a big accident caused by lag after the GM was contacted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Mystron-</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> DE Enchanter. Twinks include: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Mamalo. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Apparently, he is an annoying little shit, but the reason he made this thread is because he stole a bag of resist gear from a guildmate who was trying to help him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Loli – </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Moved to a different server. He is a well-known crook who has scammed on multiple occations. If you are so stupid to even let him in your group, do not be so stupid as to let him be the master looter. Also known for training. He is a highly unbalanced Frenchman who will go psycho on you. Putting him on your ignore list is a very very very very good thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Alexandr-</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Necro of some sort. Also plays Munyo his monk. This guy has ninjaed more loot that anyone else on the server. Everywhere you go people will talk about this waste of space. Grouping with him may very well ruin your day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Biowars -</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Human Ranger. Known to pull a transfer scam. He will pretend to be an alt of a guildmate/friend &amp; then con your ass. <br>

She is known for being insane, unbalanced, and otherwise huge problems with her anger. However, the reason she made the list are from low actions. She has been know to try &amp; scam people out of items by offering to duel item for item. She then has an “impartial” person who also happens to be Clangeddin, come hold the items. During the duel she will also have Clang heal her. She has also been known to train groups in Lguk to get their spawns. SHe recently fucked over Merton's epic just because she didn't like him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Forsetti </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- Human Cleric. Also goes by Hadina or Mitri.

He likes to do things like Master Loot for a group &amp; then camp out with all the loot. He also does such wonderful things as borrow things &amp; then claim to have been hacked so he won't have to return it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Chairez, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> also goes by Dernz. He pulls a friend/guildmate con, where he will pretend to be a respectable person in a respectable guild’s alt &amp; will pull the “give the item to my alt &amp; I will log in my main to pay you.” If you see someone trying to pull something like this, please petition immediately.<br>

Give me details about them, as in class, level &amp; race. If I feel that they are worthy, I will add them. I also want to hear details on what they have done. I don't want you to say they are dumbfucks or assholes. I want specicicicifity.<br>
<br>
I will then delete your post. If the name has been added, then I felt he/she belonged up there. If  not, then I didn’t.<br>
<br>
If you spam this thread, I will lock it &amp; put your name up there &amp; make some shit up about you. If I get bored doing this, then I will lock it. If virgins are not sacrificed, then I will lock it.<br>
<br>
Also, a side note, I do not want this to turn into a personal grudge thread. I will not post people who you just hate, or who are clueless about their class, who have called you names, you have gotten mad at you over an arguement, or who is just retarded. This is for the true assholes of the Tribunal. THe people who scam. The people who train, the people who are intentionally malicious &amp; seek to cause harm. This is for the Jaya's, not the Jenni's.<br>
<br>
You can fucking bitch about arguements over camps and mobs, but do it on a seperate fucking post on the flameboard. Because I am not going to add your new little enemy to the thread just because you think he is ebayed or he called you names or you and him got in a fight over who was first in a spot. You do that sort of pussy ass crying on the flameboard.<br>
<br>
This thread is for the worst of the worst. The shit piles. Not for whatever fag you have a personal grudge over. It's for the people that we don't know why the GMs have not permanently banned yet.<br>
<br>
Sometimes these pieces of shit will change their name for 50 bucks after no one will group with them anymore. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/renames/server.jsp?server=The%20Tribunal" target="top">Check this link to see who is changing their name on the Tribunal server.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

His alts are Tatans, Ohgreat and Ybuz. Why I am asking this is because he is a major HK camper...you know where im probably going here. He trained WR tonight about 5 times for laughs. They told him to stop and he just sayed in /ooc &quot;Oh stop having an orgasim&quot;. his dueling record he doesnt really keep up to date tho he puts up all his anonymous kills he made that day. He really gives beastlords a bad name. he flames you even if you talk in /ooc. I like to lvl with my family and if he is in the zone he ruins the fun for everyone. He is not a very nice person and I usually dont complain about people but he has hit the last nerve.<br>
