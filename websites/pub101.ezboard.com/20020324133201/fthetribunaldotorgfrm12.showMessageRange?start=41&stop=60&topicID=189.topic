Damn, I'm still reeling from the intensity of the verbal blow.  Please sir, I beg for mercy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
&quot;None of you senseless pricks have met me in game. None of you mouthy bastards have had the pleasure of hunting with me yet you accuse me of wanting equipment so i can show off. You accuse me of having no skills.&quot;<br>
<br>
(sarcasm on) I'm very distraught and upset that I haven't had this pleasure.  I don't think my Everquest experience will be complete until I have beheld your incredible skills first hand. (sarcasm off).<br>
<br>
&quot;You all wanna dick my achievements Just like you were dicking Bowynn's achievements. &quot;<br>
<br>
In a word, &quot;huh&quot;?  Are we reading the same board?  Most of the time it's one guild flaming another or a few people flaming each other.  Bowynn has a lot of respect on this board, whether it's due to his flaming prowess, EQ ability, or both.  I've never partied with Bowynn but I respect him as a player purely based on what I've read on these boards.  I can't say the same for others.<br>
<br>
&quot;FUCK personal merit. FUCK personal achievment. [Removed lots of mindless ranting]...echelon of Everquest gods.&quot;<br>
<br>
The facts to back this statement up are?  It would be a very dull world if everyone agreed on everything.  The difference between reasoned opinions and utter drivel is the former is generally supported by facts and examples.  In all of your posts you have supplied very little fact.  You haven't even supplied a single example of your apparent injustice (the fact you have little or no planar/uber items does not constitute as supporting facts on your part).<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone tries to voice an opinion that is differant than your own and you pull the great SUCK MY DICK mentality. &quot;<br>
<br>
Isn't that what you're doing? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Nobody likes a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
&quot;If anyone of you miserable cocksuckers were in a small guild with 40 or 50 members you would be singing a whole differant song. &quot;<br>
<br>
I'm in that very position but you don't see be bitching like a spoilt brat.  My guild and I generally have very good dealings with the &quot;uber guilds&quot;.  If we are the first to form a raid size force in GFay or Feerrott then we go in.  AN, SI, RNG, etc. have always respected our FCFS rights.  Once again, where's your example that the uber guilds are bullying you and stripping you of your rights?<br>
<br>
Once there was a time our senior rogue was camping KK waiting for Phinny to repop.  SI moved in so he left.  He was there alone, and for the record they didn't even realise he was there at any time (he left pretty quick when they came in).  Did they force him to leave?  No.  Did tell him to get lost?  No.  In fact, they felt bad that they didn't notice he was there and offered to help next time.  By the FCFS rules they didn't have to even acknowledge him given a single person camping Phinny doesn't constitute &quot;adequate forces&quot; by anyone's definition.<br>
<br>
Another time EV wanted to kill CT so they helped us clear Fear.  Everyone was happy and we had a blast (even when someone pulled the bulk of the Temple onto the raiding party.  Wipeout, but it was fun).<br>
<br>
Your posts scream of ignorance Krickett.  That much is very clear to me and I'm a newbie compared to a lot of the regular posters here.  You can rant about how godly your sub-50 skills are till the cows come home and it won't make any difference.  You can blame it on our ignorance of your amazing abilities, the arrogance of &quot;uber evil guilds&quot;, or whatever helps you deal with the game's reality and your sheltered world.  The simple fact is the bulk of the regulars have been playing the post-55 game for a while now.  Until you've reached that stage you won't understand their point of view.  Fortunately for them they were 47 once, were around at the time of Tribunal scheduling and can see your point of view.  <br>
<br>
Interesting how you come here thinking you're bringing fresh ideas now that you're 47 and can attend the planes.  Where were you when the scheduling was formed and later when it was disintegrating?  I smell a truck load of self centeredness on your part Krickett.  All of a sudden you think you have a right to bitch, moan and whinge just because it's effecting you now?  Stop being so self absorbed for a second, take your eye of the loot and try to understand what people are saying.  The answer to your &quot;problems&quot; has been supplied in many posts already.  You're just too caught up in yourself to realise.<br>
<br>
Sometimes ignorance is bliss, other times it just makes you look like an ass.  Sorry Krickett but you're in the latter catagory.<br>

And this schedule would be where? Some place all could see? Well you know what there used to be one, and as it has been said but you can't seem to comprehend, the mid size guilds were jumping over raids and screwed the pooch. You talk about if we were in smaller guilds we would understand. &quot;I&quot; started out in a very small size guild then moved to a mid size guild. We didn't have the numbers to do planes alone so we made alliances, worked with other guilds. I would often get invited or ask to go along with other guilds. You see this is a game where people interact, get to know one another, make friends (or enemies which you seem good at). No one DISERVES to have a plane popped and waiting on them. We all pay just like you and have the right to do what we want when we want as long as we dont break Verant's rules. And guess what.... Verant does NOT support scheduling, it's been said many many many times on the EQ boards. GM's will enforce FCFS, mostly by rolling if an epic mob is up from what I have seen on the board lately. But non the less it is FCFS. It is a fact of life and of the game, get over it. If you don't fucking like it then quit or do something about it.  <p>

<br>
Let's just clear this up so that there is no pretence.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself getting upset about FCFS and want to blame the uber guilds because they aren't fair or they are too big.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself this.....<br>
<br>
Why in hell should we care and who the hell are you anyway?<br>
<br>
a) we should not and do not care what you think......not because you are more important or less important but the fact is you don't really ever conflict with us.<br>
<br>
b) we should not and do not care who you are because you dont even do the same things we do.<br>
<br>
The scheduling system held this server back and prevented us as a community to move into bigger and better things FCFS is vastly more convenient for us because we don't have to check with A. N. OtherNoob_001 if it's ok with them. Not that we do it all that often anyway....<br>
<br>
We do what we wish when we wish it and only when we conflict with other people we work round it. (or in the case of SI we have a huge posturing fight and see who can hold their breath the longest).<br>
<br>
So you can either stop being a whiner or you can deal with the way it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/01 8:06:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=189.topic&index=46>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FCFS Sucks Royal Dick</span><hr size=1> A hostile post<br>

You didn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> REALLY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> expect anyone to take you seriously did you?? <br>

To quote the little nazi... &quot;You should check your pretenses&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you ever <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> REALLY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> want to discuss this rationally so that you can be more informed, send me a tell ingame.  For now, chew on this...<br>
<br>
There are 7 or 8 THOUSAND characters on the tribunal, assuming a normal size raid, and eliminating characters due to level, that constitutes approximately 174 raids that need scheduling.  So... you get 2 per year.  Since this year is over half over, you MIGHT get no raid.<br>
<br>
Let's see... due to your guildsize, whiny attitude and some random determination, your guild is scheduled for 9/14 at 5am EST for fear and 11/22 at 5am for Hate.  I will give you your next dates in January.  oh, btw, feel free to flame scheduling if you don't like the way i assign dates.<br>
<br>
<br>
OH yeah... due to size, the four oober guilds will all get roughly 4-6 raids to your one.  Mid-sized guilds will get about 2-3 raids to your one.  Please don't complain about this later since you were so concerned about fairness to everyone's $10 per month.<br>

Just accept the fact that the server is FCFS.  Plan on doing *something* with your guild.  Make a list.  Scout the zones, go to what's not being raided.  <br>
<br>
Throwing your hands up in the air will not make raids happen.<br>
<br>
Hmm... not knowing *exactly* what you're raiding seems like an Adventure to me.... Isn't that what this game is about?<br>

Leaving your guild and friends to join a larger guild is ~weak~ in my opinion.  It shows a lack of loyalty, innovation, flexibilty, perseverance and intellect.  <br>

Question being, why should the plane sit, poped, waiting for your guild and friends to get there shit together to show up and raid it?  What makes you so special you need a little helping hand?  Do you have any idea the blockade that puts on finishing certain class' epics, because they have to wait while guilds leisurly prepair for their raid?<br>
<br>
To hell with everyone else though, long as you get your -guarenteed- time in right?<br>
<br>
People have made all kinds of suggestions, good ones at that.  It seems to me that you've got a gigantic chip on your shoulder and no ammount of reason is going to knock it off.  So keep yelling and screaming and ranting, its not going to accomplish anything except stain your reputation and make you look like a fool.  No ones going to remember the gear you handed out, the times you sow'd them w/o asking, or the time you healed their twink... they are just going to remember you as some piss-ant ranter on a flame board, screaming about nothing. <p>~Craeven Eveningshadow<br>

Well yes really I did. I had hoped that more than a few would jump on this thread and drive it to 5 pages long in 48 hours. It wasnt happening so I threw in a crack on the art work. Still not enough. I dont have what it takes to inflame you people into throwing common sense into the wind and going crazy. Most all of you maintained composure and still posted legitimate posts. FUCK YOU ALL. If you woulda played the game I woulda won a small wager and been the proud owner of GeBs for my little cleric. Now I got to eat the cost of 30 10-dose SoW potions. I hate all of you. <br>

You on the other hand are a laughably narrow-minded, dull, near-universally scorned laughingstock of nearly the entire Tribunal server.  At least Loveseeker's mindless bitching is occasionally amusing; reading one of your posts is a migraine-inducing exercise in masochism.  Please, keep trying to pass this whole thing off as a big joke or a bet with a friend.  You just keep scrubbing shit all over your own face harder and harder.  Keep it up, maybe by tomorrow you'll be as brown as Minng and people can start cracking some ethnic jokes too.  I'd say more, but I need to go take a couple Motrin after reading your pathetic attempt at humor. <p><P><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="4" face="Arial" color="blue"><i>Caledhon TelRana</big></i></font></p>

<br>
First off, find the last 5 brain cells you have in your head and push them together because your going to need them to understand this 3 hours from now.<br>
<br>
Second don't copy stuff other people have done. I am so glad you were able to copy, paste, and then edit a post from above insulting you. But it lost all flamage it had when you tried, and really badly too, to copy it.<br>
<br>
Third, understand that you have about as good a chance of ever being listened to again as a paper cat being chased through hell by an asbestos dog. <br>
<br>
Fourth...I am way to lazy to keep going because your just not entertaining enough.<br>
