We started at approximately 2 pm EST toward DN.  There were originally 18 people present with 2 clerics.  We were on our way toward the rat hole, but some of our members were scattered.  Somehow the queen was aggroed, which wiped out the whole party.<br>
<br>
We got some additional guildmates (Sulley mainly) to corpse drag while Feldor were doing rezzes.  All corpses were rezzed at approximately 3:00 to 3:30 pm.  We were almost ready to head down when 30 Legs zoned in.  Aerra immediately /ooc &quot;camp check&quot; and followed by &quot;Zland&quot;.  One Leg /ooc &quot;Zland is up?&quot; and another /ooc &quot;Vaniki&quot;.  They then proceded to the rat hole, and we shortly followed.<br>
<br>
Legs and SI members met up again at the crossroads to Zland and Vaniki.  SI members went into the Zland tunnel first, followed by Leg members.  We told them numerous times in /say that they were in the wrong tunnel for Vaniki.  When we were fighting some rats in the middle of the tunnel, leg members leap-frogged over us.  We were all wondering what Legendary was doing and Dasgreif (our raid leader) said that she has talked to some leg members and they say they are doing Zland now.  Everyone met up again at Vilefang pool where leg members swam across and SI members were told to hold at the water edge.  This was at approximately 4:30 pm atm.<br>
<br>
There was alot of argument in guildchat then.  Some wanted to form a KSing group to steal Zland when Legs engages.  Others wanted to wait to see what Leg do before attempting anything.  At that time, there were approximately 25 SI members and 40 Leg members in zone.  Some SI members, fed up with all the infighting, decided to leave.  Shortly after, Rynnia told us to head to Ssra temple instead and we all ported out.  This was at approximately 5:30 pm EST.<br>
<br>
Personally I dont particularly care about Zland, I only wasted 4 hrs on a raid that never happened.  Like Rynnia said, he will spawn again.  I dont even care about Legendary, because they only damaged their reputation further.  However, Legendary's insinuation that they were in zone first was absolutely false.  They also engaged Zland under false pretenses, so to lull us into not heading into the camp spot fast enough.  I will, however, keep extra guard up whenever there is any legendary members in any of SI raid sites, because they obviously only care about loot and nothing about how they get it.<br>

Shut the fuck up N00b Krickett.  Krickett has like half the posts on this thread and by the third one i was SURE she was the biggest fucking n00b in the history of EQ.  Let's put it this way, at 43, your healing abilities are dick.  How do i know this...your 43 and quite honestly you suck dick until you hit 60 or so.  As for your shaman, you couldn't have been a good shaman, end of story.  Shaman don't talk, they just do it.  <br>
<br>
Legendary sucks.  I left legendary over a year ago because they sucked.  They reigning theme of every raid was Phatlewt.  Hell the password to the fucking chat room was phatlewt.  If you ever wanna have fun, read telemakhos's ranting on the Legendary news page.  Talk talk talk talk.  When really what they are doing is sticking their undersized penis's in any hole they can find.  So, my recommendation, keep your cats in the house.  <br>
<br>
As for ethios, they sucked too.  If it's the day i remember (i used to be in SI) we gave you guys 2 fucking hours to get your shit together and port up to hate.  But you had too many 46 clerics and a piece of shit shaman so noone wanted to go up and die. <p><http://www.snowcrest.net/jesses/Lerichesig2.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 545<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/02 11:51:43 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legendary....</span><hr size=1> That's my WTF look.

<br>
Saying you are killing another mob and then taking Zland though? If that's true than it's lame. That takes it from being a bully/ass (or whatever your view of it is) to being a gimp sneak.<br>
<br>
Whether or not it's ass to take a mob while someone is doing CR is debatable I guess, but lying about which mob you're after to buy time isn't imo. <p><br>

Simple fact. Sol Invictus is such a fucked bunch of power hungry honorless pieces of shit that even this n00b can pick em out of line up.<br>
Sorry Leriche, Dont waste anymore time on me. I forget that when posting on this board you must write over about the 3rd grade level or ass lackeys like yourself cannot understand it. If you actually think that I was saying that at level 47 I was comparable to any shaman on the server then you really are retarded. Comparable levels asshole. Use your head for something other than the thing that keeps your ears apart.<br>
Individually there maybe some good points to Sil Invictus. But as a collective whole the guild is just a bunch of E/V wannabes without the skillz or determination needed to attain the higher goals. <br>
You accused Legendary of being a guild without honor. I accuse you of that and worse.<br>
BTW, I am not looking to join a tier 1 2 or 3 guild. So if you ever do become a recruiter dont worry about me ever trying to get near you.  I am quite happy being in a stepping stone that supplies the end game guilds with fresh members. See I teach players about loyalty and honor. I teach respect. I teach that the only way to strengthen yourself is to strengthen all those that you surround yourself with. I surroung myself with players of the same ethics. Soon there will be no need for guild against guild flameboard wars because all of you greedy, crying, dishonorable bastards will have retired and cancelled your accounts (like flaash) and the replacements will be those that know strength and honor. <p><p><html><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FF0000" width="200"><font size="3"><strong><p align=center>Krickett Buffslinger</strong></font></p></td><td bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><font size="4"><strong><marquee width="120%">Council Member of the Regulators of Norrath..
