<br>
Depends on the name. If someone petitions a character named Gewkillah, or Porchmunkee, then you can bet your ass a GM/Sr Guide will be all over it, as well they should be. A guide (who can't kick people or change names) will even grab a GM from another server in a case like that, as it is extremely offensive and needs to be dealt with right then.<br>
<br>
If it is a just a regular naming policy violation (Poppasmurf or Ibash Bigbadmobs), then the guide will add it to the bad name list when he puts in his shift report, and then a Sr Guide or GM will watch for that person to come online and change it when they are not busy with something else. That's why alot of characters keep names so long... they have to be online and noticed to get it changed -and- the GM/Sr Guide has to not be busy doing something else of a higher priority.<br>
<br>
Now if a GM has just finished a petition or is on his way to one, and see a name violation, chances are they will change it. It doesn't take long.<br>
<br>
Of course it varies from GM to GM, but I would bet most put changing names low on their list of priorities. Besides, as far as GM duties goes, this one is pretty boring, so it's not like they get a thrill out of it. Still, if they don't change them a month after they have been added to the list, what do you think that looks like? They have to do it, it's their job.<br>
<br>
So while I can't give you a concrete answer to your question, I think it's safe to say naming violations are not the foremost thing on a GM mind and I am sure they wish they didn't have to spend the time on it that they do already.<br>

<br>
People still do this?  With one exception (Going LD during zoning) it's usually very avoidable, let me help you:<br>
<br>
1). Don't get as close to a wall as you can when you log.  Odds are you'll return on top of a roof (KC Entrance in DL) or under the world move to wall, then take a couple steps away from wall, sit /camp.<br>
<br>
2). Don't log too close to a zone line.  Take a few steps.<br>
<br>
3). Try to zone near the center of the zone in post Velious zones (Zoning is totally different post Velious), zoning on the edge can cause issues.<br>
<br>
And, as someone else said... rarely does it cause death anymore.  I went LD zoning out of Velks last night and fell through... got returned to safepoint instead of 10k fall.  This has happened a couple times with other people I know. (LD during zoning each time).  Haven't heard of a 10k fall recently.<br>

<br>
I have (because I'm an asshole) held our dear lead GM there for well over an hour, 2x, because of renaming and name policy debate. And I'm sure that I'm not the only one who's held him / Noc in a lengthy debate over something. Yes, I knew I was going to lose the debate the whole time, and it was of course pointless, but far from a waste of time. Well, waste of my time. I was having fun.<br>
<br>
As far as GM's not replying to the above list; they most certainly do, I've had the GM come help me with a couple of those issues, NOT regular guides, but the server GM. I had Noc come when I poofed a bag I picked up with a lore item in it cause I forgot (yay me), and Valshire came when I petitioned that I had lost my corpse to talk to me about what happened and give me a replacement sent of basic equipment. So the GM's do come for things regular guides do too, I can verify that much.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, I don't think I've had a BAD experience with a GM. I got to have a fun argument while in the meantime getting my name changed to something that didn't really change it; I got my Tink Bag with like 50k worth of shit in it back when I poofed it like a dumb fuck; I got a free set of equip when I lost mine (again, like a dumbfuck); I got 25 free rezzes from a GM when I got myself caught in a death loop CRing a group out of Permafrost (yay me!); I got to run around chasing a GM after I got a warning for using the old OT run them into the wall of the SF zome exploit using fear; he went invis but I still had him on track, so I ran around harassing him all over the zone till he screamed ENOUGH at me and came back with the all-server GM (I was very polite to him, can't imagine why)... All in all I think I like the GM's. I even got a free ride when the FP boat was broken.<br>

He did, and was told to stuff it. I just used him as an example.<br>
- then he should take it higher up the food chain.<br>
<br>
Um, you obviously havn't played very much because this happens all the time. You must like the band wagon from the sound of your posts. I have fallen through the world several times while logging in as well as zoneing.<br>
- in 59 levels of play the number of times i have personally witnessed anyone falling thru the zone can be counted on one hand, and in all such cases the response time while not exceptional , was satisfactory. personnally i havent fallen thru the world once so i guess i must be doing something right eh?<br>
<br>
Really? You must not have been playing recently as they do investiate this quit often. Usually when Uber loot or Dragon loot is involved though. Have you ever leveled a char over 10 on your own? or did you EBay all the way up? Your comments don't seem to have much beef in them.<br>
- hahahhahahahahahahah investigate and resolve are two different things.  <br>
<br>
Ok, so I should have to lock a corpse while the other 20 people who died killing UberMob_01 get rezed? What does log do? only way it does any good is if your in that persons group. Come on learn alittle about the game before you spout shit. <br>
- if you are looting the corpse no one else can loot the corpse<br>
why dont YOU play the game a little ...<br>
<br>
Really? This has happend to you? Seems to me when I died in ToV (Temple of Veeshan in case your not familiar with ToV) I died in a wall, had to have a GM summon my corpse because a Necro couldn't do it. No one could see my corpse except the GM, when we tried to assist off her for Rez/loot couldn't target corpse - GM was kind enough to give me a 96% rez same as cleric that was trying to rez me. This also happend in Nerriak, had to have a GM summon a corpse, others could see it but it could not be rezed, no could they see their corpse. In this case though they could target off the GM and loot, sucked they couldn't get a rez though.<br>
- yes it has happened to me b4 and the cleric was able to target it thru the group window. <br>
<br>
Lol, Really when was the last post made on badgamers.com? How many people know of its exsistance? How many people actully read the shitlist? You have any Idea how many people used to be logged on the Tribunal before they changed the server status screen? Take a guess..... I guess you must have fallen off the wagon because your answer seems alittle shaky here.<br>
- by your level you should know the names of most if not all the assholes by heart no? <br>
<br>
What does this mean? Your referance is about as open as your Ass is. <br>
- it means that kill stealers are a variant of grief players dumbass<br>
<br>
Ok, lets see I received a Hack created Item? Why am I not banned then? Why is the person who traded me not banned then? If you read I did /petition this and got no response on it. Please remember to bring your helmet and mouth guard next time you get on the wagon.<br>
- why you havent been banned is probably you cannot used the said item, fuckwad. why the person who traded with you hasnt been banned? i dont know honestly only a CS rep can answer that question. nice to know that they teach children the difference between a general and a specific answer<br>
<br>
I never said I was &quot;Champion for Baytor&quot; I used him as an example, you obviously have never delt with a GM in your extended EQ life. As far as competancy is concerned, damned if I know, don't really care either.<br>
- if you are using him as the focal point of your argument then you are 'championing' his cause. and i have dealt with GMs b4 on a greater variety of topics i might add. <br>

GMs will come on regular petitions if the guides are swamped and they aren't busy. I didn't mean to imply they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> answer those, but they are most normally handled by guides. That's why they have the guide program - so guides can take care of the issues that don't require GM access, leaving the GMs more time to do the petitions that require local access.<br>

Then I told Arendar to stick around so she can tell the Legends GMs how Gnomeball is really played. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usarta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I guess I'm as fucking<br>clueless as Darimund!</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 12:58:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always nice to chat with the lead GM.</span><hr size=1> heh, I invited Aerendar to join our guildball chat while the game was in progress.  He didn't show up when I typed /list 1, but after the game was done and everyone was about to leave, Aerendar said &quot;?&quot; over the gnomeball chatline.  When asked to clarify he laughed and said he had mistyped something.  Was kind of funny.<br>

Wouldn't be easier if he was just a homopedinecrobestiphilliac?
