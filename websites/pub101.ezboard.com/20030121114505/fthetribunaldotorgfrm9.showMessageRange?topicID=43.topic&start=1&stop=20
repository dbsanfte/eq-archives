<br>
I gotta say I was very impressed with the DAOC launch, and the gameplay and fun factor for the first 30 levels (which go by quickly).  There is ample content up until 30 to keep the game varied and interesting.  Even though quests are redundant they are something to look forward to and a reason to level.<br>
<br>
Well, I haven't really played the game in a couple of weeks now.  Why?  Nothing to do since level 30 (stopped at level 35).  No purpose.   RVR, although fun, has no point, no reward.   Dungeons are not itemized for Albion past level 25 or so, so there is no source of interesting weapons and armor.  Quests after level 30 are nonexistant, with the next one at 33 (it takes less than 15 minutes to complete).<br>
<br>
Another game released before it was finished, kinda like a playable Anarchy Online.  I feel 'tricked' into buying these games, because by the time you get to a point where you realize that there is no content or completion to the game, it is beyond the return date for most stores.<br>
<br>
Luckily, it's close to Christmas, and stores are VERY lenient on their return policies, especially exchanges.<br>
<br>
There's my frustrated rant.  I dislike being tricked and or conned.  When purchasing a computer game it is a disturbing trend that people are beginning to 'expect' that it will be unfinished and require time and patches before it is complete, especially in the area of online gaming. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aeglos>Aeglos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 1:04:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Age of Camelot R.I.P.  : P</span><hr size=1> /pats Rynnia on the head <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umertondraco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Devout Worshipper of<br>Rangers and Paladins...</span><br>  Posts: 742<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 1:32:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> I agree with you on one thing, RvR for the sake of RvR is pointless.  I might as well be replaying my old copy of Rainbow 6 against the computer, over and over.<br>
<br>
The value system is there in terms of realm points being handed out for kills, but that is useless unless you have something to use those points on.  As far as it stands right now, they are merely bragging rights.<br>
<br>
I also didn't like the fact that the names of the enemy players were removed from view.  They say it removes grief PKing, I say it removes bloodlust.  I'd sure want to get a second shot at an asshole who was sniping from the bushes if only I knew his fucking name.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I wanted DAoC to succeed very much.  I wanted serious competition in the MMORPG market that would contribute to development of better games.  DAoC was released at the crossroads of MMORPG industry.  On one hand you have EQ as the established leader which is slowly waning.  You also had a lot of people who were fed up with EQ and who were let down by AO.  So there was a fairly large amount of people for whom this time was sort of a crossroads.  Either the next game will be good enough to keep them hooked to the genre, or bland and generic enough for them to finally relinquish the genre.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can see people who have played EQ for close to two years and quitting and then trying DAoC.  Their interest is mild, the addiction is not as fierce as that of EQ.  Why?  Its the same shit.  Control tank aggro, chain heals, mezz mobs, farm loot, do fedex quests.  Nobody really wants to start another level 1-50 treadmill in a new game just to be replaying the same goddamn game in a different colored candy shell.<br>
<br>
I definitely think that DAoC is a better game than EQ in every regard: graphics, game play, concept, quest engines, balancing, variety.  However, at this point I expected something better than a souped up EQ, by this point in time, I expected something groundbreaking.<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont think DAoC will die, rather it will be relegated to a status that is slightly below that of EQ.  However, we will see after SoL is released.  I expect SoL to be a total PoS and I expect a massive exodus out of EQ.<br>
<br>
I still play, but not out of sheer excitement and tingly feelings.  More like I have a curiosity about the inner workings of the game  :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukulvinnawazzentme.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulvinna Wazzentme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Respect, Honour and Above All<br>Else Don't Steal My Captain's Camp</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 2:21:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.telus.net/affordablehsg/finalinsurrection/images/Kulvinna.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I agree whole heartedely<br>

<br>
Amazing reward for littlee effort leads nowhere in terms of balance.<br>
All classes being able to contribute equally in groups leads nowhere in terms of balance.<br>
Tradeskills being easy to advance in, with stunning rewards leads nowhere in terms of balance.<br>
<br>
And what is this no content thing ? I thought you all were soooooo happy in your Powahh Armor and Ray Guns (see lowlevel twinks in GF for a visual equivalent). You all looked so amazing, what do you need something to do for ?<br>
<br>
All sarcasm aside, there are things in EQ that's far from perfect. Incomplete/broken quests, a large number of very old bugs, horrific customer service and the list goes on. But AO was so broken it's beyond repair. In AO your spellcasting will still be aborted if someone else cast on you (e.g. healed while nuking) DAoC isn't that broken, but it needs a whole lot of balance added to it and loads and loads of content before you can even start comparing it to EQ. Give it time, I'm sure it'll get there someday and become a viable alternative to EQ.<br>
<br>
I hope all you who left from frustration in your level 50s enjoyed your newbie period in DAoC. But you're coming back in hordes now to start a new twink, realizing the grass wasn't greener on the other side at all.<br>
<br>
I'm not biased, I just don't believe in Santa Claus. I'll try out DAoC extensively early next year, when the game hopefully has an aura of &quot;completeness&quot; attacted to it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

No game will ever bring back the feelings you had when you first started playing EQ, after going through 20 hour camps and 4 hour CR's EQ has taken away one of the greatest emotional part of games like this, and that is fear.<br>
<br>
  Remember what it was like when you were actually afraid to go to certain places out of fear you may not be able to get your corpse back ? You can talk about all the gear you have gotten in the game and the rush you got from your first Dragon killing but the one true emotion that EQ was able to instill in you was fear. At later stages the fear lessened but they kept a little fear in you with Exp loss. <br>
<br>
  DaoC on the other hand, I believe, was designed by a committee of disgruntled EQ players. I don't fault the game, the graphics are phenomenal, but it was like they designed the game with every EQ whine in mind.  Everything that people have ever bitched about in EQ was addressed in Daoc.<br>
<br>
  In EQ : Trade skills are to hard for the reward they give you<br>
  Daoc : Trade skills are easy and can be profitable<br>
<br>
  In EQ : Cr's are a pain in the ass<br>
  Daoc : You don't even have to CR, you keep your gear<br>
<br>
  In EQ : Hard to find clerics for groups or rez<br>
  Daoc : Give tons of classes rez and healing abilities<br>
<br>
  In EQ : Only certain classes can solo, you have to group<br>
  Daoc : All classes can solo (but they do give a group bonus)<br>
<br>
  In EQ : Gear is hard to get and some people get better gear<br>
  Daoc : Gear is fairly easy to get and everyone is the same<br>
<br>
   This is just a short list of stuff I noticed in DaoC, there is more, such as quest items, but the list has to end somewere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . The point being as Walkabout astutely pointed out, is to be fun, the game CAN'T be easy. It has to be hard, you actually have to feel the fear and the dread as negative reinforcements, the bad times make the good times so much better. Are primal weapons impressive for their stats, or for what it takes to get them ? If you could buy them from vendors, would people still ooh and aah them ? Of course not, but when you see someone weilding one, you know they put a whooooooole lot of time getting to the point were they could have that, I hate to use the word &quot;Earn&quot; for an imaginary item, but yeah, you could say they did Earn it and other people know what they had to go through to get it. That is what gives value to the items in EQ.<br>
<br>
  DaoC is a great game, I met a surprising number of people there that weren't EQ players a lot of them were players from other RPG's. Those people will form the base for DaoC, I don't know if it will be enough to sustain the game but it is at least a start. As far as fixing DaoC, it can't be fixed (or at least not to were hard core EQ players would like it) The basic premise is flawed, it is for casual players and most high level EQ players are anything but casual.<br>
<br>

Hi all, former Enzo here.<br>
<br>
Did the Daoc thing, dropped EQ like the bad habit that it was.  Even gave away my account.<br>
<br>
Played a druid to 32 and a Hero to 17 in Hibernia...  started to drastically lose reasons to log on.<br>
<br>
Why ?  Well because there really aren't many reasons to.  The game was largely unfinished.  I already, at 32 mind you, had all the best drops in hibernia for any level.  This is because the higher level dungeons haven't been itemized yet.<br>
<br>
RvR was a blast !  But the exciitement wears off quickly. It's not worth anything yet because they haven't implemented any rewards for realm points and the keeps that hold the famed Relics are still bugged and can't be entered.  Even when the keeps ARE fixed and can be entered, (next patch), they are heavily defended by merely making all the guards at them instantly respawn upon being killed....<br>
<br>
Then I started missing EQ !  I miss fishing, baking, all the fluff spells like bind sight and summon fireworks, little things.  But what I missed mostly was the melee.<br>
<br>
Daoc is &quot;turned based&quot; or somethig close to it.  You take your shot, the mob takes his, you take yours again, repeat repeat.  The biggest excitement is when the mob has a 'Special' and will double hit you maybe.  It's really slow, and although the melee part is touted as taking more thought with the special attacks etc, the pace is so much slower that it really doesn't.<br>
<br>
Eq is fast and furious.  More thought involved ?  Doesn't matter, you'd better think faster that's for sure.   More thought for casters?, hell yeah.  First person view, in your face, it's truly fighting.<br>
<br>
Also when you get into Daoc more, you find out how less complicated it is than EQ programming-wise.  For instance, dexterity.  In Daoc, dex is god.  It is the ONLY stat that decides if you hit the mob or not.  So when they nerfed dex recently, all classes were drastically affected, even pets.<br>
<br>
In EQ all stats seem to affect if you hit the mob or not because they are all interrelated in a much more complex math scenario.  Level of the mob, your armor, your faction, cha, on and on.  It's a LOT more thought out.<br>
<br>
At first I thought, How nice!  I can buff dex and it actually means something !  After a bit of play you realize why EQ did it the way they did.<br>
<br>
Aside from all that, I was watching my brother and MHB cut though Kael last night.  One single giant in Kael = the single largest mob in all of Hibernia.  We had a 50 ft rat that Stormslayer could have wiped the floor with.  I miss the big fights.<br>
<br>
RvR was Daoc's shining point in their resume, and with no realm point rewards and bugged keeps and no realm balance testing to speak of, (Hibernia is losing on every server save one), I have said goodbye.<br>
<br>
Currently I sit happy on my bro's necro alt in No Ro and am awaiting Star Wars Galaxies.  For all the flaming I gave Verant, they are the best at what they do.<br>
<br>
If you doubt me, there are 2 copies of Daoc sitting unused in our house, email me and I'll send you one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 10:11:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/nosey.JPG WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=178></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Age of Camelot R.I.P.  : P</span><hr size=1> Electronics Boutique will take opened games back.<br>

That way people make friends and we all know we wouldn't be playing if it wasn't for the friends we met.<br>
Any game where you can solo, people will solo. That way you won't socialise as much and the game will get boring.<br>
Also, in EQ to achieve things you need large groups of people. Achievements feel better and take longer to get; that way people a long time to get some items.<br>
<br>
People may complain about how unbalanced classes are, how some can solo yet some can't, about how slow exp is, about casual players vs uber guilds, etc. But look how long we're playing simply because they made it take a long time to get somewhere :) EQ is geared toward group orientated high level content. That keeps the youngins playing so they can aim at being uber one day, and keeps the hardcore playing because there is much to get. <p><br><table border=0 width="350" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr>

It is the other way around.  Keep in mind that 50+ grouping in EQ, you are always hasted to almost max.  When you are not hasted, of course you're just matching a mob swing for swing.<br>
<br>
But hey, its same combat system that was employed in EQ.  <br>
<br>
/target froglok/siabra<br>
walk up to it<br>
hit attack button<br>
mash your special skills/attacks/combo buttons<br>
hope you last longer than the mob<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as for the rest of melee combat - it DOES take more thought and skill than EQ and it IS faster-paced, not slower paced as you pointed out.  Lets take grouping for example.  <br>
Say you got a full crew(8 man group).  You are likely pulling from a camp instead of wandering the land whacking shit along.  So, as you pull from a camp, you will get 3 BAF adds.  Furthermore, to keep xp flowing well, you need to pull high reds or purples (shit thats 3+ levels higher than the highest group member).  Now that you got 4 purple/red mobs running towards you, you need to sort out which mobs are getting engaged and such since mez will likely be resisted.  So you're fighting 4 mobs that are way higher than you at once.  I know when a red mob hits me once, I typically get whacked for 50 points or so.  Considering that I have only 250 hp or so, thats a decent chunk for a hit (no I dont play a caster, I play a melee).  That is much faster paced and actually involves quick reflexes on everyone's part.<br>

Where as in EQ I could walk up to a mob, hit auto-attack, go take a piss, come back, and still be fighting the same sarnak janissary.  Zero risk.  EQ doesn't force multiple adds on you, so of course it human nature to take the most efficient and safest route: single pulling with a 6 man group.<br>
<br>
Thinking in EQ?  A game that basically is built around a Cheal circle?  A game that can be successfully played with only 3 classes?  Hardly.<br>
<br>
First person view?

REALM VS. REALM FIXES AND ADDITIONS <br>
<br>
Here is a short description of Realm points, levels, and titles. There are 100 total realm levels, which are sub-divided into 11 ranks, each of which has a title and potentially a gift associated with it. When you gain your first Realm point (by engaging in RvR combat), you will be promoted to Rank 1, level 1. As you continue to fight in RvR, your next level will be Rank 1, level 2, and so forth. When you gain Rank 1, level 9, your next level gain will promote you to Rank 2, level 1. At Rank 2, you will gain a Realm Rank and a new title. You will gain these new titles and ranks at levels 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 70, 80, 90, and 100. So, you must be 10th Realm Level (Rank 2) before you will see your Realm Title change. <br>
<br>
Starting with this version, when you gain a Realm Rank, you will gain a 1 point bonus to each of your specializations per Rank. So, a player of Realm Rank 5 would have a total of +5 (i.e. one per realm rank) to all his skills. A maxed out RvR player would have a +10 to all skills. Please note that this acts just as if that player has a magic object that &quot;buffs&quot; skills - i.e. you will not get abilities awarded to you because of the bonuses, but for combat and other calculations, the buff will be included in the formula. <br>
<br>
In the (near) future, we plan on having a slightly more robust Realm Rank gifts, where you gain cash rewards for RvR combat, and at some point after that, additional skills and abilities. We'll give you all more information about that when the time comes. <br>

For me, I knew the game would be unfinished. It was rushed, Beta testers that made it to the higher levels told us that days before release. I'm just happily playing slowly, exploring the lands, doing trade skills, sprinting into dungeons to see how far I can get, playing all the different realms and classes, experimenting with different point distributions, different races. I've had the game since a couple days after release and my highest character is level 10 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I know the game sucks at high levels, so I ain't in no hurry to get past 30, and I'm still havin fun.<br>
<br>
You guys are just too danged impatient and just have to get to 50 as fast as possible <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But Mythic needs to be beaten for not providing much content for the 40plus crowd, seeing as how it's so easy to get there. Maybe if they had made experience mega slow so the highest character in Camelot is 20 right now, they wouldn't have so many people leaving. And with that, once they got the high end game finished, they coulda increases experience rates to the that of today, and it'd make everyone insanely happy and in love with Mythic cause of the &quot;super fast&quot; experience.<br>

<br>
I like pvp. However, if a game's is primarily aiming twards pvp, yet still want players to develope their characters to a certain degree, then there MUST be more content and rewards, and there must be a loss associated with it. Or, you can go with the &quot;shoot em up and spawn with full gear&quot; approach, but then you have to make developing a character A LOT less time consuming. This way you appeal to the players' sense of competition, and where individual player skill matters above all.<br>
<br>
DoAC tried a blend of the two, and it doesn't look like they found the right mix.<br>

High level content: Yes it is missing but it is also being worked on and will be in more and more soon. Next patch is bringing some of it and lots more will be in the next few months. The game is not meant to be rushed through. Power gamers will get to 35+ fast and find nothing to do. To this I say take your time and enjoy the game.<br>

RvR Rewards: Same thing, some are going in next patch with tons more on the way.<br>
<br>
As for anyone saying it sucks and it's dying. You are full of it and don't look at facts.<br>
<br>
Fact: Sold more copies in 2 weeks then EQ did in 2 months.<br>
<br>
Fact: Has more paid subscribers then most games have in a year in 2 months. 100k and climbing. (that's paid as in after the first free month)<br>
<br>
Fact: EQ had shit for high level content when it was released. It has had 3 years to add content. DAoC has only been out 2 months. <br>
<br>
I'll comment again in the spring when the expansion comes out. If it dies I will admit I am wrong. Will you admit your wrong if it is still striving and popular or will you make more excuses why it is dying?<br>

<br>
There are 2 groups this doesn't apply to - PvP lovers and casual gamers who play 3 or 4 hours a week. Other than those types, EQ is the standard and will continue to be until someone gets the point *** long term character development is key ***. I don't care how much people bitch and moan about it, long term character development is the holy grail of MMORPGs. <br>
<br>
That combined with social aspects and content, though people will play crazy amounts of time on games with little content if there character isn't maxed. It's something in human nature that demands a finish, some type of closure. If you don't get that closure, you keep playing. This is why EQ never really had an end game and I doubt they ever will.<br>
<br>
I am sure some company will make a game that will take EQ's place eventually, but they have a very high bar to clear and they will need more than flashy graphics and easy leveling. <p><br>

There were 100,000 ex-EQ people looking for something &quot;new&quot; who bought up DAoC on day-one... when EQ came along, &quot;online gaming&quot; in any sense was very new still, and certainly &quot;massively multiplayer&quot; was a concept only a small number of UO people knew about (UO had what, 65,000 subs at the time? that's nothing in publishing numbers though it was very successfull for its day).<br>
<br>
You can't possibly say DAoC is better because it sold faster - games like this only sell big initially on &quot;hype&quot; - the real numbers that matter are the turnover rate and the growth over time.  EQ grew steadily for 2 1/2 years (that's right, new players STILL coming into the game at a steady rate - mostly on word-of-mouth) and for a long time had a VERY low turnover rate.  That's a measure of success.<br>
<br>
UO and AC shared the same success, though to a lesser degree - UO saw a lot of turnover, and AC never had the big word of mouth.  It got a lot of subs initially and has stayed pretty steady - but they're not signing up tons of new people every month.<br>
<br>
Initial sales tell you very little about a MMORPG - 6 months down the line you can see how successful the game was (see:  AO - a game that sold good numbers off the shelf but didn't keep ANYONE around for very long...)<br>
<br>
And EQ had high-level content when it came out - but it wasn't tuned to a world where everyone was level 50(+).  EQ was designed to cause the average player to take a YEAR to hit 50 - many people in DAoC are approaching in with one month of play.<br>
<br>
The issue there is simple - EQ had a decent SPREAD of content upon release, and basically was tuned.  5% of the people were 42-50, 15% were 35-42, 50% were 25-35, 20% were 15-35, 10% maybe 1-15 at a given time.  If you look at EQ's (initial) content, about half the content was geared for the level 15-35 player, the rest was spread out and was thin &quot;at the top&quot;.<br>
<br>
As expansions came along, because the &quot;average&quot; player was now higher level, the zones in the expansions were geared at the 30+ player mostly.  The biggest mistake they made was making 50-60 try to take as long as 1-50 did - the result was that it felt like you didn't make any progress, and caused a lot of burnout.<br>
<br>
I'm certain that if they could release Kunark again, they'd do a 51-100 expansion instead - not change anything else, but it would have very likely helped prevent the massive burnout that the 51-60 game caused. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 473<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/1/01 1:38:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I should clarify, I predicted this would happen to players like myself who aren't heavy PvP fans...
