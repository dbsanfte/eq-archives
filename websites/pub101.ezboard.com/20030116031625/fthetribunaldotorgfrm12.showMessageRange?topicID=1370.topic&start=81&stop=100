80% of polled adults think you should be able to use marijuana legally for medical purposes.<br>
47% said they have tried marijuana at least once.<br>
72% say people arrested for possessing small amount of marijuana should be fined, not jailed.<br>

&quot;No one has ever died of THC poisoning, mostly because a 160-lb person would have to smoke roughly 900 joints in a sitting to reach a lethal dose.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Is it addictive?</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
&quot;Yes. But the risk of becoming dependent on marijuana is low. Just 9% of those who have used the drug develope dependence. By comparison, 15% of drinkers become dependent on alcohol, 23% of heroin users get hooked, and a third of tobacco smokers become slaves to cigarettes.&quot;<br>

&quot;Potheads <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dumber than non-users, but only a little. Participants of a study who had used cannabis regularly for an average of 10 years fared significantly worse on only two of forty indices of cognitive functioning (they particularly had trouble estimating time passage). But scientists can't say that marijuana causes such problems, as the long-term users 'may have been worse off in the first place'.<br>

For HIV patients, marijuana is a godsend. HIV patients have a tendency to not want to eat and what is the number one thing pot does for you besides illicit a high? It gives you the munchies. Test subjects who smoked marijuana gained an average og 6.6 lbs. during a trial, compared with 2.4 lbs. for the group taking the placebo. Marijuana is also said to curtail nausea, glaucoma, spacticity (extreme muscle tension), and pain in general.<br>

You all know WHY pot was made Illegal in the first place right? William Randolph Hearst (Founder of the San Francisco Chronical) back in about the 1880's Rallied for Hemp and Marijuana to be made Illegal, because he owned FORESTS of trees to cut down and make into paper. Yet Hemp / Marijunana was cheeper and easier to make paper. Theres your 2 bits of history. It wasn't banned due to drug use, it was banned because it was cheeper. <br>

Ok, there are thousands of different strains of pot. Five different classes: AAA, AA, A, B, and C. Sure you build up immunities to a strain over time. Once this happens CHANGE STRAINS. Pot is not the gateway drug, alcohol is. The majority of people I know drank first, then smoked, then smoked pot. <br>
<br>
I have smoked pot off and on since 1988. Sometimes everyday, sometimes going months without it. I have never lost a job because of it. I am in 4th year University, with a 3.8 GPA. I am in honours History and Political Science. I will be moving on to do my Masters degree in a few months. I WILL smoke weed, a lot of my Profs. smoke weed, and they are published, world renowned in their fields. Pot effects everyone differently. Some smoke it and veg out, others write books, plays, poetry and on and on.<br>

The way you are talking about Pot being a gateway drug makes me think that you are under the impression that all drugs have exactly the same effect on a chemical or symptomatic level, when the reality is that you are completely and totally wrong.  You don't even have the faintest clue as to the pharmacology of the drug, so don't come around pretending that you know exactly what you're talking about, because your words have shown your ignorance.<br>
<br>
As to the whole &quot;Marijuana is the gateway drug&quot; argument, I don't believe that shit.  People who do Heroin may start off doing Marijuana - I agree - but the reason for this is ease of acquiring the object.  You can't normally buy Heroin from a good 40 people on your average high school campus.  But you can easily buy weed.  It's not that marijuana makes you want or need to do harder drugs, I smoked enough weed for everyone for about 3 years, and drew the line at things requiring a lab to manufacture.  Pot never made or encouraged me to break that rule.  Now?  I haven't smoked weed in about 3 years.  Why?  Personal choice.<br>
<br>
But again, we come to the origional argument I made - if the government asserts the right to tell you what you CAN'T put in YOUR body, that's the same thing as them dictating exactly what you CAN put in.  What if the government decided that muscle mass was inherently beneficial to the survival of the human race?  Is it okay for them to tell you that you have to do a bunch of steroids every day?  No.  Why?  Because it's YOUR body.  I don't give a fuck what you do with your body, so long as it doesn't impact what I want to do with mine.  Why do you have this urge to assert your &quot;power&quot; by dictating what a person can do with themselves? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94628"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.pacbell.net/mccannk/holdan2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

Weed on the other hand, is a weed (it does exactly what it says on the bottle) and grows anywhere; thus no chance of restricting supply, no chance of taxing it etc etc...<br>
<br>
So the reasons for making it illegal were all buisness related.<br>
<br>
And dont forget that the tabacco brands have TM'd all the well know 'brands' of weed.<br>
<br>
And as for gateway drugs... Every (and they do mean every) Herion user smokes tabacco... so tabacco is the gateway to herion.<br>
<br>
The argument about gateways, is that you need to find a drug deaer to buy weed from because its illegal, and your drug dealer has also lots of other drugs to push, so when weed dries up, you take home a bag of crack. And its easier to by weed in the us as your dealer nevers cards you :-)<br>

THC activates the reward system the same way nearly all drugs of abuse do, by stimulating brain cells to release the chemical dopamine<br>
<br>
The locations of the cannabinoid receptors are most revealing of the way THC acts on the brain, but the importance of this determination is best understood in comparison with the effects of other drugs on the brain. <br>
<br>
Neurons are brain cells which process information. Neurotransmitter chemicals enable them to communicate with each other by their release into the gap between the neurons. This gap is called the synapse. Receptors are actually proteins in neurons which are specific to neurotransmitters, and which turn various cellular mechanisms <br>
on or off. Neurons can have thousands of receptors for different neurotransmitters, causing any neurotransmitter to have diverse effects in the brain. <br>
<br>
Drugs affect the production, release or re-uptake (a regulating mechanism) of various neurotransmitters. They also mimic or block actions of neurotransmitters, and <br>
can interfere with or enhance the mechanisms associated with the receptor. <br>
<br>
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is associated with extremely pleasurable sensations, so that the neural systems which trigger dopamine release are known as the &quot;brain reward system.&quot; The key part of this system is identified as the mesocorticolimbic pathway, which links the dopamine-production area with the nucleus of accumbens in the limbic system, an area of the brain which is associated with the control of emotion and behavior. <br>
<br>
Users build up a tolerance to marijuana, meaning that they need larger and larger doses of it to get &quot;high.&quot; Psychological dependence usually develops because a person's mind craves the high that it gets when using the drug.<br>
<br>
OK do you understand that?  Probably not, but ill breifly explain it, since although you apparently know how it works, you just dont feel like explaining it.  THC releases dopamine in the brain by triggering the brain's reward system, the same thing that happens naturally from eating foods, and doing other pleasurable things.  And i havent once said i believe in the gateway theory, that was someone else.  Yes you will build up tolerance to it, as your artificially keep triggering the dopamine, it will not be a pleasurable if you keep doing it, and you crave more.  You may start doing more and the same thing happens.  Once that happens, most people stay with weed because it still gives them a good feeling, but not as much as it did when they started.  Some move on to other drugs which do give them a greater feeling.  <br>
<br>
So now please explain to me how im wrong, and if i am how THC really works and what happens in the brain.. thanks <p>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22539&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hextreyre Forestarrow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>

It's actually flawed.<br>
<br>
Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) operates in the endrogenus cannabinoid system of the body, which isn't a reward sector, instead it's mood, memory, cognition, motor control, immune, appetite, and thermoregulation, upon others.  To say it hits the &quot;reward sector&quot; is to quote a theory from almost 10 years ago, when no one was sure how THC really worked.<br>
<br>
From there, you have a complicated calcium channel blocking and potassium channel acceleration regarding the CB1 and CB2 receptors, and I could go into it but it would be very confusing to you, I'm certain.  I'm not talking about what they taught you in Health class last year, I'm talking about the pharmacology of the drug.  The problem with your theory and the &quot;pleasure center&quot; or whatever the fuck you want to call it, is that it's simply not true.  It's not even remotely based in fact.  There is no evidence to suggest that your body develops an immunity to Marijuana, in fact, there is evidence to suggest quite the opposite.  If you want studies, I can look and find them.  Now we get back to my origional point...<br>
<br>
Since as you claim, Marijuana leads to harder drugs to find a high, please explain how PCP, LSD, or X would produce the same high.  Oh wait, you can't.  The pharmacology and effects of the drug are so different that your quarralation of people seeking the same high and looking to harder drugs is flat out wrong.  The only drug to have a similar effect to Marijuana would be very small doses of Opium.<br>
<br>
I didn't explain this before because I didn't think it would be worth my time.  I can go into more detail if you'd like to learn, though. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94628"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.pacbell.net/mccannk/holdan2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
As for that British Medical Journal, I already addressed this in a similar thread we have going on the Requiem board.  I'd reprint it here but it's long.  Here's the link:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://boards.thehouseofrequiem.com/viewtopic.php?t=2050&amp;start=100">boards.thehouseofrequiem.com/viewtopic.php?t=2050&amp;start=100</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Suffice it to say, the British Medical Journal only published those because of the impending legislation involving the decriminalization of marijuana in the UK right now.  If you look at my other discussion on it, you'll see the 3 'studies' themselves, and I use the word 'study' loosely, are all 3 of them are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>surveys</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  There is no root in actual scientific method, in fact it isn't followed at all.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to read the whole post that I made, skip down to the quote and follow-up paragraph at the very end, from the editorial of the BMJ itself.  You'll find a very interesting discrepancy between their studies and actual fact.<br>
<br>
Irresponsibile journalism tossed out there in the hopes of assuaging the antidrug crowd and converting the anti-prohibitionists...or as I call it, bullshit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/23/02 10:38:41 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loegan, I've solved it</span><hr size=1> You can't know anything about physiology (other than what you cut and paste from a Google search) if you spell correlation &quot;quarralation.&quot;  But do go on . . .  <p><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bnewland/sop-sig.jpg><BR>

Most do not have any sort of severe depression that needs treatment by drugs- legal drugs that is- they don't suffer from any anxiety disorder. They suffer from LIFE! 'Oh my god it's too much, I need help so I can feel comfortable while sorting these cans.' They're just average people that need to keep up their grades in school while working at McDonalds or they have some actual responsibility in life. They need artificial aid to make them feel better and get through the day without crying.<br>
<br>
Anyone agree with me that it's absolutely pathetic? In fact, I say do legalize it so I can more easily spot the wusses in life. If you're an interviewer and you spot someone out in the waiting room smoking pot, you know that he'll most likely crack under pressure if he has to work overtime in the office and he doesn't have his favorite drug nearby. Look at how rudely defensive this Josiiah person is when people insult marijuana. Pathetic? You decide. I almost feel the same way about coffee drinkers. Just poke a damned pin in your arm a few dozen times to stay awake.<br>
