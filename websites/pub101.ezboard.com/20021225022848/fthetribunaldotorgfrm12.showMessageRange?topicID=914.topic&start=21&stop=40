 Making up shit that is false, then banning people just because you have a problem with them is kinda funny, You talk about how you hate people that keep old shit post alive and post on more then one topic at a time and you think its spaming the board. Yet you do the same thing, so my going by what you call spaming and keeping shit post on top you should ban your self.<br>
 <br>
 Maybe the poeple posting on more then one topic can do more then one thing at a time unlike you and the rest of the board mod's it seems.<br>
 <br>
 I really like how you locked most of the topics on the flame board, maybe your afraid of people finding out that you guys spam just as much as the next person.<br>
 <br>
 You guys are fucking retards, with the brain size of a fucking ant, or maybe you guys just share the same one?? That my be the reason you are all little girls when it comes to grown up things.  <p><center>

Hey Valiso, what color is the sky on planet dumbass?<br>
<br>
Arleanna cannot ban anyone tiger.<br>
<br>
By spam, you drooling retard, we mean posting just for the disruption of the board. Such as posting Germany is better than USA 6 times in a row in order to cause disruption and not discussion, idea or flames. If you don't understand that, try reading it a few times.<br>
<br>
I am sorry your little ass pal Jadae has been telling you whatever little conspiracy is in his mind and you seem to take it to heart because he swallows, but he sent us e-mails asking to be banned and then started doing things to get banned when we initially refused. So we finnally gave in &amp; gave him his wish.<br>
<br>
And how fucking old are you kid? You are calling us girls because your butt pal got his wish &amp; got banned? Or is your creative ability just back in highschool? <p><BR>

I will leave your retarded post up as an example. What I have a problem with is logging on one morning to see over 50 posts spammed with a single line of stupidity, most didn't even make sense. Anything anyone was currently discussing on friday was on page 3 by the time the weekend was over. Not many people know or saw any of this because it's been fixed and the posts were returned to their original order. I spent over an hour locking the threads that were being spammed and deleting the spam then returning Friday's posts back to the top. I don't get paid for any of this, I volunteer my time to keep things in a readable state for you morons to have a place to play.<br>
<br>
Now the person who did all this wants us to think that he was just innocently bumping threads because his opinion was important. In fact, what really happened is IP logs verify the person made 4 or 5 account so he could bump old threads as fast as possible and get around the one minute posting rule ez-board enforces. Well, we banned the person and if you feel sorry for him, you are either him or more retarded than an average flameboard person.<br>
<br>
The fact that after I locked everything the person then went to the general board bumping old threads because he knew I can't do anything about the general board shows that he had no innocent intentions. He continued bumping things on the general board until the minute he was banned. He was a childish board disruptor throwing the biggest internet trantrum I've ever seen. Like I said, there is a huge difference in civil disobedience that the flameboard is built on and a tantrum that any 5 year old could associate with.<br>
<br>
You are encouraged to post your opinion here, but I disagree with you 100% that the people who are forcing mods to close old threads were innocent and we are wrong for taking action to prevent this kind of disruption again. It's really not that hard to start a new thread that references an old one that hasn't been discussed in 3 or more months. Add a hyperlink to it if you like, it really isn't that hard.<br>
<br>
You don't have to like me or appreciate the crap I have to put up with to help run this board for you guys, but I do expect you to understand that in order to do our job sometimes we have to make some new rules as this board grows larger and larger and attracts new retards with super human abilities. Sorry this new thread locking rule equals being drunk with power in your little brain, but unfortunately for you it is now policy. Please go make another tribunal board if it upsets you so much. The community here won't miss your amazingly intelligent posts. And the thread bumpers will love you.<br>
 <br>

 Your trying to pass all the blame onto one person and thats BS and you know it.<br>

Arleanna didn't say it was Jadae. Arleanna didn't even mention how funny it is that the person who was bumping up posts gets banned and then other accounts are made and tons of posts are bumped.<br>
<br>
You don't see us going over to his forum on the Druid's Grove and doing the same thing either.<br>

All we did was ban him and then deal with the attack that happened directly afterwards, which I am sure as you are was completely unrelated. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

Why dont you read the board over Ladida i think you missed somthing. The fact of the matter is you used jadae's name is your bash speech about about making the board mad. <br>

Na, you got me. I confess! I can't lie to you anymore. I did it because I'm trying to get people I don't know in trouble. And I would've got away with it too if it wasn't for you and your talking dog.<br>
<br>

I seriously hope you are just posting because you're trying to piss the mods off with this stupid act. If so, keep up the great work. You are very convincing. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

I feel the responsibility of having the power to affect someone's life so deeply is too much for me to handle. <br>
<br>
I resign as a moderator effective immediately. Although I will still keep the title, and sometimes edit posts, and make false accusations using my god-like authority, I will no longer ban people. Wait a sec, I could never ban anyone in the first place. Holy shit! Who banned Jadae if it wasn't me!? What the hell is going on here!? I feel like I'm in the middle of a conspiracy. Don't worry Valiso, I will get to the bottom of this. The people who falsely banned Jadae will not stay in power long! AT-TI-CA! AT-TI-CA!<br>

True that. Just yesterday I saw someone get falsely arrested because they had that particular IP address that was amazingly similar to the murderer's on Diagnosis Murder(Dick Van Dyke is the best).  Jadae obviously did not do it, even though he had the potential intentions, had showed his disapproval of the board, had bumped up posts for mischief in the past, and had that suspicious IP address. Unban him at once! I know moderators can ban people. Don't tell me they can't. I know what I'm talking about. I am wise like Valiso. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usarta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I guess I'm as fucking<br>clueless as Darimund!</span><br>  Posts: 401<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/02 11:52:33 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hstrial-wjohnson.hssites.com/files/sarta4.gif width=48 height=145></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bored Disruption</span><hr size=1> Valiso, you should start a petition in school to get Jadae back on here.  I'll bet if you get enough signatures it will show Arleanna and everyone else that Jadae deserves to be here, bumping old crap.<br>
<br>
Even better, go to the children's hospital closest to you and bribe a sick kid there to ask for Jadae to be reinstated as their Make a Wish!  That would do it too!<br>
<br>
Why I'll bet if you were just to punch yourself in the nuts hard enough over and over again, they would have sympathy and reinstate Jadae as well.  That's probably your best bet.  Hunger strikes are for pussies.<br>

Wtf was rynnia banned for then?  I thought he was the one bumpin threads.  And what kind of retard would send email asking to be banned?  Why not just not post?<br>
<br>
Valiso, you're way off base, with the possible exception of Rynnia's banning depending on the reason behind it.  If people do disruptive shit that isn't funny, they deserve to be banned.  Disruptive shit that is funny is acceptable.  Unfortunately, what is funny is a subjective thing, so the mods get to pick.  Someone bumping threads to be a dick deserves to be banned, and someone posting the same thread over and over deserves to be banned.  Why?  Because it leaves the mods with 2 options: spend time fixing it, thereby inconveniencing themselves, or leave it alone, thereby inconveniencing all the flameboard readers.  <br>
<br>
I for one am glad they fixed the bumped posts, when it happened i loaded the flameboard, read the top topic, was like wtf, bowynn is back?? Then I saw the date, closed the thread, saw that all the posts had been posted to in like 30 second increments, and closed the flameboard.  It wasn't worth it to me to wade through all that crap to find the current stuff, and I'm sure many other people felt the same way.<br>
<br>
Also, while Arleanna and Ladida may not be funny at all, they do donate a significant amount of time to keeping this board readable.  That doesn't mean don't flame them, just bear in mind that they do it.  <br>
