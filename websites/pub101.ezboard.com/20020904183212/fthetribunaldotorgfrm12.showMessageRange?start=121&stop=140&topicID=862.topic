Hes upset, and just spiraling.<br>
<br>
Loegan, there are seperate forums for this single purpose, when you want to have a civillized discussion, you cannot do that with someone talking about how he is gonna kick the shit out of you and how you are a fag and a wussy. If you want to have a huge discussion about the banning of cloning, wouldnt it be better to actually to be able to read the discussion and not let it degenerate into people just flaming your hypocritical ass. It goes from presenting the issues to actually flaming the person, or shooting the messenger and not the message. Its very easy to attack the messenger when you really cannot attack the issue at hand. <br>
<br>
Forums are seperate to allow people who do not want to be run over by a steamroller but would like to take part in certain conversations without the fear of being made fun of. Some people are shy, but they have some good point but they are never heard because they feel the flameboard is a place where they will get hurt, or maybe made fun of, and I promise you, no intelligent conversation ever happens on the flameboard as much as you want to believe. The flameboard is like trying to hold a debate while surrounded by cages of fecal throwing monkeys. Serious discussion is often lost in a cloud of hatred and cruel responses which have nothing to do with the issue at hand.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if you feel you must post your issues in the flameboard because you fear no one else would follow you to another board to discuss this, but if as you say, people like you and your posts, then they would and should follow you to another forum where you can discuss this like adults.<br>
<br>
What you fail to see Loegan is that you are becoming a crusader against nothing &quot; Its bigger then me &quot;, no Loegan, you arent defending the little guy versus the big bad moderators, you are simply upset that someone would dare to move your post, and whatever you want to believe, this is all about you, you are a very self righteous prick.<br>
<br>
I am so happy you can choose to change your opinion whenever you want but you always act like you are a man of conviction, but you arent, your spine is jello, bending which ever way the wind blows. I am estatic you had a discussion about quitting with a friend, I am happy someone was actually shocked by your fake goodbye post that you used to illicit sympathy. Cause you really need attention now Loegan, you sound like you need someone to acknowledge your hard work on this flameboard and all your countless hours of posting. Without you Loegan this board would be nothing, yes its true, without your presence this board would of folded a long time ago, I praise god that you were here to keep such a broad array of topics going. You are key to the flameboard as you are the pussy hypocrite who changes their opinion when they get scared, you are integeral to this board, so from me to you, dont leave Loegan, I take it back, we need an ass monkey like you. You are the court jester in this wonderful flameboard kingdom, now keep dancing you crazy fool. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 924<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/13/02 2:28:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goodbye</span><hr size=1> Thanks DM. I can always count on you to play the asshole. I just sometimes wish you weren't so damn good at it. You have serious issues.<br>
<br>
I gave up, what more do you want? The facts don't matter. You single me out of all the others who agree. You can't attack my arguments on only one post ever being moved (2 that don't count, because it wasn't due to content) or that it is done unevenly or that I even have a valid point.<br>
<br>
So you do the only thing left to you and attack my charcter, make up BS about flip flopping and whatever else.<br>
<br>
This is your flameboard. This is what you enjoy. This is why you hate what I was fighting for so much. God forbid you have to skip a post that actually has content.<br>
<br>
You fuckin won. Congrats. Now fuck off and take you brilliant arguments to those who swallow BS like it was fact. <p><br>

It seems to be a rather simple one.  <br>
<br>
If certain conversations were held here, they would devolve:<br>
<br>
Person 1:  Give emperical evidence supporting evolution.<br>
<br>
Person 2:  YPUR MOHER'S A WHORE!<br>
<br>
At the same time, some people come here to be told that their mother's a whore.  They get bored by long drawn out conversations regarding topics like stem cell research.  While it is true that they can always stop reading certain threads, it becomes a chore if there are too many of such threads to avoid.<br>
<br>
Personally, I like the fact we have several different forums.  I find it makes it easier to read what I want to read.<br>
<br>
Then again, I have never had problems with understanding the concept behind subdirectories.  Seems that you feel that moving something to a different folder = deleted.<br>

I, for one, would like to see the board as a whole as more respectable place. And I , for one, want to make sure the community is treated with equality. <p><center>

<br>
But I think I agree with Loegan...this is the only forum I check while on this board, this and the general discussion, sometimes the pawn shop.  I didn't even know people use the other forums on here, truthfully I don't think I've ever even visited them.  <br>
<br>
So if he had something he wanted to say and wanted people to read it, I think he was right for posting here.  As to the point about this being the proper forum for any topic...you know anything posted here will devolve into a flamewar anyways, so what the fuck difference does it make if it's not guideline flameboard material.<br>
<br>
And wanting to make this a respectable place?  You dumb fucks have played the leathered gimp so long you lost touch with reality.  Go get some whitener, clean the cum stains off your teeth, and smile a nice smile to anyone who posts whatever they want here...<br>

You mean like the general forums if it's not found in the flame forum, right?<br>
<br>
-Other than that are people trying to get me off the FB? If they want me gone, let em say so and I'll leave.-<br>
<br>
I haven't seen anything about booting your ass, then again I'm not the admins, but if your ass was persona non grata here, you would already be banned.<br>
<br>
-Why kiss the ass of somebody who has hated the Flame Board from day one and who has done a ton of shit to discourage it's success?-<br>
<br>
How is having an opinion different from yours kissing Muse's ass? What is the ton of shit to discourage it's success? The only thing I can think of was to move it down from right beneath the general section, but all that did was make me scroll down 1 inch to see it. Unless you think her statements about not liking the idea of a flameboard are equal to a ton of shit...<br>
<br>
If youre going to leave, then have the balls to do it and leave. 7 pages of you trying to eek out the martyr hasn't gotten you the support you desired, or the revolutionary spirit to throw off the mantle of oppression. <p><img src="http://www.guardians.d2g.com/sigs/raidin.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 926<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/02 1:10:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goodbye</span><hr size=1> Estevan, you have the morals of a fuckin natzi.

She was upset and talking about quiting the board from getting a bunch of shit from a person who I won't name and since the topics were all muddled together, I thought she was talking about this.<br>
<br>
She hadn't read the thread and was only getting second hand info and thought I flamed her, (which I did not) and that people were ready to jump on her shit about it.<br>
<br>
She did what she thought was right, plain and simple, and since she doesn't make policy, it has nothing to do with her.<br>
<br>
As to the segregation thing, you guys see it one way, I see it another. On the old board, people were exposed to each other like it or not and as a result, got to see views they would not have gone in another section looking for.<br>
<br>
I mean, c'mon. You put congrats in a seperate section because you are afraid they'll turn into flame wars? How sad is that? You put RL away from general for what reason? Maybe we should make a section for those who play days and those who play nights. Course then the ones who play both could jump back in forth. How about a section for Ubers and one for those who haven't raided ToV-N. After all, what uber wants to see what a low guild posts. What a hassle.<br>
<br>
Anyway, let's just let this thing go. I won't post any threads to get moved and won't bring this up again if you don't. Sounds like a good deal to me.<br>
