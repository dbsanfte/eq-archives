The hate list is only so long, so eventually his name cycles off. If however, he hit the AoW before or on the inc to SI, the AoW would still actively seek him out, and feigning wouldnt always work. Sorry Makino, stop trying to be the god of knowledge, considering what I said was pretty acurate, basically you repeated what I said.I say you hit AoW, feigning doesnt always work, You say no, you hit AoW and are engaged, feigning doesnt always work. It is in fact, once you hit him, you are on his hate list, and if no one moves you off by taking your place, he can remember you, or if you dont successfully feign and shake off his aggro which is pretty tough, he can and will often remember you and come barrelling for you. If you are feigned and laying on the ground before engaging there is a small ass chance he will see through a feign, but most times it is when you feign during a pull, some rare cases when on a pull a monk can be feigned and the AOW sees the monk as sitting. The AoW is one of those mobs who can and will see through feigns at odd times.<br>

Actually I was hoping to convey you guys are really fucking stuck on this. Who fucking cares, really, AoW was trained on us, it wasnt pulled you cannot accept that, probably emailed verant asking Blaaze to be dismissed and to review this situation. You lost, plain and simple. I find it funny as shit, you guy get all spastic when we metion Coacoa inspected her way to the SK champion, and tell us to get over it, she won, but you cannot accept you lost on this one and want to find every angle to try to make it plausible that EV screwed you. Sorry get over yourselves, we enjoy fucking with you, but we didnt this time, we gave you a clean shot, it got fucked up by a) you, or b) someone else other then us. So pull your collective whining heads out of your asses and go play the game. <br>
<br>
<br>
Omg Mindee your logs rock, you said we an EYE in there, OMG, OMG, OMG, OMG, it might make a difference if you could aggro with those eyes, but you cant, so it was a safe way to check how bad you were fucking up the pull and seeing how far along you were. Dont be upset you couldnt pull him properly, we all have had trouble doing it, hes a bitch, but there is a secret, or is it sekrit ( cool SI talk ) to pulling him. I could share it with you but why deny you the joy of learning.<br>

WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF, we gave you what happened, stop trying to concoct a story to paint EV as the big bad guy. You had a clear shot, we stayed out of any aggro range, unless of course some fucked up noobs were trying to get faction or farming one side of the arena and aggroed AOW on us, OH SHIT thats what happened. No giants were up as we cleared them during your last fight with idol ( woot finally, congrats guys ).  Stop trying to spin a tale in which SI is screwed out of AoW by EV, you got screwed out of it, but not by us.<br>

Translation: Blaaze has to be friends with Mojak from going to Fan Faire and thats not fair because me and my friends are hiding in my room looking at dirty magazines during fan faire. Rynnia this is really a cheap blow to Blaaze, to say she wouldnt do her job, to question her skills because she made a decesion against you. Thats pretty lame, and pretty weak. You are basically saying the GMs are against you. Thats called paranoia, that is what happens when you spend your entire life &quot;hunting people down&quot; for fun and playing viglante. You are a twisted fuck, I said it before, and will say it again. This is just more proof. Can I see the draft of the email you sent verant regarding this matter and how you are demanding Blaaze step down, cause I just know your pathethic ass sent one. You sound like a whining noob when a guide tells you are wrong. You throw your fists up saying, NO NO NO, listen to me, listen to me, keep listening to me until you say I am right.

Because the GMs were standing by us, watching us to see if we moved or aggroed the AOW, they werent watching you guys pulling, but in fact where patrolling us. We did nothing wrong, didnt aggro anything, we were being watched, yet in your demented mind you believe we did something when we had them watching us, and not you. Why where they watching us? cause your whiney asses petitioned once we entered the zone. <br>
<br>
You guys might talk about guilds getting along, but in reality, it has to be SI's way or no way at all. You always feel you are right in every situation and if you are proven wrong you make up some wonderful story to say how such and such is wrong.  <p><center>

1.  Crush never speaks in OOC.  not even when EV was two seperate guilds doing raids and using OOC/Shout for communication.  <br>

I have never ever seen the AoW see through a FD when he was not actively engaged.  The way I see it, AoW just ignores the fix to the FD bug that plagued us monks for oh 2 years or so.  You do remember that FD bug don't you?  When they fixed the bug, I theorize that some sick developer made sure AoW ignored the fix.  Or it could be he wasn't fixed for this bug by accident.<br>
<br>
For those who don't know or can't remember what the bug was, it was such that a mob would ignore FD even though you con indifferent when the mob was actually engaging PCs or being engaged by PCs (ie actively swinging)  It was also noted that these mobs would recognize FD when not being engaged.  And from what I experienced, AoW follows this pattern exactly.  If you are trying to tell me that they wrote all new code for FD just for AoW and all other subsequent &quot;uber&quot; mobs have been deemed as not worthy of having this code as well, you must be high.  Again, I point to the FD bug that existed well before AoW.<br>
<br>
Now if you can somehow demonstrate to me how a monk all by themselves can fd by AoW and still get whacked even though they were successful, well then i will be convinced you are not wrong.<br>
<br>
And no, I don't consider myself the goddess of knowledge, but I have been playing a monk awhile, longer than you I know, and when i see incorrect info, I call it.  If you want we can take it to monkly-business :P <p><hr>
