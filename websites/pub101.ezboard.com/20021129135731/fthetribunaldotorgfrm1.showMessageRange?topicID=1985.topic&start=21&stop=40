<br>
You want to argue he made a special connection to you, then fine, why post here? I could understand if someone from EQ died from this server, but because you posted that this person will sorely be missed, I asked by who. <br>
<br>
I dont mourn celebritites because of what they did, I mourn the loss of life, but dont give them anymore special consideration because they put out a record, or they were in a movie. I personally find it insulting that American servicemen are dying overseas and I dont see you post their names, I dont see you mourning them, No, I see mourning some one who squandered his life apparently with drugs.<br>
<br>
I dont understand why people latch onto to celebrities or sports stars. More so when they die I can understand being sad but to actually want to meet up and mourn them, what does that show? That their life is more important then yours because they hum a few bars or music, or they could play some instruments? No. <br>
<br>
Why do you discount how important your next door neighbor is only to idolize someone you only know through their music. I would be more touched if you knew this guy, or this was some random slob from your neighborhood that you felt you should pay tribute to. But you didnt know him, a friend of a friend of a cousin of sister's roomate did. What does that make you? Why live your life through someone elses?<br>
<br>
No one is saying dont enjoy his music, dont pretend to tell me his life is more valuable then anyone else's because he sung a few songs.<br>
<br>
I am all for being empathic for people dying, but I detest people placing higher value on a celebrities life.<br>
<br>
If you want a real celebrity, try following the career of a young man or woman serving this country, getting shot at and getting killed so you can sit here whine about some rock star. At least the servicemen and women are protecting you, fighting for you, this singer didnt give a shit about you. He didnt care if you listened to his music or not, he only wanted ya to buy his record so he could afford another dimebag.<br>
<br>
You think thats immature and insensitive, then yeah, I would rather mourn a soilder defending me overseas then some drugged up &quot;artist&quot; who decided that wasting his life was a good choice, I would rather mourn the firefighters and police who give their lives everyday making my world safer, then some fucking moron who doesnt care about me. Those people put their lives on the line without knowing me, to protect me, the man you cry for, didnt give a shit about you, and his family doesnt give a shit that you cry for him now. <br>
<br>
And for the record I wasnt going after Enzo, I like Enzo's point. <p><center>

<br>
When my neighbour died, I talked to my other neighbours about it, because we all knew her. I didn't go talk to strangers on the other side of town because they wouldn't know who I was talking about.<br>
<br>
The difference here is that the person is a celebrity. Post it on a message board and chances are good that at least some of the people are going to know who you are talking about and maybe some of them cared about the music like you did.<br>
<br>
Look, when a performer dies, that means his/her contribution is gone. There are no more great works of art just like Beethovens work. There is good stuff to be sure, but it is not his unique work. That is the loss.<br>
<br>
Do you think there will ever be another Pink Floyd? Boston? Jimi Hendrix? Fleetwood Mac? Johnny Cash? Hank Williams? Once these artists are gone (as some of them are already), that's it. For those of us who listen to their music regularly, that is a loss.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how you can infer that this guy doesn't care about his neighbours or the soldiers in Afghanistan  or that he thinks this man life is worth more, just because he makes a post mourning the loss of a performer.<br>

He may of used drugs, but atm they are not sure what killed him. Untill they say he died of some drug use then to me he died because of some health condition that he nor his friends and family knew he had. Only reason I did post on here is for other people that might like the band and also play everquest. And so what if I don't visit this board alot or post on here 24/7 like most of you do that have no life other then everquest or posting on this board even after you stopped playing everquest 6 months ago. <br>
<br>
Thank you Loegan for saying what I havent said.  But I guess it was a bad idea to post on this board since all everyone here likes to do is flame something, or talk it down. So excuse me for sharing some information.<br>
<br>
If Oolong or Darkmask were to die tonight would I care? Would you? I would care for both, i know Oolong in real life but I don't know darkmask nor do I talk to him in game if he even still plays (I have no clue). But I would miss them because they both are artists, not because oolong is also My best friend in RL. I would miss him for both reasons, I would miss darkmask because of the art he brought to the community, and I am sure he is a great guy.  Not because they are so to speak celeberties of our server because of their art. <p><br><br><br><br><br><center><img src="http://www.phatmatt.net/~gove/logo.jpg"><br>

They wont get me again if I can help it. And I have no qualms with her finding out I think she is a royal bitch, the truth is a painful thing. And yes I guess my perception is my reality, but then why is it everyone's elses perception that she is a bitch also?
