<br>
On whether or not he actually has WMD?  I suspect he does in small quantites.  Im almost sure his links to Al'Qaeida are very weak and are defintely weaker than Saudi Arabia and Pakistans links to Al'Qaeida.  Attacking Iraq weakens Al'Qaeida not at all.  And it certainly makes for a great recruitment poster for them.<br>

<br>
I'm sorry, but I have to give you the &quot;he used them&quot; argument. It's the Middle East sir. He's not supposed to have them, pure and simple. You can't have a crazed leader of a country in the Middle East, who has used these weapons in the past, hiding banned weapons that he can easily use for whatever purpose he wishes. This particular part of the world is full of nuclear capability, religious bickering, region disputes. The answer to your question involves simple common sense. We used them ourselves in Vietnam, yeah whatever, Vietnam sucked. The difference between us and he is we have no reason to use them now. Saddam does. We are not crazy or stupid enough to use them on 'terrorists' or 'enemies' in our own country. Saddam is. We do not have an enemy country that we'd love to gas or nuke the hell out of. Saddam does. We have no reason to hide the fact that we have nuclear and chemical weapon capability, have free access to potential biological weapon capability. Saddam does.<br>

If your definition of &quot;permission&quot; is something like giving someone a can of gas, a cigar, a motor scooter and a book of matches, and this person throws out the cigar and the scooter and uses the gas and the book of matches to burn down an apartment building, then yes we gave Iraq permission to  murder countless people with chemical weapons. I agree. If however your definition of &quot;permission&quot; is the more common formal consent, then no, that ain't the case. It's nothing but people hoping and struggling to find something horrible about the US so they can spread their anti-war/anti-us/anti-bush ideas to the unsuspecting victims of blown up propaganda and lies.

<br>
First of all you must realize that we would not be attacking Iraq to weaken Al Qaeda. That is not the point of the lines being drawn. The links between Iraq and Al Qaeda being brought up are only for demonstrating that Iraq dabbles in terrorist activities, which gains support from the international community for a possible invasion(that was what was supposed to happen anyways). The Al Qaeda links are indeed weak and would have little if any effect on the terrorist organization, but that just ain't the point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And it certainly makes for a great recruitment poster for them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Everything the US does makes a great recruitment poster for them. We build up the WTC site again, 200 want to join Al Qaeda so they be involved with the plan to bring it back down again. The president expresses his sadness over 30 people dying of a suicide attack in Israel, 500 people wish to join Al Qaeda for showing further admiration for Jews. We attack Iraq for hiding banned weapons and not giving them up, Iraqi officials lying every second of every day with cruel intentions, 1000 want to join Al Qaeda so they can kill an American working in a health clinic in Pakistan or spread a few chemicals over a city via crop duster. It's a lose-lose situation, we're going to suffer consequences either way. We may as well right the wrongs, whether the wrongs fully rest on Saddam's shoulders or partially rest on ours, and attempt to add at least an ounce of stability in the middle east and take out one more murderous world leader.<br>

Congratulations on being a complete tool.  And a spineless, witless one at that.  Congratulations on being so intellectually devoid that you can only envision one scenario and then discount it, thereby fueling your whole viewpoint.  <br>
<br>
Our nation's leaders don't have to bribe anyone, it's called 'non-disclosure' or 'need-to-know' moron.  You don't have to force someone to be quiet if you never tell them anything in the first place.  Oh but you're right...the anthrax here shows that chemical weapons from Iraq could come here also.  Of course, to believe in that you have to disregard the FACT that the pure, weapons-grade anthrax in those mailings was made right here in the good ol' USA at Fort Detrick and mailed from right here in the good ol' USA.  What, now you'll tell me it was Iraqi sleeper agents over here that did it?<br>
<br>
I like how you twist stuff around though, you're quite adept at muddling facts.  It's particularly interesting to know that the UN has pledged full support when two countries with total veto power are still against any invasion.  Nicely done.  I also like how you've elevated Hussein to the status of 'most heinous mass murderer in the history of the world'.  22 million people huh?  Where'd they come from? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Great. Now if you could show some documentation on that. I'm sure I would have heard about it on the news...the way they like to talk. Until then, you speak fluff to me.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Like the way Hussein has almost quadrupled the number of Holocaust victims - surely that would've been on the news?  Perhaps you should know what the fuck you're talking about before not only making long ass tripe-filled posts but also before embarassing yourself like this.  You should also learn to read what's written in front of you before adding your own slant on it.  Or perhaps I'm wrong -- could you go back and give me the quote where I said I 'support a regime by ONE MAN'?  Thanks, I appreciate it.  By the way, here's the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> thing you said that has any merit:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Where is your evidence that proves that the information given to the UN is made up? Where is the information that proves that the weapons have been destroyed? There is none.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You're absolutely right.  Now, let me ask you: Where is your evidence that proves the information give to the UN is factual?  Where is the information that proves the weapons haven't been destroyed?  There is none.  Otherwise we'd have found the weapons, wouldn't we?  And please don't say the evidence is corroborated by detainees...if I was tortured for weeks on end I'd probably crack and admit to everything from being the second gunman on the grassy knoll to skull-fucking Mary Poppins singing 'A dickful of semen helps the nanny go down'.<br>
<br>
Telk - you're right, obviously if we showed juicier pictures and said 'we have sources' Saddam would know right away who out of his 22 million people it was and we'd lose them.  Of course, when we evacuate them before we start carpet/nuclear bombing the country they'll know also, won't they?  Maybe we'll just leave them there to be fried.  Again though, you're assuming any of it is real.  I don't.  You're probably the same class of sheep that decried Saddam the first time around when the 'intel' was shared about his soldiers taking babies out of incubators and throwing them on the hospital floors.  Fuck, you might just be the kind of person that still believes that story - that's fine for you.  For the rest of us, I'd like to see some confirmation.  To me, the biggest affirmation that everything we said was devoid of fact is that Hans Blix came out the next day and denied most of it.  Let me guess, our intelligence is superior though cause it has to be, right?  This whole setup is a joke.  If you're too unwilling or too patriotically fervent to see it, fine -- but don't try to say I'm stupid or fallacious in my reasoning just because I can.  Oh, and Germany, Russia, Turkey now, France, and the score of other nations who won't go without a UN resolution. Fuck the world, fuck the economy, fuck the UN...oil here we come!<br>

Are you somehow more high than usual? Certain people know certain specific details. It doesn't take a super computer to narrow down the results.

Sheep. In your mind I suppose everyone who believes one thing the government says is a sheep, as you force yourself to doubt every single thing.<br>

FYI I didn't buy into much of that sort of stuff. The American propaganda machine is capable of great things and I don't blindly buy into every example of horrible human behavior that's put out during war time. I do buy into facts. I do buy into what is shown to the entire world, the government knowing full well that the evidence will be scrutinized and looked into and checked and checked and checked and checked again. I do buy into the obvious. You buy into whatever is controversial and will get people to pay attention to you on the flameboard. I ain't the sheep here.<br>

While I totally agree that it isn't quite the same thing as nerve gas, I really don't think that it should be argued that it was just another form of Round Up.  Defoliant my ass.<br>

To this day GW still has not come close to providing a good reason for his war.  Not even close.   The conservative right has always tried to keep an enemy for the American people to hate as a smokecreen to the real issues.  Iraq is no more a threat to the U.S. than Libya.  <br>
<br>
Count....  You would serve your cause better cheering in the background instead of being a spokesperson.  Your invitation to go swear allegiance to Saddam is ridiculous.  Give us all a break, the conservative clowns said about the same thing during the Vietnam War.  Seriously, no one here ever said Saddam is a good guy, just that the U.S. has no concrete reason to invade at this time.  You basically say if I am not backing the current president, I should go to Iraq.  I suppose you moved to Kosavo during the Clinton years correct?    <br>
<br>
Your claim that for 12 years under Clinton the U.S. was vulnerable to being defeated is also ridiculous.  Because he was against the Joint Strike Fighter?   That plane was originally a 200 billion (billion = 1000 million) contract currently estimated at $379.9 billion &amp; guaranteed to go way higher.  WOAH!  We better cut taxes so we can pay for it.    No country in the world boasts anything like the extraordinary numbers of combat-ready fighters the United States has in its inventory.  We don’t need the Joint Strike Fighter, it's too expensive, &amp; is nothing but more corporate welfare.   Our defense budget is way out of hand &amp; getting worse under GW.  <br>
<br>
GW’s foreign policy is making enemies of the last friends we had in the Middle East &amp; it’s only going to get worse.  Moderate Muslims see an invasion of Iraq as an attack on their religion &amp; culture &amp; cause them to turn even more against us. <br>
<br>
al-Qaida’s best recruiter is George W. Bush.  <br>
<br>
Do you pro-war people truly believe that if Saddam had any deployable chemical/biological/nuclear weapons that the Mossad wouldn’t know about it &amp; Israel would have already attacked &amp; destroyed it?<br>
<br>
Kreese.  What does a Liberal stand for you ask?  I can only speak for myself.  <br>
<br>
I believe that the power of the federal government does supersede local.  That is what the Civil War was about.  Last person I want in charge is the local moronic politicians.  <br>
<br>
I believe in the separation of church &amp; state. This is a multi-cultural country, face it.  <br>
<br>
I believe in reproductive rights for woman, including abortions.  <br>
<br>
I believe that the only way to have elected officials that actually represent the people is to take ALL private money out of the electoral process.  Want to know who is in charge?  Follow the money.  I am sick &amp; tired of Republicans &amp; Democrats that are bought &amp; paid for by Corporate America.  <br>
<br>
That one of the jobs of the government is keeping corporate greed in check.  Anti-trust was created for a reason, use it.  <br>
<br>
Corporations are not only responsible to the shareholders, they are responsible for the people that actually do the work, their employees.  If they do not treat their employees fairly, they shouldn’t be surprised that the employees organizing.  The government has no business hindering unions.  People don’t join unions without a reason.  Profits are good, share them.<br>
<br>
The crime rate went down not as a result of more prisons &amp; harsher punishments, but as a result of the aging population.  My wildly speculative estimate is that 30% of our prison population could be slowly released under a well-funded parole system.  Face it, we lost the war on drugs.  Speaking of the lost war, the time has come for the decriminalization of drugs.  Over a trillion dollars &amp; I can still drive a few miles &amp; score a rock or a balloon.  <br>
<br>
I could go on &amp; on but I got to keep this job I got after I graduated from college.  Thankfully I graduated during the fifth year of Bill Clinton’s presidency &amp; was able to get it.  <br>
<br>

<br>
What's your point?  Do you realize that the UN has just about wrapped up its case?  That it is just about ready to give its resolution in favor of the U.S.?  Current status with the UN is that its going to allow the U.S. to act...as long as France doesn't veto.  Why?  Because almost all the nations in the UN recognize Iraq as a threat the the well being of the world, hands down you can't argue that one because if that wasn't the case then the UN wouldn't be doing what it is doing now...and saying just that as well.  The UN publicly recognizes this threat.  Most likely France will abstain a vote, if not then vote in favor of war.  The UN has just about given up hope as it is...but it still presses on to do the best it can.  Just about every country in the UN is willing to allow war to happen if Hussein doesn't give his weapons up....and he won't-trust me on that one.  Turkey is a BIG ally to the U.S.  G'luck to trying to prove that war isn't going to happen, or that its wrong....when you have most of the world's leaders disagreeing with you.  I'll believe them over you any day.<br>
<br>
&quot;oil here we come!&quot;<br>
<br>
I already stated...post some evidence that thats the U.S. motive.  Quit saying shit like that because each time you do, i have to respond to it.  Until you show documents drawn up on how the oil is going to be effectively &quot;stolen&quot; or &quot;misused&quot; you ain't got shit to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;Count - wow, I got to hand it to you...I've never seen a faster 180.<br>
<br>
-you have no evidence he wants the oil at all, none - motive is not evidence<br>
<br>
-I've posted 5 articles about our plans to seize the oil<br>
<br>
-Oh. Well what's wrong with that? It's normal and fair to seize the treasures of a country once you invade it! Killing people isn't free you know!&quot;<br>
<br>
And this is how you show you are incapable of arguing in this discussion.  There isn't even a 1 degree turn, let alone 180 in what I said, reread it and then go away without posting...get into deep thought, and tell me how you were wrong and you understand now.  Until then, don't post.  By the way, you completely reworded the quote...which is not only unfair, but also much worse is it's against the law, defined as &quot;slander&quot;.  The fact that you are willing to intentionally misquote someone shows that you have no say in this argument any further...and from now on I will refuse to respond to anything you have to say...I have no need to argue against you any further you scum.  Everything you say from this point on is irrelevant and worthless, even if it might have had a point...good day.<br>

I read it.  The person writing it obviously has a one-sided opinion about the things that occurred, but I read through it respecting that opinion.  Unfortunately, in the end his opinion is fatally flawed.  I respect the fact that yes, I see how the Israeli military might have caused what are called &quot;inhumane acts of violence&quot; on palestinians.  But, what I do keep in mind is the fact that the Palestinians are the ones that won't sign off the a peace treaty...not the Israelis.  In a full out war, both sides commit actions that are considered wrong by many people outside of the conflict.  The Israelis are the ones willing to negotiate for peace...Arafat wants peace...but cannot control his own people.  That is clear.  <br>
<br>
As for how this all started...its the oldest land in human history.  Technically speaking, the Jews own that land more than any other race/religion because they have been there before any others...strictly based on time.  The Jews were the one that were willing to move around and be nomads in order to keep peace...which makes this veil of grey area that makes it seem like they don't have claim to the land and instead the muslim populations do.  When the Israeli state was created...it was created to give the Jews a part of their homeland...and to share that homeland with another culture...who would also have their own homeland.  The intentions were good, the results were not.  Its a conflict that will never end until the Palestinians are willing to give up at least a portion of the land that they enjoyed without willing to share.  The burden is on the Palestinians, not the Jews, not the Israelis.  Its a tough decision to let go of something, especially if its just for simple little ole peace. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1518.topic&start=221&stop=229>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1518.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1518.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1518.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1518.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1518.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1518.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> -
