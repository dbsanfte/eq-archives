In comes quezar (not known at the time but later find out valero was playing him).  Quezar comes in and attempts to cast something (from looks at the spell looked like mez) on Glisterin(the mage) and his pet aggroes, quezar runs out behind the cage.  I ask quezar if he wants to duel because I was anoyed at him attacking glisterin and he says &quot;haha no&quot;.  I'm like ok that's cool then I was at 90% about rdy to go when he runs in and tries to mez me.  I'm like wtf ok i won't do anything since i'm almost rdy for the mage, then he tries again, and a third time.  Now here's my question, from this point WHAt would you have done?<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok well here's what i did.  I mez'd quezar, tapped him a few times tash'd him and triple dot'd him, he gated otu before he died and got killed at his bind causing him to loose exp(which he wouldn't have if he died in the arena)  Then he proceeds to argue with me and call me an asshole for killing him.  I then ask why he was trying to mez me.  He says he was trying out his new mez, I replied that I was sorry I must of missed his tell about him telling me this.  He said he never sent it.  I asked him how he expected me to know this, i got no reply.  Then he proceeds to tell me to never talk to him again.<br>

Yeah, he attacked you without warning.  Not once, but Three times in the arena, and didn't offer an explanation.<br>
<br>
Sure, maybe he was trying out his new mez.  Maybe he just wanted a free fly by ganking.  How were you supposed to know?  Wait, you couldn't have known.<br>

<br>
First of all, Arcibu isn't saying the whole truth.  Quezar is my character, and I had just purchased &quot;Apathy&quot; the new level 61 spell mez.  I was testing to see the duration, that was all.  I casted it on Glisterin, a former EV member and someone who I knew in the past.  His pet immediately attacked me so I ran out of the arena but in the chaos of his pet I lost track of the timer.  I didn't land anything else on him either, just the new mez spell, Apathy.<br>
<br>
Second of all, I did not die with Quezar.  Arcibu thought I did but I gated out when I had 5 DoT's on me and you know what happens when you gate out with low Hp's, all buffs are stripped and you are fine.  She had Tash, Fetter, and 5 DOT's on me while I tried to cast ONE spell on her which was Apathy.  By the way, it also resisted her as well.  Then she immediately mezzed me with Rapture, and landed all of these debuffs on me with the root.  When I was rooted and Rapture wore off, I tried to mez her again with Apathy so that I would be able to memorize Gate.  Resisted again, so I kept trying to sit in my spell book trying to mem Gate while she is landing all of these DoT's on me heh.  Finally had it mem'd and gated just before I was about to die.  Also...I told her repeatedly in tells not to kill me and I did not want to duel.<br>
<br>
The whole point is, yes I know we were in the Arena.  She asked me if I wanted to duel and I said no.  I thought that was enough indication that I wasn't wanting to duel...but nope <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1117">Marshall Valero Forceblade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
So'd you tell her that you were just testing the spell in those tells saying that you did not want to duel? Or no? If you did then being attacked by her was a bad thing. If you didn't then it's unfortunate but understandable that you were attacked by someone with an intent to kill.  That's the main question in which the answer will reveal who is right I think. And we all have to know who is right in this situation. It's very important.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chantci>chantci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/2/02 10:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What would you have done?</span><hr size=1> Give her/him/it a big hug for they are obviously misunderstood..

<br>
Yeah... even you, eh?  Even a serious fucking badass such as yourself doesn't mess with Valero, so everyone else shouldn't.  I mean, you are the pinnacle of &quot;cool&quot; and the absolute definition of &quot;tough.&quot;  Next to the word &quot;superior&quot; in the dictionary is your face.  When you talk, people listen.  When you are quiet, people hold their tongues in anticipation of what your greatness might say at any moment.  You can tame wild animals with a single glance, and you have not one, but TWO massive cocks which you have to drape over your shoulder to walk anywhere.<br>
<br>
You, sir, are such a motherfucking badass and even YOU don't mess with Valero.  Trying to comprehend the awesome power of what that might be, is like trying to think of where the end of space lies, or which came first, the chicken or the egg.  It is just something that mortal man is not supposed to grasp, nor would his brain be able to handle such knowledge if he somehow figured it out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1399.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1399.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1399.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1399.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1399.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1399.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1399.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1399.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
