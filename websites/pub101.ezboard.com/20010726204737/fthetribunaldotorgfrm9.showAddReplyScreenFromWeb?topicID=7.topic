He thought about that for a while and the rest is kinda history. <br>
My subspace handle was Phred, didn't sign on until 1.0. I did get to know a few of the Armageddon bunch: tsl, ljc, and others who's names I forget now. Don't know if you remember wedgie, but she's playing on Tarew Marr, and Leigh Ann/Jerrica is playing on The Rathe in KEG. She tells me a lot of the old time Subspace players are on the Rathe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I remember a Phred! I remember tsl, but not wedgie. In beta I used to chat to ljc (Larry J Cordner) heaps, and leighann/jerrica used to get really annoyed at me for killing her all the time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But when I came back from overseas I had missed 15 months. Both ljc and jerrica were SubSpace celebrities who didn't reply to my messages! It was funny that Rincewind eventually wrote the newbie guide because he was always the player that got pissed off at newbies.<br>
<br>
I always wanted to find out what happened to Xenon who started Armageddon and why the squad didn't continue. Another I remember is Shoeguy.<br>
<br>
There was a heap of talent in the Powerball league and they seem to be the ones that are still playing the most. Talk about hardcore... our squad had training practice and rehearsed moves like a football team.<br>
<br>
Funny about Zoid, but I still think you picked the better game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=faeyd>Faeyd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/17/01 4:52:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bogon.com/faeyd-wave2.jpg width=74 height=123></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SubSpace (cont from 'j0r Name' thread)</span><hr size=1> <br>
I remember Shoeguy, though he stopped playing shortly after 1.0 came out. I'd guess you remember Arbitrage too. I ran into him on Diablo 2 just last year. I dug out my old copy of Subspace a while back and checked out their servers. I see ReDS are still going strong there, I'm sure he's proud.<br>
<br>
I never got into powerball, I liked the 2 flag games in running zone and warzone the most I think. I don't know if you've checked out JeffP's new game on the Station but it's basically Subspace with ugly graphics IMO. The worst part is they've limited the view distance to about the old Subspace 800x600 view no matter what resolution you run. I remember buying a new video card just so I could play at 1600x1200. The tiny view his new game gives you feels way to cramped after that.<br>

There were 255 channels that you could tune to for a private chat (in addition to zone and squad chat channels). So if you wanted to communicate secretly with 15 other people spread around the server, you would get those 15 people to type /freq 178 or something, and they could all chat on the same frequency. In EQ that could be used by friends of different levels in different guilds to keep in touch... or for some sinister collaboration... or maybe a meeting between guild leaders. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/17/01 6:58:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SubSpace (cont from 'j0r Name' thread)</span><hr size=1> Oops... actually there were 5000 frequencies.<br>

Nostalgia time: I found an ancient beta of SubSpace (then Sniper version 0.80) on a zip disk. There was only one zone and it was a lot simpler than the final version 1.34. All you can do is fly around in empty 2D space collecting powerups because there is no 0.80 server to connect to. The help file still says it's an experiment to test how to make an Internet game, which was ultimately why VIE never took it seriously as a product.<br>

Bran. Turrets rocked. One of my favorite ways to play. The guy who ran league, who's name slips my mind. set up a turret championship one weekend. Our team won. We had a guy named Tsunami driving, probably the best turret driver I ever saw playing. I sucked at driving but was good at getting kills. heh.<br>
<br>
Virgin's support sucked. I think it took a lot of talking from Rod and Jeff to ever get the game released and it was pretty obvious Virgin didn't want to spend one penny to promote it. The packaging was cheap, it was never advertised.<br>
<br>
The chat system ruled. Was in some ways still the best chat system I think I've used. Instant recording of macros was great, the reply system and different codes to talk on different channels were quick to learn and quick to type. Something like /freq would be great in EQ for raids.<br>

There were no squads. Every two weeks they reset the kill tallies and declared an individual champion (those names stayed on the &quot;SubSpace legends&quot; part of the official web site cos they never bothered to update it). This was the map that later became the main chaos map.<br>
<br>
My memory is rusty, but somewhere in the 0.80s they introduced CTF into the map... I think you had to grab all the flags for yourself to score points. Many people didn't understand what the flags were, so they used to get a shock when the rest of us would blow them apart for their accidentally-picked-up flags <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
They introduced squads and kill ratios, and the squad with the best overall ratio won the fortnightly squad championship. We (Armageddon) won the first and second ones, but the other powerful squad was called Doomsday and had a couple of players who were better than anyone else. Eventually they beat us, while other good squads gradually formed.<br>
<br>
One day they switched to a totally new map (controversial, but it was modified and used in release for some zones) and the flag game got more advanced. They put one of those gravity-pulling black holes in the middle of it. &quot;Running zone&quot; and &quot;Chaos&quot; were names that came up later when they made more servers. Many of the server concepts were suggested by players on the message boards.<br>
<br>
When I came back after my travels and called myself Tale instead of Freelance, nobody knew me and I got utterly hooked on powerball. A guy called nivaG started the PB league and OUTLAW'S (bad punctuation intended) won it, but I got kicked out of the squad when we reached the semi-finals... I simply had trouble attending games due to my time zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Some of the other good PB squads were Requiem (run by Durabolin), Darkslayers (I think run by phaedrus-pb and dutch dams), and Harvester of Sorrow. I think they were also in the main league.<br>
<br>

<br>
The main league squads thought PB players would not stand up to their l33t combat ability, so they entered our league and got owned. Defending a ball that was on a 7 second pass timer while dogfighting was a serious skill, just like shots performed before the goal was even in sight. I mean we had a player in Denmark making diagrams showing the correct angle for certain shots, log parsers that rated our performance, etc.<br>

I'd love to run an EverQuest ballgame in West Karana or something -- one guild has to get a unique item from one corner of the zone to the other, while in a state of guildwar with the opposition. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=faeyd>Faeyd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/18/01 12:37:08 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bogon.com/faeyd-wave2.jpg width=74 height=123></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SubSpace (cont from 'j0r Name' thread)</span><hr size=1> <br>
Oh ya, I do remember Assassins signed up for powerball but we could never field enough members interested in playing. I think we might have made it to one season game with enough to actually play. We were mainly focused on the 4x4 league in league zone. I vaguely remember we either won the last league tournament run or were ahead on points before the plug was pulled. Of course by then most of the really good players had left so it wasn't a great victory.<br>
<br>
Harvesters of Sorrow I remember, knew a lot of players on that sqaud, including Bountyboy, who got me interested in EQ when he got in Beta 2 or something early like that.<br>
<br>
The problem with your idea for an EQ version is there's no way to track who has the &quot;ball&quot;. No  way to pass either. Big servers don't lend themselves to quick customization like little ones do.<br>

If you liked SubSpace, give Cosmic Rift a try, you might like it.  Many of the old SS players play it (or at least drop in from time to time).<br>
