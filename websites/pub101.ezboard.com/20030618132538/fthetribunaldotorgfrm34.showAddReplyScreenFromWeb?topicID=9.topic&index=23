I was wrong.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of *uber* encounters.  Tired of 30 to 60 people spending 2 to 5 hours to kill one monster (that they've killed many times before) just for a piece of loot.  Don't tell me it is for the thrilling experience at that point.  If you've killed it a few times before it's an item farm.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of camping.  Camp this for X time and you might get X item.  Well, seems DAOC doesn't have that problem.  Haven't seen any campers just yet, and named monsters typically only award loot if you receive the respective quests for them beforehand.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of no PVP.  Rallos / Vallon / Tallon etc. never interested me much.  EQ was not designed with PVP in mind.<br>
<br>
I've have several level 60 characters in EQ, and have played every class at 60 at some point.  The monotony is mind numbing.   Hit A and press kick when it pops up.    Snare and sit to med.   Heal.  Nuke and sit to med.  Etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Let me illustrate a basic difference between EQ and DAOC.  I'll use everybody's FAVORITE Rogue, Nosey, as an example, VS my infiltrator on DAOC.  (parallel of the EQ rogue class)<br>
<br>
EQ:<br>
<br>
Enter combat, get behind monster, backstab, hit a, when hide pops up, evade.  Repeat.<br>
<br>
This is all he does.  Yeah he can do some CR and scouting but the # of see invis monsters at the high level game is too high to make this reliable.<br>
<br>
<br>
DAOC:<br>
<br>
Well, first question is, how did you specialize?  For me I am specializing in Critical hits for fighting (as most rogues will)<br>
<br>
as such I get combinations<br>
<br>
Open while hidden with backstab   +Damage +minor stun +bonus to hit chance --defense<br>
use eviscerate  +++Damage +minor stun +attack speed reduction +bonus to hit chance -defense (can only use after backstab)<br>
use kidney rupture  ++++Damage +bleeding (acts like a DOT) +bonus to hit --defense<br>
<br>
Now this is the low level backstab combo.  Let's say you are out soloing (yes you can do that in DAOC with any class, but you will find it much faster and enjoyable to group).   Cloak yourself, sneak up behind something, open with backstab.  Monster is stunned, next attack eviscerate, monster remains stunned and is likely 25% health down.  Next attack kidney rupture, monster is stunned again and likely 50% health, bleeding, and slowed somewhat.  Basically the monster is screwed.<br>
<br>
Things can go wrong, of course, and the above is a perfect low level scenario.   You get this combo as early as level 6.<br>
<br>
There are attacks that you can only use after parry, riposte, evade, etc.   Some you use beside the enemy, some you use in front, and some you use behind.<br>
<br>
My main point is you have to watch the fight to be effective.   EQ you can kinda hit A and go make a sandwich.  DAOC you need to get a little more immersed into the game and pay a bit more attention.  Combat is MUCH more fun.<br>
<br>
Take a look at this link.  It shows all the styles, specializations, and attacks for each line of specialization.  Lots of good stuff there.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ok, now on to EQ questing.   EQ quest = go camp an item(s) and hope it pops.  Maybe in an hour maybe in 50 hours.  Veeshan's peak key quest is a good example as is the key to howling stones.<br>
<br>
DAOC quest.  Well, #1 you get a quest journal that automatically fills in so you don't need to write it all down yourself.  Nice feature.<br>
<br>
#2 There is no camping.   Spawns of what you are looking for can be random, yes, but a little searching around the area you are sent should yield what you are looking for.   6 other people waiting in line for the same quest?  No problem.  Group up together and as long as you all have the quest active in your journal, you ALL get the quest item.  Nice touch, really.<br>
<br>
#3  Quests are a bit more interesting than EQ.  They have purpose.  And they are easier to come across.  Right click on an NPC to talk to them, and all relevant text in the window can be clicked on to further the conversation.  No more sitting for an hour guessing &quot;What quest?&quot;  &quot;How can I help?&quot;  &quot;What troubles?&quot; &quot;What blade of tactics?&quot;   Don't have to guess, stabbing in the dark at the correct phrase to use.<br>
<br>
Don't have time to kill anything?  Don't have time to do a big quest?  Walk up to NPC's and ask for a task.  Within 5 or so NPC's you will likely find one.  They'll give you a box or vial and ask you to deliver it.  Take it to the next town over, or 3 towns away, wherever they send you, and give it to the person you are to deliver it to to receive coin and about 5% of your level worth of exp.  These can all be done in about a half hour.   You could level to 50 on them if you really wanted to, although some may find that boring, it is yet another way to play (it would take forever to do this too  : P ).<br>
<br>
Another nice thing?  Give the quest item to the wrong guy in EQ = oh shit I just lost my quest and 50 hours worth of work!   Give it to the wrong guy in DAOC and he or she returns it to you saying that they do not want the item.  Thank god for this feature.<br>
<br>
And another nice thing.   Hit attack near an NPC in your realm?  It wont allow you to attack them.  There are no guard killers, and no accidental deaths associated with hitting attack at the wrong time.<br>
<br>
No faction work to do.  You start in Albion, you are ready to do any quest and any task.  No NPC will turn you down and no NPC will eat your items and say &quot;too bad.&quot;  There *is* faction in the game but who cares if your bandit faction is low?  They are gonna attack you no matter what anyways.<br>
<br>
No running thru a zone and being attacked by level 30 things when you are 50.   If something is gray to you (equivalent of EQs green) it will not attack you.   Grays WILL assist but if you wish to run thru a field of them they will leave you alone.   Wouldn't it be nice to run through dreadlands without cocks on your ass? =/<br>
<br>
Equipment is scaled.   Wanna twink out a low level with level 50 equipment?  Go right ahead, but it will last like 2 fights before deteriorating.  Sure a level 1 can use level 50 armor but the game has an intuitive armor system where armor above your useability level will deteriorate while worn (all amor deteriorates, but as long as it is within your level range it will deteriorate very slowly).  Twinking may still happen but it wont be widespread.  You visit a smith and pay a bit of cash to repair any armor.<br>
<br>
Graphics are top notch.   I know some people are posting here and unimpressed with the graphics.  I dunno what the heck they are talking about if they are comparing them to EQ.  Graphics are far better.  The characters are correctly proportioned, and the textures are very very well done.   Oh and the landscape.   You know how if you look around EQ you see repeating textures all over the place?  The ground textures are especially notorious for this.  Also a hill in EQ is alot of flat surfaces intersecting at sharp angles.  DAOC, I've seen no ground texture repetition.  Hills are rolling and smooth.   The transition from dirt to grass to gravel is smooth as well.   Instances of spikey pyramid hills and such are very very rare.<br>
<br>
Water is more realistic.<br>
<br>
Sounds are more realistic.<br>
<br>
Architecture is more realistic.<br>
<br>
Animations are more realistic and smooth.  No more EQ style &quot;let me try to slash with a 2x4 up my a$$&quot; looking animations.<br>
<br>
Rain is rain.  It doesn't roll in dense fog all the time making it nearly impossible to see.  Sometimes it will, but this is rare.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some things people might or might not like?<br>
<br>
Trivial loot code applys to everything except quests.  If you kill a gray you get no exp, no coin, no loot.  This should not be a problem, though, as quests can still be done even with grays, and grays will not aggro you unless you attack them or an assistable monster close to them.<br>
<br>
Travel is slower.  You run about 75% as fast as in EQ it seems.<br>
<br>
Leveling is much slower, although you get grouping bonuses.   A soloer in EQ will not be happy with how fast you can level soloing in DAOC.  Those who group will level at least twice as fast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally I think that the low end game beats EQ hands down.  It remains to be seen what PVP is like and realm vs realm.  Dungeons also need some exploring.<br>
<br>
I entered a dungeon yesterday.  Great graphics right off the bat.  Also, the music was top notch, and the creepy voices of the dead (undead dungeon) pumped through my surround sound.  First monster was purple, though, so perhaps in a week I can check it out  : )<br>
<br>
As far as big dragons to kill?  I dunno.  And I don't much care.  A dragon is dumb, and the AI of a computer can be learned.   I'd much rather be a part of trying to invade another realm and capture an artifact, town or castle, than farm some +100 hp cloak or whatnot off of a monster.  There is so much more satisfaction in beating a human opponent.  We'll see how the high end game works out  : )<br>
<br>
I dunno if this helped anyone or just confused people.  : P  But I wanted to type up some first impressions  : ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm34>Poll Archive</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <!-- .. -->
