Why do wizards get a melee item as their epic weapon?  This makes no sense to me.  What do i want with a weapon?  I am a wizard for crying out loud!  Yes, the skin effect is okay and the stats are really nice, but come on!<br>
  The epic for mages is good, i will grant them that.  It is in line with their class.  Necromancers and enchanters i can't/wont comment on since i don't know anything about it.  Wizards, in my opinion, should have got a spell of some description.  An offencive spell!  <br>
  For levels upon levels, the logic of the wizard class was an over-powering offence with a pathetic defence.  So why give us a skin as an effect?  Sure the extra mana regeneration is great, but i don't think that is true to the wizard class.  In a way i suppose it does help do damage since it helps you get mana back faster, but it doesn't have the &quot;bang, you're dead&quot; mentality that is what the wizard is supposed to be about.<br>
  Well, we have had the epic weapon quest for each class.  Now i want the epic spell for each class. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Have a rightclickable effect of an UBER lure. Was every lure combined (Don't know much about wizards, but I am pretty sure they have a lure for each resistance) and did more damage than any of them.

Make it do 1.5 times the damage of your lures, and check against whichever resist was lowest on the creature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaramalg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aramalg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/22/01 3:19:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:The Wizard Epic.</span><hr size=1>   Hmm.

Verant gives us a DD spell that uses no mana. Let's say they do to us what they did to almost everyone else and give it some god awful cast time. Not effective. They give us a decent cast time, we dump it, we die. (Aggro). They give us a Damage Absorbing, componentless, manaless shield and wala, BOOM, I'm the tank. I can dish out more, take more and still live because of it. I think they did pretty well.<br>

Instead I am going more for the “appropriate” angle.<br>
  Yes, the boosted manaskin is nice.  Especially since it doesn’t cost a peridot to cast.  Yet how appropriate is this for the wizard class?  Defensive skins are not something that I would call inherently wizards.  Necromancers, enchanters and druids all get a form of the same type of spell.  With some variation, of course.  So a boosted skin spell could easily have been given to any of those three classes.  It could even be argued that the druids got a castable version of our epic which was better in some regards.  That is debatable of course and isn’t really the point.<br>
  The point as I see it, is that while the skin effect on the wizard epic is good, it isn’t really in line with the class.  This is of course open to interpretation, but to me that epic effect isn’t what I would have chosen for the class.  An extra offensive spell would have been nice.  Yes, you can argue the aggro point, but to me that isn’t a valid argument.  Not really.  Wizards have been dealing with aggro for a long time.  I really can’t see us killing ourselves repeatedly if our epic had a good damage spell as a right click effect.  Lol, not after the first few times anyway.  I can understand why an offensive spell wouldn’t be wanted though.  Yet there are still other options.<br>
  Some alternative wizard epic effects.<br>
  A 25% increase to mana regeneration.  Maybe more.  It gives you the potential to do more damage, but not in a soloing situation.  Not really.  This would, in my opinion, be good for groups, where wizards can find themselves easily running low on mana if the pull rate is high.<br>
  Another idea is to have a one in four chance of doing a double spellcast.  What I mean by this is that every time you cast a spell, a check would be made.  If you miss your check, the spell goes on to land as normal.  If you make it the spell will land twice.  You only receive the aggro for the initial spell though.<br>
  You could have the effect of the staff be that all spells cast by the wizard when they are holding the staff it is as if an unresistible spell has been cast.  This would allow you to use your mana efficient spells instead of lures.<br>
  There are lots of possible effects they could have chosen, some better and more practical than others.  While the skin is good, I really don’t think it is appropriate as the effect of our epic weapon.<br>

Doesn't cost any mana to cast, doesn't cost a bleedin' peridot to cast.  That last fact will save you tens of thousands of platinum over the career of your wizard.<br>
<br>
The rune also keeps you alive through an extra AE or two.  Yes, a well-played wizard will keep deliberate aggro off of himself, but you cannot stop AEs.<br>
<br>
The mana regen you cannot argue with.  3pt is 2 points more than manaskin, and 1 point more than Breeze.  So this is mini-clarity for you that stacks WITH c2, potg, gob/m/i, all that fun stuff.<br>
<br>

You want a nuke?  There's robes that have mana-free enticements.. they take forever to cast.  With this rune, you can survive longer in a fight to unleash your holy hell DD's rather than relying on an item to do it for you.  <br>
<br>
Wizards have enough offensive capabilities, the epic having a defensive effect is a good thing.  It keeps you alive, it boosts your mana regen, it has awesome stats, and of all the epics, it is now the 2nd easiest to attain since they dropped the cazic skin/mistletoe powder requirement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufilanfyretracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beam me up, Scotty!</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/30/01 7:56:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/pic01.jpg Width=192 height=280></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:The Wizard Epic.</span><hr size=1> up regen on barrier of force to 10 per tic and keep its stacking with everthing =) therefore letting us do damage to sov mobs rather then doing .01% and being oom. <p><center><a href="mailto:filan@snet.net">

What I am talking about is whether or not the skin effect that we have been given is something that truly represents what the wizard class stands for.<br>
  Yes, a damage spell would be nice.  However, the same argument about the skin could be used on such a spell unless the spell in question was some sort of lure or better version of disintegrate.  So the only way a damage spell on the epic would be justified would be if it was something uniquely related to the wizard class.  I realise that the effects on other epics are not “unique” to the class, but those effects are, in my opinion, strongly associated with the class.<br>
  Let me put it this way.  If I asked you to tell me the two things that most strongly represent the wizard class in your mind, what would you say?  My guess is that it would be something to do with our damage output/potential and our teleports.  I really doubt that you would say our magical skins.  Magical skins are useful, but they are not, in my opinion, a key element of the wizard class.  If I was to take away our ability to cast magical skins, would it drastically change the wizard class?  I don’t think so.  It might make some encounters more difficult and we would die more often, but that is about it.<br>
  Taking all of what I have just mentioned in mind, let me ask again, why do we have a skin effect on our epic?  Nice though the effect is, it is not appropriate to the wizard class.  Not as an epic effect anyway.  Out of the alternative effects I mentioned in the post above, the one that I personally like the most is that of being able to land any spell unresisted on mobs.  The lures show that the wizard class has been working towards this, so it would be an understandable progression.  I think so anyway.<br>

Completely changes the way you play a wizard. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=135152" target="_blank"><img src="http://204.225.62.28/scott/sig_ves_01.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umaephestos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maephestos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/02 8:08:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Wizard Epic.</span><hr size=1> If you really want to use your effect for nukes, group with a mage... mod rod 2 = MUCH faster mana regen with a better ratio than a mana robe, and still no damage to you... <br>
<br>
I don't feel the epics were designed to &quot;represent&quot; any particular class.. They were designed to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> enhance</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the classes.. A defensive effect like the wizard epic does just that.. Takes the main disadvantage of int casters (made of cotton candy in the rain), and alleviates that by 800(!!) hp.. depending on your gear, that's quite a noticable difference. <br>

The mana regen/ absorption skin does in a way reflect our class.  We have many absorption skins as a wizard to choose from (only getting better as we level).  Yes we do nuke as a carear, but we also speciallize in more than just nukes.  A good wizard knows when he needs to nuke yes, but he also knows how to keep himself alive.  Consider fighting a dragon even as simple as nagafen, when back in the day i got killed almost ever raid against him because of AOE.  And i had very good resists too, they just still landed now and then.  Also consider that on most dragons nukers have to be within melee range to even land a nuke.  So the skin does represent the wizard because we are a WIZARD.  That does not mean NUKER.  It means Arcane Powered demolitionist/ Evacuation specialist.  We are the best at dishing out the most/ quick damage.  We are designed to demolish dragons and boss mobs in raids.  We dont need a spell that does 1500 dd in 15 seconds. we already have spells that do 800dd in 3 seconds and if need lures that land almost every time on a boss if you are within the correct range.  The epic is used to keep us alive when we are in that range.  Therefore concluding it does very well apply to our class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufilanfyretracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/auction WTB a clue! </span><br>  Posts: 563<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/02 8:54:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/wtcsmall.jpg Width=110 height=141></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: The Wizard Epic</span><hr size=1> wizard epic is definatly the best staff in the game over even ntov stuff. <p><center><a href="mailto:filan@snet.net"><img SRC="http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/filan-sig22.jpg" height=172 width=444 border="0"></a>

I like the damage it deals by way of melee, use it all the time on those annoying skels. They increased the time it took to cast the skin/spell because it was too overpowered.  The skin even has mana regen built in.<br>
<br>
And yes it does fit the wizard theme, we get alot of self buff skins.  Make sense that the epic should reflect that.<br>
<br>
I use the skin all the time in grp, sole, ae, uber mob encounter.  I am sure every wiz, who has an epic, has it hotkeyed.<br>
<br>
At 60 or any level the Epic owns!!!<br>
<br>
Best Wizzy staff in the game, IMO.<br>
<br>
Recommendation:<br>
If you do make another staff that is better then <br>
Add Increase damage III on it.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Or maybe Verant should make an Epic Enhancing Quest where an NPC can add a focus ability on every epic, sort of like a specialization.  Would allow each Player to tailor their character how they want it.  <br>
***BTW that sort of quest is not that hard to program in.<br>
Ex: If a warrior wants to add Increase Damage III on the warrior epic than it would be up to them.<br>
<br>
