I taught both my sons to read by the time they were 4 years old. They were NEVER made to display their reading abilities as an example of what &quot;good&quot; parents we are. Sorry to tell you but where they WERE taken was to the library. If more children were taught to read and love books and reading at an earlier age, the literacy rate in this country would be far superior to what it is today. As it stands both have done very well academically now that they're in their teens. You're welcome to your opinion however misguided and ignorant it may be.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes I'm a parent. 4 children. Oldest 3 all were placed into the gifted and talented magnet program in one of the largest and most prestigeous school systems in the country (program starts in 3rd grade and progesses thru 8th grade).  The youngest is still too young for that.  Obviously we read a lot to them, they love books, and are voraceous readers.<br>
<br>
Now, re-read my simple statement.  Reading ability at age 4 is not predictive of academic performance later in life.  I didn't say not to read to your kids, etc etc etc.  I absolutely agree 100000% that young children should be read to and should be exposed to books.  We did this with all of our kids from infancy.  What we didn't do is hothouse them and push them to be able to read.  None of them could read at age 4, and only our youngest entered first grade being what I'd call a fluent reader.<br>
<br>
Your kids obviously are great readers. Maybe they can help you with comprehension of my very simple statement <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bnewland/sop-sig.jpg><BR>

Weirdness? What? I was going to go off in a really big rant, but I won't. Please let me know what makes you think role-playing is wrong? Or unsuitable?<br>

As far as the actual topic at hand is, having no children of my own, I can't overly comment, but I certainly would not let a child under 14 play EQ. Then I would offer supervision at the time.<br>

I'm not saying playing DD made them what they were, I am inclined to think they were attracted to such a passtime because of thier deficiencies.<br>
<br>
Read the &quot;who's the man&quot; thread on the flame board and tell me you would want your kids to have more than a very limited exposure to any of the key figures there.  What about the woman who roleplayed a sex slave?  If she wasn't a nut case I don't know who is.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are plenty of people who are able to roleplay and keep the line between reality and fantasy in perspective, but there are also those who let fantasy overwhelm reality.  I tend to believe those who are attracted to escaping into fantasy do so because they are having a difficult time with reality.  I also think that the vast majority of adolesents are having a difficult time with reality.<br>
<br>
What 13 year old boy hasn't said &quot; it's the superbowl, forth down and one yard to go, 3 seconds on the clock...&quot;  Fantasy is an attractive place, especially during adolecence when we are struggling to define who we are.  I think we've all heard stories of 30 year old men who are big shots in EQ and live in thier parents basement, or 14 year old freshmen who are getting stuffed into their lockers by seniors at school during the day, but at night are leaders of major guilds with a hundred people doing just as they say.   Real life for both is a very difficult place, so the inclination to escape even deeper into fantasy where they have an important role.  <br>
<br>
So, 2 reasons I didn't want my son involved in roleplaying,  I didn't want him exposed to social misfits, and primarily because I was concerned he would become overly attracted to a fantasy world during a difficult time in his real life.<br>

Don't you think it is strange that SO MANY parents think they know more about raising kids than non-parents? <br>
Hmm.. a pattern forms.. <br>
Maybe.. just maybe.. it is because there is MORE to raising kids than you ever expect? There is a one-liner that is often told to expectant parents. &quot;Enjoy yourself, this is the last time you will ever have all the answers&quot;<br>
<br>
Try explaining to a mischievous 18 month old child that pulling your hair out by the roots is NOT a fun game.<br>
Try explaining to a cranky 2 yr old that they are not allowed to throw a tantrum right now.<br>
Try telling your 4 year old that if they use Mummy's lipstick on <br>
the walls ONE MORE TIME there will be trouble...<br>
Do these things successfully without once spanking your child, THEN come and tell the rest of us how it is done.<br>
<br>
Every single child I know that has been raised in a house where spanking is forbidden is an undisciplined brat. Spanking <br>
!= abuse. Explanations and discussions are essential for growth and understanding, a firm hand is necessary to emphasise respect and authority.<br>
<br>
Minding children is different to raising them. <br>
Don't assume you have all the answers just because <br>
you are a good observer and have a logical brain.<br>
<br>
Love your children extravagantly, and discipline them well, or they will bring you grief.<br>

I never said it was impossible, I was responding to Once Delight ... but why do you assume that endorsing the occasional smack means a fast hand and a quick temper? <br>
I do not hit my kids in anger, that IS abuse, in a temper mistakes are made and you would end up wishing you had dealt with it differently. They get a discussion, an explanation, a quick smack and a big hug. Forgiveness is a big part of it.. and once it is finished, it is finished and not brought up again.<br>
I am not saying this is the only way to raise children or even the best, but _in_my_experience_ (and you are outside of it) people who refuse to smack their toddlers lack any other form of effective discipline.<br>
<br>
If you have an alternate system that works, I would love to hear it - being serious, not facetious. Email me if you like, <br>

I read and comprehended what you wrote very well.<br>
Apparently you did not.<br>
<br>
Did you not state that people who taught their children to read at an early age were merely doing it to prove what &quot;good&quot; parents they were?<br>
Sure read that way to me.<br>
<br>
Now of course there are never guarantees that teaching your children to read early on will lead to academic success.<br>
However having the tools to do so DO guarantee them a better chance.<br>
<br>
My children were not &quot;hothoused&quot; nor forced in any way to learn, indeed because they were read to and gained a love of what books have to offer from their earliest memories they were EAGER to learn to read.<br>
<br>
It sounds to me that you possibly have some guilt for not doing something that most parents could and should do..take responsibility for educating our children rather than relying on our school systems.<br>
<br>
It's wonderful your children are doing so well despite your laissez-faire attitude towards education. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~ekaycee01/_uimages/60ash.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub22.ezboard.com/bsentinelsofchaos">Sentinels of Chaos</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadaetidalstorm>Jadae Tidalstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/10/02 7:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=75>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Children and EQ</span><hr size=1> No need for emails =) I was trying to explain.

So you think its bad for kids to role play? So cops and robbers is a bad thing? I really dont see how you can say that a teenager or what have you is really going to become a social misfit because he plays a role playing game. Seems rather close minded. Ya know i never played DnD tell about 2 months ago i didnt like it at all. Never played it in high school cause i was kinda busy drinking trying to get laid the &quot;Normal things Teens do&quot;. There where the kids that played role playing games but i was too Punk Rock to talk to them or hang out with them pluse they didnt really smoke drink or party at all.  <br>
  Funny part is all the people i hung out with and alot of the other &quot;normal people &quot; didnt do so well when they got out of high school. Most of my friends found bigger better drugs and died. About 19 of the people that walked in my grad class died due to partying. 3 died that same year. Ya know the DnD geeks are still around im friends now with 2 of them they have good jobs and really are pretty good people. Oh yah and on friday they dress up like vampires (ohhhh shiver). <br>
        So the moral of this story is if you dont watch your kids they will be fuck ups. If you try to make them normal they will rebel and most likely be Big Fuck ups. If you cant take care of you child DONT BREED. Our children are the ones that have to deal with our mistakes just like we had to deal with our parents. If you teach them to be careing happy people they will most likely be that way. If you try to make them Normal most likely they will be like me... No one knows the best way to raise a child. If you do clue me in. All i know is I want my son to be happy if hes a Uber Jock football hero (the kind i use to fight with) Or a geeky kid with a piece of papper no tan trying to talk like a elf. If hes happy and ok then you know what i did all right. <br>
  True your kids they are smarter then you.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I'm sure a street bum is going to be stoked about his big move to a tar paper shack, but he's not going to convince me he has a nice place.<br>

I think I made it pretty clear that I think roleplaying is a very normal thing for young people to do, it's a good escape for them, but it's a dangerous thing if allowed to go too far.<br>

If you think smoking, drinking, doing drugs and dying is &quot;normal&quot; I feel very very sorry for you.  It's particularly disturbing that you don't even know how many people died, about 19???
