So I'm a sexual predator.  I see.  You're only showing yourself to be a scumbag to stoop so low.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension.<br>
<br>
It isn't just my view that teenagers have the ability to make their own decisions, it's the view of the law that they are accountable for their decisions.<br>
<br>
Going by your view, there shouldn't be any juveniles within the prison system.  That the kid in Florida shouldn't have been held accountable for shooting his teacher.  That the band of youth, as young as 8, shouldn't be held accountable for murdering a man in Detroit, only a month ago.  That the young 17 year old sniper that was caught on the east coast, also should not be held accountable.  Since, all of these children, have no clue what is right or wrong.  That the ability to make such decisions are magically gifted to all at the ripe old age of 18.<br>
<br>
Forgive my ignorance, for knowing of a woman that was raised in an abused home.  When at the age of 14, the state of Michigan proclaimed her to be her own guardian.  Where they sent her a check, and she was made responsible for bringing home groceries, paying rent, and making it to school.<br>
<br>
Excuse me for thinking that a properly raised 14 year old should know that there is something inheritly wrong with moving across the country with out your parents knowing and approving of the move.<br>
<br>
If a child at the age of 14 makes a trip across the country without her/his parents knowing of it, was raised by CRAP parents.  They failed in raising their child properly. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
anywho   yes i agree with wenin.<br>
<br>
for the example of the 14 year old traveling away alone this is bad parenting.<br>
<br>
jaeran was correct in saying that if a child choses to do this there is nothing a perant can do.<br>
<br>
for arguement sake lets say this hapened, child leaves gets to destination BF says get lost.<br>
<br>
what now ?<br>
<br>
well i dont know about everybody but i know that when ever i was in trouble when ever all seemed lost i could make a simple phone call to my parants and they solved my problems.<br>
<br>
They knew i would make mistakes but made sure i was well aware they would allways be there for me.<br>
<br>
so why does this kid choose to be roped into a world of prostitution drugs etc ? as aposed to making a phone call to mum and dad  <br>
<br>
what has caused such a rift between child and parent ?<br>
<br>
This child has not made just one bad desicion but many.<br>
<br>
SOMETHING caused this child to make continual bad choices SOMETHING caused this child to think that mum and dad wont help or that they dont care when any normal child would call mun and dad and ask for help<br>
<br>
perhaps mum and dad dont care or wont help and that is what made the child think this.<br>
<br>
its called bar parenting any way you look at it<br>
<br>
it is no ones fault but the parents.<br>
<br>
I have made many mistakes in life as a child I imagine I will make many as parent also but I will never lay the blame elsewhere because thats just a load of crap.<br>
<br>

I have had two kids and one thing holds true - kids are a crap shoot. I don't care how well you raise them, how righteous you think you are, no matter how good an example you set, some kids go bad. Saying it is always the parents fault is ignorant at best.<br>
<br>
As to behaviour, there are many things that come into play. Genetics, brain chemicals, peer pressure, life experiences, hormones, circumstances and perception.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, good parenting puts the odds in favor of a well developed child, but it is far, far from a guarentee. <p><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
so once again you want to lay blame else where.  bravo for you what a way to step up to the plate and take responsibility.<br>
<br>
1) Genetics + brain chemicals + hormones  <br>
<br>
Lol not even going to start the nurture Vs nature arguement.<br>
<br>
2) peer presure     parents are responsible for this, it is there example setting and the way they do or do not give in to peer pressure that your child will follow.<br>
<br>
3) Life experiences     parents give there children the most important life experiences and if your child does have bad life experiences this was either caused by the perants or is the perants job to try and help the child deal with this.<br>
<br>
4) circumstances and perception <br>
<br>
The way the child has been raised the life experiences they have had the upbringing they have been provided determines how they will percieve any given circumstance and there reaction to this circumstance.<br>
<br>
once again input from parenting <br>
<br>
<br>
If you have a child YOU as a perant are responsible for this child<br>
<br>
If you cliam you are not responsible for your child you do not deserve to have children.<br>
<br>
No where have i claimed to be self rightous or a perfect perant in fact i have even admited i will make mistakes<br>
<br>
I am merely argueing that when i make these mistakes im not going to run around blameing others i will be looking at myself to see what went wrong.<br>

<br>
We're talking damn near the bottom of the barrel here.  You can't believe that a kid could end up in such a situation and have come from good parents.  There are just so many issues with a person that have gone wrong, for them to end up in that situation.<br>
<br>
We can all agree that the "level" of parenting is definately a grey scale to be graded upon.  It isn't so cut and dry as Good vs Bad.  But in the situation that Jaeron presented, I can't see how the parents involved can't be classfied clearly in the "bad" region of the spectrum.  They failed someplace, and their failure lead to disasterous results.  The biggest excuse I could find for them, is if the child is mentally handicapped in some way.  Even then, you have to hold them accountable for not watching after their kid more closely. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Parents WILL make mistakes     bad things will happen<br>
<br>
So when these bad things happen what will you as a perant do ?   blame someone else or take a look at what you could have done better and try to fix it ?<br>
<br>
In other words  take responsibility <br>
<br>
In the example you give the number of bad desicions this child needs to make for the full realisation of scenario is staggering.<br>
<br>
you cant possibly blame the bus company in anyway for this.<br>

<br>
Anyway, I think both the parents and children are partly to blame. you can't point to a child making bad decisions and say it's all the parents fault, any more then you can blame it totally on the child.<br>
<br>
I think it comes down to that humans aren't perfect, and we all fuck things up. There are thousands of reasons why something like this could happen, and to say it's only the parents fault or only the child's fault is really silly. Unless something crazy happened (molestation, physical abuse, ect), usually both parties are to balme. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 784<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/4/02 2:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suicide Bombings on American Bus Lines</span><hr size=1> True true.  Don't think anyone would say that blame can't be spread about.  This discussion, though fucked up as it was, started out placing the blame on Greyhound's doorstep.  Checking IDs won't prevent a kid from obtaining a bus ticket.<br>
<br>
- Kids do travel alone on the bus, and probably don't need an adult escort unless they are around 10-12 years old.  So checking IDs at the bus won't really help.<br>
<br>
- Checking IDs when purchasing the ticket.  Well any kid that has the balls to travel cross country without their parents knowing, will have the guts to use their parents Credit Card to order the ticket via the phone.  Or have their older boyfriend order the tickets for his "daughter".<br>
<br>
Complaining about a situation without a solution, is bullshit to begin with. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I have seen kids come out of horror houses of homes and become some of the stable, happy, productve people I have known.<br>
<br>
Life is not like a computer. Sometimes what you get out is far different than what you put in. Maraclaire, you seem to be the type of person who believes diagnosis of ODD, Bipolar, ADHD and defective Y chromosones are just a bunch of BS to give parents a way to cover up their bad job of raising their children. I say that I have seen parents have kids that in no way reflected the example given them.<br>
<br>
You also seem to believe that parents are the biggest influence on children... and they are until the teen years. Once a kid hits the teens though, they naturally start establishing independence and start looking to others for examples. Those examples most often come from kids their own age (because they relate easier to people their own age) and the adults they see as cool or exciting (most of the time these are performers, actors and sports stars). Too often these adults are also drug dealers with fancy cars and lots of cash.<br>
<br>
Now I don't care how great of a parent you have been, once a kid hits that stage it is a crap shoot. Some kids who have had great upbringing will hit the fastlane and nothing you do or say will take away their taste for adrenaline. Some kids who have had the shittiest home life will be drawn into sports and avoid drugs because they are into their bodies an turn out very stable. Some kids will turn out bad just to spite their parents, while some will turn out well because they don't want to be their parents.<br>
<br>
The greatest years of influence a parent has is between the ages of 1-6 when the child's personality is developing. And most evidence suggest that what we do after the age of 7, while having some influence, will be very minor compared to the first 6 years when their mental foundation is being layed.<br>
<br>
Once they hit teens, there is very little you can do that will change the kids mind. Oh, you can stand over them and guard them, but once they hit 18 and you lose that control, they will do what they wanted to in the first place.<br>
<br>
So my belief is this - you do the best you can and hope for the best, but don't for one minute think that because you were a great parent that your kid won't shoot somebody or end up on drugs or be a thief. Teen years are a war of hormones, brain chemistry, life experiences and peer pressure. Their desire to fit in with their peers may very well outweigh your influence... or not. But like it or not, you are not in control at this point and believing you are is wishful thinking.<br>
<br>
The Bible does offer some hope though. It says &quot; Bring up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it&quot;. I have no doubt that once you hit your mid twenties and your hormones calm down and your brain matures, that you once again start falling back on your upbringing. But it's a long way between 14 and 25 and alot can happen that can't be undone during those years... if you make it through them.<br>
<br>
Anyways, good parenting is something every parent should shoot for... it helps... almost as much as bad parenting hurts. But it very rarely is the deciding factor in how a child turns out imo. <p><br>
