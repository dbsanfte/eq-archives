Fuck it in its stupid ass.</span><hr size=1> There was a better way of going about this whole mess.  I really don't know if it could have been implemented, but they should have offered 'Legends' type service on the normal servers as a premium subscription.<br>
<br>
For example, current subscription is $9.89 a month  (how clever I am sure they thought they were when doing that.... but over the last 3 years I'm sure that 10 cents a month they lost by being &quot;cute&quot; would have added up, lol), so for, say,  an additional $10 a month per increment ($18+ for 2 or $23+ for all three packages)  you can pick up additional services.  Resulting in monthly charges of :<br>
<br>
Basic Service (what we currently have)  $9.89 a month<br>
<br>
Basic +1   $19.89 a month<br>
<br>
Basic +2   $27.89 a month<br>
<br>
Basic +3   $32.89 a month<br>
<br>
Additional services :<br>
<br>
~ Web based utilities.  (map, magelo type thing, etc.)<br>
<br>
~ Access to newer / revamped zones earlier.  (Cazic etc.)<br>
<br>
~ Increased customer support.  Access as key participants in 'premium' events etc.  They could scale CS staff based upon how many people took this option.   Only 1000 people pick it up?  Hire 4 more full time GMs instead of 13.<br>
<br>
Let's say someone just wanted the new zones.  They'd be looking at $19.89 a month, and would have access to them like any normal zone.  Those not on that specific subscription plan would have to wait 3 months, and would be locked out of them as they would be locked out of any of the expansions had they not purchased them.  Would this create resentment?  Maybe for some, but far less than the current situation, I believe, and word of mouth may be enough to increase sales of this part of the subscription.  Benefits of making this available, for the basic service players, is that the premium subscribers are paying for the new content, but you get FAR more new content than you would have before, and at no cost to you.  Downfall is you have to wait another 3 months, but hey, it doesn't cost you a dime.<br>
<br>
Let's say someone just wanted the increased customer support?  The account is flagged, and your petitions, reports, whatever, go into a seperate queue.  The full time GM's paid for by your opted for increased subscription price, handle your petition.   Benefit to those paying the standard rate is that they still get guide and GM service as they do now, but the load is a bit lighter on that area of CS because of those being offloaded onto premium CS.  Your petitions and such will be answered more quickly, too.  Additional benefits to the server would be increased GM events (and hopefully better thought out events).  Perhaps allow premium subscribers to be key players (might be a bad idea.... dunno) but allow everyone to participate.<br>
<br>
The web based stuff is self explanatory.  Pay for it, you get it, don't pay for it, you don't.<br>
<br>
The problem with the current legends server is that you can't take all your friends online with you.  Not everyone can afford the $40 a month or whatever it is.   If they offered this stuff as available on *Tribunal* as optional services, I would be one of the first to sign up, and I am sure many others would to, based on how much they could afford.<br>
<br>
Who knows... perhaps legends is an experiment and something like this will be made available on al servers in the future. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukarenne666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karenne666</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shut up~??<br>What does that mean~??</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/3/02 9:17:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=760.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mapage.noos.fr/langelus/images/face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck the Legends Server.

Fuck it in its stupid ass.</span><hr size=1> That comment is somewhat biased. People who don't get what they want in EQ constantly blame VI, and for good reason, they are the game makers, however take into account a few things. First of all, there are 2000 people on average per server, and I think what, like 45+ servers? Do you have any idea how many different people, with different ideas and opinions about how this game should be run really is? it's too many. Some people will not be satisfied, which is the sad truth. <br>
The best VI can do is make comprimise and they've done a damn good job in my opinion. I will agree with a few that 40 dollars a month is too much for too little, and I will ALSO agree that some of the services given on legends should have already been implemented, however for whatever restrictions they were not. Making suggestions like Ryn is the way to go, screaming &quot;verant sucks!!&quot; won't change anything or make this game any better.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/3/02 11:15:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=760.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fuck the Legends Server.
