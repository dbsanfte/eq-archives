<br>
Where is this proof? This is your opinion, it is not fact. That second statement can't even BE proven. It's impossible. <br>
<br>
Basically, you are saying that spending money on rehabilitation to save 5% of the people is chaper than not spending it at all? So, the other 95% that we just throw the money away on is made up by the 5%? This makes no sense whatsoever. Prove this with dollar amounts below.<br>

<br>
Nope, political correctness prevents us from EVER closing the barn door. This WILL happen again becuase we are afraid to profile people in this country -- we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Somebody mentioned that welfare doesn't guarentee they won't go to jail anyway. That's true, but who do you think is more likely to go bad, a kid with decent clothes to wear, food in his stomache and a sense of a future or a kid with ragged clothes who is hungry and has no hope of ever amounting to anything in a legal way?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That was me. Who is to say the welfare money even goes to these kids? Again, I stated earlier, welfare should be a safety net. Not a way of life.<br>
<br>
I want you people to show me the fact and scientific proof that giving people welfare keeps them out of prison. You all seem to make this connection that money solves all the problems. Where is the proof? It seems to me the more money we throw at people, the worse off they are becuase they become DEPENDENT on that money.<br>
<br>
<br>
You want to bring up families? My family comes from nothing. My father had to drop out of school to support his family in the 8th grade. He worked 2 jobs most of his life to raise his own family. He never took handouts form anyone. My mother worked full time as well. THAT is responsibility. THAT is what you do to survive. Not stick out your fucking hand and say GIMMIE GIMMIE GIMMIE.<br>

<br>
There are (or at least was) programs that are being implemented that will put a huge dent in welfare fraud. One of them is the welfare card. Instead of taking food stamps to the store, the person slides their welfare card through the scanner. This is like a debit card for food stamps and is a good way to keep participants from selling them for cash.<br>
<br>
I would like to see this implemented for the cash as well. Enough places take credit cards now that almost every mom and pop store has a scanner. If you received debits instead of actual cash, the state would have a record of EXACTLY where every dime was spent. It does invade privacy, but if you are on welfare, than I think giving up your privacy should be part of the deal so we can see where our money is going and what it is going for.<br>
<br>
As to whether poverty factors into a person becoming a criminal, the evidence is has been presented constantly in the media. Why do you think blacks are so highly represented in criminal statistics? Could it be that as a race, blacks have the highest number living in poverty? Or would you try to tell me that it's just a black thing?<br>
<br>
How many middle class people do you hear of mugging people? How many rich people are in gangs? Ask any police officer where the trouble spots are in his beat... I bet he doesn't include any well to do neighbourhoods. I mean, c'mon, this is common sense. <p><br>

I did not say that poverty is not connected to criminal behavior, I said that giving welfare does not keep people out of prison. There is a difference there.<br>
<br>
Do you think that giving someone welfare brings them out of poverty? I don't. Again, it creates a dependency on thge government. The card idea is a good one, but we will have to see how and when the government implements it. Also, how well they track it - we all know how well the government does things. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

I believe when it's done right that a majority of people would rather be independent. Welfare income is below poverty level and I think few people like living on low income. <br>
<br>
The problem is, when you get a job it has to pay enough for medical insurance (huge expense), child care (another biggie), rent and food before you even break even. People are afraid to get off welfare due to the medical insurance and child care for the most part. These 2 expenses alone can easily take 65% of your wage at a minumum wage job and that leaves 35% of your check for rent, food and utilities.<br>
<br>
I know there is a percentage of people who are lazy and wouldn't work for 1k a week, but I honestly believe they are the minority. I think alot of people are just afraid of becoming one of the working class poor who are actually worse off finacially than those on welfare. <p><br>
