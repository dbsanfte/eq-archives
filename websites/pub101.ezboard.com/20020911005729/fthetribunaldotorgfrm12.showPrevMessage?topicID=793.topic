I personally know 7 people who have had their chars names changed ~Against their Will~ due to changes made by the SoL expansion, as well as an additional 5 that have had their names changed because some GM doesn't like it.  Example of one is a friend of my who was Founder and Guild Leader of &quot;Legion of Pain&quot; had his last name taken from him (Pain) but yet is allowed to have (Payne) for a name?  Do the GM/guides have nothing better to do with their limited time/resources?  I petitioned one time when Somehow I received the Ranger epic in Trade but got no answer (Earthcaller) a No Drop weapon on my Enchanter but the same day a friend had her name taken from her because what ever reason.  I don't understand why new characters can run around with names like Frodo Baggins (knock from Lord of the Rings) and Pantyraider don't get their names changed?  At one point I tried to get my Surname removed from my Oger Warrior named Shihalude Goingtoeatcha, but found it a waste of time because I didn't want that last name. <br><br>~Edit~ I suppose had I wanted to keep the name It would have been removed.  <br><br>    Why do you (VI/Sony) continue to make EQ less desirable for older players?  When I started to play EQ, it was fun and addicting but lately with all that has been happening I haven't even logged in in two weeks because I don't want to deal with the poor CS.  I don't know if you moved every GM that knew anything about the game to the Legends server or what but this new Lead GM can and commonly is referred to as &quot;Hitler&quot; or &quot;Stalin&quot; because of his/her actions without explanations.  If you want those of us who have been loyal customers a year or more to just up and quit, then put that in a patch message and we will.  Many in my guild have played for more then a year, do you (VI/Sony) want a game run on repeat business or a game run on constant flow of new players that will quit after your free 30 days?  I played DAoC for a whole of 6 hours before I quit, BG II for a day and I quit, I have played EQ for nearly 18 months and still enjoy most of it.  Perhaps I will log in this weekend to see who quit over the last week due to things like this, if at that time Anyone would like to contact me about anything I said, I would be happy to talk, my Characters names that I currently play are Darmuth Daystar, 55 Beguiler of Legendary, and Swipft, 40 Iskar Monk of Collection of One....both on the Tribunal.<br><br>    I know nothing will be done about this matter but I find that I must in good faith make an effort to at leaste have someone look into what has been going on lately.  So many things that don't seem right.  Now before you say this is all negative, I have Meet a few guides/GM's that have been really nice and helpful.  There are so many things going on something must be done.  I have also put in an application to be a volunteer guide but have never received any word back about it.  I used to enjoy playing EQ but now I find myself questioning if I want to renew again 6 months from now, let us hope things change.<br><br>Darmuth Daystar<br>55 Beguiler<br>Legendary<br><br>Swipft <br>40 Iskar Monk<br>Collection of One<br><br><br>Edited name and number.<br><br>P.S.

Anytime we have to enforce our naming policy, we do run the risk that we will not be held with the highest regards by the customer affected by this enforcement as well as his or her friends. It appears that this is the case here and that all of you are unhappy with this ruling. It is my hope that I will be able to explain to you and your friends as to why we feel that Alwaysoom is a phrase and thus a violation of the naming policy per Section 11.<br><br>This is the definition of Always from Websters:<br><br>Main Entry: al·ways <br>Pronunciation: 'ol-wEz, -w&amp;z, -(&quot;)wAz also 'o-<br>Function: adverb<br>Etymology: Middle English alwayes, from alwey<br>Date: 14th century<br>1 : at all times : INVARIABLY<br>2 : FOREVER, PERPETUALLY<br>3 : at any rate : in any event <br><br>The important thing to note in the definition is under Function. Always is an adverb not an adjective or a noun. The general rule that we use here is that only adjectives or nouns can be used to start descriptive compounds. There are, of course, exceptions to this since English is a rather dynamic language. It's really hard to nail this down and write a policy for what makes a descriptive compound and what doesn't. <br><br>The last part of the surname in question is OOM. OOM is not a word but an acronym for Out of Mana which is a phrase by itself. I know that people have taken to pronouncing it as a word instead of pronouncing each letter (another great example of this is SoW) but it still remains what it really is... an acronym for a phrase.<br><br>Now we take and put it all together we have Always Out of Mana. This, to us, is clearly a defined phrase which does violate the policy under Section 11. As such, the ruling will stand and the surname will not be restored.<br><br>Once again, I do understand, David, that you have had this surname for a long time and that it's hard to have it taken away. It's always our focus and goal to make our customers as happy as possible and provide them with prompt quality service when able. At the same time, it's also important that we uphold the standard and policies that we have set for ourselves, Everquest and the populous of Norrath. In cases such as names and surname changes, those two usually clash and we have unhappy customers. <br><br>Another point that I wanted to make sure that I addressed since it was brought up several times was Aerendar changing the surname without notification. Several of you have submitted the section from our naming policy posted on our website that for category 3-13 violations that the customer will be notified first via in-game tell or email. This only applies to first names. It does not apply to surnames at all. First names are far more important to a character then surnames are because first names are what you are identified by. They are what your friends list search for. They are what comes up on a /who all in a zone. <br><br>I hope that I have accomplished my goal in this email and have explained our stance on this issue thoroughly and concisely. <br><br>If you should have further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.<br><br>Good day,<br><br>Lead Game Master Valdelmar<br>Sony Online Entertainment<br>akirton@soe.sony.com <br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.soe.sony.com">www.soe.sony.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br><br>What shit.<br><br>Dar <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 729<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/26/02 6:09:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always nice to chat with the lead GM.</span><hr size=1> What is it with the Tribunal server people wanting fucked up names?<br><br>There is a naming policy. Guides see a name that violates it and they add it to a list (guides can't change names). When a Sr Guide or a GM is not busy already and sees that person online, they change it. (or at least that's how it used to work).<br><br>If a GM pops into a zone on a pet and sees you there with a name that violates policy, he changes it.<br><br>If a person petitions your name because it violates policy, they change it.<br><br>I still don't get what is so hard to figure out about this. If one guide is slacking and doesn't report your name, that doesn't mean that every guide will do the same thing. If no GM/Guide happens to see your name for 30 levels, that doesn't mean you get to keep it. If a GM/Guide does see your name, but is busy at the time and doesn't change it, that doesn't mean you get to keep it.<br><br>I understand everyone has a right to their own pet peeves, but the naming policy seems pretty low on the list from my perspective. You start talking about people who get away with fraud in-game, then you'll get my interest level up, but this naming thing has been one long, lame ass cruesade over nothing.<br> <p><br><center> <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1146">Loegan Wolfheart </A> <br><center>Druid of the 60th Ring <br><center> Resident of The Tribunal <br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udarmuthdaystar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darmuth Daystar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/26/02 6:33:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Always nice to chat with the lead GM.</span><hr size=1> It's not about the nameing policy only.

It's not something that needs to be researched or discussed.  All the information the GM needs is right in front of him, and if your name violates the policy he's gonna take that 5 seconds to change it.  What does take up their time is douche bags like you that try to gewt away with something, then bitch and whine to CS about it.

This has happend to you?  Seems to me when I died in ToV (Temple of Veeshan in case your not familiar with ToV) I died in a wall, had to have a GM summon my corpse because a Necro couldn't do it.  No one could see my corpse except the GM, when we tried to assist off her for Rez/loot couldn't target corpse - GM was kind enough to give me a 96% rez same as cleric that was trying to rez me.  This also happend in Nerriak, had to have a GM summon a corpse, others could see it but it could not be rezed, no could they see their corpse.
