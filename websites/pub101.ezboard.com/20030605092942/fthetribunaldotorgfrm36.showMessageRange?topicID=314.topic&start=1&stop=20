Someone did a<br>
 lot of digging to get this kind of ringside seat to<br>
 history:<br>
 <br>
 1. The first German serviceman killed in the war was<br>
 killed by the Japanese(China, 1937), the first<br>
 American serviceman killed was killed by the Russians<br>
 (Finland, 1940), the highest ranking American killed<br>
 was Lt. Gen. Lesley McNair, killed by the US Army Air Corps.<br>
 <br>
 2. The youngest US serviceman was 12 year old, Calvin<br>
 Graham, USN. He was wounded and given a Dishonorable<br>
 Discharge for lying about his age. (His benefits were<br>
 later restored by an act of Congress)<br>
 <br>
 3. At the time of Pearl Harbor, the top US Navy<br>
 command was called CINCUS (pronounced &quot;sink us&quot;), the<br>
 shoulder patch of the US Army's 45th. Infantry<br>
 division was the Swastika, and Hitler's private train<br>
 was named &quot;Amerika.&quot;<br>
 All three were soon changed for PR purposes.<br>
 <br>
 4. More US servicemen died in the Air Corps than the<br>
 Marine Corps. While completing the required 30<br>
 missions your chance of being killed was 71%.<br>
 <br>
 5. Generally speaking there was no such thing as an<br>
 average fighter pilot.  You were either an ace or a<br>
 target. For instance Japanese ace, Hiroyoshi Nishizawa<br>
 shot down over 80 planes. He died while a passenger on<br>
 a cargo plane.<br>
 <br>
 6. It was a common practice on fighter planes to load<br>
 every 5th round with a tracer round to aid in aiming.<br>
 This was a mistake.  Tracers had different ballistics<br>
 so (at long range) if your tracers were hitting the<br>
 target, 80% of your rounds were missing.  Worse yet,<br>
 tracers instantly told your enemy he was under fire<br>
 and from which direction. Worst of all was the practice of<br>
 loading a string of tracers at the end of the belt to<br>
 tell you that you were running out of ammo. This was<br>
 definitely not something you wanted to tell the enemy.<br>
 Units that stopped using tracers saw their success<br>
 rate nearly double and their loss rate go down.<br>
 <br>
 7. When allied armies reached the Rhine the first<br>
 thing men did was pee in it. This was pretty universal<br>
 from the lowest private to Winston Churchill (who made<br>
 a big show of it) and Gen.Patton (who had himself<br>
 photographed in the act).<br>
 <br>
 8. German Me264 bombers were capable of bombing New York City.<br>
 <br>
 9. German submarine U120 was sunk by a malfunctioning<br>
 toilet.<br>
 <br>
 10. Among the first &quot;Germans&quot; captured at Normandy<br>
 were several Koreans. They had been forced to fight<br>
 for the Japanese Army until they were captured by the<br>
 Russians and forced to fight for the Russian Army<br>
 until they were captured by the Germans and forced to<br>
 fight for the German Army until they were captured by<br>
 the US Army.<br>
 <br>
 11. Following a massive naval bombardment, 35,000 US<br>
 and Canadian troops stormed ashore at Kiska. 21 troops<br>
 were killed in the firefight. It would have been worse<br>
 if there had been any Japanese on the island.<br>
<br>
The above was sent to me in an Email.  I found them pretty funny.  As to if they are &quot;facts&quot; or not, I don't really know.<br>

<br>
12 Not that bombers were helpless. A B-17 carried 4 tons of bombs and 1.5 tons of machine gun ammo. The US 8th Air Force shot down 6,098 fighter planes, 1 for every 12,700 shots fired. <br>
<br>
13 Germany's power grid was much more vulnerable than realized. One estimate is that if just 1% of the bombs dropped on German industry had instead been dropped on power plants German industry would have collapsed. <br>
<br>
14 A number of aircrewmen died of farts. (ascending to 20,000 ft. in an unpressurized aircraft causes intestinal gas to expand 300%). <br>
<br>
15 The Russians destroyed over 500 German aircraft by ramming them in mid-air (they also sometimes cleared minefields by marching over them). &quot;It takes a brave man not to be a hero in the Red Army&quot; - Joseph Stalin <br>
<br>
16 The US Army had more ships than the US Navy. (wonder if this counted landing craft)<br>
<br>
17 The German Air Force had 22 infantry divisions, 2 armor divisions, and 11 paratroop divisions. None of them were capable of airborne operations. The German Army had paratroops who WERE capable of airborne operations. Go figure. <br>
<br>
18 When the US Army landed in North Africa, among the equipment brought ashore was 3 complete Coca Cola bottling plants. <br>
<br>
19 The Graf Spee never sank. The scuttling attempt failed and the ship was bought as scrap by the British. On board was Germany's newest radar system. <br>
<br>
<br>
20 One of Japan's methods of destroying tanks was to bury a very large artillery shell with only the nose exposed. When a tank came near enough a soldier would whack the shell with a hammer. &quot;Lack of weapons is no excuse for defeat.&quot; - LtGen. Mutaguchi <br>
<br>
21 The MISS ME was an unarmed Piper Cub. While spotting for US artillery her pilot saw a similar German plane doing the same thing. He dove on the German plane and he and his co-pilot fired their pistols damaging the German plane enough that it had to make a forced landing. Whereupon they landed and took the Germans prisoner. I don't know where they put them since the MISS ME only had 2 seats. <br>
<br>
22 Most members of the Waffen SS were not German. <br>
<br>
23 The only nation that Germany declared war on was the USA. <br>
<br>
24 During the Japanese attack on Hong Kong British officers objected to Canadian infantrymen taking up positions in the officer's mess. No enlisted men allowed you know. <br>
<br>
25 Nuclear physicist Niels Bohr was rescued in the nick of time from German occupied Denmark. While Danish resistance fighters provided covering fire he ran out the back door of his home stopping momentarily to grab a beer bottle full of precious &quot;Heavy Water&quot;. He finally reached England still clutching the bottle. Which contained beer. I suppose some German drank the Heavy Water. <br>

The B-17 had a maximum bomb load of 9.4 tons but the normal load seldom surpassed 2.2 tons because larger loads reduced the bomber's range.<br>

The first 3 divisions were purely German and they adhered to the Aryan philosophy.  The LeibStandardte (Hitler's private Guard), Totenkopf (Death's Head) and Das Reich.  Eventually the Waffen SS expanded to almost 30 divisions but as the losses were piling up, the Aryan creed was thrown out the window and Waffen SS had basically every European nationality in its ranks and also arabs in it as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 862<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/2/03 9:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I found out that the 45th's shoulder patch was changed in 1939 to that of a &quot;thunderbird&quot;, though it looks more like a falcon.

The infamous &quot;Rape of Nanking&quot; occured before Germany invaded Poland yet it is rightfully associated with WW2.  (In another very ironic twist of WW2., One of the reason we know so much about Nanking is because a local german citizen, who was a zealous nazi, was so horrified by the actions of Japanese soldiers he went to great lengths to record and smuggle out evidence of the atrocities.  For somewhat obvious reason his superiors in Germany were not quite as shocked and suppressed his reports.  They were found by the allies after germany's surrender.) <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
In April, 1937, Claire L. Chennault, then a captain in the United States Army Air Corps, retired from active duty and accepted an offer form Madame Chiang Kai-shek for a three month mission to China to make a confidential survey of the Chinese Air Force.  At that time China and Japan were on the verge of war and the fledgling Chinese Air Force was beset by internal problems and torn between American and Italian influence.  Madame Chiang Kai-shek took over leadership of the Aeronautical Commission in order to reorganize the Chinese Air Force.  This was the beginning of Chennault's stay in China which did not terminate until 1945 at the close of World War II.  Chennault's combat and other experiences between 1937 and 1941 in China are another story, but it was these experiences together with the knowledge he attained of combat tactics and the operations of Japanese Air Force over China that laid the ground work for the organization of the American Volunteer Group in 1941.<br>
<br>
The official status of Claire L. Chennault in China prior to 1942 was always a subject of speculation.  Chennault himself states that he was a civilian advisor to the Secretary of the Commission for Aeronautical Affairs, first Madame Chiang and later T.V. Soong.  Until he returned to active duty with the United States Army in the spring of 1942, four months after Pearl Harbor, he had no legal status as a belligerent and held no rank other than retired captain in the United States Army.  Even while he commanded the American Volunteer Group in combat, his official job was adviser to the Central Bank of China, and his passport listed his occupation as a farmer.<br>

Considering some of your other views on things I am surprised to here you state an opinion that the war didn't start till fighting broke out in europe.
