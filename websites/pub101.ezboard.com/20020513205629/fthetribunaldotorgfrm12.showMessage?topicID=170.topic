Soandso did this and that, what the fuck is wrong with &lt;insert guild here&gt;?!<br>
<br>
Oh so now you hate our guild now because of a few people acting like this?<br>
<br>
I personally won't hate you,  but I will look down on the guild as a whole.  If your guild allows people that go out of their way to be a pain in someone's ass, I look down on the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
Discipline your members.  If they continue to be a problem, /guildremove them.<br>
<br>
Sadly the above will never be done, because I can think of several guilds that would probably lose half their members, and they wouldn't be able to do some of the things they do now. <p><b>Bronus Blackblade</b><br>

<br>
let's say, for example, that I said that Shining Path was the lamest bunch of pricks in all of Everquest.  That you're out to screw over everyone and have no respect for the rest of the server.<br>
<br>
Now, a few months later, I've still been saying all this, but now I say that 2 SP members did something on a raid I was at.  Would you believe me?  After all the belittling I did of your guild?  Would you believe it to be true?<br>

Sapphon says Slannesh got a warning on his account.<br>
Slannesh says he didn't get a warning on his account.<br>

Giving items to mobs doesn't change their delay or damage, so that point is moot.  the only thing that that effects is the proc of weapons  (ie the annulling sword WILL strip bebuffs)<br>

The recent issue spawned this posting, but I was speaking in a broader sense.  <br>
<br>
For example, if someone is of a 'needed' class, you can bet there are several guilds out there that would let this person act like an ass, and still remain a member of said guild.  People care more about doing big things than about the actions of their guildmates.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, but I truly dislike people trying to brush the actions off as trivial because the guild as a whole did not participate.<br>
<br>
When I actually read that other thread, before I had heard any names I already had an idea in my mind about who was involved.  I do not hold grudges, but specifically the SK and Druid mentioned have caused problems on a raid I led (Kael), and the Druid on a raid I participated in.<br>
<br>
Were they raid crashing problems?  No, not really.  Couple weapons, mod rods given to mobs, tons of foraged vegetables and other junk items does make it a little more difficult to clear out the fallen NPC's.  It just goes to show poor integrity.<br>
<br>
That being said, I agree with you Bacris - you should always consider the source. <p><b>Bronus Blackblade</b><br>

<br>
If you have a problem where a situation arises with a fellow guildmember who is being an ass to you, and no officers are around, what can you do?<br>
<br>
* Logs can be faked.<br>
* Word of mouth can be faked (lies).<br>
* Screenshots are pretty good but can be faked.<br>
<br>
So personally, I don't tend to believe 95% of what is said when someone says &quot;XYZ did ABC to me!! What an outrage!&quot; Alternatively, I can operate on the assumption that such was the case but I don't _know_ what happened and I'll _never_ know for sure.<br>
<br>
Now apply that principle to people outside your guild, with antipathy towards your guild for real or imagined or just fucking overblown wrongs done in the past.<br>
<br>
My faith in humanity is that when it suits them, they will cheat/murder/steal/lie to do whatever it is that makes them &quot;better&quot; or fulfills their desires, when they think they can get away with it.<br>
<br>
On the internet, it's all he said/she said, so I don't operate under that principle. If I see someone saying something, that's different, I have first hand perspective of what they said. If I see a situation occur, ditto... If i get told what happened or what someone said... well... I tend to place very little value on its veracity. The only time I consider hearsay is when I have multiple people telling me different stories which all fit together like a puzzle without a piece missing... &quot;I told this person XYZ and I didn't tell anyone else&quot; &quot;XYZ told me ABC had told them blahblah&quot;, etc., you get my drift.<br>
<br>
But that's just me, formerly an officer of CoP and now just a member of the Comps.<br>

If someone is doing a raid, or setting up to move into a raid, just leave them alone.  If you were planning on doing a raid at the same location, and they got there first, better luck next time.  If you insist on &quot;watching&quot;, then be a mouse, don't stand in the way, engage mobs, converse with mobs, talk, or emote.<br>

This is true, but if you want to take it to such extremes, anything in the entire world can be faked.  Video tapes of crimes, photographs...well maybe the exception being DNA or something.  Anyway, I think it's a bad idea to say I am never going to believe anything anyone ever says because they could be lying.  The difference is being objective, not dismissive.<br>
<br>
I think guilds have a responsibility to keep track of what their members do, if they truly care about their reputation.  Simply washing your hands of any information simply because you can't prove anything 100% in this game is exactly the problem I am talking about. <p><b>Bronus Blackblade</b><br>

<br>
Sad to say but I must agree.  We were once in an alliance and a member of the other guild behaved like a spoilt child and abused one of your members openly (read: in OOC instead of tells).  It didn't help that our member retaliated but I don't blame him really.  The alliance split over this.  A few months down the track both the parties involved  have left each guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Sigh, what a waste of a potentially fruitful alliance just because a few poeple acted like idiots.<br>
<br>
This is why I watch the trouble makers and won't hesitate to boot them from the guild once i have enough reason (and my tolerance is pretty low).  Will this mean my guild will always be &quot;minor&quot;?  Yes, but I (purely personal choice and not a lecture or preeching) prefer a guild with dignity and standards above all.  It's not perfect but we're working on it daily <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
Bronus, i completely agree with where you're coming from here...as well as Druugyn.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry... Been an officer for about a year and a half in two different guilds.. both based on Integrity and Good Gameplay..<br>
<br>
I'd never, ever in a million years approach a situation with &quot;You can't prove Dick&quot;.  That's just lame  and proves how much you don't care about reputation, honor and treating others the way you want to be treated.<br>
<br>
