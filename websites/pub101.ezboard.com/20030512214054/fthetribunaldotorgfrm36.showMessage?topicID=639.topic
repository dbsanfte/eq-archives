<br>
Here are some of the highlites for the time or attention impaired:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Take the vast security apparatus with which Saddam surrounded himself, the torture chambers and the huge bureaucracy which was its foundation. <br>
<br>
President Bush promised that America was campaigning for human rights in Iraq, that the guilty, the war criminals, would be tracked down and brought to trial. <br>
<br>
Now the 60 secret police headquarters in Baghdad are empty; even the three-square-mile compound headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. <br>
<br>
I have been to many of them. But not a single British or American officer has visited the sites to sift through the wealth of documents lying there or talk to the ex-prisoners who are themselves visiting their former places of torment. <br>
<br>
Is this through idleness. Or is this willful?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Were they monsters, these men? Yes. <br>
<br>
Are they sought by the Americans? No. <br>
<br>
Are they now working for the Americans? Yes, quite possibly - indeed some of them may well be in the long line of ex-security thugs who queue every morning outside the Palestine Hotel in the hope of being re-hired by the US Marines' Civil Affairs unit. <br>
<br>
The names of the guards at the Qasimiyeh torture centre in Baghdad - pedestrians were forbidden to walk down the road outside lest they heard the screams - are all named on the documents lying on the floor. <br>
<br>
They were Ahmed Hassan Alawi, Akil Shaheed, Noaman Abbas and Mohamed Fayad. <br>
<br>
But the Americans haven't bothered to find this out. So Messers Alawai, Shaheed, Abbas and Fayad are welcome to apply for work from the Americans.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There's a substantial pile of papers, for example, recording the existence of a new super-drug for cancer which a number of Arab doctors wanted to manufacture in Iraq and - according to one file - &quot;to test on Iraqis&quot;. <br>
<br>
It includes a personal letter to Saddam Hussein from Dr Ahmed Shehada who appears to be associated with the Saddam Medical Clinic in Baghdad and who appeals to Saddam to allow Egyptian and Syrian medical personnel to involve themselves in the 14 years of research on the drug. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have to cooperate with each other to break the (UN) embargo that is imposed on you by the United States and the British Government,&quot; Dr Shehada writes to Saddam. <br>
<br>
&quot;We beg God to preserve you, Your Excellency. Long life to you and long life to Iraq, our brother in Islam.&quot; <br>
<br>
An Iraqi intelligence file attached to this correspondence states approvingly that Dr Shehada can be trusted. <br>
<br>
Intriguingly, it notes that the doctor is a Jordanian &quot;who also carries American citizenship&quot;. <br>
<br>
But again, the Americans have not bothered - or do not want - to search through these papers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now here's another question the Iraqis are asking - and to which I cannot provide an answer: <br>
<br>
On the last weekend of the invasion, the Americans dropped four 900kg bombs on the Baghdad residential area of Mansour. They claimed they thought Saddam was hiding there. They knew they would kill civilians because it was not, as one of the Centcom mandarins said, a &quot;risk-free venture&quot;. <br>
<br>
So they dropped their bombs and killed 14 civilians in Mansour, most of them members of a Christian family. <br>
<br>
The Americans announced that they couldn't be sure they had killed Saddam until they could carry out forensic tests at the site. But this turns out to have been a lie. <br>
<br>
I went to the site two days ago. Not a single American or British official - forensic official or soldier -- had bothered to visit the bomb craters. No western forensic experts have examined the mass of debris. <br>
<br>
Indeed, when I arrived, there was a putrifying smell and families pulled the remains of a tiny baby from the rubble. No American officers have apologised for this appalling killing. <br>
<br>
And I can promise them that the baby I saw being placed under a sheet of black plastic was very definitely not Saddam Hussein. Had they bothered to look at this place - as they claimed they would - they would at least have found the baby.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Rest assured that we're not going to let murderous Baathists back into power.  We may not have combed through every police station for papers yet, but the job will be done...<br>
<br>
This is nothing more than more sensationalist reporting, trying to stir up shit with a stick to sell papers, or whatever...<br>

For crying out loud, at least wait a month or two and see what happens before breaking out this kind of crap! <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 866<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/17/03 9:44:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=639.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just read this</span><hr size=1> that's if you get that long before the shit hits the fan... am curious to see how long chalabi will last. should we start the pool ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3190<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/17/03 9:53:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=639.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just read this</span><hr size=1> Well, I would have let the whole thing slide except I saw the part about the cancer superdrug and didn't want to put just that out there without the rest as you kinda have to see all this guy has witnessed in order to make up your mind if he is an informed reporter or just repeating 2nd hand info.<br>
<br>
I also was concerned about the part where the site they bombed where Saddam allegedly was hasn't been checked out. I think they have definitely had time for something that important, unless it wasn't what they said to begin with.<br>
<br>
As to the rest, I agree most of it is probably sensalitionism, but I think it is also true that alot of the papers they can't get to soon will end up lost forever. Isn't this another hint that we should have had more troops as we could have been collecting alot more evidence? <br>
<br>
The more I see going on in Iraq, the more I see the need for the UN, more troops or both.<br>

<br>
But, again... we all seem to just rely WAY too much on what the freaking media &quot;tells&quot; us.  There is just too much going on behind the scenes that we don't know.  So again, just like prior to the war, sit back, and keep your conspiracies coming, but just be prepared for further information.<br>
<br>
I just spoke to a friend from high school who is Army SF last night.  He's back from deployment, and said that the Republican Guard was trained more like our National Guard.  Basically, he said they threw fire down range, but our Girl/Boy Scouts could have probably routed them.  They were not the elite force hyped up to be.<br>
<br>
I agree, stability needs to be put in place, and as far as the site of where Saddam was supposedly bombed...well, we need a secure area to allow those folks to work.  Just give it all time, and we'll have our answers.  Whether good, or bad, we'll get them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=639.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=639.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=639.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=639.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=639.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=639.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=639.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
