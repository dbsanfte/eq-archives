<br>
<br>
Once, I threw my vyemm's fang.  I was told that it was great for the ranged slot, so I was trying it out.  Problem was that I am used to having a bow in ranged, and a monk told me to help him split a pull.. so i hit ranged attack..and boom! There goes the fang.  Yes. Its the dagger off Vyemm in NTov.  Well...I was FREAKING OUT...I petitioned...and they told me to suck it, basically.  So I escalated...I explained to Aerendar that the item doesn't have a range listed and that it was no drop, etc so it shouldnt have been able to be thrown, etc...and he graciously replaced the one I had lost and told me not to throw this one ;)  What ended up being the worst part of throwing the fang was that I missed the target...heh<br>
<br>
He also was very kind and fixed the ninja incident on my 10th ring. VERY FAST...like within half an hour or so...That ruled.<br>
<br>
There are some things that I have noticed, however, and they might not be all his fault...But the taking away of sirnames is just silly.  Unless they are nasty or extremely inappropriate, I think people should be able to keep their sirnames.  Names like Saviour and DMeutrier and Bagg...Come on...anyway...I am sure there is enough Sirname talk in this thread...<br>
<br>
The other thing that bothers me about him is that he is not extremely familiar with many of the quest mechanics nor is he familiar with the lore of the game.  I will give him a chance to learn it and catch up before I bitch about this again...<br>
<br>
It seems just wrong to leave this post with negative things, so one more thing I like about him is that he is trying hard to get to know the players in this game and he is being social, which, on the Tribunal, is a necessity.  He has HUGE shoes to fill since he has predicessors like Valshire and Nocnivin...<br>
<br>
He is trying hard and I think for the most part is being a decent GM which providing somewhat decent customer service at the same time.  There is always room for improvement ;)  <br>

Tuesday after the servers came up we went to Velks to try Lord Bob. Someone looted the POS ring that he dropped. After no response on Tuesday night I finally talked to him last night. His response to me was that he could not tell who looted the ring, but if I knew who it was he would look and see if they have it on them. My response was that if I knew who looted it I would not be talking to you. <br>
<br>
Guess it all depends on the item and how much time he wants to invest. <p><center><img src="http://www.fiberoptica.net/images/baraden.gif" border="0"></center>

He sure acts like it. Someone forgot to tell him that people pay his employer money to have fun in this game, not to log in one day and be told that after 2 years their name has to go because he has a hair up his ass.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt he's reading this right now and marking my name in his little book of people to make sure they don't get as good a quality service as they pay for. But fuck him. He's a typical VI representitive. Knows very little about the game he is supposed to be refereeing, and just does the bare minimum to make sure he looks good to his superiors by enforcing the rules, and just enough to make sure we don't think he's a total cock and cancel our accounts.<br>
<br>
Hey dickhead! No one petitioned Beened's last name becuase it interfered with their enjoyment of the game! You're just a fucking cock!<br>
<br>
Until he came along I thought Cogito was being too hard on VI's customer service. Now I understand completely. Bring back Valshire. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

<br>
People petition an illegal name, and if it's against naming policy (accessable via the Everquest webpage) then they HAVE to do something about it.<br>
<br>
I had to rename a twink Pronstar because it was going to be deleted if I didn't.  That was with Nocnivin, and she was more than helpful to my &quot;Eh, I think I need a namechange&quot; petition, I believe her direct response was, &quot;uh... yeah, you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blurring lost Motion as his last name because of a petition, I'm pretty sure that a lot of these people are losing theirs because someone gets a bug up their ass or gets upset at someone and thinks &quot;Well, I'll just get them a namechange.&quot;<br>
<br>
To Remnant, dude, you had a name that you KNEW was from Star Trek, you might not have chosen it for that, but now you're complaining because you got it removed?  WTF dude.  Everyone knows the policy, if not read it.  Your name broke the rules.<br>
<br>
I can see the stuff about Beened being sort of anal, but like I said, that was probably a petition.  And obviously you pissed him off, hence the tell to stop harassing him.  It's like a cop, if you get pulled over and be an ass to him, you're going to get a ticket.  But if you generally go along with things and are courteous to the guy, he's probably going to do the same to you.<br>
