I usually don't side with the plaintiff's bar (or Ralph Nader), but in this case he made sense.<br>
<br>
1. McDonalds didn't just serve 'hot' coffee, but EXTREMELY HOT coffee (shut up, i don't remember the exact temp =P). Much hotter than places like Starbucks serve their coffee. So hot that this woman suffered 2nd, and 3rd degree burns from the spill. McDonalds maintained that customers wanted it at that temp so it wouldn't be cool by the time they go around to drinking it.<br>
<br>
2. They served this scalding beverage in flimsy cups with lids that were easily dislodged. In fact, this was not the first time someone was badly burned by their coffee. McDonalds had done nothing to correct the situation.<br>
<br>
3. McDonalds had rejected offers to settle the case for far less than the final judgement, choosing to take its chances with a jury verdict.<br>
<br>
4. The high amount of the jury's award was based in large part to punish McDonalds for their failure to address the issue in the face of the multiple, previous incidents of scalding.<br>
<br>
5. The multi-million dollar award was later reduced to a few hundred thousand by an appellate judge. <br>
<br>
The point is, its not as clear-cut a case of 'lawyers out of control' as it was portrayed at the time. <br>

People love that fucking McDonald's case. But, I can see her fucking point. We all like coffee hot &amp; so we really don't understand it when someone says this was too hot. It was too fucking hot. It was to the point of boiling. It spilled all over her genitals &amp; burned the everliving shit out of them.<br>

The lady in question was not driving, her grandson was. I could never determine if the car was in motion or not, but I belive it had not yet exited the parking lot. <br>
<br>
Basically, what happened is, <br>
- the lady was elderly, her fingers not too nimble. She spilled the coffee on herself in the car, while trying to put cream/sugar in it. <br>
- She went to the hospital with severe burns in her groin region.<br>
- Later on, contacted the restaurant, asking them to cover the hospital bill (but did not ask for damages). <br>
- The restaurant refused. <br>
- The lawsuit uncovered that many such incidents had taken place prior to this, and McD had been approached by customers before, about their coffee being far hotter than most. <br>
- McD countered with taste tests that they had done, showing that people LIKED the coffee this hot, but also that on average, people would buy the coffee, drive somewhere -- to work for instance, this would take a certain amount of time (statistical average), and the coffee would be at the perfect temperature THEN. Ie., according to this, the coffee was not actually MENT to be consumed, in the state (uber hot) it was, when customers received it. <br>
- The jury, being made up of retards who can't get out of jury duty, awarded the normal monster bag of monies.<br>
- A judge reduced the settlement, as often happens. <br>
- McD reduced the termperature, and introduced the warning. <br>
- Another woman tried to sue Burger King for the same reason, but that one was thrown out. I'm not sure what the circumstances were. <br>
<br>
That's it in a nutshell. <br>
<br>
I am sorry the lady hurt herself. But I do not feel the coorporation was at fault in any way whatsoever. An elderly person is not very nimble, and to fiddle with a cup of coffee in a car, holding it over your crotch, that's just plain stupid. I'm sorry it happened. But it was an accident caused by very bad judgement. <br>
<br>
It's not the end of the world, but simply an example of how the legal system is fucked. It's law, but it's not justice. Just like the good samaritan principle (an olympic swimmer can stand by idly, watching a baby drown in a swimming pool -- he does not have to lift a finger to help, even though he can easily do so without causing harm to himself). <br>
<br>
On the flipside, most private persons are screwed if they go up against a corporation. McD has gone after people who distribute literature about their mistreatment of employees, harmful effect on environment etc. Read up on those poor fuckers, and it damn near makes you cheer that senile old bat for having given them a kick in the ass -- no matter how stupid it was. <br>
<br>
But my end opinion is, I don't like it. You can't go round rewarding people for fucking up.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umandoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/01 9:09:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the general population of the world is.....</span><hr size=1> I remember bout a month after th mcD incident went live ( was working at taco bell at the time in high school ) we got new lids for the nacho cheese cups that came with nachos, content may be hot heh... like you cant tell when you pick the fucker up?<br>

Got the story from a cop this apparently happened in his district. He left the force because he ate too many donuts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uihri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ihri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/15/01 3:25:33 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.t-online.de/home/D.Sternheimer/cat.gif height=96 width=96></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the general population of the world is.....</span><hr size=1> Hiya<br>
<br>
How comes that in Europe we have neither stupid warning labels on any kind of product, especially if the text on the label should be obvious regarding the produkt, nor that anyone can get these immense amounts of money for damages in court  for basically just being plain stupid?<br>
<br>
There has been a case in germany where a guy has stuck his dick in a vacuum cleaner for sexual stimulation. It was a small handheld device and it had a fan right behind the nozzle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've seen some of the pics he used in a court case to sue the manufacturer afterwards (the manufacturer sued everyone who tried to make these pics public in fear of bad publicity) but he failed in court because the vacuum was not designed to be used as a sexual stimulant and thus the manufacturer is not responsible for any damages caused by any use other then vacuum cleaning.<br>
Oh, and there is no label on the vacuum saying not to stick your dick into it either.<br>

Loads of stories like these, plus other things that just plain defy description.  And about 90% of them have links to actual newspapers that ran the stories.<br>

He sued his employers successfully arguing that no mater how hard he tried the system should be safe short of actually removing panels on purpose.<br>

the big question was, dude why put your dick in there? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=117.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessage?topicID=119.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessage?topicID=85.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm8">Cogito's Whacky Woondarland<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm4">Events, Parties, Weddings, etc.<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm13">DarkMask's Illusions<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm14">Bowynn's Playsure Palace<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm2">Admin Stuff<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <table border=0><tr><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
