Dupont is a huge contributor to the repopulation of endangered species.  They have, out of their own pocket, developed countless wetlands and animal sanctuaries and even have employees devoted to encouraging development of endangered species of plants and animals on property that they pay for out of their profits.  Yes, the nature of their business requires animal testing in some measure, but I can assure you that I know from personal experience it isn't done maliciously and they give back way more to our environment than they take.  Many of the animals that they use for testing are bred on sanctuaries and lead normal lives until they are randomly caught and used for testing purposes under humane conditions.<br>

Type II diabetes is a condition where your insulin becomes resistant to processing glucose.  This can be reversed by changing your diet.  Type I diabetes is the other 5%, which is where your pancreas does not produce enough insulin to process the sugar you eat.  This HAS to be taken care of by supplementing your insulin with daily shots...changing your diet only lessens the amount you need.<br>

You obviously know nothing about how the immune system works do you.  Guess what...our immune system DID kick small pox in the balls...once we were exposed to a smaller, less harmful amount of it in the form of a vaccine.  There are no drugs that can do anything against viruses...the only way to beat them is to let the immune system beat them.<br>
<br>
And no animals were tortured in developing vaccines...in fact it was in trying to cure cow pox that the vaccine was discovered.  <br>

I'm not one of those people who relies on witchcraft or shit like that, not an idealist who folds on his convictions and goes running to a doctor at the first sign of something.  I believe in orthomolecular medicine, which is healing the body through natural compounds and nutrients found IN the body.  It was developed by a man named Linus Pauling.<br>
<br>
You know who Linus Pauling is?  He's the only man in history to win 2 nobel prizes.  One was in chemistry.  So I think he knows a little bit more than your average drug-indoctrinated med student.  He was shunned by the medical community because he insisted the body could be healed without a need or dependence on prescription drugs, and he was a big advocate of Vitamin C.<br>
<br>
He's the Nikola Tesla of medicine.  Prevention through proper diet and nutrients is the key -- know how much a med student is taught about nutrient and diet in 8 years of schooling?  3 hours.  In 8 years.  Guess that's because the pharmaceutical companies provide all the text books and grant money for experiments and equipment.  When all you're taught is how to prescribe medicine for symptoms, that's all you know.<br>
<br>
I don't believe or support idiots who make ridiculous statements about chickens or comparisons to tragedies either.  The fact is animal use in scientific testing is not needed, never was.  And certainly not torturing animals.  <br>

Humans OWN animals.  Animals are our means for making our lives better since the days of the cavemen and throughout our history.  As long as we don't deplete nature of them and we care for them and treat them humanely (something we should do BECAUSE of our higher intelligence and lack of cruelty) then all is good.  For the most part, I tend to believe that most companies ARE humane due in part to fanatics like PETA.  However, a long history of slanted reporting and misrepresented propaganda has caused me to disbelieve most of what they report.  <br>
<br>
Sure, you can cite examples of inhumanity, but that doesn't mean that all testing is inhumane.  There are examples of extremes in any topic you name, it doesn't mean that the foundation of our existance and self-preservation needs to be changed.  <br>
<br>
Dvin, I was agreeing with you, why you tell me STFUW?<br>
<br>
However, something you failed to mention is that the reason that older medicines weren't tested on animals was because it was tested on humans.  We developed laws since then that regulate testing to avoid the horror stories that come with human testings and non-tested drugs being released.<br>
<br>
Also what you failed to mention is the HUGE loss of human life that occurs with your proposed immune system method.  Seems to me you musta wrote that chicken misery crap about the Sept 11 tragedy.<br>

<br>
Then they start rounding you and your fellow humans up and do extremely painful tests on you and justify it by saying they are worth more than you and that they treat you humanly while they are stapling your eyes open and cutting your vocal chords out. What is a few million human lives if it can save the life of this races members?<br>
<br>
Would it lessen your suffering knowing that your sacrafice would mean that some fat bitch wouldn't have an allergic reaction to the chemicals she uses to paint her face? Or that they could make more money off their food by using the additives they filled you full of to add another week of shelf life? Or that maybe you could help them find a cure for that STD they got while whoring around? They you could feel really good about the government grants that made it profitable to torture humans even though it only yielded previously known data.<br>
<br>
With your view Wolvar, you should be the first to volunteer.<br>
<br>
Your strong support for animal testing makes me wish human testing was employed. Animals feel pain just like humans do.You should really experience the the suffering you support. <p><br>

Cancer is the overgrowth of cells due to the mutation of peptides caused by free radical damage.  Free radicals are scavenger molecules that inhabit the body and are produced by just about every process of the body from eating to taking light in through our eyes.  Free radicals are destroyed by antioxidants, which I'm sure you've heard of.  Consume the proper amounts of antioxidants and the free radicals will never damage cells and you'll never get cancer.  Obviously there's more to it than that but like I said I'm pressed for time.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for AIDS, it doesn't exist.  Before you start your incredulous campaign against me for saying it doesn't, do me a favor and find a medical resource book and/or site about aids and learn what the definition of AIDS and when someone is diagnosed with having it.  Then you'll be prepared for when I show you how wrong it is.  The only reason AIDS exists is because the cocktails to combat it are big-time money.<br>

Just because i condone and agree with testing on animals before humans doesn't mean i agree with inhumane treatment.  I do believe there is a certain justification level that needs to be reached but I think folks at PETA are way fanatical about it.

I used to read it just to laugh my ass off at how mis-informed they all were.  <br>
<br>
One example of this:  They had an article on the cruelty of shearing sheep.  It was all about how these poor sheep are tortured needlessly just to support man's greedy need for wool.  Well, I hate to point it out, but NOT shearing a sheep leads to numerous other problems ten-thousand times worse than shearing.  Domesticated sheeps' wool when unsheared continues to grow and tangle until the animal can no longer walk.  They would then lay upon the ground bleating piteously until they died of thirst.  Also, not shearing them allows all sorts of parasites to make a nice little home in the wool, bringing them massive discomfort and even illness.  Not to mention, on a hot day, those sheep LOVE not having a thick coat of wool causing them to overheat.  <br>
On top of that...the process of shearing is no worse than getting a haircut.  These animals are highly valuable, and you can bet no rancher worth their salt is going to damage one of these animals.  (And ranchers, believe it or not, actually CARE FOR THEIR ANIMALS.)<br>
<br>
This is just one example of the unfounded accusations made without enough proof daily on the PETA webpage.  Granted, I haven't been there since I fell out of my desk chair laughing and struck my head on the desk.  I figured that a good laugh wasn't worth the pain.  <br>
<br>
Now, before you label me as a totally heartless biatch, I just want to say, I am as big an animal lover as any PETA member.  I just have the common sense to realize that there's a difference between mild discomfort and torture.  It might not be comfortable for that sheep to lay and get it's coat sheared, but they'll get up with no harm done.  Better than the alternatives.<br>
<br>

&quot;AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. An HIV-infected person receives a diagnosis of AIDS after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. An HIV-positive person who has not had any serious illnesses also can receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4+ counts). &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that causes AIDS. This virus is passed from one person to another through blood-to-blood and sexual contact. In addition, infected pregnant women can pass HIV to their baby during pregnancy or delivery, as well as through breast-feeding. People with HIV have what is called HIV infection. Most of these people will develop AIDS as a result of their HIV infection.&quot;<br>

I never said that animals were harmed in the testing of those vaccines. I was contradicting your statement that we don’t need medical science to fight disease or vaccines, that all we need is our own immune system, which has done so well on its own throughout history.<br>
<br>
Thanks for giving me a little lesson in how vaccines work though. I was so confused about it since not having seen anything about it since reading a Louie Pasteur children’s book in the 3rd grade.<br>
<br>
Oh, and your belief in orthomolecular medicine is cute and we all really give a shit.<br>
<br>
And I am truly sorry for making a claim that you were a wacko &amp; had no sense of reality. That government has cures for every disease theory is starting to sound plausible. <br>
<br>
Not to mention I am now wholly convinced that you are right &amp; the only reason we are testing on animals is for “exerting some sense of superiority over another species.” Quite possible we do it just to make up for physical inadequacies.<br>
<br>
I will join you in your Orwellian uprising as soon as I can find a decent hat to wear. <p><BR>

<br>
Again, I'm not going to get into my &quot;real&quot; views much here - simply debating a point (I'm actually an animal lover with a biochemistry degree ;) how's that for seeing both sides? hehe).  However, one point is being missed here:<br>
<br>
That statement makes it clear that you don't think of man as an animal.<br>
<br>
We add our own views and moralities to all of this, making it more difficult - but let me ask you this:  in your example above, if that &quot;new race&quot; that did this all to humans was actually our own beloved dogs (say they had a very good step in evolution), knowing what you know about dogs, do you think they would hesitate to do this to us?<br>
<br>
Unless they evolved a sense of morality, I'd wager to say the answer is no.  Biology and our own instincts provide us only with a drive to survive.  Every mammalian species as well as most higher species (insects, etc) has examples of creatures killing their own in order to cull out the weakest in the &quot;race&quot;.  Dogs kill their own.  So do cats.  In fact, just about every furry or fuzzy and cute creature on this planet does it - and those that don't are generally the ones that are hunted by the more aggressive creatures (gazelles may not kill the weakest in their herd, but lions do it for them).<br>
<br>
Among all those creatures, as far as we know, we're the first to develop a sense of something significantly larger than just our instincts.  We try to wrap our puny animal brains with all these &quot;higher functions&quot; like morality and emotion, but all of that means very little in the long run - we're still running on instinct.<br>
<br>
That said, the suffering of humans OR animals for testing is often minimized, but necessary with our current technology (no, those computer models do NOT currently 'get the job done') to advance our science.  Nazi doctors made fantastic advances in medicine, but there sure as hell was a cost.  Animal testing exists today because people couldn't stomach (nor should they have!!!) the testing that was going on on humans.<br>
<br>
Now our society is moving up - we're losing our ability to stomach the animal testing.  This is (in my personal opinion) a good thing - soooo many new protocols and procedures exist today to eliminate as much animal testing as possible, and to do what other animal testing there is 'humanely'.  <br>
<br>
Is it a perfect system?  No.  But we're getting there.  These protesters, however, are doing nobody any favors, and are not making the 'general public' sympathetic to their claims.  The fact that soooo much of what they say is horrible propoganda, often with very little basis in fact, doesn't help either.  That is, after all, what this debate is really about - nobody (outside of Dvinstat) is claiming that medical research in and of itself is a bad thing.  Just the ends to the means.<br>
<br>
By the way, ever wonder how they determine dosages for major drugs like, oh, chemotherapy?  Take 10 human patients with terminal cancer.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Give them increasing doses until you kill them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Measure the results of each dose.  These people volunteer for this in the hopes that others who are less ill can benefit from the results.<br>
<br>
If it wasn't for animal models for this, you'd need 1000 patients instead of 10.  Would you rather see us not have chemotherapy, kill mice, or kill 990 more humans?<br>
<br>
The answer to this question is, of course, going to lay out where everyone's viewpoints really are.  And no, none of this is going to change anyone's mind -- if Dvinstat's mother contracted breast cancer, or if my dog were captured by a lab and tested on, I am sure our views would both change dramatically.  But in the absence of something like that, its a discussion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 560<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/02 10:50:30 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Holy Hand Grenades!</span><hr size=1> If an animal is slaughtered painlessly, then I have no problem with eating steak or using it's pelt.

<br>
Insects have no pain receptors, they do  not feel pain as we understand it. That's a lame argument, but FYI, I don't kill an insect unless it is one that bites/stings (with the exception of flies and misquitos of course). I just throw it outside. Yeah, I am one of those nut jobs that actually catches a moth and then puts it outside rather than bashing it with a fly swatter. Bet you are totally convinced I am weirdo now, huh?<br>
<br>
The only hyprocrocy I see is someone claiming to be an animal lover and then condoning their torture in the hopes it will better their own life. I love ya, but I am going to inject you with massive amounts of toxic chemicals that will induce an excruciatingly painful death because it may make my life a little easier. Sorry, but your suffering means nothing when compared to the needs of the almighty human. <br>

That's a kind of a love I think the animals can do without.<br>

<br>
Humans have the luxury to chose, animals don't. There is your answer.<br>
<br>
I don't understand how people can justify the horror these animals endure by saying it helps humans. Let humans deal with our own problems instead of torturing animals who had nothing to do with it and have no say in it.<br>
<br>
Paint it any way you want, but these animals suffer and they suffer due to our actions. People seem unable or unwilling to put themselves in that animals position and imagine what it's like. They may not be able to speak or write music or design nuclear bombs, but they feel pain and grief and suffering.<br>
<br>
To willingly inflict that on an animal is evil and I don't care how many cures you parade out, the end doesn't justify the means when it involves the kind of torture we are talking about. <p><br>

I happen to have a multi-chromasomal genetic skin disease called psoriasis.<br>
<br>
It is the direct result of my immune system being far too efficient.  My immune system is not only fighting any real threats but also attempting to fight imaginary ones.  As a result I have patches of skin which are growing new layers every 24 hours rather than the standard 28 days.<br>
<br>
One of the most effective treatments I have taken is Methotrexate -- an immune blocker that actually causes my immune system to slow down and not work as efficiently.<br>
<br>
I am having a hard time understanding how consuming more vitamin C could help.   I don't really think beefing up my immune system would really be of much help.  <br>
<br>
Diet and sleep, believe it or not, are not the solution to every problem.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  This is not a Razzine-esque plea for sympathy.  Psoriasis affects 4 percent of the population in every ethnicity.  I can think of countless things that could be much worse in my life and one of the cool side effects is that I very rarely ever get sick.<br>
