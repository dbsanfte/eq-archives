You have your loot types and your friend types. I belonged to a guild, and was the leader of it, that was a friend based guild who wanted to do things together. They had goals and objectives as do any guilds. How ever when it came down to it we always lacked in the actual execution of the goal. It was not a lack of willingness on a lot of peoples part, nor was it a lack of knowledge. This guild knew what it needed to do and how it needed to do it. We had the resources to accomplis most anythign we wanted to do. But no one wanted to listen to anything.<br>
<br>
     I suppose that is a major reason to the downfall of a good group of people and of many a guild leader. It was my demise. I tired of  having people not listen to thier officers. I tired of the day in day out moaning and griping amongst the individual players, and having them come to me instead of the officers to work problems out. I left my guild last night because of internal squabbling. I tired of the constant fight. There was never a power stuggle in the  guild just childesh bickreing and the lack of ablitily to listen to solutions.<br>
<br>
     I personaly am sending a plea to all of you who are just members in your guild to do your officers and your members a huge favor. I will list them out for you one by one.<br>
<br>
1. Use your chain of command( most importaint) guild leaders have officers for a reason. Use them<br>
<br>
2. Listen on raids <br>
<br>
3. attend   guild meetings so you knwo what is going on<br>
<br>
4. Use your message boards.<br>
<br>
5. Work on things to improve your skills. ( go watch a raid that is being executed by a larger more experienced guild)<br>
<br>
6. Be nice to each other ( you never know when that one person in your guild ,you were mean to,  is the  balance to tip the scale in a raid for you)<br>
<br>
7. know your own guild charter.<br>
<br>
I dont know how may guild leaders read this message board. But i can assure you everything i say will help increase your guilds ability 10 fold. I have seen many a guild fall because they do not work together and never listen. I am sad to leave mine for those exact reason. Remnants fair the well and  i hope you and all your continue on even better with out me.<br>
<br>
What do you think is the main reason a guild falls short? i am curious to know your opinion (. thanks for letting me vent here <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nitewhisper2000@thetribunaldotorg>NItewhisper2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/13/02 3:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2257.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> I don't think high end guilds still carry the family theme, or &quot;friends&quot; theme anymore frnd. ;-)<br>

Though I admit, I had more fun and adventure with the lower guilds who could only raid the arena in kael =P  but the high end, you must make changes to yourself, and accept that most hardcore players will not be the &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;family&quot; type, he wants to accomplish stuff that many will not see in year(s). <br>

What makes a good guild, that lasts?<br>
<br>
People running it who (are):<br>
<br>
Fair, so that all members feel they are both contributing and getting something back that is comensurate with their relative contribution;<br>
<br>
Willing to listen to all who try to contribute, even if the ideas are whacky, and encourage input from everyone;<br>
<br>
Use good judgment and good people skills and realize that what they do has to make sense and not just be followed, as there are a lot of smart people playing this game and who won't just 'take orders' as if this is the Army;<br>
<br>
Strong enough and unified enough to do what they think is right and best for the guild, even in the face of some opposition. Of course this presupposes that they ARE right about what's best; and<br>
<br>
Not afraid to admit that they made a mistake, whether large or small.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed playing with some very good guilds, and really only had very positive experiences with all of the guildleaders I was associated with:  Darkhen, Fazzarya, Kylemall, Baraden, Aric and Manglodin.  And call me a &quot;homer,&quot; but the people who run SI embody the principles I listed.  How do you think I came up with them?<br>

I would however, disagree with Raylar's perspective that the onus for arriving at and maintaining those attributes lies on the members at large.  While the membership is of course critical, as the &quot;membership&quot; is basically the guild as a whole, it is the guild's leadership that must make those things happen.  <br>
<br>
  Do not take that to mean that the membership is &quot;less important&quot; to the process, but simply that the leadership is &quot;more important&quot; to the process (ala Brutus &quot;loving Rome more, not loving Caesar less&quot;.)   This simply means that if you want clear organization, fair loot systems, clear objectives for the guild, etc. there must be competent leaders to make it happen.  Granted, any guild with a signifigant number of members who just dont care is going to flop, but take a number of guilds with good members, and the successes and failures will be determined by the leadership.<br>
<br>
  Basically, if a guild fails, I would look to the leadership and expect to find something wrong there.  In the case of a successful guild, particularly those that exist with some measure of harmony within, I would likewise look to the leadership.  People tend to need someone to crystallize around, and if they don't crystallize around someone, then the lack of cohesion will show. <p>  Kazak- 57 Troll Warrior.<br>

  Few things are more enraging to people than to have their identity or their sense of home stripped away.  They will fight for it, kill for it, sing for it, write poetry for it and novelize about it.   Because without a sense of home and belonging, life becomes barren and rootless.  And life as a tumbleweed is no life at all.<br>

as far as what makes a strong guild? you need to have goals, and you need to WANT to achieve them.. that is the founding principle.. respect for the chain of command, and a general sense of comoradery amongst members is good as well.. internal conflicts will ruin your guild in the blink of an eye <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lavondyssautumnwynd>Lavondyss Autumnwynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tribunal Artist</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/13/02 12:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2257.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> The onus is never - at any point - on the membership.<br>
<br>
It is at all times the responsibility of the guild leader, and guild officers, to direct a guild.  If the members don't listen, the solution is not to ask them politely to start paying attention.  They've got to go.<br>
<br>
If you're running a family guild, then you shouldn't worry too much about those who don't listen, because it only means your in-game goals will be limited.  The true focus of the guild will remain.<br>
<br>
What people fail to see is that &quot;uber guilds&quot; have much more of the &quot;family&quot; aspect than actual social guilds.  People in the same guild for three years may be power gamers, yes, but that doesn't preclude them from being extremely cool people.  They work together, and grow together.  This means that if you take the road of a &quot;loot&quot; guild, eventually you'll discover that the people who are in your guild have unified and the loot, hopefully, becomes secondary to the solidity of the guild itself.  The real loot whores pass through, always looking for greener pastures, while the good people stay.<br>
<br>
If you have goals, and you know how to achieve them, then you do it.  If you can't, it's not the fault of the membership... it is yours, either directly or indirectly. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://lavondyss.thetribunal.org/Autumnwynd.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarta>Sarta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I guess I'm as fucking<br>clueless as Darimund!</span><br>  Posts: 470<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/13/02 1:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2257.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What causes the downfall of a guild?</span><hr size=1> Lavondyss,<br>

I can't disagree with you more.  The onus is always on the full membership of the guild.  The greatest leaders in the world won't mean a darn thing if the rest of the guild does not agree with their decisions, nor give them the respect they deserve.<br>

The threat of /guildremove is not what instills respect -- nor the tool that repairs it.<br>

I can't disagree with you more.  The guild leader is responsible for his guild, including the people admitted to it and how they are handled.  I am reminded of a story of Crush, old leader of The Elitists.  They were in Hate I believe, back when Hate was uber.  Two of their members decided to go to Fear with other people though, as that was the plane that held their loot.  Crush left Hate, went straight to Fear to confirm it himself, and deguilded both of them right there.<br>
<br>
That is a leader, one who offers guidance, demands respect and obedience, and at the same time accomplishes goals for the betterment of those he leads.  Those who object or can't get with the program are removed.  If a leader can't control the people that he (whether through his officers or personally)invited into the guild, that is no one's fault but his own.  And no one's shame to bear but his own.<br>
<br>

Had the rest of the guild not agreed with the decision made, they also would have guildremoved themselves and/or began the bickering that breaks guilds apart.<br>
<br>
I am fairly certain that the vast majority of the members agreed with the decision that was made and saluted the leader that was so decisive.<br>
<br>
However, I still maintain that it is the full membership of a guild that makes it great -- not just a guild-leader with an itchy guild-remove finger.<br>
<br>
Cooperation, companionship, shared vision, clear lines of comunication, and the desires of the members to work together are what makes a guild great.  Admittedly good leadership can help instill these qualities, but they cannot enforce them.<br>

<br>
Was a time earlier this year when I was genuinely worried about us.  No raiding, big exodus, lots of tumult.<br>
<br>
The people that remained after all that mess were the people you know you could count on.  That's where it starts, recognizing the people that will always be there for you, no matter what. <br>
<br>
We then unified with a simple goal, to play this game under our conditions, see as much as we could see and do as much as we could, under our conditions.  We are a social guild that raids, that is not an oxymoron, attendance is not mandatory but expected.  It is expected because you joined us to play with us, and we can always have more fun together than apart.<br>
<br>
That took a little while (month or two) to sink in, it was rare that we ever played in the same group together, thus spawns that were rare were never attempted, we just couldn't get people together.<br>
<br>
But faith in what we were prevailed, and a lot of that is due to the leadership of the guild, in our case our former great leader Cburn and our current and terrific guild leader Sonnia.  <br>
<br>
In the past three months we have achieved near 20 epics, killed all kunark dragons, killed Vindi, WToV dragons, cleared the 7th island of Air for mage epics, and the list goes on and on.  Every day is a new accomplishment, a new first, that is the fun of it.<br>
<br>
And when we are done we take time to be with our families, we only do this 2 days a week.  It's content without regimentation, that is what we did.  <br>
<br>
A guild needs to learn to celebrate other's good fortunes as if it were their own, that is so crucial to their health.  And a guild must never tolerate anger, insults and dissention.  It ruins the experience for everyone.<br>
<br>
Lastly there must be consistent standards as far as allocation and what will or won't be tolerated.  Don't ever switch, that's a guild killer.<br>
<br>
Now I log on and play with my friends, it is rare that I am not soley grouped with guildmates, I know them and I like them.<br>
<br>
That, in my mind, is how to keep a guild alive.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=276721"><br>

<br>
The guild is formed by the guild leader.  Officers are picked by the guild leader.  The membership is screened by the guild leader.  The loot is observed by the guild leader.  Etc.  If problems arise, and they grow out of hand, it is the fault of the guild leader.  If the membership was responsible, EQ guilds would be democracies.  In this environment, democracies do not work.<br>
<br>
The point is that the guild leader is, ultimately, and simply, responsible.  For that reason, and not because a guild leader has authority, is the onus on him/her, and not the membership.<br>
<br>
And of course cycling is not a good thing.  One shouldn't strive to actively cycle members.  But eventually, the greedy ones sort themselves out, and what you're left with - if you've done things right - is a strong core of individuals. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://lavondyss.thetribunal.org/Autumnwynd.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lavondyssautumnwynd>Lavondyss Autumnwynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tribunal Artist</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/13/02 7:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2257.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What causes the downfall of a guild?</span><hr size=1> Also... because I can't edit.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

However, I do see the flip side of the coin. People can and do change over time, and some bad apples slipping in can do a lot of damage. I knew good people in CoP before I left that were acting badly because of disinformation that was being spread by some of the bad crowd.<br>
<br>
I can also say that any time that the general population of the guild frustrates the officer core to the point where the entire officer core retires... the fault lies not with the guild leader, but the population.<br>

Their fuckups were not your responsibility or your fault... and if it can happen to one guild, it can happen to more than one guild.<br>

<br>
One of the things I learned was that EQ guilds only succeed if they follow the template set by the game designers. The closer your guild structure is to that of a medieval guild, the more success you will have.<br>
<br>
The leader should be a strong figure with absolute power, and the officers should also have significant power. Everyone else must join on the basis that they will try to do what the leader and officers ask them to do, or expect to be kicked out.<br>
<br>
My real life beliefs are the opposite, but democracy and equality will weaken your EQ guild. The strongest guild on the server is the most ruthless and focused. The guilds below it are varying degrees of the same thing.<br>

It implies that the larger guilds aren't friendly or don't have a family feel to them and while that may be true of some I doubt it's true of all.  I think that the smaller guilds tend to have more of a family feel to them due to size as it's much easier to be closer to everyone when there aren't as many people to develop relationships with.  I prefer the term casual guild as I think it's more descriptive of the playstyle.<br>
<br>
As to the topic, the downfall of a guild is caused by it's leadership or lack thereof.  You cannot blame the membership as it's the leadership that created the membership and set, or failed to set, it's expectations.  If you are attempting to lead a guild that you didn't set up, then you either have to follow through with the members' expectations set by former leadership, or start over and get rid of those whose playstyles and expectations don't match your direction. <p><img src="http://ravlowscorpse.com/kot/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> </p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2257.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2257.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2257.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2257.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2257.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2257.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2257.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2257.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2257.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
