<br>
What really sucks in my opinion is that music is such an insane influence now, actually shaping kids minds.  In my generation(Baby Boomer), the music reflected what we were doing not the other way around, with maybe the exception of Disco.<br>
<br>
Now music IS the lifestyle, not OF it.  It's sick to me that kids are baselinining their whole outlook on life on something as petty as what's playing on the radio or what they see on MTV.  Putting their hopes and aspirations in the control of a coprorate giant because they idolize, (more than any god), a handful of junkies that can play instruments.<br>

<br>
I'm of the baby boomer generation I suppose. I grew up in the 60s. I have knitted, done crochet, macrame, needlepoint, cross stitch, embroidery and quilting. That's what I do now. I make quilts. Quilts for walls, quilts for beds, quilted clothing, etc. And I play Everquest. Quilting is art. Everquest is play. My son plays Everquest and my grandson plays Everquest when I let him.  Haha <br>
<br>
I'm not ready for the rocking chair just yet. Even when I am, I will probably have a computer or whatever new form of them is around then. Most retirement communities nowdays have a computer center and internet access is taken for granted.<br>
<br>
We have definitely changed the face of retirement. People take classes, learn new things and continue to do what they love as long as they can. That's good. Lucky for us, computers don't take a strong body to operate, so no reason to think we would have to give that up unless we want to.<br>

Our parents came from generations which didn't know computers or video games, and any kind of electronic entertainment newer than radio was totally alien to them.  <br>
<br>
Naturally, the majority of these people weren't going to be playing Everquest when they retired, or surfing the internet.  Most of them never even became comfortable with VCRs and touchtone telephones.  <br>
<br>
I remember, at a whopping 7 years of age, watching the moon landing with my parents.  To them, it was the end of an era.  To me, it was the beginning.  The world had passed them by at 28,000 mph or so, and that &quot;Crazy Buck Rogers&quot; stuff was becoming our world.  Most of them resisted the coming changes and watched in shock as their whole world disappeared.  Steam, the energy that had powered the world for the last century, vanished almost overnight.  Everything which was once tedious and time consuming became automated.  Washing machines were greatly improved (remember those old wringers on the back that you had to run the wet clothes through&lt;shudder&gt;?), dryers came along, dishwashers invaded the household, etc.  Suddenly we had something in this country that we'd NEVER had before ... lots of leisure time.  <br>
<br>
I played Pong in a pinball arcade, where you had to put money in the machine ... can you imagine paying to play Pong in black and white?  Space invaders came out and led to the birth of video game Arcades.  Personal computers, from the Commodore Pet with a cassette recorder to load programs, to Trash80s, etc. filled our world with the promise of better video gaming.  <br>
<br>
Then ... the Internet! Email, BBS's, MuDs.  Suddenly, we could spend as much time as we liked in the virtual world, be whoever and whatever we wanted to be.  We dreamed that a game like Everquest might come along, but it didn't look like we would live to see it.  The first attempts at visual MuDs were clumsy things.  You could maybe walk around a courtyard from a single overhead view.  It was Ultima with nothing to do.  <br>
<br>
WE are a new people.  Somewhere, the slide-rule dies and the pocket calculator rules.  Between the first moon landing and the first rap song, we emerged.  I admit, I am far removed from today's generation, but never by so much as the older generations are removed from all of us.  We broke through a barrier of imagination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 646<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 2:57:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1949.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Will you ...</span><hr size=1> Independance. Lack of will. Lack of life. Boredom. And above all--the lack to be able to even to digest food. Food, if you can eat, would be either a dietary supplement like Ensure or the like, cottage cheese (if you can digest dairy) and apple sauce (if the apple sauce doesnt..well, you know). No thanks :p I wouldnt put my parents in one and Id hope my children wouldnt ever do such a thing. In my opinion, a nursing home is the bi-product of sloth. Someone's child(ren) is(are) too lazy to care for their parent(s) like their parent's did when they were young. If the parent needs active medical care--get a rent-a-nurse. I have seen nursing homes. Theyre not glamorous. I have also seen active senior citizens engaged in community activity till the day they pass away. Far more galmorous, albeit, not Hollywood glamour.<br>
<br>
So yes. Id rather be shot than to be put in one of those hell holes. But to answer the question! I dont think knitting or gaming sounds fun at 60+. Perhaps living behind a golf course and shooting yuppies in the ass with a bb gun and blaming it on the grandkids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukerstique.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerstique</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 4:03:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1949.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sunflower.com/~amandab/doll.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Will you ...</span><hr size=1> I will have tons of cats. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uganguskann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ganguskann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/02 5:36:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1949.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Will you ...</span><hr size=1> I'm going to live in a private apartment, smoke pot, play (insert game here)and have a live in midget nurse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  sounds like a dream.

As for Kulvinna's totally accurate decade descriptions... being born in 1985 and all, I would say I'm both a 90s kid and a 2k kid. The funny thing about that being that I do pretty much nothing that you ascribed to kids of the 90s and 2ks. I don't do drugs really, and while I get wasted with some regularity, I'm never stupid enough to drive in that state. If you're going to cover 30 years worth of teens, at least try to get it right. <p>
