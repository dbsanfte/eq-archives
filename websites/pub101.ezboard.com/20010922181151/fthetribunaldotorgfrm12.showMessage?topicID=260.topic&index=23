Powerlevelling is not an act, it's a concept.  It's also a relative concept.  Giving a newbie SLN is powerlevelling them.  So you should fucking buff the people you port as well you greedy bastage.<br>
<br>
I took the opposite extreme to make a point.  Basically some classes come with annoyances.  We've all known that for a long time.  There are extreme examples to everything but I feel that many people have forgotten what the middle ground is like.  I've seen naked porters wait 20-30 minutes for a CR and purposefully ignore a lowbie looking for a bind.  I've seen naked porters refuse to port people because they are &quot;doing CR&quot; and then sit on their ass for 20 mintues waiting for a rez.  I've seen people with epics refuse to zone out to rez someone when it would have cost them 60 seconds that they had available to give but were to bothered to do so.  I've seen porters sit at a ring and ignore tell requests for a port for 10-15 minutes while they wait for their friends to run to the ring.  Those are the people that need fucking wakeup calls.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you play your game for fun and nobody should expect anyone to leave a group that needs them for a port or a rez; however, you ignorant selfish fucks that won't lift a finger to help anyone because you are too &quot;bothered&quot; with the many requests are the ones that bother me.  The annoyances happen because of the class you play, don't let those annoyances affect the way you treat others.<br>

I do it because I LIKE to help others, not because I'm obligated to.<br>
What i would like to see are transport portals, drop your 100 plat into the thing, pick your ring.<br>
Honestly, the majority of the money i've ever made, which is not huge, came from generous strangers when i ported them.<br>
Friends, guildmates and allies i will never take money from.<br>
I've spent a LOT of my time sitting in Gfay, Oasis and the like buffing, healing and sowing for hours, I do it because I like to.<br>
The sad thing is, it's getting harder to find folks who REALLY need them, most are so twinked (not a slam on twinks) they don't really need what I can do that much, I like especially getting the folks that need it most.<br>
Honestly, I don't mind doing ports, you'll find I'm one of the rare +50 druids that is almost never anonymous.<br>
But what I hate is the folks that want to tell me why I should port them anyway even after I've told them I can't right now.<br>
They're the ones who really piss me off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/6/01 8:25:03 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /grumble</span><hr size=1> Fuck it, we're getting horses.

Last night I almost died helping a RL friend of a guild member whom was on the other side of Iceclad. It was snowing and I ran by the tower of frozen shadow and picked up a mittful of those mobs hanging around outside it. A few good stuns and I was suddenly at half my HP. I eventually outran them, but I was <br>

I ressed the person, as well as another nearby victim. The victim insisted on payment. I never accept, but it's always nice to see how much a person thought they should pay. Apparently, this person though that 6gp should more than cover any inconvenience.<br>

The amusement value I got from that offer made it worth my while.<br>

Its like in RL. You need your car towed you call the person who was stupid enough to buy a tow truck. If he is busy then you try another and you pay the price it cost.<br>
<br>
Same way with ports, rezzes, sows..... You find a person who was stupid enough to start a character with the ability. If they are busy you thumb through the the /who all yellow pages and find another. Then you pay the price for the service.<br>
My shaman buffs and sows<br>
My cleric revives<br>
My bard locates corpses.<br>
My druid dies alot.<br>
<br>
There is a service and there is a cost. But just like RL there are times when someone is too busy to get to you so you find someone with time. <p>Krickett Buffslinger<BR>

<br>
i left this board to its own devices for a few days and my post blew up on me<br>
<br>
<br>
wolvar you missed the point<br>
<br>
<br>
i came here to let off a little steam ... because the other night while involved in a CR (and a particularly nasty one at that) some lvl 41 wizard sent me a tell asking for a res<br>
<br>
<br>
i politely told him that i was involved in a CR and wasnt able to go to tim deep to res him<br>
<br>
he then sent me a tell saying &quot;please i lost so much exp&quot;<br>
<br>
again politely i said &quot;sorry friend but i have committed myself with helping these people get their corpse back and im not leaving until thats done perhaps later&quot;<br>
<br>
then i get . &quot; i can come port you DL or to Gfay and we can go there together it will only take a min&quot;<br>
<br>
this is when i started to get alittle perturbed, worse yet he became rude and demanding over the next 4 or 5 tells he sent me... i finally had to add him to my ignore list... bleh<br>
<br>
to use the tow truck example : when your car breaks and you call jimbobs towing ... and jimbob tells you sorry our tow truck is broke now and cant come get you ... to you continue to call jimbob over and over ? no ... you look for another tow truck<br>
<br>
my post isnt to say &quot;dont ask me for a res , im sick of ressing people&quot;<br>
<br>
and frankly im disapointed in you for reading that into it wolvar ... i thought you had your head screwed on alittle tighter than that... and i definately thought you had enough exp with myself to know me better than that ... perhaps not<br>
<br>
my post is about politeness and respect, its about being considerate towards the players that can offer you something you may at some time need<br>
<br>
thats all <br>
<br>
and btw wolvar likening an enchanters clarity to a clerics res or druid/wizard port is kind of weak... hehe... whens the last time you were in hate and someone asked you to come to najena to give them clarity ?<br>

I too am one of the few high levels druids that never go /role.  I very rarely get tells demanding things, but once in a blue moon I do.  I tend to think its because I am female and people tend to be politer to females than males. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I am lucky in that aspect.<br>
<br>
I am a druid, but me being a druid does not make me a port whore.  I have numerous other characters as well that cannot port themselves.  When Silver said that he runs across numerous zones without asking for a port, I found myself reading what is a part of me.  I have no fear.  I have run my chanter through the dreadlands when she was level 16.  I have run my warrior through Kithicor forest when she was level 12.  It just does not occur to me to sit around and wait for a port or a rez if i die.  I do occasionally ask in /ooc but you bet your butt I'm running in the direction of where I need to go.  Its silly.  The few times that I have been granted a port, I am up front and honest.  I also find myself running to wherever that person is to meet them.  I try to make it as convenient for them as I can whether it is meeting them wherever they are or helping them do something as payment.  I firmly believe people waste more time sitting around whining for a port or a rez than if they got off their duff and ran back to their bodies or to their zone of choice.  I hate lazyiness.  Some of you sit there and say that WE, the druids, are lazy?  Well guess what?!! YOU are lazy if you cannot run your butt to wherever you need to go zonewise.  <br>
<br>
I really respect independancy &amp; politeness in a player because those are the kind of people that I associate myself with AND am more likely to help simply because people that help themselves are more likely to help a friend in need if the time ever comes instead of being a leech and a thorn in your side.<br>
<br>
I hate beggers.  I hate whiners.  Its rude and I hate rude people.  Those are the type of people that are blood sucking leeches.<br>
<br>
Everytime I see someone begging for a piece of equipment or money just drives me nuts.  I miss those days of the rare true newbies, although lately I have come across some rare true newbies or at least a polite person.  I found myself helping a little druid halfling that politely asked me if i knew where the druid guild was in RV.  I was more than happy to show him &amp; it felt awesome to have him say &quot;Wow, thanks!!&quot;  I buffed him up a bit and told him to go hunt before they wore off.  That true innocence and thankfulness is what I appreciate the most.  A bit afterwards, I get a tell along the lines of &quot;hey, i'm level 3 now!! thanks a lot for those buffs!&quot;  I loved this little guy.  He had integrity.  He had self-worth.  He was independent.  He got off his duff and went out to level by himself.  I respect that.  He did not beg of ANYTHING.<br>
<br>
The main reason I refuse to port is because I am a guild leader and in constant /tell and in constant conversations with my guildmates.  I zone slow.  I do not like missing important conversation.  What my guildmates and my friends have to say to me is more important to me than taking the time to port someone that can simply walk. *smile*<br>
