<br>
My name is Goldbeard de'Dwarf.  I have been on Tribunal server since a few days after it opened, and I have seen alot of things, alot of selfish actions by people on our server.  This was highlighted tonight by the immaturity and inconsideration displayed by a guild named the Elitists and Vagrants over my guild Sol Invictus.<br>
<br>
Tonight my guild made its first attempt on the Avatar of War.  After a few hours our guild managed to kill the idol, which then spawned the AOW.  It is a scripted sequence where killing one mob spawns another.  People from EV managed to come and witness us killing the idol.  Afterwards, EV's guildleader shouts as we were rebuffing that we had 5 minutes to pull the AOW, or his guild would kill AOW.  In short, this was a threat to kill a mob which we SPAWNED.<br>
<br>
As we were about to pull AOW, EV aggroed the AOW and killed him.  They just happened to have a guild force of 80+ people next to us ready to kill a mob we spent a few hours to spawn.  To top it off they claimed we trained AOW on them.  Of course the GMs dont do anything to resolve the issue (they never do anything.)<br>
<br>
This is not the first time EV has killed a mob we spawned and was about to engage (ie. Rhag 2).  In the past I have been lenient, but EV's action tonight disgusts me.  It hurts me to see the hard work and patience of my guildmates spoiled by idiots.  For what its worth, I'm severing all ties or friendships I have had with anyone in EV.<br>

If it takes 25 minutes for your guild to rebuff I truely feel sorry for you, but we were not going to let the spawn get wasted.  <br>

<br>
EV decided to do AoW tonight, so we headed to Kael where we found out that SI was attmepting Idol. We waited at zone for SI to fail because <br>
<br>
a) we were told to wait at zone so as not to interfere with the raid.<br>
b) we were told that SI had already failed 3 or 4 times on the idol that night.<br>
<br>
As we were waiting at zone, several GMs showed up. We didn't call them, so my only guess is that SI called them. (dunno) Shortly thereafter, our Guildleader told us that SI would be given another shot at Idol, and if they failed we would get a shot. In preperation for a failure that we expected, we gathered our forces and moved towards the arena and made groups.<br>
<br>
SI was setup inside the arena on the right hand side, so we gathered outside the arena on the left hand side. As far as possible from the SI raid so that we would not cause additional lag or interfere, but at the same time we would be in a position to move quickly once they failed and it was our turn.<br>
<br>
Lo and Behold, SI killed the idol. (kudos to you guys) For those that don't know, killing the idol spawns the aow and sets a 30 minute (approximately) timer. If aow isn't engaged in that time frame, he depops. Since SI killed the idol they were supposed to have first shot at the aow and if they failed, EV would get a shot.<br>
<br>
11:18 pm est, Idol is killed and AoW is spawned.<br>
11:26 pm est, EV Guildleader shouts, &quot;AOW INC&quot; - the aow was not inc, he was just messing around, also the aow was not pulled.<br>
11:28 pm est, EV Guildleader tells Rynnia to stop stalling and move it along in shout.<br>
11:29 pm est, EV Guildleader shouts that EV would be pulling aow in 5 minutes. (more than half the time to depop would have passed before we pulled if EV had carried out that threat.)<br>
11:38 pm est, aow materializes out of nowhere on top of the EV raid. A full 20 minutes after spawn with a mere 10 minutes left before depop. Since aow was attacking us, we killed it.<br>
<br>
After the fact, we were told that SI messed up the pull and &quot;trained&quot; aow onto us. I know that if they did indeed train us, it certainly wasn't deliberate, but when you have a mob like that beating on you, you don't stop to ask too many questions. I do know for a fact that EV DID NOT pull the aow and that in discussions with the GMS after the incident, the GM said that the aow was trained onto us and that what we did was perfectly legal.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to try the aow. That's how it goes sometimes. To be perfectly honest, if it took hours to kill the idol, including seveal failed attempts, then it is likely that aow would have wiped the floor with you because he is several orders of magnitude tougher than the idol. Congrats on the idol, it's a step in the right direction and I have no doubt that you will be able to kill the aow in the next few months.<br>
<br>
As for severing your ties with your friends in EV, that's your decision to make, I just hope you base it on what happened and not on what you think happened.<br>

<br>
I logged on, motd saud to get to kael so i got a port. After a few minutes i was there and coh'd up to the raid body. I was busy setting hotkeys and talking to my class captain about the day i had and had no idea we were waiting for another guild to kill-fail aow. I found it odd that we were int he place we were but like i said i was occupied(i'm a hunt and peck typer so i'm sure i just plain missed that fact). <br>
<br>
Well about 1 minute after i got coh'd and my keys set up the AoW stepped on my head and after a quick /petition &quot;I'm being Oppressed&quot; i got ressed, and started looting my shit. At this point i get a 3 line tell from an old friend named Seshet. She basically said i sold out and wanted nothing to do with me and i was on ignore. I was not able to respond right away to find out wtf was going on, i had to loot and get mana to do my job. After it was all said and the AoW was dead i figured it out. <br>
<br>
Needless to say it fucking sucked to get that tell, even though i dont think id talked to sesh in over a year, mabey longer. It was seemingly out of the blue and had me wondering the whole fight. I assumed someone else was playing her and fucking with me. Well as soon as i found out i sent tells to her....no response. I sent a tell to another person in SI asking them to please let sesh know i wanted to talk....no response. So we got our shit and got out. <br>
<br>
What deel said is what happened. You can piss and moan all you want. People thought you trained the AoW on us on accident. Some thought you were trying to let the aow despawn to keep us from killing it. Fact of the matter as i know it, is some faction seeking people accidentally aggro'd trained it on us and all was watched by a invis GM(not guide). <br>
<br>
All shit talking aside, looking at the facts it looks like it was a clean, GM allowed kill. Seeing as how it would have been DIE or Kill, the gm knew we didnt pull it and obviously that SI didnt train it, or something would have happened differently. <br>
<br>
In any event it sucks that Sesh would &quot;sever&quot; any friendship with me over this. And even though i didnt know it was still there, theres nothign i can do to change her mind. GO ahead and think it was a conspiracy or whatever if it makes you feel better. Didnt ruin my day...<br>
<br>
Shit happens, AoW died, try again next week.  <p><center>

A single group fighting their way to the arena did. I don't know everyone who was in that group, but I did see Karry and Truculence cleaning up their corpses afterwards. We were in no way expecting the AoW. Hell, I was semi-afk when he showed up and had to run to my computer when I heard the combat noises. Perhaps if SI had warned the zone when the AoW was spawned it would have prevented them from trying to go to the arena and aggroing him, but maybe not. After all, it should have been obvious from the 180 people in the zone that something was up.<br>
<br>
Second, as Deelron pointed out, the AoW was sitting there for over 25 minutes before he was aggroed. Realize he only stays up for an hour after being spawned, and rebuffing and engaging quickly is vital if you want to have any chance at a second attempt. Many people in EV were speculating that SI was delibarately letting the spawn timer run down to try and ensure that EV could not kill him after they wiped out. And with only 3 level 60 warriors, SI was going to wipe out on their first attempt.<br>
<br>
So to SI, if you were just being slow to set up for the attempt: sorry, but those are the breaks. We did nothing wrong. Get better at rebuffing after Idol is dead. If you're serious about beating the AoW, you need to be getting as much practice as possible, and that means getting 2 attempts per spawn if you can.<br>
<br>
And if you were letting the spawn timer run down: well, that's poetic justice for you.<br>

E/V has had about every uber first kill on our server and had noone interfering with them learning new mobs  why not show the same consideration to others?<br>

I have a hard time believing  transcended trained aow on a fully prepared guild in kael for no other reason than the aow being up that they didnt spawn<br>

<br>
There was a GM, and two guides there, who watched the whole thing, and ya know what they said, that we didnt pull it, that it was trained on us as we waited patiently for you to die, a small group was moving to get faction, I do believe it was some transcended I wouldnt know as I wasnt in the arena but outside of it as no ev went into the arena to insure we wouldnt get an instant SI petition for even being in the area. We get tired of killing the mobs you cant and handing you the loot because you petition.<br>
<br>
So take your tears some place out, talk to the small group that was trying to get faction off your kills who aggroed the aow and sent him speeding to us. AOW was trained on us, we werent even standing at ready, hell half of us were afk talking about how much you guys suck and how you can you couldnt have even done tovn without RNG showing you how.<br>
<br>
Alot of our members died when AOW came charging to us because we werent ready, but because of our ablity to recover we made the best out of it and laid waste to him.<br>
We even dealt with the server hiccup and several SI members running over to hit the AOW for their faction hit. <br>
<br>
Take your story to the people who camp faction in the arena during big kills, they fucked you over, not us, dont expect us not to defend outselves when the AOW comes charging full barrel at us. You should of known this from when you trained the statue on us and we had to kill it and we decided to give you the loot to be nice.<br>
<br>
We expected SI to whine about this, its just sad, you should suck it up as Gms and guides were there because SI has petition hotkeys &quot; EV IN ZONE, HELP &quot;. Your immaturity is showing through as you are looking for someone to blame for your fuck up. So Goldbeard, I appreciate you trying to make up this wild fantasy of how EV swept in and took the aow, but you need to get your facts straight. If it went down like you described there would of been reprecussions. Instead you are trying to say GMs wont do anything and they didnt because nothing we did was wrong in any sense of the word. It was trained on us by a small team of faction hunters whom you should of told to get our of arena but you didnt and they fucked up your pull, causing AOW to come to us and kill our guildmates as we waited for you all to die.<br>
<br>
So once again, take it up with the group who aggroed AOW, that is who you have a beef with. Name me one EV who was in the arena who aggroed the AOW, I dare you. You wont be able to as we were not even allowed on the ramp. We held back and waited for our turn, sounds like maturity to me. Your crying sounds like immaturity and selfishness to me. <p><center><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/RFthunderkickfinal2.gif><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92681>

You all smelled blood and caming a running like a bunch of jackals screaming &quot;Lets see how big an ass we can make of ourself today guys!&quot;Your guild has big enough to kill nearly anything in the game, yet you still have to screw other players anychance you get.  Could have be a first for SI to kill the AOW, but just turned into another mark in the EV KS block.  Keep up the good work guys,  and be sure to pick up every piece of trash in the game so we know where they are.<br>

Let me lend ya a hand:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The following is my opinion and not that of my guilds:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Listen up you fucktards<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> My name is Goldbeard de'Dwarf. I have been on Tribunal server since a few days after it opened, and I have seen alot of things, alot of selfish actions by people on our server. This was highlighted tonight by the immaturity and inconsideration displayed by a guild named the Elitists and Vagrants over my guild Sol Invictus.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
My name is Goldbeard de'Dwarf. That's fuckin Mr. de'Dwarf to you gimp mofo's. I was playin this goddamned piece of shit game when most of you players were still suckin on fudgcicles and whackin off to your dads National Geographics. During that time I have seen some fucked up shit done to my guild by some fucktarded people, but tonight EV took the fuckin award for assinine gimpness.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Tonight my guild made its first attempt on the Avatar of War. After a few hours our guild managed to kill the idol, which then spawned the AOW. It is a scripted sequence where killing one mob spawns another.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This part is fine, though some cuss words would add color.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> People from EV managed to come and witness us killing the idol. Afterwards, EV's guildleader shouts as we were rebuffing that we had 5 minutes to pull the AOW, or his guild would kill AOW. In short, this was a threat to kill a mob which we SPAWNED.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Fucktards from EV managed to come and overlaod the zone causing us to lag like a fat ladies tits. As if that wasn't ass enough, while we were rebuffing, Mojerk opens up his piehole and shouts that we have 5 minutes to pull AoW or he and his guild of lazy ass, spawn jumping, gimpmiesters were gonna take our mob! In short, this homo was gonna take a mob that we spawned!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> As we were about to pull AOW, EV aggroed the AOW and killed him. They just happened to have a guild force of 80+ people next to us ready to kill a mob we spent a few hours to spawn. To top it off they claimed we trained AOW on them. Of course the GMs dont do anything to resolve the issue (they never do anything.)<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As we were about to bum rush AoW and put a hurtin on his ass, EV aggroed and stole our fuckin mob. They just happened to have a zerg force right next to us, ready to take advantage of our spawning the mob (depsite all the fuckin lag and ooc pollution). And if that isn't fucked up enough, the fuckin slack jawed, knock kneed, uber guild ass kissin homo of a GM wouldn't do shit. (Like they ever do - heaven forbid they have to put that slice of pizza down or stop cybering teenage girls long enough to type up a warning).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This is not the first time EV has killed a mob we spawned and was about to engage (ie. Rhag 2). In the past I have been lenient, but EV's action tonight disgusts me. It hurts me to see the hard work and patience of my guildmates spoiled by idiots. For what its worth, I'm severing all ties or friendships I have had with anyone in EV.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This ain't the first time EV has gimped a mob we spawned (anyone remember the Rhag 2 fiasco?). In the past I have let this shit slide cause I figured EV were all a bunch of small pronged mother fuckers that stoile mobs in a video game to boost their ravaged egos. But no more! I've had it with these lame ass, spawn jumpin, shit talking, lag causing, pussy asshole owning mother fuckers.<br>
<br>
Fuck every last one of you EV pee pee puffers right up the ass with a spiked dildo!!!!!!!!!<br>

wrong. if a mob is up, it's whoever is alive to kill it. if they fail and we are there, we sure as hell aren't gonna let it depop, and you'd be a liar if you say you would.<br>

<br>
again, what we've killed in the past and under what conditions have no bearing. But since you bring it up, we kill shit first with less people and with gear that is far worse. We have all the time in the world because we keep banging our heads against the wall until the job is done. Nothing is stopping you from doing the same, except for the fact that we haven't posted an uber strat yet, so you can't download it yet.<br>
<br>

<br>
try reading the thread. trans (if it was them) was trying to get faction and accidentally agroed aow which in turn accidentally trained ev.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
&quot;ohh look the AoW.. hey lets kill that ok guys&quot; noone is afk.. noone is not ready.. ch cycle is already casting and theres a mt order...I am believing it was trained more and more.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
again, try reading. we knew we would have a shot if SI failed, so we set up our main tank list and our cleric chain. Maybe that's why we get server firsts... we're prepared, we don't wait till after the fact to set that shit up. Secondly a lot of people were afk and a lot of people died as a result. We generally have 2-3 deaths on an aow kill these days. This time we had over a dozen. Coincidence? I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Next time mind your own business, especially considering you weren't even there to misinterpret the facts.<br>

<br>
The reason you are being hypocritical has nothing to do with SI having killed Idol to &quot;earn the right&quot; (the discussion over what constitues being &quot;ready&quot; for AoW I will leave for another time - an *unslowed* (ie. for the entire fight) Idol is probably a semi-decent indicator however) to kill AoW - it has everything to do with barging into an *established* rotation on AoW between EV and Comps. Did you ask if you could attempt AoW? If you didn't, how the hell does that make this any different from what Legendary did? How can you expect others to expect you to uphold one rotation when you blithely ignore another one? Are rotations only worth your observing them when you are *in* them?<br>
