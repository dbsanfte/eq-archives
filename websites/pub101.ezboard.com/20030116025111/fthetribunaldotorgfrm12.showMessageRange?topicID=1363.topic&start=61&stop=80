I know all of you that left the guild did help out with others as well.. I just think it was very bad timing.. very bad timing. as far as korlath is concerned.. only reason I mentioned him is because he is the same player as tungus.. at least from what I observe in game. now I hope you can understand that when I came on here. I was very pissed.. yes I know we don't own your account when we get someone their epic.. but I am trying so hard to get this guild up and going to where it can be a major force in the tribunal.. I have had many offers to leave SoD.. but I don't because I love the atmosphere of this guild.. it is very much a family guild. and to see people leave of this magnitude..especially people that I trusted so much leave and slice under that attempt at making SoD better,, it aggravates me. and I'm sorry.. but when I put my original message on here I was aggrivated. now all of you guys I will be happy to talk to in game. you guys were my friends in SoD.. and i respected you guys.. now if we can have a good chat about it. maybe I can see your point of view. but I still don't like ppl underminding what we are trying to do.. especially officers. so anyway.. if any of you guys see me in game.. send me a tell.. I will gladly talk things over with you guys.<br>
<br>
now that being said.. I know I probably could've handled this situation better. but I hope ppl understood my anger.  <p>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;<br>

Really? Coulda fooled me!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Epic completed up to at least the white and red dragonscales</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
is the exact phrase I used on bard recruitment. And any bard who can't solo 90% of the shit to wds/rds I don't want in the guild anyways. I also stated I have multiple pieces for MQ, like phinny spines, etc.<br>
<br>
I don't think we require a single class to have their epic, they're all stated as 'Epics not required but are a plus'.<br>
<br>
In fact, I have no memory of turning down a recruit based on them not having their epic, and I've been in Transcended for over a year.<br>

<br>
It's more like getting up early and taking your wife to the doctors office and staying faithfully in the waiting room until she's done with her long examination. Then, immediately after that you escort her to the mall where she tries on countless outfits for hours, until she finds a few that she likes. Then, you go with her to her mother's house for dinner, and sit thru it patiently waiting for the great sex you might have later that evening. Then you take your bride home, and open a nice bottle of wine, and give her a massage so she's relaxed and ready for your big dick. Then, after all that selfless work you did for your wife, she has the balls to say, &quot;honey, not tonight, I have a headache!&quot; THEN, to top it off, you catch her fucking the mailman the next day.<br>
<br>
That's how I feel right about now, because my members who I did so much for, decided that I was no longer any use to advance them in EQ, so it's time to move on. Yes it happens, I have seen it happen for 3 years now as leader of SoD, and every dam time it hurts. But we bounce back and we still have 150+ members, but these were guys in the limelight, and guys basically in charge of slowing at the big raids, pulling at the big raids, healer of the MT group etc. They were trained by our groups to know how to deal with certain mobs, we learned strategy together, and we grew together as friends, now they are no longer part of the team, and fuck yeah it's aggrivating. <br>
<br>
But ya know, if you are sick of doing epic mobs, let someone know, instead of waiting for your turn to be handed your epic and leaving the next fucking day. I told you my plan at least 100x and we needed a few more cleric epics and we could start doing the post-kunark mobs. We have 1 cleric with an epic atm, and if he can't make the raid for whatever reason, maybe our second cleric could save the day. No, he just left, we will have to go back to Chardok before we can advance now. <br>
<br>
Anyway, that's how close we are to advancing, and you guys just set us back a few days, to a month. No big deal, I have waited 3 years to get this far, what's another month?<br>
<br>
There was a good post about mixing up the raids, which is a good idea in theory, and would probably keep the &quot;epic&quot; members around a little longer, but we have about 52 players in SoD going for their epics, if we did just one per week, it would take another YEAR to complete them. And if you raid more than twice a week, people get burnt out and you lose attendance at the raids, &quot;I need to XP grind today, sorry&quot;, is a common complaint.<br>
<br>
Yes we are still a third tier guild, but when I joined we had 10 members, and now we are doing Kunark dragons and Venril Sathir etc., which means we have grown and accomplished something in the past few years, and that feels good, until 5 of my best guys bail on me. I take it personally, because obviously there was something wrong with the leadership that made them want to bail. <br>
<br>
Yeah, you traitors, I'm still your friend, but it makes me sick to see you in another guild after all the hope we had for you as our team mates. Gotta remember this is just a game, /sigh.<br>

Dating has a purpose.  You get to know someone, so you know if they are right for you.  You are sposed to find out if they are a shithead or not at that time.  Same thing for the recruitment/potential process in a good guild.  You are surveying your potential members.  If they are continually backstabbing you and turning out to be shitheads, you aren't doing a good job recruiting.  The problem lies in your pratices and procedures in aquiring members.  If you let anyone in, or just marry any random girl, you can't bitch about getting fucked over... sorry =)   <p>Love<br>

 Xetus, ty for showing everyone your the only 10 year old girl on the server that plays a male character. This situation reminds me of a girlfriend i once had. Took her out to places all the time. Spent time dealing with her and  endless list of problems with countless out of pocket expense. And never got a piece of ASS. Then when i decide enough is enough, and break up with her, She tells everyone i used her.<br>
<br>
 So i used SOD? For what, a pair of hate legs, and a Note from chardok. Woo hoo, I made out like a bandit. I went to damn near every raid in the past 3 months. Didnt even ask for or roll for 95 percent of the drops availible to me. Used countless peridots, never recieving a single one in return, but never complaining ever about anything. If i might say quiet and calm 95percent of the time in guild chat or on raid. Now Bobmd says&quot; I was the second cleric in the guild&quot;. Well thats news to me , 2 other clerics got their note before me and like chamelius so kindly put it &quot;it wasnt for me in the first place&quot; so in reality i got the note cuzz there wasnt anyone else to give it to, but im the second best cleric in the guild , Nice.<br>
<br>
 You guys are just making up shit as you go. In an attempt to blame, like all americans do, all their problems on others and slander your, well as you now put it but never showed, your 4 best players. Trying to gain pity with the server but more for your guild. Rather than looking in the mirror trying to figure out why{3,4,5,6 or whatever you settle on} of your best players left. I really hope the rest of you aren't as crippled as Bobmd makes you sound. If it really takes a month, with 150plus members , to get a note from chardok ad kill ragefire, its a wonder with that grueling pace,why anyone would want to leave. <br>
 Bob i see where you said the guild was gearing up? Did that consist of all COF's and RBB'S that people won the rolls for on raids and went strait to the Bazaar to sell after the raid, so they could twink a couple more toons. And leave the mains with banded armour and no resist for raids so they could say they didnt have better ? I got a note from chardok and Hate legs , cant sell either so i dont see the greed there. For hours upon hours of hard work on tons of epic encounters to help make others in the guild better, i go to the flameboard , but the People that immediatly after the raid go strait to the bazaar with the COF in hand , note not on back, typing /WTS COF 80k OBO ? Lol, the rest of the sever was wondering who was still farming them. With all the new content.<br>
 Remember who threw the first stone, I kept my mouth shut and just left after i began to realized the ownership you were gonna put on MY epic, that i did all the camps for unguilded , cuzz if you remember right i came to you at lvl 57. My leaving wasnt premeditated though, and it wasnt a conspiracy against guild as bobdm tried to put it in tells. OMG, i didnt shoot Kennedy, put your theories to rest. WTF, for 6months of raiding i got 2 pieces of loot, that i couldnt have gotten on my own. If i was trying to USE the guild, wouldnt i have waited till you killed ragefire for me ??? I left becuase on Friday after Damyan left, i sat for a few hours watching people rip him from one end to the other.{ Shit like OMG he had a COF didnt he, we got him is epic and the peice of shit leaves, Im sick of helping people with thier epics till i get mine, Im never leaving cuzz you got me my pally epic , but ohh btw , i just bought a windblade the day after i got my epic and im gonna have to bank it now.} That nigth i realized that the guild as a whole was more concerned about loot and epics than what the people actually do for the guild. <br>
 Damyan, was the same guy that i didnt even get along with when i joined, did more for that guild than any other single member IMHO. He was the raid leader for all of the chardok raids died in 5 raids maybe 50 times, with nothing to gain from it himself. And you talk about him like that? Whos the piece of shit there? The guy thats burned out from trying to get more than 5 people over lvl 50 to a raid when its a 50plus guild? On any night there is maybe 65, lvl50 plus people online yet you all sit on your hands. And when we do kill something a lvl 48 twink wins the roll, when hell if we are gearing up shouldnt a main get the loot? Your guild has no benifit for any member to ever raid so they dont. Unless their is something in it for them , Mostly not all members. And i used you?? Those people use you, and will continue to use you. Like others have said your guild wont be able to kill anything of significance, becuase your guild isnt set up for that. Your guild is for people that want to twink there toons, and come around only when it has something in it for them.    <br>
 You guys want some sympathy i understand. Playing the Poor Me Card, only makes you look pathetic though. The time you guys all spent posting would have been a couple of trips to chardok , so whatcha waiting for ???<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW, Chameliuos notice this is my first post, so how did i send in my application to Lego? Pony Express? LOL its ok you yourself admitted in tell that it was a friend of a friend that had an uncle that told you they saw it. Nice move, make up shit to seem wise. <br>
 <br>
Does anyone in the guild have an epic that another guild helped them get? When you have double standards you cant see the truth.<br>
