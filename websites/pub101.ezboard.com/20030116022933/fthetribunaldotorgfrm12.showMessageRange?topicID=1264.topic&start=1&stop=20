The times ive seen him in Droga hes been real friendly and nice so i send him a tell asking him what hes up to.. of course hes afk so i wait a while and still no response.. so now i think things are really fishy cause i sent him a tell before he even FD and that was ignored too.. so i ask one of his friends who tell me hes after the angry goblin also.. so i told him it was camped just as it has been for the last 52 hours.. still no answer so then i speak one of their officers about the situation.. Kogarne tells him to respect the camp and that he will not do the turn in but hes just gonna hang out in case i leave so i say fine.. meanwhile i had 2 friends in the zone waiting cause we thought the spawn was gonna be soon but they were on alts getting exp while we while waited for the pop.. well Battlechaser told me hes gonna do the turn in and he doesnt care what anyone else says and that his guild has his blessings to take it from me... i said your officer told me you were just waiting until i left he said they tell you and me different things.. i asked him didnt he care about his guild rep.. he told me he does what he wants.. so just as luck would have it the angry goblin spawns so i ask him if hes gonna ks me or take it even though he was told not to...he says you have 30 sec to do your turn in or im taking it.. i tried to explain to him that my friends were logging to their mains and it would take 1 min for them to get logged in well he says times up turn in or im taking it.. so afraid hes gonna take the spawn ive waited for 52 hours over i do the turn in and try to fight the mob with a druid with 20m and my friends low lvl alt. of course we were spaughtered and battlechaser and his cleric friend stroll right in for the easy kill.. i understand i made a few mistakes here as doing the turnin when i wasnt set.. as well as not immediately asking more guildees for help.. but had we not been so rushed i mean 30 sec isnt enough to buff anything we would have won i managed to get the mob to 60 perc before dying so it was a piece of cake for him to finish. I spoke with synap his guild leader who told me F off and belittled me without listening to anything i had to say.. he was a very rude and quite an a** so I thought id post this.. ive included a bunch of the text log its long so i cutt parts of it out due to the fact i had the auction channel on at the same time feel free to read it.. i just wanted to thank phalanx for wasting 52 hours of my time and the sleep i didnt get over this<br>

I can give you what I know considering I have a few friends from Phalanx(that's how I know anything of this situation).<br>
For one, you had been camping it for 52 hours, according to several of my friends you were afk for 90% of that.  BC knew when Angry was due up, because he had helped kill it for faction last time.<br>
Two, A GM was called(by you I presume, not sure), and you were both told, whoever hands in first gets the mob because VI doesn't support camps.  Eventually Angry spawned, you both stared at it for a few mins(not long, only like a min, which you did say would have been plenty of time to have your friend log on), and BC eventually said &quot;30 secs and I do the turn in.&quot;<br>
According to Verant, BC could have done the turn in and immediatly killed him, but he gave you time(even if it was only one minute) to get ready, in which according to your logs(ya, you ommited stuff, I know), you did nothing.  So then he said 30 secs and I do turn in, for that time you sat there gwaking, going &quot;30 secs? 15 secs? 10 secs?&quot; instead of spending time letting your friends know angry spawned and to get on him main.<br>
Once you die, you have no claim to a camp... So when you were killed, you lost rights to the camp.<br>
If you do know the spawn time on angry, which I'm doubting, you don't have to worry about him for that many days, if you don't know the spawn timer on him, get prepared for another long, boring, camp(who knows, maybe you'll get really really really good at gems!)<br>

Nommen campin the Angry gobbie.<br>
Battlechaser comes in and sits next to nommen and basically starts harrassing him/her.<br>
then takes the mob after &quot;rushing&quot; him/her to do the turnin.<br>
<br>
one of two things happened with phalanx leadership here..<br>
1.) the officers threw Nommen a bunch of bullshit and told BC to take it, or...<br>
2.) Phalanx openly recruits camp stealing ppl like this.<br>

<br>
Nomenn camping angry goblin 52 hours.(street value of crystal meth goes up noticeably from his large purchase of it)<br>
Battlchaser comes in at some point.(probably trying to find the bastard that jacked up the price of crank)<br>
Battle fails a feign near mob spawn.(need to work on that skill there bud.I hear monks use it alot)<br>
BC refeigns successfully near spawn.(good job heres a cookie for you)<br>
Some time passes (BC gets 3 skill raises in FD)GMs called in and pretend to give a flying fuck about anything for 45 seconds.Then leave realizing there will be no academy award in it for them on this performance.<br>
Mob spawns and goes un engaged for over a minute (BC was still trying to max FD i think and Nomenn was cutting up another bump to get himself through 12 more hours of camping )<br>
Nomenn attempts to kill mob , dies.(spills his mirror too which is the real tragedy here)<br>
BC kills mob (celebrates by feigning til he reaches 95 skill)<br>
Nomenn posts here<br>

Nomenn camps a spawn for 51 hours.  Named pops.  Battlechaser threatens to do the hand in if Nomenn doesnt do it immediately.  Nomenn does the hand-in inadequately prepared and dies.  Battlechaser gets the kill.<br>

Morales of the story:  <br>
<br>
<br>
(1)  Battlechaser is a piece of shit.<br>
<br>
