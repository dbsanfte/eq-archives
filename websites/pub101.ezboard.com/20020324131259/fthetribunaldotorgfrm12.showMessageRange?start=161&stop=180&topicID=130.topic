I say she killed them because she is a nutcase.<br>

Other massacres in recent history (school shootings, etc)<br>

The people are disturbed/depressed.<br>
The people are atheist/agnostic.<br>
The people kill lots of innocent bystanders.<br>
<br>
No one goes around posting anti-atheist rhetoric about how the atheists are opressing and killing people.<br>
<br>
Do you see a double standard? I do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Religion is a mental disease.&quot;<br>
In a previous posting of mine, i used the statistic that around 90% of americans are christian.  I think the number jumps to around 95% or so that claim some religion.  So what you are saying, Cogito, is that everyone else is crazy, and you are the only sane one?<br>
<br>
&quot;perhaps try to argue the point, and not the person.&quot;<br>
On the topic of arguing points, you've responded to very few, if any, of mine.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been against free thinking, against open minds, exploration, discovery, and the search for truth...&quot; <br>
Arguably the freest thinking, open minded country, (yes the US) is 90% Christian. <br>
<br>
I will be the first to admit that historicly Christianit, and Religion in general, have been used for personal gain and as the basis for many wars.  But you are basing everything on the past.  What i see in the discussion is not the religious people persecuting the aethists, but the opposite.<br>
<br>
Cogito:<br>
&quot;All your postings have contained so far, are personal attacks: accusations of hate-mongering, narrow-mindedness, cruelty&quot;<br>

Sure, politicians may be clouded by religious thoughts, but the fact is that a paranoid/angry/power-crazed cardinal/insert religious title here/etc don't have virtually any actual authority and if they try to hinder people, can be stopped by law-enforcement.<br>

. . . and countless others. No, I'm not saying your average christian would do anything like this. The reason is, the average christian does not truly believe in their religion. Ie., if the average christian were to share Abraham's experience, they would immediately conclude, &quot;I have obviously gone insane! I am having a vision of God telling me to kill my child!&quot; and refuse to follow God's order. Even if the thought entered their mind, that this vision was reality, and not the result of them being insane, they would never dare, would never stomach to have to do such a deed. The fraction of christians who would follow such an order, is insanely small. That fraction of people, are the only christians that truly believe. The rest merely tags along, half-hearted, without thinking much of it. <br>
<br>
You see, that's the important part: thinking. Most people, who decleare themselves christians, or belonging to some other type of religion, never think about it, never study it. Even mormon missionaries and jehovah's witnesses don't think or study too much. <br>
<br>
George Bush (the senior) once voiced his opinion on atheists... He felt that atheists should not be allowed in the country. I can't quite imagine him getting away with saying that, of any religious group... <br>

<br>
If you rule out God because you don't want to believe in him, and you rule out Evolution because it's absolutely impossible (I'm not going into this, but if you've read some of the better arguments against Evolution, you will likely agree ... if not, just play along ...  )<br>
<br>
the question becomes ... &quot;Just what do you BELIEVE?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sherlock Holmes (yes, a fictional character I know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
once stated, &quot;Rule out the impossible, and whatever remains, no matter how improbable, is the TRUTH.&quot; <br>
<br>
You can rule out the impossible (evolution), and all that we can see remaining is an omnipotent being (however improbable), which must be the truth.  <br>
<br>
One of the most frequently used arguments against Evolution is:<br>
<br>
The Bombardier Beetle: <br>
<br>
        This beetle has an amazing defense system. If attacked, he shoots extremely hot irritating gases out of twin combustion tubes in his tail. Chemicals are squeezed from storage glands, mixed in a holding chamber, then ignited by an enzyme. The resulting gases are 212 degrees F. <br>
<br>
        There is no way this type of beetle evolved because if it did, generation after generation of this beetle would have blown themselves up. <br>
 <br>
There are many arguments against evolution, and the christians make as much fun of evolution as the non-believers make of Christianity.  The very foundation of science is BELIEF.  First you have a Hypothesis, right?  Then, if you can really get your act together, you're allowed to call it a Theory.  For the sake of Science, they also started calling advanced theories Laws.  Most &quot;Laws&quot; of science can be disproved in certain conditions, and the most important laws fall apart at the micro level (leading to the popular Chaos Theory, which just says, &quot;Hey, shit happens.&quot;).  <br>
<br>
Check out this link for a cartoon look at how seriously some people take evolution:<br>

<br>
Before you trying argueing against creationism (God), try looking at how flimsy the pro-evolution arguments are, and how much of evolution's &quot;evidence&quot; has all ready been disproved (though much of it is still being taught). <br>
<br>
Now consider something else ... the creationists and &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot; aren't deathly afraid that Evolution will be proved.  Look at the Vatican agreeing to the dating of the Shroud of Turin (and their calm reaction when it was proved not to be Jesus's shroud).  <br>
<br>
But what about everyone else?  I detect a bit of fear here that God IS real, that Judgment is waiting ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucamthan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>camthan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Cleric of Love</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/2/01 9:32:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=165>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sherlock Holmes Was Right</span><hr size=1> So, if we don't believe in evolution we must believe in your god?<br>

<br>
Darwinism may be out of whack but evolution, just like your god, isn't impossible, but it is improbable. You cannot rule out evolution as impossible. <br>
<br>
Who says we have to believe in anything? I sure as hell don't know what is right, or how anything came to be, and frankly I don't care.

People who believe in god die thinking they know the answers.<br>

I was just reminded of my &quot;religion&quot; when the evolution vs. creationism argument was brought up.  Those are the two explanations of &quot;where we come from&quot;, are they not?  So if we didn't evolve, we were created, yes?  Or rather, if we weren't created, we evolved?<br>

Evolution and creation are not one or the other, you can have both.<br>
<br>
Consider this:  According to Christians God is all powerful and all knowing.  With this in mind, couldn't he have created an earth that was already mature?<br>
<br>
I.E. on the date of creation, all the years of evolution were built in?<br>
<br>
It's like those faux-antiques, the ones were people make a new piece of furniture, then beat it with chains to make it look old (who knows why, seems strange to me, but people really do this stuff).<br>
<br>
If there were concrete proof of the existence of god, it kind of makes faith obsolete.  <br>
<br>
Cogito, your theory about insane christians being the only true ones is rather silly.  A person can have all the faith in the world, and yet never hear voices.  Also, god, according to Christians, has basicly stopped talking to to them.  They aren't really supposed to hear from him again until judgement day.  I also can't think of any new testament story in which God has ever commanded someone to kill someone else.<br>

<br>
Evolution and Creation work perfectly together.  It's actually the missing link in evolution.  How do you think primates evolved into neanderthol man??<br>
<br>
Simple,  when God kicked Adam and Eve out of the Garden, they fucked alla monkeys.<br>
<br>
When I've asked how one couple was able to populate the earth without incestual problems, christians allude to their being &quot;other people&quot; outside the garden of eden.  I'm sure that they refer to them as people to save the reputation of the first couple, but with Dummy's help, I've discovered the truth.<br>

(this is regarding your missionary/jw learning thing)  serving a mission will do one of 2 things to you: 1, it will make you a stronger member, 2: it will drive you right out of the church.<br>
<br>
in my opnion, the healthy members are the ones that dont take everything too seriously. the ones that understand their religion, and dont go for complete minute dleve into every theory mastery. i.e. just about all mormons except for utah valley(provo/orem/BYU) are healthy mormons.<br>
<br>
i will concede though that too many mormons in utah, where i live, stop thinking when church authorities open their mouths. <br>
<br>
brigham young once said(paraphrased, caused i dont have it word for word, just the thought), my biggest fear is that the saints will grow fat successful lazy and will cease to think for themselves.<br>
<br>
now, having said that, i will return to what you said regarding missionaries not knowing their shit....<br>
<br>
in a lot of cases its true. really though, what can you expect a 19-21 year old kid to know? hell, i felt awkward giving baptism interviews to 40 year old reformed prostitutes that had used abortion as birth control. from a life experiences point of view, these kids arent going to know much. from a scripure point of view, they arent going to be very spectacular either. i hadnt read the entire book of mormon cover to cover until just before i went on my mission. i only went to 1 1/2 years of seminary. i hadnt even planned on serving a mission until i hit 18, and started to think about it. when i entered the missionary training center (boot camp for missionaries), i hadnt even heard of d+c chapter 4(the missionary chapter). i never went to the missionary prep classes that all these other guys had gone to. i was the first missionary from my family to go(and as it turns out, the last), so we had no clue what to expect, or to do. all i showed up with was 2 siutcases, a backpack, and a desire to share something i thought was special.<br>
<br>
i wont argue your points cogito, in fact i agree with a lot of them. i hate the holy rollers. the ones that insist you belong to their religion.( sounds ironic having been a missionary, but being a missionary isnt just about baptizing people). i dislike the intolerance that is shown by misunderstanding scripture.<br>
<br>
wolvar, something i wanted to add was adam and eve werent the first two. eve wasnt even the first woman, it was lilith. only she refused to be subordinate to adam.(taken from jewish scripture. i might be wrong, cause i havent read it myself, but i have heard it from several different people). <br>
<br>
in closing, i think i want to say that people that take scripture too literally( i mean ANY scripture), and try to affixe 1 singular meaning to it, are going to go wacko as the contradictions start to pile up,(id love to be a vicar for the church of england for example, or of a small town parish anywhere, darn the vicar of dibley, but i would go nuts with the contradictions i see) and they start to delude themselves to make it all seem right in their head.   <p>Vaseel Doomherald 51 minstrel<br>Wittles Woodfurfun 51 champion<br>

Go look at statistics sometime boy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Bombardier Beetle: <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I've heard this story before, I was at a religious camp and this scientist guy I was discussing with explained it was the reason why he started getting involved in the church community. It blew apart his thoughts on evolution and got him to thinking there really was a god.<br>
<br>
You see, some people like him need reality to be laid out before them. (I.E. beetles don't evolve if they blow themselves up all the time. :-) ) You can do this two ways. 1. Is science, the whole Creationism vs. Evolution thing. 2. Is religion. Protestant, Catholicism, Buddism...whatever is your cup of tea.<br>
<br>
There's a third way out, though. Ignorance. It can be ignorance in the face of pleasure (sex, power, money, greed) or denial (depression, drugs, suicide). If you don't have the power to &quot;choose sides&quot; you can always choose to sit on the sidelines. <br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, both science and religion doesn't like people standing on the sidelines. They want to know who their enemies are. So both science and religion fight over each other for the &quot;sideliners&quot;. The churches usually REALLY DO care about people in the face of suicide, drugs, or whatever. Even if they have an alterior motive, they are attempting to keep you alive even though you are a waste for society. If you're reading this post, I'm assuming you want to stay alive, so you'll understand my point. If you don't, I would suggest to keep reading posts like this, and on several other philosphy boards to make a decision for yourself.<br>
<br>
Myself, I could care less if this beetle would blow itself apart a billion times before it could evolve. Not everything in this world MUST have a logical explanation; religion RELIES UPON things not having logical explanation. No religion has ever found the root of all creation. Sure, god created the world, but who created god? He just 'is'? Well, then what made God immortal in that fashion?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But what about everyone else? I detect a bit of fear here that God IS real, that Judgment is waiting ... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Of course we're afraid! We're afraid of all real truths, for we're used to living in a society filled of lies and uncertainty. While change can be good, it is oftentimes harmful, and many people do not survive the process.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt that any one side (Science, Religion, Ignorance) will EVER be in the right. There are cracks in all beliefs, lies in all beliefs, and assumptions in all beliefs.<br>
<br>
Until then, I will continue to believe in my own sort of worship: Myself. I do what I want to do; be it instinctual (ignorance), intellectual (science), or emotional (religion). My world IS these questions, and the day I stop asking these questions is the day that I die.<br>
<br>
And if my questions are ever answered...then god help my soul. <p>Go and boil your bottoms, son of a silly person!<br><EMBED SRC="http://jasienta.homestead.com/files/boil.wav" align="left" autostart="false" loop="true"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=25986">Jearom Jasienta</a>--<a href="http://www.eq-remnant.com">Remnants of The Tribunal</a><br>
