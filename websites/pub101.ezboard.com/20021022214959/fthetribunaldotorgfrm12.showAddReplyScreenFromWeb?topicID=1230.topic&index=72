After 10 years in the military I can tell you for a fact that the average firefighter finds himself in dangerous situations much more often than the average military member. The percentage of the military that ever 'sees action' is very very low. &quot;Special Ops&quot; is a generalization in itself. The number of 'special ops' personnel that actually go into harms way are a tiny fraction of the tiny fraction of the military that is 'special ops' in general. For the last 25 years our military has been a damn safe place to be. If we go building to building with Iraq that will change.<br>

Your attempts to sound knowledgeable on a lot of subjects are pretty good except for the artificially stilted language you use trying to sound intelligent, but other than that theres no real info behind it. <br>

A hero is not a general descriptor that you can point at someone and say, 'He's a hero!'. The hero is the person that on any normal day of their life finds themselves in a situation that most people would run away/hide from or avoid and they do the hard right over the easier wrong. <br>
     I've found that nothing makes me prouder of my time in the service than to sit down and read the accounts of Medal of Honor winners from the past. In EVERY single one you'll find a person who came across a situation they may not have been completely prepared for but they risked their lives to do things that in most cases I find *godly*. If you want to read about a true hero that will make you think about what you've done in your life, read the story of MSG Roy P. Benavidez in Vietnam. Paraphrasing here... he got in a helicopter twice to go and drag wounded men out of a firefight with NVA, accruing 6 or 7 kills in the process, including one in hand to hand combat, was shot like 4 times, stabbed like 15, and ended up saving over 10 men's lives. <br>
     Mainly my point is this.... any single person in this world could be a hero if the situation presents itself that way and they make that choice. Any person who SAVES LIVES at personal risk to themselves either directly or indirectly, is a hero in my book, from the person who pushes a child out of the way of a speeding car and gets hit to the firefighter who walks into a burning building on a daily basis to pull people out. The person who got hit by that car may never have had the opportunity to do anything great previously, but on that day, at that minute, the situation presented itself and they acted. <br>
<br>
     Don't disrespect the sacrifice people made and will make for this country. They did the right thing and saved lives, and for that alone, they should be honored.<br>

<br>
There were two soldiers.  One had a wife and kids, the other none.  They were both asked to join the rescue attempt, and both were told that it was strictly voluntary, because the situation was way out of hand and Americans were dying trying to rescue the two downed helocopter crews.  The army had already lost enough and were willing to cut their losses at this point.<br>
<br>
The one guy with wife and kids tells the other guy that he just can't go.  That his Wife etc were more important and he really has to think of them first.  The other guy honestly agrees and tells him that it's really ok.  Then gets into the Jeep himself to go.<br>
<br>
Then just before he sets off, he looks in his side view and see's the married soldier, with slow deliberation, getting into the Jeep anyways.<br>
<br>
That, my friends, is a Hero.<br>
<br>
The difference is this.  These soldiers, and the fireman, are highly trained and very gung ho.  It really doesn't hit them that they can die, the feel invincible.  This invulnerable feeling, when lost, scares the living crap out of them.  <br>
<br>
Imagine the incredulous feeling they must get when they start hearing the radio reports of their teammates getting killed.  Impossible!  Right?  Every non-american in that town had an ak47 aimed at them.<br>
<br>
A true hero overcomes this fear and forges ahead.  Not with  numbing mindless reaction and/or just doing what he's been told, but with full contemplation and the knowledge that he could very well be next to die.<br>
<br>
Not sure that the NYC fireman had time to contemplate what they were facing, it all happened so fast.  I'm sure they had no clue the buildings would collapse like they did, and most likely had procedures going through their heads and thoughts of what they needed at the scene etc.  They also, like someone said before here, didn't haved armed and trained people trying to kill them.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The hero is the person that on any normal day of their life finds themselves in a situation that most people would run away/hide from or avoid and they do the hard right over the easier wrong. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No fireman would run away/hide.  It's their job not to, so they aren't 'most people' inheirently.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, they WERE doing their jobs.  It wasn't 'voluntary' in any real sense because it most likely never crossed their mnds that they could sit this one out.  Every available man was going, and every available man went period.  They weren't told that they could back out, only a true coward would and no true coward would join the fire department.<br>
<br>
Going back into a burning building is not above and beyond the call of duty, it is their duty.  Fireman all dream about getting the chance to do this.<br>
<br>
If you have bullet holes in you, then it's your duty to seek out a medic, lie down and get attended to. NOT jump back into a helocopter and go for more.  See the difference?<br>
<br>
I wasn't there, nor am I in a fire department.  I'm positive that there are true heros in alot of Fire/Police departments, (they sure as hell have more than enough chances to prove their metal), and this is in NO WAY a questioning of their charachter.  I'm just showing how the word Hero is defined in my mind, and showing how crucial it is to keep that definition pure.<br>
<br>
Hell, Reginald Denny was called a &quot;Hero&quot; by the press for his role in the LA riots, and the only 'role' he had was getting pulled out of his truck and having his ass kicked.  The media tends to cheapen the word hero because they know people want more hero's and it sells.<br>
<br>
Please don't pass out the label Hero lightly.  Doing so is to disgrace the ones that have earned that label. <p><br><br><br><br><center><img src="http://home.dejazzd.com/tombern/Personal/Jeffs/Enzo2.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhawkfeatherrowe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hawkfeather Rowe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/19/02 9:09:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Iadas_Mistwalker/fullsize/test.jpg width=144 height=144></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ya know, I gotta agree with this</span><hr size=1> If any of you watched the documentary vidoe filmed in the lobby of tower one as the firemen made their plans to go up into a building, knowing their communication systems were not working, and knowing the scope of the people needing rescue...and to see their faces...I think you would have seen that they did indeed know that they knew many of them would most likely die and that this was bigger then things that had faced before.

Nice.<br>
<br>
Maxa - when I said 'baseless generalizations', I was addressing lowlight who called me a drunk or something, I don't remember and not looking back<br>
<br>
Croneus - wasn't one thing I said or did, kinda dismantled everything they had in turn like a lawyer ripping apart the prosecution's case.  That's a very long story (one of my better ones) that I only recount during parties early in the morning and whatnot, but there was like 4 different police boroughs there and the one brought in the crime dog and introduced it to the other guys...then they started hiding the weed they confiscated from us in my car and teaching the other guys how the dog works, then letting him go into the car and start pawing at shit.<br>
<br>
By the way, should watch one of them dogs work once...he could tell where every person who'd hit the bowl was sitting in the car...and he found the shit everytime in seconds flat.  They spray his nose with some kinda chemical to make him more sensitive which I didn't like at all.  And the dog sure hates it.  But anyways, after a couple hours I just kinda got out of it along with one other guy while they arrested four other people.  Overturned the results of the breathylizer by showing it was faulty, stuff like that.  Wasn't one word, phrase, or court case.  Actually was fun now that I think of it.<br>
