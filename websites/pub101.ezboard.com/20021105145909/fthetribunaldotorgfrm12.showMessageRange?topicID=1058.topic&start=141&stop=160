  Ntov is like every other zone in the game, the only thing you have to do to earn the right to fight there, is to pay $12.95 a month. <br>
 <br>
 This entire thread is just an attempt to browbeat Legendary ( and any other guild that may want to try Ntov) into accepting the rules made by a handful of people. Rules btw, that are in place not to prevent chaos, but to prevent competition. <br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> Do people not read the alternative to rotations in NToV? I mean seriously, do Legos really abhore the idea of getting a shot at a full spawn of the NToV mobs? <br>
<br>
Nah, they don't, but they're pissy because the only way they're getting to any NToV mobs is to wait until someone kills Aary, which means they HAVE to support FFA right now. I can garauntee that if they had the ability to regularly take down Aary we wouldn't be having this conversation about FFA vs. rotation, because they could get what they want and get it equally as much as everybody else for the least amount of pain and effort. <br>
<br>
That's what the NToV rotations do, make life easier for guilds in NToV, so you don't sit there for 4 hours clearing to one dragon with shitty drops. Legos know this, everyone knows this, but calling FFA bullshit on this is the easy way to try to gank a dragon here or there for phat lewt. Easier for them to let someone else do the work of taking down Aary than put in the suffering and learning it takes to take him down. Whoever said there's no l33t ub3r battleplan for Aary is pretty much right, you just do him enough to learn wtf to do, but if you don't put in the time, and you don't learn, that doesn't mean those that have are somehow being l33t fuckheads tryin to oppress the 'po fun oriented guilds that realize it's 'just a game'. <br>
<br>
Ever realize that maybe these oppresive stuck-up ub3r guilds are also trying to have fun playing a game, but their idea of having fun playing this game is different than yours? Well goddamn, since they don't want to kill a dragon for you so you can gank the dragons they were working for, they must be seriously deranged and obsessed with holding you down. Give me a fucking break. <br>

EV and Comps sometimes kill in NToV, do the rotation guilds bitch about it?  Nope, because they can handle the zone.<br>

AN used to go in a lot and kill shit, they weren't in the rotation.  No one bitched then either.<br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> Its about some odd stuff called honor, common courtesy and deserving to hunt somewhere (past the gatekeeper, once you killed him).<br>
<br>
Concepts hard to grasp by a lot of people obviously.<br>
<br>
In clear : kill Aaryonar if you want to kill the other stuff in North wing. Otherwise you look like some loser who cannot kill the gatekeeper and wait for someone else to kill him to be able to come in and leech the easy money pot dragons from someone else work.<br>
Want to kill/get a shot at Aaryonar?<br>
Ask the next guild about to kill him, do it a few days before, and you will get your shot. Easy as that. Otherwise you are wasting the time to 40-100 people and its being rude.<br>
Got it yet?<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and Laotzu,<br>
If you would actually read the thread, you would notice that a lot of guild leaders, officiers and other relatively important people of their specific guilds posted here. Yeah, theres a lot of not important peons, but theres also a bunch of leaders who posted here, and guess what? They all agree on a few things : when you kill Aaryonar you earn the right to hunt in North wing, killing dragons in North wing w/o killing Aaryonar at least once to show your skill is being gimp and to try Aaryonar w/o telling the next guild in line for it is being rude.<br>
Wow, eh?<br>

 I think Lejina is correct, if Legendary doesn't start respecting planned rotations, and doesn't start trying to work out arrangements with other guild leaders, they might set a bad precedence. <br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> Let me try to explain this to some people, cuz they clearly don't understand. Assume there was no rotation, nor any guilds but Legendary that hunted in NToV.<br>
<br>
Legendary has tried... 3 times to kill Aaryonar. NP, Trans took twice. Big deal. BUT, If they were the only guild that tried NToV, they still wouldn't be killing Fesh/Dagarn/Koi/Vyemm all that good stuff. Because they haven't killed Aaryonar, and you can't get past him. Its not that Legendary hasn't asked for permission to try Aary. Trans didn't. I don't believe RNG, AN or SI did either their first times (I could be wrong). Its not that they monopolize other guilds time by trying Aary while the guild sits in ZI.<br>
<br>
Lego can always pull AN's route and kill Aary, then go along as a FFA guild, and the rotation would treat it as much the same as they do an 'intrustion' by comps or EV so to speak. Comps went into north 2 weeks ago. No one flamed them here, or anywhere for that matter. Nothing was made out of it. The only result was SI got pushed back a week, and so did Trans.<br>
<br>
Its the fact that Legendary went into NToV with Aary down, and killed the gimp dragons. If there was no rotation to &quot;Boss Lego Around&quot;, or set up all these &quot;crazy rules&quot;, Lego would STILL not be in NToV. Aary = the gate keeper, and hes a lot more harder than most of the shit in ToV-N. shit like koi, cevelak, mire, dagarn you can do with 22 people. I know, cuz half our raid went LD on Mire. 8p<br>
<br>
Its not the rules of the rotation guilds that makes Aary the gatekeeper, its the dynamics of the game and the choice that VI made when they made Aary a helluva lot tougher than the rest of the shit. Its the reason VI changed it so you cant CoH past Aary anymore. And THOSE are the reasons that the Rotation guilds made Aary the defining requirement. Laotzu, yes, most of EQ is just different hps, different ac, different aes, different attacks, etc. But Aary actually requires some tactics (doesn't matter if you read it off safehouse or develop them yourself), you CAN'T brute force the sumbitch.<br>
<br>
Lego is not my favorite guild. It never has been. But they will get aary one day, and they will realize after aary dies, that there is a reason Aary is so much harder, to protect the pussy dragons like  fesh and koi.<br>
<br>
Oh and Est, Thinky is just dealing with some RL problems the past week or so. Everyone goes through them. he still pops in from time to time, and he continues to post to keep us up to date. So plz dont say shit like that about my guildleader, thx~ <p><HR>

<br>
you calling me a loot whore has to be the funniest fucking thing i've seen in a long time.  hi pot, i'm kettle, you're black.  yeah i'm a loot whore because i was the best equipped shaman in SI.  hello dipshit, i was the most active shaman for six months. <br>
<br>
oh look my name is hopkins and i want a high elf mask even though i will never use it.  oh look, my name is hopkins and i want a willsapper even though its a great taunting weapon for warriors, i want to get one so i can proc and get killed all the time.<br>
<br>
hop, you're one of the two biggest reasons i left Sol Invictus and EverQuest.  You're the biggest reason why i won't attempt to rejoin the guild even though a dozen people in SI said I should come back.  go back to giving manglodin handjobs for loot, you're so good at it.   <p><p>

<br>
1) yeah i was a loot whore.  so what?  i fit right in with the rest of the loot whore equip-my-twink-cuz-i-hate-my-main guild SI.  <br>
<br>
2) no i'm not being sarcastic in my original post.  big fucking deal if legendary can't kill aaryonar and join your 1337 circle jerking club.  let them wipe out then raid past them.  if they're skipping aaryonar, skip them. <p><p>
