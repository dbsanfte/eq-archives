&quot;Modern Medicine&quot; may be flawed and it may have its faults, but for most people in most cases it works and works well.  How many people are going to believe what you are saying here and ignore or delay a trip to the doctor to check out that spot, or lump, or uncomfortable ache?  How many people are going to believe your method of &quot;prevention&quot; fully and completely just because you had quotes and numbers and you &quot;won&quot; the flameboard argument with an old sceptic?<br>
<br>
The thing is, your ideas may help some prevent cancer and therefore live; your ideas may convince others to never see a doctor and they will die.  Who the fuck made you God!  How many people are gonna die from your seemingly benign but potentially dangerous regeiment of self treatment?<br>
<br>

However, I shall once again endeavor to show you up for the brainless cretin you are.<br>
<br>
I mean seriously, do you just make this stuff up as you go?  'For most people in most cases it works and works well' ?  Did you not (naturally you didn't) click on that link in the post to sayree that contained that JAMA article, you know the one showing how even with the most expensive health system in the world the US is nearly last in all indicators for health?  The medical industry is the THIRD highest cause of DEATH in the US...does that sound like it works well to you?  Know how many people die of those hardcore Schedule II drugs I'm abusing?  20,000.  Know where that's at on the top 10 list?  It isn't.  By the way, know how many of those deaths were due to marijuana?  0.  As in Zero.  Over 100,000 prescription med deaths, zero marijuana induced deaths.  So you hold tight to your propaganda-fed idealisms there Bakamon...but don't come on here and presume to preach to me.<br>
<br>
But yes, you're right, I'm dangerous.  I specifically told people not to see their doctors if they suspect they have lumps or uncomfortable aches.  I'm sure you can pull the exact quote, right?  Obviously I have a god complex also, and tried to convince people never to see a doctor again...which will cause people to die of my potentially dangerous treatment of oxgyenating the body through better cardiovascular exercise and moderating blood pH by watching the foods they eat and adjusting accordingly.  Yes, I can see how many will fall to that deadly and caustic advice.<br>
<br>
But you're not necessarily arguing my facts as much, because you don't know anything about anything, you're arguing who am I to present them in the face of modern dogma?  Ah, cause I'm a professed drug abuser...cause I smoke weed right?  Yep, that's a Schedule II drug alright...so is ritalin. Do you even know why marijuana is illegal?  I bet you don't -- you can thank a man named William Randolph Hearst and his campaign to make it illegal...because with it hemp would have to also be illegal.  And hemp was a huge threat to the paper and logging industry of which Hearst was a huge owner and benefactor.  In fact hemp has over 50,000 industrial modern uses, and would solve most of our forestry problems, food, steel, oil, you name it.  But this isn't about me smoking weed, this is about me being dangerous and telling people dangerous things.  Oh, what was it I specifically told people to do?  I'll quote it for you...here it is, all the way from page 2, the words of the devil himself:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Best advice I can give anyone is, research it yourself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

didn't have anything substantial that related to ADHD in adults...almost all of everything I have concerns children.  Most of the stuff I have says 'ADD untreated in children will accompany them into adulthood and progress further in symptoms'.  Truth is, ADHD is pretty much fictitious.  I have a shitload of stuff on the 'disease' itself and some interesting facts as well (like I'm sure you've heard of CHADD...but did you know CHADD's silent partner is no other than Novartis, the makers of ritalin?)<br>
<br>
Question I need to ask of you is, what are you on?  Ritalin, adderall, dexadrine (sp?) ?  Whatever you're on, it's a methamphetamine based drug, classed as Schedule II and regulated by the DEA.  You CANNOT stop taking it cold turkey.  Something you can do though to help yourself is adopt a diet change.  Avoid sugars, nutrasweet/aspartame products, trans fatty acids (fried foods, margarine), grains, shellfish, peanuts, pork, ham, tap water milk and soy.  Eat lots of beans, legumes, grass-fed meats, drink copious amounts of spring or filtered water, and eat green green green vegetables.  <br>
<br>
I have stuff on ritalin, stuff on the disease itself, legislation against novartis and the government...give me an email address and tell me exactly what you're on and what you're looking for and I'll send ya what I got and give you links to check out for yourself.<br>

I would have to disagree there. I was diagnosed with AD (no hyper activity component) about 6 years ago. I had the problem where I would be reading a book, but my mind would wander so I would have to go back and reread... sometimes 3 or 4 times. I would drive down the road and miss my turn because I would forget where I was going. My mind went on autopilot qite a bit. I realize all of us have experience like these and that is normal, but I was having them daily.<br>
<br>
I was put on Ritalin and since then I have very little problem reading a whole book through without having to reread one page. I am much more focused now and can train on one task at a time.<br>
<br>
The best way I can describe it is, to see my thoughts as a radio waves. Before I started on Ritalin, t was like I was hearing 3 or 4 stations at once, making it very difficult to ffocus on just one at a time. Ritalin seemed to fine tune my mind so that I can now lock into just one station at a time.<br>
<br>
Now I realize that stimulants give short boosts in attention to anybody, whether they have ADHD or not. But what I experience goes beyond that. Ritalin is a mild stimulant that has been shown to be safe (in the short term anyway, the effects of long term usage is still be studied today) when used <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> correctly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. It can have side effects like any other drug, but I don't consider the dangerous ones that common.<br>
<br>
That being said, I think many doctors misdiagnose normal behaviour as ADHD many times, but for the kids and adults who truly have ADHD, the benefits of Ritalin are enormous. <p><br>

Nervousness and insomnia are the most common reactions but are usually controlled by reducing doasge and omitting the drug in the afternoon or evening.  Other reactions include hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme with histopathological findings of necrotizing vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic purpural); anorexia; nausea; dizziness; palpitations; headache; dyskinesia; drowsiness; blood pressure and pulse changes, both up and down; tachycardia; angina; cardiac arrhythmia; abdominal pain; weight loss; and toxic psychosis have been reported.<br>

Just thought you might be interested in that, not everyone has a PDR.  For the life of me I can't find this one article I know I had...was about a conference that happened when all the big wigs of medicine and psychiatry got together once and for all to classify ADD/ADHD and treatment for it.  After the conference they concurred that 'we don't know anything more than we did, and that's a lot of nothing'.  I'll have to hunt for it tomorrow.<br>

Genetics does impact cancer to a certain degree; for example, the genome of a cell determines that a given cell has a certain size in order to maximize surface area for absorption, while being small enough to make its own operation energy-efficient, and further still being large enough to contain all of its own organelles.  *When it reaches a certain cytoplasm/ genome ratio, the cell has one of its cues that it is ok to divide.  This size is also a part of the &quot;density-dependent inhibition&quot; of the cell, which is comprised of several factors regulating when the cell passes a restriction point, or goes into G_0 phase.*<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the DNA codes for the proteins which help to replicate it.  If you damaged the DNA polymerases, which assist with DNA replication, their conformation would be so distorted that it may not be able to create a complex with nucleotides at all.  In this way, you are absolutely correct Dvin.  <br>
<br>
*Another factor to consider are protein kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases, which are activated by cyclins.  These two molecules form a complex, and one complex in particular, the complex of cyclin/ cyclin-dependent kinase maturation promoting factor, is responsible for many steps of mitosis AND it destroys cyclin.  Thus, this concentration of cyclin helps to regulate the rate at which a cell goes through interphase into mitosis, thus influencing rate of cell division.  The genome directly impacts the creation of these proteins.  Coupling the genome/ cytoplasmic ratio with the MPF, the latter switches the cell into prophase.*  <br>
<br>
So, we have a ratio between the genome/ cytoplasm that determines maximum cell size (ending G_1 and signaling the checks for mitosis), we have the creation of important protein kinases/ cyclins which are at the hands of DNA.  Understanding the cell division process is directly related to the enigma of cancer itself.<br>
<br>
I'd say that if the DNA coding for kinases/ cyclins were damaged to some degree, then you might be fucked as far as cancer is concerned, as these are part of the regulatory process of cell division.  This is just conjecture, however.<br>

<br>
But, my doctor told me if I saw the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> possible</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> side effects for Tylenol, that it would scare me... the point being that every drug and vitamin has side effects. The thing you need to pay attention to is the severity of the side effect and most importantly, the percentage of people who experience those side effects.<br>
<br>
There can be some really nasty side effects to a drug, but if only 2 people out of a group of 1000 experience that side effect, your odds are pretty good that you won't experience it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is you have to weigh risk against benefit, and thus far the benefit of Ritalin far outweighs the risk for me. If no information comes out, that could change however. <p><br>

<br>
Indeed, your posts are informative and well-thought out.  I would like to expound upon my answer to this statement, however.  Damaged proteins (such as enzymes) in themselves more than likely will not be assimilated into DNA in as much as they will cease to function properly.  The factors which denature proteins are severe changes in pH and temperature; this change in the protein results in a change of shape, and this inhibits the protein/ enzyme's ability to conform with a substrate (perhaps a nucleotide).<br>
<br>
So, who knows what happens during replication at this point.  We've got a bunch of nucleotides with no enzymes to join them to.  Perhaps the DNA would be sorted out, perhaps the nucleotides would do some funky bonding to other stuff.  I'm not really certain.  Unless this were to happen on a large scale, I must say that the chances of this faulty DNA getting passed onto the offspring are fairly slim. <p>View <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130889>Tarj's Stuff</a> or view
