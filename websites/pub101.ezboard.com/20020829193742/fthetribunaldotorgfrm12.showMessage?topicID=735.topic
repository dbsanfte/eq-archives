<br>
Tonight around 6pm eastern Ragefire spawned.  Our cleric was in Skyfire as he had been most of this week and told us.  He was the only cleric in the zone.<br>
<br>
We started getting folks there.. being that it was early evening and most of our folks don't come on till after 9, it took us a while.  <br>
<br>
6:30 rolled around and we were the only folks in Skyfire aside from a NGoH group killing things at the BW zone.  One of our druids had Zordak aggro'd and he was kiting him around the northern section of the zone.<br>
<br>
We called in friends from Equilibrium (/hug Celby) and Alliance of Steel.. as well as a couple miscellaneous folks.<br>
<br>
As we gathered.. Legendary folks came through the zone.. and kept going.  We were fucking nervous since we weren't super duper fast that someone would beat us to the punch.<br>
<br>
More time passed... we had Zordak for an ENTIRE HOUR while we gathered our meager little force.  Finally we had 3 groups 52-60 assembled and buffing began as the last of our folks came in.<br>
<br>
Right about the time we started buffing, Vis Veres got wind that he was up.. and they started coming into the zone.  There were 8 or 9 VV the zone when we brought Zordak in for the kill.<br>
<br>
Vis Veres was verbally upset in /ooc that we would take &quot;their&quot; camp cause their cleric was camping it ALL week long.  This is true.. he spent some time with our cleric there.. but more often than not they switched out and did shifts watching the zone.  Our cleric as well as theirs (Behr) had the shimmering pearl, having camped the merchant in SolB already.  Behr was at an auto show when Zordak spawned.<br>
<br>
Anyway.. we pulled the human Zordak... clean pull.. no adds.  We killed him.<br>
<br>
Dragon Zordak spawns and we go to work on him... then a handful of Vis Veres folks arrive.<br>
<br>
Along with the Vis Veres folks were minimum 1 mature wurm, 1 hungry sperm thing, and 1 chromadrac.<br>
<br>
We were trained.<br>
<br>
We were able to get Zordak the dragon down to &quot;Zo&quot; before the adds overwhelmed us and caused a wipeout.  The dragon didn't cause a wipeout.. the adds from the nice train caused a wipeout.<br>
<br>
We start gathering our shit together to get this mostly-dead dragon all the way dead... when we find out that Vis Veres and Revolution were gunning for the dragon.<br>
<br>
Revolution brought in at least two manaburn wizards which made quick work of the crippled beast... and locked the corpse of the dead dragon down until their cleric, Rosario, could come loot it.<br>
<br>
Vis Veres was pissed at Revo for KS'ing them of a dragon that had 3k hit points.<br>
<br>
One of Revo's already-epic'ed clerics stayed to click-rez all of our bodies (Azeca? Thank you for that).. and everyone started to leave.  I petitoned and waited.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Aerendar at length after the ordeal... and, well, in short, we're fucked.  They cannot prove that we engaged first.  They cannot prove that we were trained.  They cannot do anything.<br>
<br>
So.<br>
<br>
1. Congrats Rosario on your ill-gotten epic box.  I've spoken to Xaviera and hold very little animosity towards Revolution over this because if you didn't, Transcended or SI would have.  But know that you hold a box that should rightfully belong to Chabraham.<br>
<br>
2. Vis Veres - because of your children training us, you cost my guild our first cleric epic.  We had this fair and square.. and we would have won with all of 3 or 4 deaths if your children didn't train us.  You are the object of our animosity.  As far as I'm concerned you owe Chabraham a big apology, as well as assistance in getting him a box.<br>
<br>
3. Aerendar... I'm not sure what to say to you.<br>
<br>
So that's it.  Feel free to pick this apart or whatever... the &quot;little guys&quot; got fucked.  This is why I advocate a waiting list for Ragefire.. shit like this is going to happen every single time.<br>
<br>
We have always been a fair guild, and this will not change.  It's sad that others can't respect fairness.<br>

Nothing like watching men and women of the cloth squabble.<br>

Sure you may say tuff shit to the rest of us, what are we supposed to do. I guess with shit like this goin on i wont even bother starting my epic, cause whats the use...<br>

Dont be surprised if one day you ask a level 60 cleric for a rez from his click stick and his response is: &quot;Sorry i dont have my epic ive been KS's several times and i gave up&quot;<br>

<br>
Point being after all my rambling..SI at most had 3 people in zone...we were passing through..so STFU and keep your flames to VV and Revo..as they were the ones who swooped in and trained or killed Rage or whatever.<br>

BTW..thanks Azeca for rezing us..perhaps if the gimp patrol would have killed Rage in the first place..you all wouldn't have had to kill it.<br>

Paying the same 10 buck does not mean you should get it over anyone in an uber guild either.<br>
<br>
Nobody is more entitled to an epic or any item. It is the people that are able to get items easier that will get more of them. And just because you are in a smaller guild or pay just as much as anyone doesn't mean you should have an easier shot at it. <p><BR>

I also had a comment but it's not worth it. You fought in a extremely bad spot. An area that is known for patrolling mobs. Not our fault it's yours. We were not trying to KS we were hoping for you to fail. Of course we were upset since we have been there since Saturday. But again we did not and will not try to KS anyone. If you have anymore questions or concerns please contact me in game.<br>

I hope you do not speak for your guild. Anyone who has ever had dealings with us i think could tell you that we are not KSers and we do not &quot;steal camps&quot;. <br>
<br>
We kept a serious force in sf constatly for about a week and had mostly given up on the spawn as being broken but when he did pop and behr let us know we rushed to the scene. We were told that you had engaged, After your little kiteing, which doesn't count as engaged btw,  and we headed to the ot zone. I still an not sure why you choice such a poor place to pull him.<br>
<br>
Our thought was to assemble and kill him if you failed, We had after all been working on him for just as long if not longer and felt we had as much right as anyone. But when you failed we were to close and got summoned in singly and killed. Revolution did then get the kill. Congrats to them they got it fair and square in my mind. They even resed us, Thank you so much for that and allowed us to have the other loot 2 bps and a helm. <br>
<br>
Some member of VV may have trianed you on accident, I can't prove that one way or the other. I can say that i haven't heard of any VV member doing it and saw nothing on /guild about it. We would never do such a thing on purpose! <br>
<br>
The zone to OT has alot of mobs that path around it not to mention it is a Zone! Ever hear of people training things to a zone in order to escape? Hmm sounds familar to me..<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that some adds cost you the kill, the same thing happened to us in hate with inny last week and we were the only guild in zone lol. It does suck but to blame VV for it is wrong and unfair.  <p><img src="http://www.visveres.com/ezboard/members/azicsig.jpg">

Smaller guilds put a lot of effort into things that the ubers take for granted.  We people in smaller guilds don't expect to ever attain the gear, status, or what ever of the ubers.  What we do expect is to be treated with a little common courtesy.   <p>Level 55 rogue of The Tribunal, and member in good standing of Equilibrium. <br>

Chabraham has been camping Zordak for half past forever just like half the clerics on the Tribunal have.  We get a announcement in /guild that Zordak has popped.  We immediately come to Skyfire.  In the meantime I keep Zordak enganged kiting him around the North Wall.  In the meantime Tuatha with friends assemble to kill Zordak human/Zordak Dragon.  About 15 minutes prior to pull time Behr logs into the zone.  He follows me around a while watching me kite.  No biggie.  A couple minutes later he starts charging at me.  Not saying anything but just getting in my face over and over.  Not sure if he was trying to snap my concentration or whatever.  (Could have possibly been a graphic glitch).  2 minutes before I pull Zordak to the waiting killers Vis Veres has about 5 people near Zordak.  At this point I call the incoming and bring Zordak.  I had been kiting Zordak for almost an hour total and at this time had no adds as there was very few if any mobs where I was kiting him.  When Tuatha and friends began to engage Zordak the Human, the menagerie of mobs came piling in from the VV players directions.<br>
If at any time some other force would have assembled a killing force prior to us then Zordak would have been theres (I agree and understand my kiting him doesn't &quot;claim&quot; the spawn until we have the force) however we were the first assembled group capable of taking Rage.  Once VV piled into the zone immediate /ooc's on their part happened about how Rage was &quot;their Spawn&quot; because Behr is apparently the only cleric that matters on Tribunal.  <br>
It's pretty dickless and juvenile to not accept the fact that for once someone was quicker to assemble and instead do whatever is possible to weasle back into position.  I'm just glad that Vis Veres did not get the container and just reconfirms my suspicion that Vis Veres is french for &quot;We're Assholes&quot; <p>Sanphius Bugeater<BR>

Again not what happened. Do not attempt to drag my guild down to your level. Kiting is not engaged. We did not engage him even though we knew you were kiting which is against VI's rules. You started out in the wrong and still failed. Do not blames us for your failure we did in enhance your failure rate.  <p><img src=http://www.visveres.com/sigs/qaeen3.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=735.topic&start=161&stop=166>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=735.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=735.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=735.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=735.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=735.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=735.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
