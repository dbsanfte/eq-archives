<br>
As for citations,  please look up Georgia statutes 16-6-2, 16-6-18, and 16-6-19.  I'll help out:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>16-6-2<br>
<br>
(a) A person commits the offense of sodomy when he or she performs or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another.<br>
<br>
(b) A person convicted of the offense of sodomy shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 20 years. <br>
<br>
16-6-18<br>
<br>
An unmarried person commits the offense of fornication when he voluntarily has sexual intercourse with another person and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor. <br>
<br>
16-6-19<br>
<br>
A married person commits the offense of adultery when he voluntarily has sexual intercourse with a person other than his spouse and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
20 years for oral sex.  Granted, the others are misdemeanors, but 10 other states have similar laws (actually, one month ago the Georgia supreme court killed all three of the above on the grounds that they violated privacy laws, but they had been on the books since 1855, so for 147 years you could go to jail for having oral sex - and its still on the books in may other states).<br>
<br>
10 states have laws against cohabitation - it's illegal simply for an unwed pair of people of the opposite sex to share an apartment or something.  They don't ever have to even have sex.<br>
<br>
I can dig around to get citations for all 27 states which have statutes similar to this, but my point was made.  The point isn't that I'm worried GWB is going to make it illegal to be anything but a southern baptist or whatever - i'm more worried that policies which infringe upon my civil rights (such as the above example) will be put into law (until eventually challenged and thrown out by the supreme court, who KNOWS how many years later.. 147?) to enforce religious teachings on secular folk.<br>
<br>
And it would only be overturned by the supreme court if the justices who took the challenge weren't also biased toward the law - that's why presidents have a check and balance over the judicial system, by being able to nominate justices.  It means that the president can put in justices who are (theoretically) favorable toward his political agenda.  It can backfire (Clarence Thomas is a good example) but in general, its a powerful tool.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to have flamed on this board - but be careful when you toss around terms like 'ignorant'.  Discussions can quickly become arguments that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeron>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>How many of you can honestly<BR>

Or do you continue to deny the scenario that congress could pass a bill limiting your civil liberties, a president could sign it into law, and a panel of federal judges appointed by (and sympathetic toward) the president wouldn't enforce it?<br>
<br>
Only the Supreme Court is (theoretically) immune from political influence - the ultimate reason for its objectivity - and yet still it has numerous times in history overturned its own decisions as the panel of justices' political views have swayed from generation to generation. <br>
<br>
This is why the ACLU exists - for as much as sometimes they make silly issues of things, occasionally they're critical in getting some of these rediculous laws overturned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeron>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>How many of you can honestly<BR>

Atlanta Journal-Constitution... I believe its their &quot;daily&quot; so this isn't a right/left-wing off the wall website.  <br>
<br>
And while it ISN'T often enforced, the one which IS in the bible belt is the Sodomy law, which is also VERY CLEARLY illegal for nothing more than religious reasons (or, at least, the bible was the source of the law when it was penned/passed however many years ago).<br>
<br>
Look up Powell vs. State of Georgia 1998 for that one.<br>
<br>
I know there are some rediculous things on the books - some of them are hilarious - its only when they ARE enforced that I get concerned.  But the vast majority of those unenforced laws are ~120-200 years old... back on topic for this thread, I'm talking about laws the government of 2003 tries to get passed.  You wouldn't pass a law today just to ignore it... very different from ignoring a law from 8 generations ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/03 7:23:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stuff like this sends shivers down my spine</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What I said was, a president can't decide he will force you to practice his religion.

My point was, and still is, that people of more extreme religious viewpoints will tend to try to push their views onto others - such as the southern baptists boycotting Disney a few years back for being &quot;anti-family&quot; because they refused to fire homosexuals.<br>
<br>
I mean FFS.. Disney.  Anti-family.  It's laughable.  Choose your freakin' enemies better.<br>
<br>
Anyway my point was that Bush is significantly closer in his views to those Southern Baptists than a few of our previous presidents (not sure honestly how far back you'd have to go to find one as tied to his religious convictions).  This is why the press is starting to question all his religious talk - its very extreme.  With a congress able to pass anything he wants, right now, and his attempt to load the courts with judges who see things his way, people are getting worried that we're starting down paving a path for Bush to pull a Southern Baptist Disney on us all and pass his beliefs as law.<br>
<br>
Would it eventually get overturned?  Most likely.  Could it take a generation?  Possibly - the supreme court right now probably wouldn't support something like that, but that's why Bush is trying to load in new justices (and why the Dems are blocking it).<br>
<br>
And it does all come back to abortion - that's the BIG ONE, and we all know it.<br>
<br>
But go back to my first response to you on the top of this page (first line, even, I think) - I never disagreed that a president could EVER make a religion itself into a law.  Just his religious-based beliefs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A> at: 2/19/03 7:25:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 574<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/03 8:42:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=440.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stuff like this sends shivers down my spine</span><hr size=1> Actually you would only have to go back to Carter, and in my opinion he was MORE influenced by his faith than Bush Jr. is. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Tuwene. When was the last time someone was tried for Sodomy. You work at a law firm. I am sure you can give us an answer. Or as I imagine, you are pimpit.com.<br>
<br>
I am sure you can also tell everyone what &quot;blue law&quot; is.<br>
<br>
You are not a bright individual. Because even though you are showing how morality is regulated and has once been regulated, you are not showing how religion is the cause of all this horrible moral regulation.<br>
<br>
I assume that you, like myself, are not religious. And I also agree with you that morality should not be regulated by the government. However, you seem to go ape nuts over a president believing in something that you do not.<br>
<br>
You are intolerant.<br>
<br>
And just like you can point out how religion has been the cause of morality regulation, I can point out how intolerant people like yourself have regulated what people should think and do.<br>
<br>
You make leaps in judgement and logic. You assume that because a president actually believes in a higher being rather than just giving it lip service like others makes him an oppressive bastard who wants to take away your right to fuck sheep. <br>
<br>
And dude, if you want to keep fuckign sheep, do it. Nobody here is judging you for being a sheep fucker. Go ahead and fuck all the sheep you want. It is your right!<br>

The one I know about for sure is a case in maryland.  A man was acquited on rape charges in a trial.  The defense was that it was consensual.  During the trial, the nitty gritty details were described.  Based on this testimony they then charged the man with sodomy, which was illegal in Maryland, consensual or not.<br>
<br>
There also HAD to have been a case for the Geogia Supreme court to rule on.  Don't be to sure about some of these laws NOT being enforced just cause they often aren't  As long as they ARE on the books SOMEONE some time is going to try and use them.<br>
<br>
The main reason they are still on the books in most cases is simple.  Would YOU like to be the legislature who sponsors a bill to repeal these laws?  It would be political suicide in a lot of cases.  It wouldn't be so bad except State Supreme courts have been all over the map in the few cases this has come up.

8&lt;=========================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Cabinet meetings start with prayers while speeches demonstrate the President's faith, but is all this adding to divisions with Europe?<br>
By Rupert Cornwell in Washington<br>
<br>
21 February 2003<br>
<br>
But for Christ, George Bush likes to tell churchy visitors, he might be found today in a bar rather than the Oval Office. As it is, the man who may soon take the world to war over Iraq heads the most overtly religious US administration in memory, where cabinet meetings start with prayers and where no presidential speech is complete without some statement of Christian faith.<br>
<br>
The tale of Bush's transformation is well known, but no less remarkable for that: the feckless near-alcoholic who rediscovered his Christianity after a long conversation with the evangelist Billy Graham in 1986, and went on to become a teetotaller , the Governor of Texas, and finally one of the most relentlessly disciplined presidents in history.<br>
<br>
At one level, Bush's conversion should not surprise. America is far and away the most religious country in the developed world. More than 90 per cent of Americans believe in God, according to recent polls and 80 per cent believe in miracles – indeed four out of 10 say they &quot;personally experienced or witnessed&quot; one.<br>
<br>
Almost half of the population attend church on a weekly basis – a higher proportion than before the Second World War – and 53 per cent say religion is very important in their lives, compared with just 16 per cent in Britain, 14 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany. The reasons are many, stretching back to the pilgrim origins of the country. America is still relatively young and still steeped in idealism. Yes, the US has experienced calamities: 11 September; Pearl Harbor; and a civil war that took 600,000 lives. But it has not suffered the catastrophes that test national faith: mass famine; plague; sustained wartime bombardment; or occupation of its territory by a foreign foe. Indeed, America's very success, its emergence as unchallenged master of the planet, only heightens a sense that the Almighty has singled it out for special favours.<br>
<br>
Every recent president has been a practising Christian. Good East Coast gentleman that he was, the elder Bush was an Episcopalian. Bill Clinton was raised a southern Baptist, though as President he attended his wife's Methodist church in Washington.<br>
<br>
None was more devout than Jimmy Carter. His victorious 1976 campaign had a strong evangelical strain and to this day Carter remains a church deacon and Sunday school teacher – even though he left the southern Baptist denomination three years ago because of its conservative stance. But once in office, he rarely advertised his Christianity.<br>
<br>
Not so Bush and the men around him. In The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W Bush, the former Bush speechwriter David Frum tells of how virtually the first words he heard were: &quot;Missed you at Bible study.&quot; The remark, it should be said, was not addressed to Frum, who is Jewish, but to the chief speechwriter Michael Gerson.<br>
<br>
Gerson, who comes from a modest Midwestern background, is by any standards a marvellous wordsmith, responsible for a host of eloquent setpiece speeches by a notably ineloquent President. He is also a theology graduate, comfortable with religious imagery and allusion – which suits Bush perfectly.<br>
<br>
Tracing the origin of the phrase that stole the show in the 2002 State of the Union, Frum claims he lumped together Iraq, North Korea and Iran in an &quot;axis of hatred&quot;. It was Gerson who altered this to the more biblical &quot;axis of evil&quot;, picking up on the President's description of al-Qa'ida and the 9/11 hijackers as &quot;evildoers&quot; – a word that incidentally appears in Psalm 27, of which Bush is particularly fond.<br>
<br>
These days, as threat and disaster crowd in, Bush's turn of phrase is growing, if anything, more religious. In this year's address to Congress, he spoke of &quot;the loving hand of God behind all of life&quot;. The shuttle disaster drew a quotation from Isaiah. If war does come, Bush's speech to the nation will invoke the protecting hand of God.<br>
<br>
But there are less obvious references, which suggest that Bush has more earthly, political motives for wearing his faith on his sleeve. The State of the Union, for instance, also spoke of the &quot;wonder-working powers&quot; of the &quot;goodness and idealism and faith of the American people&quot;. For the uninitiated, &quot;wonder-working powers&quot; sounds like a speech-writer has gone over the top. But a Christian activist would understand at once the borrowing from the evangelical hymn, &quot;There Is Power in the Blood&quot;, and its resounding refrain, &quot;There is power, power, wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb...&quot; And to appeal to the Christian right, one of Bush's key political constituencies, makes perfect electoral sense.<br>
<br>
Karl Rove, the key adviser plotting Bush's re-election campaign next year, argues that in 2000, four million evangelical Christians, all natural Bush supporters, did not bother to go to the polls. Energising this base and persuading even one million of them to do so could make all the difference for a President who lost the popular vote last time.<br>
<br>
But that's only part of it. Bush's born-again Christianity cannot be questioned. Indeed, it dovetails with his widely attested lack of intellectual curiosity, his seemingly utter certainty of his convictions and with the difficulty of persuading him to change a mind already made up. Few mortals can compete with God for his ear. But the approach carries dangers. At home, many worry that Bush is chipping at the wall – not too strong at the best of times – between Church and State. At the very least it creates unease among Americans who do not share his faith. Abroad, where America's popularity is falling by the day, the risks are greater still. Church leaders in Britain have spoken out against the war, but their views are unlikely to influence policy.<br>
<br>
Mr Bush's Christian fervour only confirms suspicions that the looming war with Iraq is indeed a &quot;crusade&quot; against Muslims, exactly as Osama bin Laden suggests. For world-weary Europe the presidential language evokes mirth and queasiness in equal measure. A European leader who spoke in such terms would be laughed off the stage. An American one who speaks this way only increases the fear that simplicities of faith, and a habit of seeing a hideously complicated world in a black-and-white, good or evil fashion, are a recipe for disaster.<br>
<br>
Chapter and Verse: Bush and the Bible<br>
<br>
&quot;Our prayer tonight is that God will see us through and keep us worthy. Hope still lights our way, and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness will not overcome it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Speech on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks, 11 September 2002<br>
<br>
&quot;We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence. Yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of history. May he guide us now.&quot;<br>
<br>
State of the Union address, 28 January 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;In the words of the prophet Isaiah, 'Lift your eyes and look to the heavens.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Address to the nation after the shuttle 'Columbia' disaster, 1 February 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;It is the greatest gift you can give anybody, to pray on their behalf.&quot;<br>
<br>
At National Prayer Breakfast, 7 February 2003<br>
<br>
&quot;I welcome faith to solve the nation's deepest problems ... We're being challenged. We're meeting those challenges because of our faith ... We carried our grief to the Lord Almighty in prayer.&quot;<br>

I would say, however, that when speaking of terrorism, for example, the language of black and white - good and evil - is perfectly appropriate.  Obviously there are complex issues surrounding terrorism, and I'm sure you are all familiar with my refrain of &quot;It's more complicated than that!&quot; by now, but the fact remains that no matter how one may try to justify events like 9/11 with chest-beating about American foreign policy and flagellation over unfairness, the act of slaughtering 3,000 innocent people remains evil.  I find Bush's attitude in this regard refreshing and encouraging, especially compared to the weaselish semantics of the Clinton era.  I also suspect that part of the problem goes beyond religion... Europeans and American liberals who love to advocate moral equivilancy seemed perfectly comfortable comparing the Land of the Free to the Land of the Gulag during the Cold War, for example... so naturally references to manichean thought are going to upset them.  Doesn't bother me much though.  =) <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

Paraphrasing you : &quot;it's not really that simple, but binary manicheanism is a-ok when applied to terrorism&quot;. What you seem to comfortably forget is that innocence is in the eye of the beholder and one's terrorist is another's patriot. Moral ambivalence is a euphemism for hypocrisy, but what your media bred attention span challenged mind seems to always be failing to integrate is that this pervading religious manicheanism has been the root of all historical tragedies. Guess you'll only learn from your own mistakes, so keep the blinds on and march forth komrade : the Iraqi are in need of real american heroes to liberate them from their evil and show them holy freedom.
