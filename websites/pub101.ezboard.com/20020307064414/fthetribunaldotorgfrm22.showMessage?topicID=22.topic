As my guild is currently lacking in high level chanters I thought I'd post here for some advice.<br><br>What I'm curious about is what gear should I be looking at to increase all the important stats? What are &quot;important&quot; stats, I've managed to get my CHA to 112 and my INT to 184 but saw the message about AC and HP, which has now caused my &quot;dilema&quot;.<br><br>ALSO, are there any places for a chanter to solo at 39+ for good, SAFE xp? I had a look at casters realm, and there was a post suggesting Spectres? Anyone else tried em?<br><br>Any advice would be muchly appreciated.<br><br>Kadija - 52 Elementatlist<br>Kadijaa - 39 Enchanter<br>Officer of Southern Legion <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladylime.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lady Lime </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ladylimelight.homestead.com/files/smallmoviestar.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 1:41:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ladylimelight.homestead.com/files/gotlimefit.jpg width=145 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: N00b Chanter looking for some advice</span><hr size=1> At lvl 39 or so I'd say try to concentrate on keeping your int and cha up, when you get to higher levels is where you just have an int/cha overflow and can *afford to sacrifice all that extra stuff for hp/ac, so don't try to worry to much about that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Where to hunt at lvl 39..?

I enjoyed trying to do stuff solo, and did a few really good things solo -- things that NO other class could have done at my level -- but getting exp bores me, so I never did exp solo, except to just try it out. <br><br>The game -- for good, or for bad -- is based on groups. Me, I think this is good. Playing EQ solo is moronic. EQ solo is a really bad game -- compare it with single-player games, and you'll find this game is very, very poor. What keeps people playing thought, is a real life issue: EQ can become an online version of a rat-race. People kinda admire you, and look up to you, for having obtained a high lvl, or fancy gear -- the same way they do, with people who have power and wealth in real life. <br><br>Uh sorry about the philosophical bits. But I seriously think that this game is ONLY valuable, inasfar as multiplayer, group, or guild-based gaming goes. <br><br>And there is no better class than chanters for groups. <br><br>As far as stats go, I am reluctant to offer advice. I was a dark elf, and had a high INT, and a very low CHA, so nearly ALL my efforts went towards increasing CHA. If you are a gnome, the same would be the case, of course. Now, I'm not even sure if CHA really mattered, as far as mezz goes. Rumors about stats, and what spells and resists they affect, are just all over the place. It is like a social experiment is being played on EQ players: create a game, make some stats and features useless, make some work, and see what people make of them... <br><br>The most important thing you can do, as a chanter, is to work the group. I was a good chanter when I played, I knew the techniques, and kept a cool head, but taking control of a group -- or at least keeping track of things so that you knew what they were up to -- that is essential. <br><br>Chanters are known for being control freaks, but I never ordered anyone around in the game. This is a game, and I played it for fun and relaxation, so I was fairly laid in most situations. But I kinda got bitten in the ass a few times, when the group I was in, would screw up, and I would get nailed, and quit being laid back and passive, and get severely pissed off. <br><br>Oh, and every good enchanter should be willing to take a hit for the team, btw. Just my opinion. But you really gotta be able to do that. Stand up like William Fuckin' Wallace and keep stunning and mezzing, till yer last hp is gone. Chanters are like the Black Knight -- &quot;cmon, I'll bite yer legs orf!&quot;<br><br>A final point: clerics. Be on the lookout for a good cleric. If you find one -- dude, STALK that cleric. OK? A good cleric and a good chanter rules. I've worked with a very few awesome clerics, Boab, Beened, and Thisltebur -- and I've worked with a helluva lot of dreadful ones. A good cleric is the single most valuable aspect of an enchanter, in this game. You can be the best enchanter in the game, have the best gear, doesn't matter a damn, unless you have a good cleric by your side. <br><br>Not only do good clerics know to heal you, they'll buff you like they buff tanks, because they know chanters aren't wizards or mages or necros -- chanters are more rangers than rangers. Chanters are the baddest paper tanks in the business. <br><br>Really good clerics can also help out with stuns. First time, in SolB, I ran into a cleric that lent a hand stunning the Kobolts, I was impressed. Very cool stuff. <br><br>Sad thing about clerics is, you can rise to a very high lvl, as a cleric, and have no damn clue. A cleric can reach high lvl, and just be a simpleton, that tosses heals on players when they drop less than 50&amp; hp. You'll know those moreons when you are at 50% hp, the warrior at 25%, and the cleric heals the warrior... &quot;Tank healers&quot;. Nobrainer job. A great cleric is hard to find. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucyndarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyndarr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://cyndarr.homestead.com/files/kitty.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/01 2:44:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cyndarr.homestead.com/files/kitty.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: N00b Chanter looking for some advice</span><hr size=1> You know a good cleric when they can keep you alive while you tank 3 mobs that added and aggroed you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Tho this is bad for the rest of the group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Cleric_01 tells the group, 'OOM OOM OOM OOM!!!'<br> <p><center><imgsrc=http://cyndarr.homestead.com/files/Angelsig2.jpg></center><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1306><center>Cyndarr Ella<br>Phantasmist of The Tribunal</center></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uutinioftribunal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>UtiniOfTribunal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/9/01 6:16:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cityweb.co.uk/images/animgifs/t-u/tweety.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: N00b Chanter looking for some advice</span><hr size=1> ahahah, Hugz Cyndarr<br><br>I'd say get intelligence up and work on charisma as a secondary.
