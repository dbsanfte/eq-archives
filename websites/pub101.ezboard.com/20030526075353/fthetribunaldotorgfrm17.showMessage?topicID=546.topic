Many of you are quick to place blame, and hatred; to a force you aren't even aware of.  Do you all forget this is a game, and that games were designed to be competitive?  Naggy and Vox are childs play, the real EQ world doesn't have lists...  noone waits around so you can kill a mob just because you said you wanted to.  I dare say that atleast 90% of you don't even know why there was ever a list for these dragons, mainly because you weren't around that long ago.  Before any expansions, there weren't any other high end mobs to kill...  and even into kunark and velious, Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox were still highly saught after.  This list was created to solve the massive chaos, an attempt to bring peace between the people.  Even today some high end zones have guild rotations, so that order can be had.  Put yourself in this position... your in a guild that raids naggy and vox; and it has to compete with 10 other guilds who also, want to raid these same two dragons.  Imagine having guilds hop in front of you, or attempt to train whipe you so they could go in for the kill.  Thats the sort of chaos that brought upon these lists.  On my original server, even after guilds had moved on to bigger things...  the public still went after these two dragons religiously.  My first character, a paladin, was 13th on the list to getting his book off vox.  With that kind of competition for one thing...  some kind of order is needed.  <br>
But...  look at now.  How often is Naggy or Vox even attempted?  How many people actually care? and how many of those people that do care, decide to do anything about it?  You're probably wondering what i'm getting at by now...  but I felt it was necessary to give you all a short background before I said some things.<br>
The answer to who has been killing these dragons lately, and not telling anyone; lies before you.  It is me, and the guild that I have created.  I am very aware that some of you will dislike me and my guild, but I feel it is time I went public.  Every leadership position in existance brings hatred by some group of people, whether small or large.  There's no way around that.<br>
I have seen a few accusations that what I have done is out of greed...  little do you know.  I designed this long ago, and have put forth great effort in the creation of it.  It was an opportunity lying there, and I took it.  My intent is no less than to help other people.  I am a Rogue, already with my epic; and to speak bluntly, equipped quite well.  I am not your average ignorant loot whore, that cares nothing about anyone but himself.  I am here to make friends, to teach them what I know, and to help them advance their characters and playing abilities.  Another of my goals is to help people obtain their epics, as I have mine on this character; as well as my paladin long ago.<br>
So now you've heard my forestated intents and desires, whether or not you believe them is your decision.  I'll tell you some facts, and let you decide for yourself.  The name of this guild; before now, kept to secrecy...  is &quot;Fellowship of Vindication.&quot;  At best, we have killed Lord Nagafen with 9 people, and Lady Vox with 11.  I'm sure many of you are sitting and thinking right now...  that this guy is full of shit, that you have seen raids of 30+ people get their ass handed to them.  Again, what you believe is up to you...  but, I have allowed a number of outsiders to participate in our raids; and even helped some obtain epic pieces doing it.  Some may even run across this post...  they know who they are.  If they wish to speak up and validate what I say, that is up to them.<br>
The big question now is, why the hell did I bother saying all this? Alot of you could care less...  alot of you probably hate me.  Here's why:  I'm opening up my guild to anyone who meets the criteria, and that I see as a benefit to its existance.  I don't know how else to say it...  I want to help people! For me, that is fun.  But...  In order to filter out people that I do not want... first on the list being loot whores.... admission will not be easy.  nor is it for any decent guild out there.  <br>
<br>
1) You have to be level 52, and be willing to stay level 52 for a decent amount of time atleast.  If you want help, you've gotta be willing to give it.<br>
2) The resist factor...  the BIGGEST reason public raids fail miserably.  I have pushed the following UNBUFFED minimum, and by minimum I do mean no less: 100+ magic, 150+ fire, and 150+ cold.<br>
3) Attitude.....  I don't care how uber you are or how smart you think you are....  Working together is a must, respecting authority and your fellow players is the only way to fly...  I've had to filter out a lot of people because of this sole reason... <br>
<br>
Those three are the most important, and probably 98% of what I expect.<br>
<br>
Now....  For those of you that ARE interesting in such a thing, you have one of two options.  <br>
1) Going on public raids; with loot whores, idiots, morons, and whatever else you can possibly think of that will cause the raid to go bad or disputations on loot to occur....  which sadly enough usually ends in failure, and a lot of upset people.<br>
2) Me.  Get to know me, raid with me, see if I'm all that I've said I am.  See for yourself, if i'm capable of what is aforementioned.  What have you got to lose?  <br>
<br>
Well....

Other guilds, like mine, require more people and that requires scheduling.<br>
<br>
I went to help my friend Grazk and the AoN get ready for Naggy last night, but as our clearing team was getting closer, they discovered that Naggy wasn't up.<br>
<br>
I applaud you for your precsion and dedication to take down these dragons with such few numbers.  Not all of us can and require more planning to plan around RL things so that our guild members can come.  The schedule is still useful to us for these reasons and is courteous to other guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jerrek>Jerrek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dragon Lord &<br>Uber Smith of the Tribunal</span><br>  Posts: 392<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/03 8:51:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the hell is this? -Opportunity</span><hr size=1> Now everyone that benefits (and has benefitted) from this schedule over the past 3 years has a name that they can voice their.. opinions to about childishly jumping ahead of everyone simply because they can.<br>
<br>
I find it highly amusing that you sit here and hide behind how ethical and helpful you're being by &quot;helping others&quot; attain their goals.  You, the champion of all Norrath, decide who is &quot;worthy&quot; to accompany you on your little childish raids.  Everyone else, whether they are level 51 or whether they don't have the ability to buy/attain gear that will push their resists to extreme levels, can just fuck off and die in your eyes.<br>
<br>
Congratulations on defeating Nagafen with 9 people.  Do it without level 60+ buffs.  Do it without 51ac breastplates.  This is what most guilds that this schedule benefits do.<br>
<br>
The schedule is here to allow smaller guilds the chance to PLAN ahead of time, get their ducks in a row, and go after what for many of them is STILL their first &quot;real&quot; raid experience.. and have a damn good time doing it.  Your little band jumps ahead of them and kills the dragon.  Aren't you uber... who are you helping?  Your friends?<br>
<br>
And you have the audacity to come here and ask people to be your friend.. so that maybe one day they will have the glorious honor of being able to go on one of your elite raids.<br>
<br>
I've used the word childish more than once in this post.. I'll use it again.  An adult would realize there was an honored schedule in place on the server.  An adult would have read the rules and saw that while the dragons were FFA, kill them all you want but LET US KNOW about it.  An adult would have stepped up and asked questions about the schedule, why it was here, whether people still planned to use it, etc, before going off on a renegade crusade to prove how uberleet you and your &quot;friends&quot; are.  You might be an adult in chronological age, but your actions and your post here indicate you are a child in maturity.<br>
<br>
Eventually you will get tired and try to move on to other things.. and all of your &quot;friends&quot; will be left by the wayside.  Nobody has the power to stop you since schedules are not sanctioned by Verant, so enjoy your little swath of destruction.<br>
<br>
People DO have the power to judge you, however.  Maybe some unethical people will train your elitist band of mercenaries or cause you undo levels of grief.. maybe a sympathetic band of enchanters will enter Nagafen's Lair the night of a patch and keep the last 6 fire giants charmed.. so that when your little band comes through and engage the dragon, they break charm and you have 6 giants to deal with.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is that you're scum.  You don't want to follow the rules that everyone else follows, and you have the gall to come here and try and paint yourself as doing something honorable.<br>
<br>

You and you're &quot;friends&quot; have cheated them out of a great opportunity.  <br>
Think back to the very first time you got to raid on of these dragons.  I certainly will not forget mine.  I was shaking I was so nervous.  There were 30 other people there just as scared as I was.  In all the kills I've been involved with in this game, seeing Vox's corpse lying in front of me is still one of the best.  <br>
Vox/Naggy is probably the first raid most people go on.  It teaches people how to prepare for bigger raids.  You killed Naggy with 9 people...well..Gratz I guess.  Would it have killed you to come to this board and say &quot;Hey, we killed Naggy today.&quot;  I don't see how that would have hurt you.  <br>

 if you dont know me im one of the &quot;elite jerks&quot; who has been saving and dealing for all the resist gear i can carry so i can kill naggy and vox for our alliance or even our guild in house to help others with epics(  remember its not just paly books its bard and warrior scales and some good loot that EVERY guild needs) i wasnt a guild leader so i never looked at this board to see whos doing what or when or that it was posted after killing naggy or vox , but what paly in his right mind doesnt jump at a chance to kill a dragon ?<br>

pyros not a bad guy and i like most of the people in his guild if these mistakes in comunications can be worked out then everone gets what they want.<br>

Our main tank still wears crustacean legs.  Your comments are nothing but ignorance and jealousy, greed is all you show.  All of us old skool people have been on 30+ people naggy/vox raids that failed, what the hell has that got to do with now?  that many people shouldn't fail with the equipment available for such cheap prices.  A full set of BD resist gear back then was like 30k? SSoY was the thing to have, also 30k?  Not a single public raid has killed vox since last october, and on naggy before us... december.  The list is for you greedy people that don't have the balls to put effort into competing against a mob like every other EQ player out there.  I don't give a damn if you don't have the time, thats your own problem.  If you don't have the time, then you shouldn't even be bothering with dragons.  Nor should you ever go any farther in the game, if you expect people to just leave a mob up for you.  <br>
If anyone is scum, its you people who lead these public raids and fail.  You waste all these other peoples time; and this piss on me because I can kill them.  <br>
Lets look at a couple quotes from Jerrek himself - <br>
<br>
&quot;Pickup raids fail. That is the rule rather than the exception&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been toying around with the idea of leading a public raid on them, but the headaches come shortly after I think about the morons that would show up and not follow directions.&quot;<br>

And another thing I remembered I wanted to answer - I remained anonymous because I wanted to see how well we did before I said anything publicly.  Here I am now, and if you so wish for me to post when I kill the dragons - I dont mind.  But with the kind of attitude you have jerrek, to just piss on me like that - when you yourself have said some of the very same things about the public...  Thats just not cool.<br>
90% of the people in my guild didn't know a thing about naggy or vox, I coached them from the beginning.  None of them are veterans, none of them are uber.  I killed these dragons with so few people, just to say I'd done it.  The same kinda adrenaline rush people used to get fighting him with 5 full groups.  I still get a rush when going in.  But to go in with 9 people?  We tried 6 people once, and failed, but got naggy to 20%.  Why do people break records in the real world?  because its fun.  Simple fact my friend.  Nothing to do with the lack of maturity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dellita>Dellita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/03 12:40:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the hell is this? -Opportunity</span><hr size=1> Well, I can already tell this subjest may cause controversy among some of us.  I am Dellita, the current monk in the Fellowship of Vindication.  I quit everquest about half a year ago, I used to be Denday Proudfoot a 60 druid, the reason I quit was because I mainly missed the old school everquest.  My best everquest friend, Pyroticator, whome I've know for most of my eq life, told me what he was planning to do, make a lvl 52 guild dedicated to epics and successfully raiding naggy/vox.  This is the reason I came back. My individual theory is that we group for aa exp at 52, we will meet nice people, and assholes.  The nice people we will get to know better and ask them to come along on raids, they obviously deserve their epics, we think it is much more beneficial to them if they go with us knowing their epic peice is going to them, not some jerk who came along and didn't do crap.  We work as a complex team doing this with so few people, everyone does their part, unlike public raids where they shout wave one go go go! and they all die, we usually have 1 to 2 deaths in the worst case scenario.  The other thing is, we arent restricting people from their epics, you don't need to join us, simply gain our respect and trust and we shall help you.  I laugh at all those public raids I went to, watching the scales and books go to people whome I knew were completely useless during that raid and who are assholes to everyone, but they win simply because they got a lucky roll.  Our guild WILL help those who deserve it, we arent doing this to horde money, we're here to help, so please, understand us, respect us, and we will help you in the best way possible.<br>

Most of the guilds that are going after Naggy and Vox at this point, I dare say, aren't competitive guilds.  We take things at a slower pace, have fun and enjoy the trip, not just the destination.  If we wanted to be very competitive, we wouldn't be back at level 52.  I enjoy the thrill of killing Naggy with 9 and Vox with 11, it's quite an accomplishment, however, you come across like you and your guild is going to continue to farm them.  Why?

<br>
My name is Reptylle.  I'm a lvl 48 monk, no guild alliance, highest char is a 52 warrior, NOT Uber, NOT Rich, and most of all, willing to go out of my way to help ANYONE asking.  If any of you have EVER met Lazarux, or Oohmpa, or Reptylle, or Kedin, or Mylluv, you will know exactly how I play the game.  I have raided with Pyro, hell, I was with him when we took out Vox before the last patch, and when we took down Nagafen the night before last.  I raided and this &quot;Lewt Whore&quot; as you call him, GAVE me the Vox WR Bag....   Why? Don't ask me...I wasn't the main puller, or even a Main Tank, I was just some guy that asked if he could go and I got lucky.  So far, every time I've seen an Epic peice drop, it has gone to the person who's epic it was for, if no one needed, Pyro sells for a decent price on the open market, the GIVES the money back to his guildmates...splitting it evenly throughout.  Now I dont know about you, but I've seen more than one guildleader that would have sold it and kept a Very Large portion of that profit as &quot;Guild Treasury Account&quot;.  You know, that account that Never gets used from, and no one can access except certain officers/GL, and oh, once it gets just so big, Never seems to grow anymore even tho a select few members of the guild just keep bein able to afford Upgrades?  <br>
<br>
Well, I'm here to say, Pyro ain't like that.  He gives to his Guild...not Vice Versa.  You can flame me all day today, tomorrow, hell, NEXT YEAR, but I'll still respect Him until he proves to me otherwise.  He has helped friends with Epics and Every raid I've been on, at Least 1 other person was NOT in his guild, yet his Non Guildies seem to get more of the &quot;Phat Lewt&quot; that his guild is supposedly Pharming than his Guildmates themselves.  BTW....&quot;Pharming&quot;---Using a High End Char to kill and loot items easily (without risk of death or loss) to gain a profit.  Umm......if Pyro is Pharming this stuff, why hasn't he made a profit?  And....we took Nagafen WITHOUT lvl 60 buffs, other than c3, and how many of YOUR Guildmates go ANYWHERE without donating for c3 first? HUH?   Sorry to tell you all this, but Pyro thought this through very well, he planned and he used Tactics.....Not Uber Gear and Buffs....to Kill these dragons.  My personal Stats on these raids...I met his resist stats....101 MR....164 CR.....180 FR...as an Iksar Monk lvl 48.  My AC?....oh, somewherea round 900, not uber by any means, not planar, not even as good as Thurg Quest armor.  I have NO uber gear...only thing close is my RoLC, and I did THAT quest MYSELF.  I survived.  Why, if I Can do it, never having more than a couple of k in the bank at once, i think my highest EVER was like 18k, cannot anyone else?<br>
<br>
All Pyro was stating in this post is:  we have proven ourselves, if you are interested, give me a tell and you can join us as well.  And you have the AUDACITY to Flame him for offering OPEN INVITATIONS to his guild.  Have YOU ever got on a messageboard, SERVERWIDE, and offered any such thing?  Especially one so EASY to attain?  Most guilds now, you have to have like 15 sponsers and take a vote, on top of a minimum lvl requirement, resist requirements, raid attendance requirement, AA requirement, ETC ETC....  Pryo simply asked what ANY Decent guild Does....and if you don't like his Rules or his Requirements....DON&quot;T JOIN THE DAMN GUILD.  Just STFU and Go your own way.  No One, and I do mean NO ONE Has been killing Vox lately.  I've been on raids RECENTLY that failed with 5+ groups, ALL of which had Great Gear, but they lacked discipline and tactics. <br>
 If you guys can't do it, and Pyro can, why be mad at him? I don't see Flame after Flame on E/V for takin down some high end tough as shit, kick Everyone's ass, AE for like 3k and hit for 2k MOTHERFUCKER....yet you flame Pyro for doin the same thing, with a lvl restricted mob.  And you wanna talk about Childish.  He only said that to get in, you meet his requirements and you are a nice person.  He don't like ass holes in his guild, WHO DOES?  Oh yeah...I forgot....Other Ass Holes do.  (DUH) <br>
<br>
So....if I'm LUCKY, maybe I'll get into this guild and be part of a great group of really friendly and easygoin people, and I'll continue to raid with them, help others out on equip and epic drops, and maybe, just Maybe, pick up something here or there for myself.  If not, well, I'll still raid with Pyro and the guys, and I'll still help out on other peoples Epics and such, and I'll still enjoy thier company and respect him for his decisions, but i'm NOT gonna get all pissy cause he is doin what No One else is doing, and cause I don't get to roll on the Uber Haste Mega Super Item even tho I wasn't a key figure in the raid.  I'm glad Pyro is doin this the way he is, shows alot of respect to the people that really WORK for what they get.  (BTW)  Check the &quot;Uber&quot; guilds you are always bitchin about, obviously they are doin something you guys can't and are willin to put for the effort to do what you guys won't.  THEY reward certain players with rare drops when they DO drop.  Its out of respect for the work and effort Individuals have put forth for the benefit of the Whole Guild they are in.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cp worth.<br>
<br>
If you want to Flame me....go ahead, I know who I am, and I know where I stand.  Flames are for children with nothing better to do.  Go play DAoC or something and leave us alone.<br>

The time I grouped with him, I didn't have any problems with him.  Reptylle helped us on one of our Naggy attempts...and the insuing CR.  Having Fathersword and Reptylle speak up for him, speaks highly for him in my view.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with what he wants to do as far as killing the dragons when they're FFA or for signing up for a spot in the rotation to get a regular shot at them.  However, if he intends to kill the dragons if they're up, no matter if someone is in the rotation, then I cast my lot against him.  I would meet the requirements for your guild, but I am very happy in the guild I am in now.  We are on the verge of being able to kill Naggy and I'd like to see that through.  I want to kill him with my guildmates and friends...I'm not saying he and I couldn't get along and be friends, just that we haven't yet.  Also, given his prowess at killing the dragons, I'm afraid accompanying him on a Naggy raid would be just that, me along for the ride, and I feel killing him with my guildmates would be more personally fulfilling to me.<br>
<br>
Announcing that the dragon has been slain, can be done to help others schedule without bragging.  However, to disregard the system that the rest of the Tribunal accepts and to kill the dragons as you will because you can, is self-centered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=reptylle>Reptylle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/03 4:40:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .......</span><hr size=1> Greetingsss once again....<br>

<br>
I agree, killin with a guild that hasn't yet reached that pinacle of the game is VERY gratifying.<br>
<br>
I Disagree that you would &quot;just be along for the ride&quot;.  NO ONE is just along for the ride.  That is how we kill him with so few, we just take what we need and a couple of support to make sure they survive, but trust me, Everyone is an Intricate Part to the Machine that we are when raiding.  If you do not pull your wieght, you only attend one raid, if you finish that ONE raid.  As Pyro stated, he set rules and guidelines for people lookin to join, but he takes non guildies as well, if no one in the guild needs something that &quot;Might&quot; drop, you could probably ask him, and he would gladly let you attend, and if no one else contested it, loot whatever peice you needed.  He is a really cool guy, if a bit brash at times.<br>

<br>
I think those of us who have dealt with Prachlyn before know what the real issue is here. And that is that Prachlyn's control has been usurped and now he is pissed. Prachlyn doesn't give a damn about anyone that is not willing to do exactly as he demands. So someone that comes along and doesn't ask permission to what I'm sure he has come to think of as &quot;his dragons&quot; is a special thorn in his paw.<br>
<br>
For a couple of months now, these dragons have been FFA. Which, if I remember right, means Free For All. Now, all of a sudden, when someone dares to start conducting Vox / Naggy raids that aren't by Prachlyn's book, we have a renewed interest in scheduling? Come on! There's two guilds in line for Naggy and ONE guild in line for Vox. And they have 3 and 5 days to kill each? If Pyroticator and his band can get these dragons dead the night they pop so that they'll be that much quicker on the re-pop, I say more power to the guy! The Tribunal is too old to do these dragons well anymore and yet, here's a guy who has made it a special priority to get these dragons dead when the rest of the server can't. I certainly hope he keeps these particular characters at level 52 forever and keeps farming dragon loot for the server. I plan to level up to 52 and obtain the required resists as quickly as possible so that I can participate in what seems to be the most efficient dragon-killing machine The Tribunal currently has. Vox and Naggy raids are fun and its fun to see how small a force you can do them with.<br>
<br>
Prachlyn is &quot;Your company's computer guy&quot; from Saturday Night Live. The guy who, in real life, is pissed on by the world and made fun of. So, in EverQuest, he gets to be the dictator and rule the world through things like Vox and Naggy scheduling, and if people dare to do things not in his way, then he flames them. Much unlike real-life, where everyone laughs behind his back at his antics. It is ridiculous for a guy who is calling Pyroticator immature to use the phrases:<br>
<br>
&quot;My personal opinion is that you're scum&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been toying around with the idea of leading a public raid on them, but the headaches come shortly after I think about the morons that would show up and not follow directions.&quot;<br>
<br>
And this one, in ever-classic condescending, sarcastic and &quot;how much better I am than the rest of the world&quot; Prachlyn style:<br>

Last Killed: Wednesday, Jan 22nd by Some Irresponsible Guild<br>
<br>
I've been on a Prachlyn-led raid before. He quickly loses patience with the crowd and starts yelling at them in a condescending and belittling manner. He doesn't keep his cool and keep repeating instructions and helping those who are slower than him. He yells at them and the entire crowd and generally is just a big dick. I remember thinking the whole time: &quot;What a pompous asshole!&quot; For christ's sakes, look at the title he calls himself by: &quot;The Elf King&quot;. How much more better-than-thou could he possibly imagine himself?!? Absolutely people are going to behave &quot;as morons&quot; as he would put it. But here's a guy named Pyroticator who clearly posts the requirements to attend his raid, grabs people who listen, learn and meet the requirements to make a quick, clean dragon kill, and are interested in killing these dragons efficiently. He helps them obtain epic and dragon-loot items with very small forces and passes the extra items on to the server at the prices that the market will bear. What more could you ask for?<br>
<br>
So keep kicking dragon ass, Pyroticator! The more CoFs, RBBs, Weight Reduction Bags, Red and White Scales, Mystical Eyepatches, etc. that we have on the server the better. Its irked me that these sources of those items have gone without being killed again and again and again, thus losing out on the total overall number of these items on the server.<br>
<br>
And finally, from Prachlyn's public pick-up raid post:<br>

Just because some people on the server are way past them, don't assume everyone is... There are guilds that are working thier way up to them, and just because you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> kill them doesn't mean that you need to monopolize them.

I'll agree with Prach; someone who decides that he's going to monopolize a spawn like that and isn't willing to share (which is what he came across as in that 1st post) is scum.<br>

I've dealt with Prachlyn before... he can be a bit of a dick, but so can anyone who strives to run an efficient raid.  People screw up and they can get thier feelings hurt when corrected.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naeamian>Naeamian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 741<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/03 11:06:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the hell is this? -Opportunity</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your resident Dragon Lord?!?

<br>
jealousy? last i checked, to quote your own post, &quot;How often is Naggy or Vox even attempted? How many people actually care?&quot;, nobody *cared* about vox and naggy.. why then, would you expect people to be JEALOUS of your antics? grats on killing naggy with 9, i've seen it done with 6<br>
<br>
why is prachlyn pissed? because some little little tool has decided that he and the guild he leads are &quot;too good&quot; for the rotation that has been in place for over 2 years now.. you mention &quot;even now there are high end zones where guilds rotate&quot; .. to the guilds in this rotation, this is a &quot;high end zone&quot; .. the rotation is here to ensure that everyone who *wants* a legitimate shot at attempting what is largely considered *the* entery level raid encounter.<br>
<br>
as for this, <br>

<br>
Ok, where do I start on this. Simple things first...Spelling  &quot;togeter&quot; is Together...hehe<br>
Ok, now to the actual points of this post:<br>
<br>
1.  No, we dont' have &quot;a bunch of 52 characters&quot;....we have approx 2 groups of people.  14.  In my book, &quot;a bunch of 52 characters&quot; would be something ilke a 5 group raid.  We have already stated what we had when we took Vox and Naggy down: 11 and 9 respectively.<br>
<br>
2. &quot;forced them to remain at lvl 52&quot;  Ummm.....No.  If anyone wishes to lvl up, it is thier right and priviledge to do so, we do not &quot;Force&quot; anyone to do anything.  You want to raid, you HAVE to be 52 or below, or you get booted out of these particular fights.<br>
<br>
3. 'and have claimed &quot;Control&quot; over the old world dragons....well, no one else was killin them, No One, not in 4 months for one, and over a month on the other, technically, they were FFA when we took them each down.  Look it up, Jerrek pointed it out himself in another thread *to tired to look up link atm*  We simply did what no one else Can do or Will do atm.  We were organized, planned things out, and went in for a kill that wasn't contested in any way, no one can &quot;Camp&quot; anything technically, and in this case, No One was even Trying to.  We are not saying that we are taking &quot;Control&quot; of these dragons, we are simply stating that we CAN kill them, and WILL kill them, on a regular basis, and if people want to be part of this group, you must show US the dedication to get done what needs to be done and not just coast along with 40 other people to &quot;Zerg&quot; the mob at the end and pray someone lives to rezz all the dead people.<br>
<br>
4.  Finally....&quot;i wish you and your guild the best of luck, but i don't see you going far...&quot;  I have a question for ya....were you in RNG when they FIRST started?  How long did it take THEM to do Vox/Naggy on a regular basis, and how much discipline does your guild have NOW on raids?  Can you see the difference there?  Well....our guild has that discipline NOW, experience and unexperianced players alike, we don't screw around and train our own raid and say &quot;Oops, Darn&quot; over /ooc or /raid channels, we take hits to make sure the Rest of the team survives.  This unit of people is extremely self sacrificing and un selfish when it comes to getting the job done for the whole.  Who said we wanted to be another RNG or Sol Invictus or Legendary?  We want to be US, that is it...no more, no less.  We simply want you to know us, and respect us for what we Can accomplish, for no one else is doin it atm, or has been able to do it for some time now.  If we had announced these kills 3 months ago, 2 weeks after the last Vox kill....and you had thown your &quot;fits&quot;....we would have all gone for those same 3 months without a single killl.  Even tho you say these guilds are &quot;just getting there&quot;, alot of these guilds have &quot;Been there&quot; for over a year, or have been &quot;Almost there&quot; for a year or more.  It's time to step up, i fyou can't do it, WE WILL.  Do not doubt us or nay say us, for we can and will do what we have stated.  Not KS the mobs, hell, we'll wait for the guild that is up to try, if they get Vox/Naggy to drop, WOOHOO, if not, we move in and that's that, it will be over and another dragon will need a grave.<br>

I think if this kid had come in here without the shit in his voice, his message might have been more well received. If you post with a cocky attitude, inviting flames - then you best be prepared for the fire. /shrug<br>
<br>
I have no opinion in regards to the topic - but I think if the subject had been approached differently, this would have been a more productive discussion instead of a bitch fest. <br>
