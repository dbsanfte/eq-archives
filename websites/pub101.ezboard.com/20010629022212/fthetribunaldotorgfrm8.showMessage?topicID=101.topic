These guys are simply reverse engineering Everquest, like people have reverse engineered the BIOS to create IBM-Compatible PCs all these years; like reverse engineering chips to create Intel compatible CPUs, and like Osborne (as if anyone remembers that stuff) reverse engineered famous software to create that Paperback software that did the same shiet for a fraction of the cost... <br>
<br>
And so, them big companies never managed to shut down those reverse engineering bad boys, because what they did wasn't illegal at all -- they simply designed a better mouse trap, to be honest. Free competition. <br>
<br>
Well, Verant don't like that, of course. <br>
<br>
Imagine how cool it'd be, if you could run a server on your own machine? <br>
<br>
Well, with Eternalquest, you CAN. <br>
<br>
Most of the people I know in real life, have never seen any of the big mobs, like Nagafen, or Cazic-Thule, other than screenshots. Fire up Eternalquest (there are three pieces of software: the login server, the world server, and the zone server), type #spawn 96 1 (that's mob number, weapon number -- you have to give it a weapon for some reason) and lo and behold, there's Cazic-Thule with a rusty sword. He's only normal human size though. I'm not sure why. <br>
<br>
Eternalquest doesn't have everything implemented, though. No combat, and you can't zone. SoV isn't implemented yet, and you have to guess a little bit, to find the correct spawn point, when you launch into a zone. I kept showing up in a &quot;prison cell&quot; style box, with a picture of someone's cat on the wall, when I tried to take a look at VP. <br>
<br>
Oh and another thing, you can walk, or run. The tutorial program, that some of you may have used to look at other zones, will only let you walk, plus of course, you are a human, so damn near blind. Eternalquest lets you summon items, so you can see better. And of course, you can be any race you want, so you get ultravision -- and also, you may be any MOB you want, too. Turn into Cazik-Thule, for instance... <br>
<br>
Or Nagafen, Vox, Innoruuk, The Tribunal, Bristlebane, Rallos Zek, Tunare, etc. It's really pretty neat. Inny looks like a deranged hillbilly when he runs, he's hillarious. Bristlebane is just a big hafling with a stoned expression. The Tribunal is a barbarian with a cool black hood, and shiny, scary red eyes. Rallos is a weirdo, and does this &quot;punch-the-air&quot; type move, like &quot;fuckin' A!&quot; thing... Tunare has by far the most dignified, graceful moves when she &quot;walks&quot; -- in fact she doesn't walk at all, she GLIDES! <br>
<br>
&quot;Things to do in Denver when dead&quot;: Garcia's character tries to chat up some chick, with that line, &quot;You don't walk. You glide. That's a very attractive characteristic&quot;.. <br>
<br>
Tunare does that, it's really quite odd. Kinda looks like a very well balanced, but very ridgid surfer, gliding on air. Very neat. <br>
<br>
Well now, thing is, wouldn't it be cool, to be able to run a full EQ server at home? I don't mean a full fleged 2700 population thing. I mean something more like a Quake server. <br>
<br>
And you could create your own GM events. And make people PAY to participate in them. <br>
<br>
The neat thing about this, is the ECONOMY. Ebay is regarded as a bad thing, and of course, I agree, it has some very bad aspects. But the idea of doing stuff in cyberspace, and earning real world cash for it, is really quite cool. <br>
<br>
However, with the current ebay situation, what you end up with, is a) Farmers take stuff that would otherwise go to &quot;normal&quot; players; b) The &quot;work&quot; performed in cyberspace is 99% no-brain bs that only requires you to have no life. <br>
<br>
Because cyber-world work, with real life payoff, could be pretty exiting, if it is implemented properly. You always hear people saying &quot;I don't want to be harrassed by a freaking 12 year old, I'm 40 years old, and want to play this game for fun and relaxation, and I feel bad when I have patchwork armor, and some fucking pimplefaced 12 old is running around in uber plane armor!! WHAT ABOUT THE CASUAL GAMER?!&quot; <br>
<br>
Well here is your answer: You are 40 years old with a good job, pull down a good salary, damnit dude, you can afford to buy the uber stuff you want. That 12 year old (or whtaever) can sit on his ass for 3 weeks farming stuff, and you can get it off of him, for the price of a night out, no problemo! <br>
<br>
Except hay, that 12 year old is screwing up other gamers. And the job he does, isn't really creative, it is freaking manual labor, burger flipping type work. It has no benefits, no reward other than money. That is no way to go into a bright cyber future! <br>
<br>
Here's the real answer: <br>
<br>
Let people run their own server, create their own GM events, their own competitions, and have the participants pay to be part of it. <br>
<br>
Lets say Verant gave a server to a handful of people, and said, go fer it!? Lets say a handful of creative minds got together and created a wild event, dynamic interaction -- it could be ANYTHING. Lets say Verant created a world-design application like what we usually get for the FPS games, and let us design our own dungeons and creatures? <br>
<br>
Dude, that'd rock. <br>
<br>
And even if that might not be a huge success commercially, imagine the possibilities of cyber sex. People spend a LOT of money on 900 numbers. And a helluva lot more than that, on porn. <br>
<br>
Did you ever see the website for &quot;Faydwar Frolickers&quot; ? Peaches and what, Aprikott or something, two halfelf and woodelf females who basically cybered people, on an appointment basis? I don't think that was pay-per view. But I'm fairly sure was (is?) real. <br>
<br>
Anyone ever read the book Snowcrash? <br>

To simplify it all, i remember when that emu first came out, you would spawn in HS and people were running around everywhere with all sorts of nice stuff, since you could spawn whatever you wanted.  I agree with Cog, it would be so fun to do whatever you wanted with eq, and play with just your friends.  It would add life to a game that most people have left because they would have so much more freedom to do stuff.  I personally have never seen farther then the zoneline in seb, no vp, have killed naggy and vox, but thats probably all i will ever achieve.  I would like the chance to see new zones with my friends at our leisure, and not have to worry about being betten to a zone or fcfs.  I would love the chance to do this, and have more freedom in eq.  I know thats not how this game was made to be, but after 2 years it would be a nice change of pace and a different way to see things in the game.  Would be sweet to run my own gm events too, i hope they do finish it and it works.  I really, honestly do. <p>Cornisolis Lioneater, 48th  Warrior

First: forget the plot, let's go to the concepts.<br>

<br>
Everyday Joe Coder (aka. Hiro Protagonist) is just your average big-blue-esque programmer who delivers pizza for a living.  He dicks around at work getting his job done, but in his free time, he lives jacked-in to this alternate world where he's a god.  He's the best of the best in the game, and people come to respect and pay him in real life for services rendered in the game...but not too much...after all, he's just some geek who can code.<br>

very cool upbeat version of the older, serious, and more brain-frying Neuromancer...<br>

ps.  &quot;they'll listen to reason&quot; &lt;/injoke&gt;<br>
<br>
pps.  Remember the &quot;dentata&quot;?  That shit really freaked me out.  The concept of a tampon-like device that's modified to hold a spring-loaded hypodermic needle with a strong sedative as a modern-day chastity belt...man that gives me the willies.../shiver <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/22/01 11:16:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://voy.net/~rexart/catwinkR.gif width=42 hieght=33></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Just as long as you don't try to give HER the willy. <p><center>
