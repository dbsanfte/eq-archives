I play Sadad, 45th Erudite paladin of Prexus on the Tribunal. Yes, I know you could easily figure that out by clicking on my name.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against E/V. I was not flaming E/V or any of the players in that guild. <br>
<br>
I play Eq to have fun. In order for me to have fun I converse with friends and go on adventures.  I'm sure that sounds stupid, and makes me look like a newbie. Camping all sorts of high level mobs and spending hours upon hours killing the same monsters is just a bore to me. This is why I have all sorts of alts and my main is still level 45. But that's just my way of playing Eq. If you like being in an uber guild, good for you! If it's fun for you, then that's your deal. To me, Eq is just about having fun in my own way.<br>
<br>
And yes people can be &quot;of use&quot; if they go ld. They could be your friend, even if they go ld all the time. You might die because they go ld, but you had a good time being with that person. This doesn't apply to a high-end encounter of course, but neither do I.  <br>
<br>
And actually I was mad because someone had taken away my allowance during naptime in kindergarten. You found me out, I'm a product of incest, I'm a hermaphrodyte, I'm really stupid, I'm probably gay, I'm not in a high level guild, and I'm just some anon 8 year old jackass posting here to waste your precious time.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uflasshgordon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FlasshGordon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F is for Friendship.</span><br>  Posts: 662<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/16/02 8:38:59 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.greendaymusic.com/discography/records/inter/images/intRec.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV = Fuckwads</span><hr size=1> how do you know it's a bore to you if you've never done it?<br>

<br>
I have spent hours upon hours killing the same monsters. It was boring.<br>
I haven't camped all sorts of high level mobs, it's true. Toughest thing I've ever killed would probably be Nagafen. It's true, flame away at that one. While killing him was fun, crawling in sola for the first time was much more enjoyable. <br>
<br>
I suppose I should have rephrased that.<br>
So I will:<br>
Camping mobs is not as exciting to me as getting a pick up group in Guk or wandering around, not caring much for personal wealth, having fun with friends, and helping out people. I would rather wander around a low level dungeon killing stuff and giving the loot to new players, helping people that are in trouble, and even innane things such as just healing afk people than sitting there camping a mob to get a shiny new piece of armor for myself.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 581<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/16/02 8:52:20 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~jakecj7/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV = Fuckwads</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They could be your friend, even if they go ld all the time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Heh, i would say, he has been cursing about it even more once in E/V than when he was in Emp. To manage to gather an E/V force to help for an epic... now that is epic. Epics just dont fit in a full time raid environment. In Emp the folks had pretty much only such things to do, we didnt have the power to actually kill the mobs but it was possible to find someone willing to help without being stuck in raids 7/7 heh. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://pages.infinit.net/kerosene/sigfinal.JPG"></CENTER>

Yes it makes you lazy and weak, you only want to do it one day. For a short time you give it your all, when for days on end, members of Uber guilds give it their all.

Oh look another artwork flame. Once again it shows you have no clue about me and my guild. I joined EV long before I started to do sketches. I didnt sketch an EV member until I was in the guild for almost 3 plus months. I did sketch pics of my friends that I grouped who were not in EV, but I dont know how that helped me get in EV. Also considering I charge for my pics, I dont see how me being in the guild changes that. I charge those in the guild and out of the guild the same rate, so once again, Whooops, Krickett comes up with nothing. Oh heres the kicker though, I did more pics of SI members then EV members when I first started doing sketches, god that must of helped me win favor with them.<br>
<br>
Also I dont use an etch a sketch or colored pencils, but thanks for pretending to know something, you do it so badly it is laughable and good for a few chuckles.<br>
<br>
As for contributing to my guild and the end game, I have great attendance and contribute if yer really curious, and ya feel the need to actually find something out instead talking out of yer ass, ask my guildmates, feel free they will be more then happy to tell you. Or was that once again Krickett pretending that he knows what the fuck is going on. Keep playing yer part loser, you are the nerdy waterboy who when the team is huddling you are hopping up and down to see whats going on. <br>
<br>
Go back to slinging those buffs 100% of the time 12% of the week. I will go back to sketching people in my guild to get loot, like my new sketches of Lejina and Raffica, I just did, but god knows as a monk, they help make the calls for my class that will get me items!!!

I have to disagree here -if-... and please note the -if-... the same policies that were being put in place when I left EV are still there.<br>
<br>
I have been told that Companions do not force out or give a cold shoulder to people who have busy schedules. You show up when you are online and if you are not, you are not alienated from the guild and made to feel like dead weight.<br>
<br>
This is a game. The loot isn't real, the people are. I refuse to judge people based on how many hours they spend in a video game. I will judge them on their behaviour -while- they are playing the game, but that is not the same thing... a distinction that seems to be missed here. <p><br>

<br>
If a player only plays 10 hours a week, but he/she knows their class and plays well, they are an asset for those 10 hours. If they can only make one raid, that is one raid that you have a quality player helping to reach your objective.<br>
<br>
Nobody is saying that a 1 raid a week player deserves as much loot as a 7 raid a week player, but that does not make them lazy or worthless. They are still an asset and if they are a friend, they deserve to be treated as such.<br>
<br>
All this other bullshit is about loot and kills, and yes,there are some people who look at guilds who only see their members as tools in a bad light. <p><br>

<br>
E/V is merely playing EQ the way Verant designed it at the high end.<br>
<br>
To take down a difficult ubermob you need a large number of people to commit a large amount of time, and then you need all of those people to perform at maximum efficiency during the fight. This means melees must output the absolute maximum damage possible (you actually have to talk about calculations of damage per second), tanks must wear hitpoint items in all equipment slots to increase their chances of staying alive while taking thousands of points of damage per second, healers must co-ordinate healing with split-second efficiency (overlapping with each other's heals so that you don't have a gap due to casting time), nukers must have the only spell that affects this type of creature and have enough mana to keep using it, and every other little thing must occur perfectly.<br>
<br>
Otherwise the battle fails and you just wasted all those hours. That is why E/V need a minimum of starting equipment and stable connections, because everyone else in the guild is going to be relying on those new people.<br>
<br>
And it is never about individual loot. Loot acts to improve team efficiency -- over time, if every member gets equipped with a minor upgrade, it is a major upgrade for the guild as a whole (more mana/damage/hitpoints/ac means a slightly better chance at the team succeeding where it failed before). You can't equip new people with the newest stuff on behalf of a team, because you don't know those people yet -- and there are many who want to join a guild like E/V for personal gain. In guilds like these, the people that have shown the most commitment over time get the best loot first.<br>
<br>
That may not be how you want to play EQ, but Verant has catered extensively for that kind of gameplay. Over the years since 1999 I've seen views like yours expressed hundreds of times, and usually people like you creep their way into the mid-50s and then the penny drops.<br>
<br>
You might feel like you're upholding some kind of noble ideal, but you just look like a n00b. <p><br><br>

Actually what I said was that my skills as a healer were better than many and rivaled by few. It was flameboard gimps like yourself who twisted that statement to &quot;I am the best healer on Tribunal&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> but everyone wants to be the biggest and best, and doesnt want to be told the truth that they might suck.

Wrong again oh small penised wonder. There is no jealousy here. I will stand behind my statement of better than most and rivaled by few. Why? Because I have the self confidence and the intelligence to learn from the gamers that just dont quite get the concept of healing. Its<br>
people like you who think that once you get the E/V tag you can look down on others with feigned supeiorority. Luckily their are not many asshole like you left on the server. You are one of the very few left who think the guild tag you wear makes a statement about how great a player you are. All your guild tag means is you spend far more time playing than others do.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In effect you are saying you are of the same level of those who give 100% of themselves 100% of the time, when you are giving 100% of yourself 12% of the time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nice twist there pond scum but pay attention. I give 100% of myself 100% of the time. My 100% of the time maybe 10 hours a week. yours maybe 40 hours a week. Does it bother you that some of us can achieve in 10 hours what it takes you 40 hours to achieve? I think you are the jealous one here. I play Everquest 10 hours a week and I feel good about it and I have fun with it. I am sorry it takes you 40 hours to get the same thrill.<br>

I think its wonderful that my feigned ignorance can give so many people chuckles throughout the day. The sad thing is your ignorance is not feigned. You actually believe the crap you type and you are the king of twisting shit around to try and make yourself look right.<br>
The fact is you made a blanket statement to everyone that was not in an uber guild and called them lazy. Your statement was addressed to me and everyone else out there that is not in an end game guild. You try to cover that you werent talking to me but if I took offense the blah blah blah. You need to learn some language skills in order to know how the address the person you are talking to. Then you will not be making blanket statements<br>

If someone goes ld during a fight they could make the whole raid wipe. I get that, I just don't believe that a player is of no use to a guild is they have a bad connection...But my idea of a guild is different from theirs. I think of a guild as a close-knit circle of friends that go to different places in groups and raid. I don't see a guild as a group of people that just gang up in order to kill high level mobs. But like I said before, if that's what they like then great. <br>
I don't have a disdain for raiding. If I did I would have quit already. I actually do enjoy raiding to some extent, but I don't enjoy huge timesinks.<br>
