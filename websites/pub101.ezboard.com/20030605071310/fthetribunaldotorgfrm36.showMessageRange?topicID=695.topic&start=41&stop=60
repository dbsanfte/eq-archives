As for placing the beef council and the likes in the category of cruel and unusual, you have to consider if the means of the situation justify the ends. The beef council kills countless anmials a day, yet almost all parts are used to produce goods and food. People are fed by meat, clothed by leather, etc etc. It can be comparable to natives who hunt and kill for survival. Granted, it's not such an extreme issue, but it's along the same lines. <br>
As it was said before, cruelty is subjective. I can support eating meat because I see it as necessary for survival.  Whereas a fish in a blender or half of a horse carcus on display in a NY museum isn't all that high on my list. <br>
<br>
<br>
Then again, there's the question of if fish can actually feel pain. If not, then maybe this is all pointless.<br>

Thats the same excuse Hitler used for killing millions of Jews, gimps, and old people.  &quot;in order to get rid of the problem we must kill everything questionable to the promotion of our race.&quot;  If YOU do not take the time to look up whether the insect is a harmful or harmless type, then you are being a hypocrit.

No, that isn'y my argument, at all.  Obviously you want to express that as my argument since its the part you find the weakest.  My argument (as I clearly stated) was &quot;who are you to judge what another person does for their entertainment if it does not harm a human being, nor our society?&quot; which is the reason we create laws in the first place.  You can say morally this and morally that all you want about whether you think animals should be killed for this, or killed for that, or killed at all and you are entitled to that opinion and to live by that standard yourself however you choose.  You can't say that the person should be bitch slapped because they have a different opinion than you (well you can SAY it I guess, but you can't enforce it).<br>

<br>
Actually, the police recommend that people shoot stray animals if they are in their yard (for any reason) if they do not feel like taking them to an animal shelter.  They really don't care what the purpose behind doing it was.  The police's purpose behind it is to control stray animal populations, and by control they mean kill, pen up, or anything goes.  I have yet to see a single court case against a person shooting an animal here in Michigan EVEN when it was someone else's pet and the person who shot it was shooting it for entertainment (yes, there are lots of people that like shooting animals for entertainment.  To see it, you would have to leave your urban lifestyle though).  The thing the pet owner is always told is &quot;why wasn't your pet on a leash?&quot; and the prosecutors never get beyond that.<br>

<br>
Actually, you don't have a God-given right to place judgement on others.  If you take a look at the Bible it explicitly says 'do not place judgement on others, for judgement is mine'.  I can give a few examples for ya, to make it a &quot;for sure thing&quot;.<br>
<br>
Levitcus 19:15 -19:18<br>
<br>
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgement: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.  Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among they people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of they neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.  Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
<br>
A confusing passage I must admit.  Sounds like its going against what its saying, constantly.  But, its not.  I'll break it down in simple terms (some of the stuff I'm not going to explain, if thats ok).  Its saying rebuke and judge, yet don't judge and avenge.  It places judge with rebuke and then judge with avenge.  Givin the context its in, this means you can judge a person verbally or consciously (rebuking them), but not in action (vengeance) and then only if its in a righteous manner.  It also makes it clear that in rebuking them, you should still love them and not hate them.  If you hate people that do things that you don't agree with, you are sinning yourself.<br>
<br>
I looked through my concordance real fast and couldn't find the place for the quote: 'judge not, for judgement is the right of the Lord' or something like that.<br>
<br>
The Law:  Well, I'm sorry but as I have stated already, Michigan Law isn't against it.  Yer wrong.  We went over this once before on an entire thread, and eventually someone brought up a link for Michigan Law.  That link made it very clear that its legal.<br>

&lt;----Typical life, with pets.  I was a child at one point, our house never had ants.  My mom did a good job of keeping the house clean (by which she assigned us chores as well, and we did them well).  I guess that comes with a behaved household.  Actually, our house was next to the woods.  We got a lot of spiders, but never any ants.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyhow, the workings of ants really isn't the point here. If they are in your house, they are in your house, for a reason. They aren't on vacation or some shit. They are there for food. That 'food' could be any number of things, to include the house itself. But since I don't live in your sanitized bubble, I kill ants when I see them. If I see more than a few, I bust out the raid.<br>
<br>
Again, it isn't needless, it is with a purpose... which is not entertainment.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

And depending on the type of ant, and how well you take care of your house you could have easily prevented the mass genocide of ants just by taking a little more time to do it appropriately, no?  Thats my point.  Try being an anti-animal killer, but when you start killing things upon which there are alternate options...you become a hypocrit.<br>

Lets see here um, you drop it in a big lake...it turns grey and dark...grows 3-4 feet long.  To keep its golden color (a defining term for goldfish) it must remain small and in an aquarium.  Haven't seen goldfish turn into carp have ya?  I mean, its not exactly a &quot;morph&quot; or anything, but if you throw a bag of goldfish into a closed off pond you will find yourself with a bunch of 3-4 foot greyish looking bottom suckers.  Once in a while in rivers and streams you can catch carp that still have their hue of gold to them, they are usually 2-3 feet long and not fully mature at that point.  Been there, done that.<br>

Also, you are implying that Goldfish, if they do reach 4 feet long, would be the top predator in any fresh water habitat that you introduce them into, because they would be enormous fish.  Anyways, your link says &quot;The largest Goldfish are roughly 10 inches (25 cm) long.&quot;  This is a far cry from 4 feet.  Some type of goldfish are rather fat with huge fins.  If they did reach 4 feet long they would be larger than small children for sure.  The argument that other types of fish that do reach 4 feet long (and btw, for a freshwater fish that is HUGE unless we are talking about freshwater pike) are long and skinny and thus not larger than small children is rather silly because these fish do not undertake radical physical transformations from the adolescent stage to the adult stage<br>

<br>
In any case, provide proof that the common goldfish, when thrown into a natural aquatic habitat, will magically transform into 4 foot long carp and while you are at it, prove your theory of how goldfish can regulate to such a large degree the size to which they can grow at just based on the available space in a tank.

Nor did I say the link said that.  However, thats just what I know from actually watching fish grow.  Ya see, I'm from a little area known as &quot;the country side&quot; where kids grow up without being watched by their parents because the surrounding area is safe.

And you are an idiot, whats your point?  To be larger than children you pretty much have to be a shark, whale, barricuda, sea lion, or things of that sort.

Habitat doesn't support it.  Go figure.<br>

Oh and BTW 4 feet for fresh water fish is NOT huge.  All the fish I named in my previous post are fish that can (and frequently do) reach that length.  In particular, walleye and catfish aren't even worth keeping unless they reach 24 inches to start...and the legal limit (smallest possible to legally catch) is somewhere around 20 inches.  Most of those named fish reach between 3 and 4 feet in length.  Also to note, every single one of those types of fish start off VERY small...after hatching from eggs of course.  Why would you think goldfish any different?  Oh yea, I know, because you want to be right in an argument even if it means spreading lies (which I alrdy caught you red handed in doing).<br>

Yep, 300%, thats right, and true.  Take any fish and you will see that that is what happens.  ANY fish (that I know of) will conform to its environment.  Take a great white shark and place it into a small aquarium and watch it never grow beyond the size of the tank, no matter how much you feed it.  Thats a &quot;general&quot; rule about all fish.  They all seem to conform to it (although there very well might be exceptions, but carp is definitely not one of them).<br>

Want proof, go to aquatic life websites that will help inform you of the &quot;illogical&quot;.  There are lots of things in this world that defy logic, this seems to be one of em I guess (to you at least).  I'm not sayin this stuff because &quot;my dad told me&quot; (however, if he did then it would most definitely be true because he is actually a pretty wise man)...but instead on first hand experience.  I already told you I WATCHED goldfish turn into carp in my uncle's pond.  It was a stocked pond, with no water sources or exits.  Growing fish was one of his hobbies, and he would fish for them and throw them back to see how they were doing.  I guess you need to hit the books before continuing to argue here.<br>

Opinion remains divided regarding the origin of the goldfish. There can be little doubt that it is very closely related to the crucian carp, Carassius carassius, but the question remains whether it is actually a direct descendant or just a close relative. It is certainly true that if allowed to reproduce in the wild, without the intervention of man, the goldfish will, over a few generations, revert to something very closely resembling the crucian carp. The question is, is the resulting fish the wild form of C. auratus or is it a reversion to C. carassius? According to the FBAS fish guide, booklet number 3, Dr Yoshiichi Matsui, aquatic author and Professor of Fish Culture at Kinki University in Japan, believes that the former is true and that the crucian carp is the ancestor of the goldfish. This publication also quotes Dr Otto Schindler’s opinion that while the two species are closely related, there is a dark blotch present on the caudal peduncle of the crucian carp that does not appear on the reverted form of the goldfish.<br>
<br>
Other differences exist between the two species. The dorsal spine in the goldfish is coarsely serrated but not so in the crucian carp; the edge of the dorsal fin of the Common Goldfish is concave whereas that of the crucian carp is convex; the body of the Common Goldfish is thought by some to be more elongate than that of the crucian carp and the scale count along the lateral line is reported to be 25 to 30 in the Common Goldfish but 28 to 35 in the crucian carp, indicating a larger scale size in the Common Goldfish. <br>

As you can see (search the site), theyre are in the same FAMILY but different Genus. They can actually interbreed and create some really fugly looking critters (the phrase brown trout comes to mind...). Average maximum length of the common goldfish or comet is 1.5-2' but under optimum conditons I have seem them much larger. Ive seen very large ones at different koi gardens here and there in Oregon and Washington. In the wild this would be extremely rare. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/25/03 4:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=695.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: US holds no monopoly on silly litigations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And is that where you learned about these Four Foot Teenage Mutant Ninja Goldfish?

Actually, the info you gave works pretty well for my argument.  Firstly, I want to state that I don't believe in vertical evolution (read Darwin's Black Box, evolution is proven false by this biochemical scientist who is not a Christian nor religious).  The OPINION of the doctor was that it was a descendant, he didn't say it was fact.  The stuff about the dot and the skeleton structure can easily be seen as evidence for my side of the argument as well.  If the goldfish are not allowed to fully develop, then that could mean the black dot and skeletal structure (such as the concavity) are not allowed to fully develop...and that could very easily explain the differences.  Its also interesting how (at least with what was shown) he simply decided to ignore the fact that after a generation or two, the goldfish magically turn into carp.  He stated it, but he didn't explain it, probably because he can't.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nor did I say the link said that. However, thats just what I know from actually watching fish grow. Ya see, I'm from a little area known as &quot;the country side&quot; where kids grow up without being watched by their parents because the surrounding area is safe. We fished, we played with frogs, climbed trees, the works. Learning about wildlife was one of things we did the most.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And I spent my life studying Biology voraciously as a kid.  What is your point?  That you are from some podunk area that you must therefore know more than science?  Oh that's right, you are a Creationist, since you disbelieve in evolution and therefore you discount all species classifications for some odd reason.  Although it is still possible that evolution can just be God pulling the strings, so evolution and creationism are not mutually exclusive btw.<br>
<br>
Now let us look at your theory of fish size.  You use evidence that a great white shark would not grow beyond the size of the tank.  Well, considering that we have been unable to keep Great White Sharks in captivity for any long duration, you are using an example which humans don't have any evidence on.  Also, sharks require a large volume of water just to survive because they need to be able to swim around to put oxengenated water over their gills.  This is due to the fact that they are unable to pump water like fish, so they must constantly move. So suggesting that they can grow to the size of the tank is preposterous, as they would just plain die.  This is why aquariums do not keep or have been unable to keep the larger species of sharks.  They either die or have to be released to the wild because they grow too damn big.  If your theory was true, then millions of people around the world would have minature great white sharks living in 20 gallon tanks.  And yes, I know there is one species of shark that can remain stationary, but that is an exception.  So far, I have seen a lack of proof on your side that fish won't grow to their average adult size if the only limiting factor is the size of the tank.  In addition, I have yet for you to provide proof that a fish, if held in a tank, will limit it's size of growth and if released to the wild, will resume growing again.  Even your countryside examples fail to point out how this is possible.  You just keep putting out this weird idea that fish can regulate their size based solely on your word.<br>
<br>
Also, the site that you link to says the largest goldish ever recorded is 10 inches.  Since this is something you have linked to as evidence, and you are now saying that this fact the site has is false, then why the hell are you linking to it?   Not only does this NOT say that the goldfish will grow to 3-4 feet long, but it also says that it takes a few genereations for color change to occur.  What this means is that a fish will not completely change it's color in it's lifetime, but subsequent generations (in other words, offspring/kids) will see colors change.  What does this mean?  A fish, in it's lifetime, does not magically grow to such huge proportions and change their color as you are proposing.<br>
<br>
I stand by my children statement because yes, a 4 foot fish is definately bigger than say a 4 year old human.  Maybe you consider children to be teenagers or something?  By the way, sea lions and whales are not fish.  We ARE talking about fish here, aren't we?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh and BTW 4 feet for fresh water fish is NOT huge. All the fish I named in my previous post are fish that can (and frequently do) reach that length.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I have already mentioned pike, which, btw your beloved walleye that you post links to all over the place, is a type of.  Also in your link with the chart, it notes that bass reaching a length beyond 31&quot; are r e a l l y h u g e.  So if you are saying that bass, a fish you named, are comonly 36&quot; to 48&quot; but the site you link to says they are pretty damn big (which means they aren't common) then maybe you country people use rulers that have smaller inches on them or something.  Furthermore, your chart only goes up to 40&quot;, which is a whopping 8&quot; shy of 4 feet.  So care to explain again why 4 feet fish are common and frequent?  Also, all the fish in your chart are top level predators for fresh water habitats.  A 4 foot goldfish would be a huge monster and a top level predator in any fresh water system, and I find the idea of 4 foot goldfish devouring other fish whole a little hard to swallow.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Here is one showing charts for the lengths of 3 types of fish...all going up between 3 and 4 feet.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, 40 inches is not 4 feet, and Bass, which are not common beyond 31&quot; is not even 3 feet.  Maybe you flunked math or something.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess that should be enough <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, this is enough to prove that a) you link to stuff that doesn't prove anything for you but rather disagrees with you, b) you are unable to divide by 12, c) you are completely off your rocker.<br>
<br>
The ONLY thing you can prove, which you don't even have the wits to point out, is that my skepticism of goldfish surviving in the wild is not true.  Although evidence points to them not being able to survive very well. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
