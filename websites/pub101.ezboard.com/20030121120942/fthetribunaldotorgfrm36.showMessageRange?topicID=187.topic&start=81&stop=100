Do you live in daily fear of the government swooping in and taking your car?  Your statement is just ignorant.  Any time anyone mentions the government coming in to take their guns is when I know I am dealing with a whack job.  Stop for a  minute and think about the logistics of an operation to disarm the citizens of the US.  The only thing an attempted siezure of weapons in this country would do is cause is a revolution.  <br>
<br>
Give up the paranoid rhetoric and think about what you are saying.  Registration and licensing are not against the constitution, they in no way infringe on your right to own a fire arm.  <br>
<br>
I am seriously starting to think all gun enthusiasts (nuts) should be tested for paranoid schitsophrenia, you all seem to think there are drug enraged criminals around every corner waiting to rape and murder you, or that the government is going to swing into action any minute and try to take your guns away.

The wrong time to find out you need a fire extinguisher is when your kitchen is on fire.<br>

The wrong time to get insurance is after an accident.<br>

The wrong time to learn to swim is when you boat is sinking.<br>

Just like most of these things will never happen to the majority of us, most gun owners will never need to fire their weapon in self defense... it is insurance.<br>
<br>
As to registration, it's already done in my state (Maine) and I have no problem with it. The cold war is over and I don't see any country that would ever be able to put ground troops on American soil... not a significant force anyway. And as far as the government coming to get my weapons... I  can see it happen the way the public opinion is manipulated by all this anti-gun rhetoric bullshit (hey, it happened in the UK, it can happen here), but who says every gun is registered? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>

<br>
There are powerful anti-gun lobbies in the United States.  There are no anti-car lobbies that i know of.  The official position of the UN is that no one should have any guns period.<br>
<br>
The UN-funded Commission on Global Governance (CGG) called for civilian as well as international disarmament programs in a 1995 report entitled Our Global Neighborhood. In the chapter &quot;Promoting Security,&quot; the CGG claimed: &quot;Militarization today not only involves governments spending more than necessary to build up their military arsenals. It has increasingly become a global societal phenomenon, as witnessed by the rampant acquisition and use of increasingly lethal weapons by civilians -- whether individuals seeking a means of self-defense, street gangs, criminals, political opposition groups, or terrorist organizations.&quot; Note that civilians &quot;seeking a means of self-defense&quot; constitute a security threat -- juts like &quot;street gangs&quot; or &quot;criminals.&quot; In 1997 UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan endorsed a &quot;Small Arms&quot; report that defined as small arms such weapons as &quot;revolvers and self-loading pistols&quot; and &quot;rifles and carbines.&quot;<br>
<br>
In nation-wide polls taken over the last twenty-five years around 40% are in favor of banning the civilian possession of handguns. Almost 20% are in favor of banning the civilian possession of any kind of firearm.<br>
<br>
but politicians will protect our rights, won't they?<br>
<br>
Mr. President, what is going on in this country? Does going to school mean exposure to handguns and to death? As you know, my position is we should ban all handguns, get rid of them, no manufacture, no sale, no importation, no transportation, no possession of a handgun . There are 66 million handguns in the United States of America today, with 2 million being added every year.<br>
         --- Senator John H. Chafee, Rhode Island<br>
<br>
Mr. speaker, we must take swift and strong action if we are to rescue the next generation from the rising of tide armed violence. That is why today I am introducing the Handgun Control Act of 1992. This legislation would outlaw the possession, importation, transfer or manufacture of a handgun except for use by public agencies, individuals who can demonstrate to their local police chief that they need a gun because of threat to their life or the life of a family member, licensed guard services, licensed pistol clubs which keep the weapons securely on premises, licensed manufacturers and licensed gun dealers. <br>
         --- Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, New York<br>
<br>
Twenty years ago, I asked Richard Nixon what he thought of gun control. His on-the-record reply: 'Guns are an abomination.' Free from fear of gun owners' retaliation at the polls, he favored making handguns illegal and requiring licenses for hunting rifles.<br>
         --- William Safire<br>
<br>
There is no reason for anyone in this country, for anyone except a police officer or a military person, to buy, to own, to have, to use, a handgun. The only way to control handgun use in this country is to prohibit the guns. And the only way to do that is to change the Constitution.<br>
         --- Michael Gartner, former NBC News President<br>
<br>
The goal is an ultimate ban on all guns, but we also have to take step at a time and go for limited access first.<br>
         --- Joyner Sims, Florida State Health Dept., Deputy Commissioner<br>
<br>
If it was up to me, no one but law enforcement officers would own hand guns... <br>
         --- Chicago Mayor Richard Daley<br>
<br>
One of us is ignorant.  It isn't me.<br>

Lilum... first of all, your short post a page ago.<br>
<br>
Call me elitist, but the sheer number of stupid people in the world is staggering.  Most of them are irresponsible, too.  It is NOT, however, the role of the government to interfere with these people any more than with more intelligent ones, unless they abuse their freedom by committing criminal actions.  To suggest anything else would be a violation of the freedoms which every man and woman possesses.  If you value your freedom so little, that's fine.  I will fight tooth and nail, however, to salvage MY freedoms from the political bonfire onto which you and people like you perversely continue to throw them in the name of safety.<br>
<br>
As for your second denunciation, to insinuate that the vast majority of anti-gun activists do not want to do away with them completely is amazingly ignorant.  Schizophrenic?  I don't think so.  I am merely aware of the growing tide of uninformed thought and knee-jerk reaction concerning guns in this country, and very worried about it. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

First off did I once in any of my posts call for a ban on firearms.  (I notice that most of you don't even use the proper term, yet you know more than I do, SURE).  What I do want is registration, education, and licensing.  Sorry if you can't pass a class to learn how to use, store, and care for a weapon that can kill me and mine by just raising your arm and moving your finger less than half an inch, you don't deserve that power.  <br>
<br>
Secondly we are a republic, we put the government in power.  If we as a nation are dumb enough to elect people to power who will abuse that power we deserve what we get. <br>

BUT soon.<br>

» Forget the phony Hitler quotes, and focus on the facts. In 1938 Germany did establish gun control. From 1939 to 1945 over 13-million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, mentally ill, union leaders, Catholics and others, unable to fire a shot in protest, were rounded up and killed.<br>

» China has more practice than anyone does in disarming potential dissenters. Once upon a time they banned knives and swords. In 1935 they established gun control. Subsequently, between 1948 and 1952, over 20-million dissidents, again deprived of the tools for self defense, were rounded up and killed.<br>

» Democrat Representative W. Clay was quoted in the St. Louis Post Dispatch of May 8, 1993, regarding the Brady Bill. He said it is &quot;the minimum step&quot; Congress should take. &quot;We need much stricter gun control and eventually we should bar ownership of handguns except in a few cases.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;We'll take one step at a time, and the first is necessarily ... given the political realities ... very modest. We'll have to start working again to strengthen the law, and then again to strengthen the next law and again and again. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns, is going to take time. The first problem is to make possession of all handguns and ammunition (with a few exceptions) totally illegal.&quot;<br>

Of course there are going to be people who want to ban all firearms  You managaed to quote ONE Senator out of 100 and ONE representative out of 435.  Just as there are people who want to lift all restrictions on firearms.  That does not make either position a realistic possibility.<br>
<br>
So where are the massive stomping of human rights on a defenseless population in the 100 other countries with strict gun control?   Gun control does not equal dictatorship.  Obviously most Dictatorships HAVE strict gun control (but even this is not universal) but so do most democracies.  There is no correlation between gun control laws and the oppressiveness of the government.  ALL kinds of governments have gun control oppresive, free, weak or strong.<br>
<br>
You right wingnuts are falling into a trap.  Fighting tooth and nail against every single effort that even remotely might impact firearms is playing into the hands of the left wingnuts.  If there ever is a successgul effort at a general ban, the blame falls squarely on the gun lobby and its absolute refusal to reasonable compromise.<br>
<br>
Ever wonder how Prohibition came into being when it was obvious from the start that it did not have anywhere near the support of the majority of the population?  One of the reasons was the brewing industries arrogance.  The problems that the temperance organizations were complaining about were real.  But the brewing industry fought tooth and nail against attempts at addressing these issues in a reasonable manner.  The argument soon became one of do nothing or Prohibition because of the inability of BOTH sides to compromise.  Doing nothing was not an option so we got Prohibition.  It was a huge mistake but the brewing industry was as much to blame for its inception as was the extremeist temperance organizations who pushed for it in the first place.<br>
<br>
There are very real problems with the easy availibilty of firearms in this country.   I oppose anything resembeling a ban.  BUT I am not blind to the carnage that firearms cause in this country.  None of our basic rights are absolute.  Their are limits on all of them.  Generally speaking you can't impact someone elses rights in the persuit of your rights.  In these very strictly limited cases, the government can regulate.  Freedom of Speech but you can't yell &quot;Fire!!!&quot; in a crowded movie theatre is the best example.<br>
<br>
Now with the second amendment, the right to bear arms is assured, BUT there are situations where someone bearing arms is a immeadiate and clear threat to someone else's rights (usually life or liberty)  The debate should be how do we better control THAT situation without stepping on the rights of those who do NOT pose a threat to the basic rights of those around them.  How do we better control the flow of firearms into the criminal world without impacting possesion by law-abiding citizens.  There is an answer out there, but until both the right wing and left wing nuts get off there soapboxes and back off thier extremeist positons, we will never find one.<br>
<br>
Personally I would rather they lift ALL restrictions on firearms  (You want to own a howitzer, no problem) but have a robust registration system with teeth.  It is the transfer from legal market to illegal market that is allows criminals to so easily get hold of weapons.  We need to start controling THAT transfer better.  You cannot do it unless the government(state. local of federal) can better track gun ownership.   Even then it will take years of effective enforcement to shrink the supply of guns on the black market, but it can be done.<br>
<br>
One other thing. Simple registration, probably is not unconstitutional because as long as it does not itself disallow gun ownership.  However licsensing gun ownership is another matter.  The term inherently implies a standard needs to be met.  This IS a restriction.  As much as I would like to make sure that everyone who owns a gun knows how to safely use it, I don't think the case can be made that there is enough compelling interest for the government to restrict a basic right in this way except in most extreme cases (i.e no felons, mental patients etc.  Cases where there is a high likelyhood of someone else's right to life is at stake)<br>
<br>
So in the end, I don't believe that a registration requirement is out of reach, I do think that licsensing DOES run into constitutional problems. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Well, how bad is it, really in the Unites States? I mean, such a passionate subject that one would assume that Firearm Homicide is an epidemic in the US that needs to be controlled, correct?<br>
<br>
CDC numbers from 1999 (sorry, best i could find)<br>
<br>
There were 2,391,630 deaths in the US in 1999.<br>
<br>
Homicide was the 16th leading cause of death in the United States with a total of 16,889 deaths occuring becuase of this.  That accounts for .7% of all deaths in the US. You could say that homicide is a &quot;rare&quot; occurance.<br>
<br>
Out of those homicides, 10,828 were caused by firearms. This accounts for a large portion of homicides, 64%, BUT, as an overall cause of death, is a mere .4%.<br>
<br>
Is .4% worth playing around with the 2nd ammendment? That's what it really comes down to. And out of that .4% of homicides that occured with a firearm, how many would not have occured if these registration processes were in place?   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

<br>
Do the math<br>
<br>
16,889 / 2,391,630 = .007, which is .7%.<br>
<br>
.01 = 1%<br>
.001 = .1%<br>
<br>
therefore<br>
<br>
.007 = .7%<br>
<br>
For proof, take out a calculator, type in 2,391,630 then type .7, hit the % sign then multply . You will get 16,741.41. I rounded off the .7%. Its actually .00706171111 <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

How many of those murders could have been prevented by strictly enforcing a registration, so that every firearm was/is accounted for.  <br>
<br>
What the gun nuts like to ignore is the first bit of the second amendment.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A well <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> regulated </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->militia, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> (emphasis mine.)<br>
<br>
I guess that little clause is a bit too inconvenient so it gets ignored quite a bit.  <br>
<br>
Every state has a &quot;well regulated militia&quot;, it's called the National Guard.  Every National Guard unit is under the direct control of the Governor of the state that it is in.  While the federal government can call on the National Guard in times of emergency it is technically a state run branch of the armed forces.  <br>

<br>
It is not refering to the National Gaurd or any other formal government organization.  It refers to the responsibilty that a gun owner has to the defense and well being of the community at large.  The &quot;minuteman&quot; militias and even the posse's of the old west are the kind of thing it is referring too.  Being a gun owner inherently involves responsibilty to your community and the government is suppose to regulate in light of that, but it is a very very limited mandate.  The problem is how do we deal with those who DON'T use firearms responsibly w/o impacting those who do. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Following your logic here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Why don't we ask 16,889 husband, wives, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, etc. how many deaths does it take to make the loss of life unacceptable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There were 1,879 people stabbed to death. We better start a registration process on all knives as well.<br>
<br>
There were 708 homicides caused by suffocation. Next time you buy a pillow, you better register it with the government. <br>
<br>
197 people were murdered using Fire. Matches and Cigarette lighters need to be tracked by the government now. As well as sticks (you know those boy scouts).<br>
<br>
There were 70 homicides using drowning. Not sure how your going to register water...<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if no loss of life is unacceptable through homicide, and just by registering with the government, these homicides can be prevented, we better start registering all these things, right? I mean, no loss of life is acceptable for the cost of freedom, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How many of those murders could have been prevented by strictly enforcing a registration, so that every firearm was/is accounted for.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would venture to say 0, or close to it. If someone wants to kill you, they are going to kill you. The problem with people like you is, they blame the murder on the means by which the murderer uses, not on the murderer him/herself. That's just simply, wrong.<br>
<br>
I want to also comment on the &quot;strictly enforcing&quot; part. THAT is the main problem in this country, that we do not strictly enforce our own laws. If we did that, which is focus on the actual people and not the means by which they use, the homicide rates would drop, although never disappear. Strict enforcement of laws is a problem in the US. People get away with criminal acts too easily. So, instead of hindering and attacking the law abiding citizen, maybe we should actually start going after the criminals... <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

The second and third words of the amendement are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WELL REGULATED </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->that to me seems to be fairly narrow in it's scope.  It would seem that the gun lobby is actually quite anti-second amendment since they generally seem to be against any regulations concerning firearms.<br>
<br>
Actually it could very well be refering to what eventually became the National Guard.  Two hundred years ago when the second amendment was written the federal government had very little power compared to the individual states.  State governments were considered more important so as to allow individuals a way to more easily rule themselves.  The National Guard acting as militias would give the states the ability to stand up to the federal government if it ever over stepped its bounds.  I am not saying  really believe that is how it should be interpreted I am just saying that is how it could be interpreted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/02 5:27:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gun Control and Crime, the English experience</span><hr size=1> Kel maybe you aren't smart enough to understand the basic difference between knives, fire, pillows, water, and firearms all those things have other uses.

This is one of those completely ignorant things the gun lobby likes to throw out, while completely missing the design and function of a firearm.<br>
<br>
Also maybe you should stop to think if people had to register their weapons fewer would enter the black market and become illegal.  Many of those murders would have been stopped if the killer hadn't had an easy to get and easy to use means of killing someone.<br>
<br>
You also completely ignored the other part of my argument.  So please explain your stance against registration in light of the secon and third words of the amendment?
