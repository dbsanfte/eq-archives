Lizzie,  This forum bothers you because your guild is getting bashed.  <br>
<br>
I've only ever had two ~Heinous~ encounters with epic issues in the setting of &quot;Us Vs. Another guild&quot;  and guess what?  <br>
<br>
Both were with Companions.<br>
<br>
Both instances could have been brought out to the public boards and MAN, you guys would have *really* looked like assholes.  <br>
<br>
Trust me.<br>
<br>
Honestly, i hope the word gets out.  It made me smile to see Sapphon's post.  At least someone is taking the time to let others know what your guild condones or what type of company you keep.<br>
<br>
Does this mean i hate all Companions?  No.  It means i'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> VERY</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  protective of  my friends and on guard when faced with a situation where they're present.<br>
<br>
Flame Boards are good...  Like someone else said, look at the old board.  Moderating and biased deleting went on with no end.<br>
<br>
Talamay would get stressed about having to be unbiased while people trashed her guild.<br>
<br>
~Maybe~ Mistakes were made, things were said that shouldn't have been... people took liberties that moderators shouldn't take.  The Board went to hell.<br>
<br>
I thought you would have learned from the past... if you're going to Run a Board, be prepared to deal with this sort of stuff.  <br>
<br>
  We are all mature enough to sift through the obsceneties and biased opinions and understand the patterns of the guilds being talked about &amp; angry posters when we read through this stuff. <br>
<br>
Your guild is getting Flamed.  It would happen somewhere else if not here.  Your guild isn't the first or the last to be flamed. <br>
<br>
So just hang tight and Please, don't forget the Role you have chosen to take while running a board.<br>
<br>

<br>
If any of you ever feel bad becuase of anything someone you don't know posts on a messageboard, or says in a game, you are suffering from LOW SELF ESTEEM. You need to go find some real friends or go do something that makes you feel good about yourself. If flaming people on a messageboard makes you feel good, knock yourself out. Make fun of me please, I can take it.<br>
<br>
Muse, you seem to think that the people you meet in EQ are your friends, and therefore have the ability to make you feel bad. Everyone playing this game is roleplaying and therefore a giant fake! I pour salt on snails and tear wings off flies in real life, but in game I'm the nicest person there is. Eat a bag of shit if you think otherwise, assholes. Go meet the people on the other end of the screen and share a beer and some stories, then you can call them friend and worry about what they think. But until then, they are all 400 lbs truck drivers from New Jersey named Frank, and they make the Unibomber look normal. <br>
<br>
This includes you Muse. Prove me wrong. Invite me over for a beer someday, or are you just &quot;hiding behind the internet&quot; like you accuse us of?<br>
<br>
Oh, and I know you will probably think I hate you or something stupid now, but I really have no clue who you are and it doesn't keep me up at nights either. I'm just here to flame the people who flame the flameboard! She created the flameboard and is now SHOCKED people are flaming eachother! Hahaha, I have to remember that one.

<br>
It's one thing to have some place to vent when you're pissed or bitchy. It's another to see the kind of vitriol that comes across here. In some ways I think having this dedicated &quot;kvetching&quot; forum has actually encouraged the bitching rather than given it an outlet.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I think I had thought that the flameboard was going to get as much traffic as the &quot;Good Times&quot; forum gets. I also thought it was going to be more lighthearted like some of the original flames were.<br>

Sure, it doesn't affect RL, but it does affect ME and the people that I play with.  If I sit down to have fun with a group of friends and that fun is turned into frustration and disappointment by the actions of a few, I think anyone would get upset.  <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

You know, that argument goes both ways.  Anonymity gives people a greater freedom to express themselves without facing repercussions.  We can say all kinds of half-assed things (god knows i'm guilty of that) hiding behind our EQ personas and never have to worry about RL  consequences.<br>
<br>
However, internet would be a pretty boring place if people didn't speak what was on their mind.  After all, the beauty of the internet is that it is a massive, unregulated, undisciplined, uncontrolled flow of information.<br>

This was said by a good friend of mine who still plays, and when he put it to me this way, I couldn't disagree.  We still spend time trying to accomplish something in a game.  It maybe completely, totally and utterly fucking meaningless to anyone else but to us it bring a sense of satisfaction when we finish a quest or kill a juicy mob.  <br>
<br>
So when people say its just a game, they are wrong.   We invest our time in it, it is the same time that we could be doing something else with.  If I spend my EQ time instead by going to the gym and doing some weight lifting only to find the gym completely full, thats my time wasted again.<br>
<br>
And as much as we deny it, or like to think otherwise...  none of us really have boatloads of spare time on our hands.<br>

You can disect it all you want but in the end killing a_uber_mob or a_orc_pawn it still makes no difference. <br>

There is a real world out there and alot of us need more exposure to it. The world will pass by before you notice it and people you love and care for will disappear into the winds of time.

Well, it DOES matter.  Your posts prove this.  <br>
<br>
And Sapphon, that second Naggy jump you are speaking of only had I think 3 or 4 Companions there.  If I recall, a large portion of it was Veeshan's Enigma, my old guild.  Also, if I recall, I and anyone else involved apologized profusely AND MEANT IT.  As a matter of fact, VE hosted a Naggy raid for Sons of the Jade Falcon not too long after it, and you could count on seeing VE then VV supporting them at thier raids even after they became Raven's Wings, all because we screwed up and ruined a raid.  It is possible for someone to be genuinely apologetic about something (NO! FUCK YOU!  IT'S JUST A GODDAMN GAME!) and even try to make up for it if given the chance.  Why?  Because regardless of this being a game, most of us understand that real feelings are behind the toons.  Just think, as much as you and I have flamed at each other, if you needed help and I was there, you'd get help.  Why?  Cause you're a person.  <br>
<br>
Same goes for the people I would gladly watch rot (yeah, all TWO of you).  The only reason I wouldn't help someone is if they had done something reprehensible enough to personally have me hate them.  How can I hate anyone if it's just a game?  Because, like I said, there are real people and real feelings.<br>

It saddens me to read that you totally missed my point. I like ya for the most part but you throw the biggest tantrums when people dont agree with you (or you totally fail to get the point).<br>
<br>
I did not say I wasn't too involved in the pseudo reality of eq. <br>
<br>
I am/was and just having a reality check.<br>
<br>
I know Talamay knows what Im talking about heh.....<br>
<br>
As for the farewell posts, those people are my friends and that was one of the nicest things that has happened to me in some time. Friends will still be friends there is no EQ and everyone else doesnt matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utanjekindharte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanje Kindharte</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Dwarf Control</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/27/01 4:01:50 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ebonrose.hypermart.net/tanje.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate this forum.</span><hr size=1> Actually Bowynn the second raid was Vis Veres.

<br>
And yes, Vis Veres apologized and the world kept on turning.  It was from working out that whole thing that I met a lot of your guild and became friends with you all.  It was never brought up again by anyone still together from the old alliance but then most of us don't hold grudges. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I don't hate VV, they made a mistake. But I do hate the comps because they don't make mistakes they do this crap on purpose. Even if it isn't against my guild or friends I don't want to see them do this stupid crap, and they seem to do it all the dang time. That's what really focused my annoyance against them. They'll fuck you, apologize, and then fuck you again a week later, and if they don't fuck you again a week later it's because they're currently working on fucking someone else.<br>
