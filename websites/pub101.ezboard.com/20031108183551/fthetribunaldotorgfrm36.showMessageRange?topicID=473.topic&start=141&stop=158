That's just wrong. They are setting up a government of 200 US citizens (mix of military and civilian) that will be headed by a 3 star general who has yet to be named. They stated that it will run everything from health and human services to the Iraqi military.<br>
<br>
It was also said today that the UK troops are in foward placement to secure the Iraqi oil fields to &quot;take the onus off America&quot;. Fact is, the US <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be controlling Iraqi oil no matter which troops secure them first.<br>

If you are going to back this war, you really should keep informed of what the goals and plans are. <p><br>

It was a strain being kept by US labs.  If it wasn't done BY an american, it certainly was gotten FROM an american lab.<br>

Shehbahn lives in California, btw, so I'm pretty damn sure his country was hit with an anthrax attack.  That said, he wasn't born here but he certainly was here when 9/11 happened.  The rest he can speak to himself, but that little &quot;if you don't support Lord Bush, you must be (non/Anti)-American&quot; twist was just silly.

The only place he loses me is with his glorifying of the Clinton years.  He was no saint, especially in his first term he was largely a fuckup, but compared to Cowboy Bush he was great.  You may love that Bush &quot;tells us how he really feels with no bullshit&quot;, and I respect that, but just because he is very BLATANT about his stupid ideas doesn't mean I respect him more.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 703<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 7:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=473.topic&index=144>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> In the meantime...<br>

<br>
Under Clinton we had:<br>
<br>
The lowest unemployment rate of modern times<br>
<br>
The lowest inflation in 30 years<br>
<br>
The highest home ownership in history<br>
<br>
Greatly reduced crime rates<br>
<br>
While he inherited the biggest federal budget deficit in history, He turned it into largest surplus ever - a huge $230 billion. <br>
<br>
Welfare reform (not all good, but at least confronted the problem)<br>
<br>
Over 300 trade agreements that benefited the US greatly<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
He passed legislation that:<br>
<br>
Increased the number of people who could go to college<br>
<br>
Protected parents of sick children from losing their jobs<br>
<br>
Added federal funding for extra police officers<br>
<br>
Passed NAFTA<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
Global Affairs<br>
<br>
Brought peace to N Ireland with the Good Friday Agreement<br>
<br>
Ended ethinic cleansing in Bosnia and instituted the Dayton Peace Agreement<br>
<br>
Ended ethnic cleansing in Kosovo<br>
<br>
Came closer than anyone in bringing peace between Isreal and Palestine (remember the famous handshake on the White House lawn?)<br>
<br>
<br>
Clinton has visited more foreign countries than any other president, and displayed a more sophisticated understanding of international affairs than most of his predecessors and certainly more than our current president. <br>
<br>
Under Clinton anti-Amercanism was at an all time low. He was especially liked in the UK.<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you starting to get the picture? We were the most prosperus during his administration than in any time in history.  We had the fastest growth in real wages for more than two decades, and the biggest drop in welfare rolls seen during any administration. <br>
<br>
He was great in foreign affairs, he was great on economic issues, he was great on helping the poor, he was great on the enviroment...  come to think of it, other than never getting his Global Healthcare bill through, I can't think of any campaign promises he didn't meet or exceed.<br>
<br>
Did he have faults? Sure he did. Somolia was a disaster and we refused to get involved in Rwanda where there was a horrid genocide. He passed the Brady Gun Bill which was horrid imo. And of course there was Monica.<br>
<br>
But all in all, I couldn't think of a better president past or present. He had a vision and he fulfilled that vision. He changed the way the citizens viewed the White House changed the way other countries viewed the US. He was human and casual (what other president played sax on national TV and told the world he wore boxers, not briefs?) and brought that to his administration.<br>
<br>

Clinton IMHO did his *job* better than any president in a very long time.  I don't care if Bill Gates is having sex with his secretary, I'm a microsoft shareholder and I only care if he sells more Windows XP and manages to stomp out his competitors.<br>
<br>
Clinton the personal guy was greasy and a liar.  That said, he is nothing other than reflective of his generation - I just wish he'd admitted he smoked pot, and that he'd said &quot;yes, i fucked her, since when was that YOUR problem, Mr. Starr?&quot; (in nicer terms).  He was caught lying and is forever tainted for that.  But his performance as a president overall?  Fantastic.<br>
<br>
It is probably worth noting that the economy would have exploded like it did in the 90s if *I* had been running the country.  During times of peace, people are free to start getting greedy, and I think the .COM frenzy was nothing more than greed feeding greed.  I don't think the government did anything in particular to create that situation, nor could they have done much to diffuse it (though SEC regulation of Wall St. was a joke).<br>

Anyone who works within the Fed Goverment can show you the books and books of &quot;Fixes&quot; Clinton made that litterally fucked this country up beyond High heaven just so it would look pretty for his 8 years.<br>

We also had the Dot.com Boom, And the Highest Corporate Crime rate of all times. Of course Clinton did almost NOTHING to prevent these fraudlent Investors, Infact he Decreased our (The IRS/FBI's) Power to go after them. And you say bush is a friend of Big Buisness!<br>

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH.<br>
<br>
Clinton, Destroyed many of the basic Federal structures to get this Surplus Loegan, The IRS was actually concerned about how the U.S. goverment was going to keep running because of this, Yes it was really that  bad, And yes we are still recovering.<br>
<br>
God this point alone shows me you only read the pretty numbers on the front page of the reports, We had Heads of the Dept of Treas. getting ready to  kill themselves over Clintons Patch work Goverment spending.<br>
<br>
Creating a surplus of money by destroying avenues of getting more money, Or keeping track of money is NOT a way to keep a goverment running, Yet you glorify him for this? Why...<br>
<br>
Clinton Baisicly Coated a big piece of Shit in Gold, And for a while everyone was like ooooo that does not look so bad anymore...But guess what, Its still shit, It will stay shit, And somone has to clean it up.<br>
<br>
Can bush do it? Probably not, He is fixing things but what he has to work with is so broken its Unbelivable, I hope the next President (Dem or rep) Has a better understanding of how this goverment works or we are all in a shit Load of trouble, More then any of you relize. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A> at: 3/12/03 11:12:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1041<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 11:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=473.topic&index=151>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Telk just wanted to check in and see how you were feeling about Blix now that it has been shown that the whole drone thing was a farce?

I'll admit defeat now. It's pretty funny actually, everyone was wrong. Iraq was wrong in not declaring it on 2 seperate occasions and giving out the wrong specifications, Hans Blix was wrong in not realizing that Iraq later admitted to having the plane and clarifying the specifications, and the US was wrong in assuming that Blix was talking about another drone.

<br>
I didn't agree with Bush Sr on much (other than his handling of Iraq), but I have to say he has a much more mature approach to this than his son. I hate to say it, but I would rather have Bush Sr in office than his son anyday. While he lacked the vision of Reagan, at least he didn't activily harm the US as I believe Bush Jr is, and Bush Sr did have some above average diplomatic skills where his son has none at all that I can see.<br>
<br>
Oh well, wishful thinking. This Iraq thing is pretty much past the point of no return and we'll just have to deal with the fallout. <p><br>

For this sheb I am sorry to say you can lay the blame pretty squarely on the FBI/IRS criminal Investigation Units. We knew for years the Bubble economy was going to blow up in our faces, But we did not do anything for 2 reasons.<br>
<br>
1.) At the time the IRS was pretty much Neudered, Many laws were passed not only Limiting our power but also holding us acountable for wrongly auditing people.<br>
<br>
Now if anyone has worked for an acounting Firm or the IRS they know how many man hours it takes to audit a company like Enron (Example), Its simply too much to invest if you have to wait a few years for the courts to give you the OK, There by giving them time to cover their tracks.<br>
<br>
2.)People just did not pay Attention to Investors who were wise at the time, They wanted a piece of the pie, This is something I can not blame on Clinton because he really did try to create alternate avenues of investing your money.<br>
<br>
Can I blame this all on Clinton? No, The only thing I can really blame him for is the apauling state of our goverment atm, But I will say at least the man <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>honestly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tried to help the the economy (Even if he did not think about the long term affects)<br>

<br>
That is why I am a Clintonite and fiercly loyal to the man. I believe 100% that he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>honestly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tried to help common people. The vision he had and the programs he enacted produced benefits I could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>see</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in my everday life.<br>
<br>
Alot of presidents pass bills that they claim help us out, but most people never see the effects in their everyday life. That was not the case with Clinton. I saw the two extra officers in my town from his program (a big deal in a town of 6k people). I saw friends who went to college thanks to his programs. I saw my living conditions improve.<br>
<br>
Did Clinton really care about us or was I duped by a politician who happened to be slicker than most? There's no doubt he was slick, but I will go to my grave believing he was different than most previous presidents and I think the results he achieved during his presidency prove my belief to be founded in reality. <p><br>

<br>
The .com boom bust is a combination of factors, a big one of them is small carrier investment itself going online. At the end of the day it's Joe Schmoe with his $3000 savings who got the painful end of the stick. It was the &quot;internet revolution&quot; : everyone got on the internet at home. Because everyone suddenly had access to it, everyone convinced themselve it was the biggest revolution since TV. Nevermind that no one cared to look at what an actual business model was. <br>
<br>
The con was played by the investment bankers who were short selling all those early IPO companies with business models based on advertisement revenues. They knew the company was offering no real service, because no one would ever willingly pay for it. They sold the shares to their good buddies for next to nothing, drummed up the internet/interactive/multimedia magic buzzwords hysteria then soon as the profit was good enough, they would dump it all, leaving small carriers to pick up the pieces. All nice and clean, above SEC (for the most part). You can't really protect people from being stupid and greedy... there's no miracle : if you make more money than the global index increases, then someone else has been losing money. it's all in who wins and who loses. hint : &quot;middle class&quot; has never been really good at this game.<br>
