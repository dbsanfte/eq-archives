After 4 months and several characters (Highest L39 Healer) I finally got bored with all it has to offer at the moment, and the new high level raid zones didn't help that. RvR was a slideshow most of the time, keep raids especially. For some reason, I never found the fighting in groups as engaging as EQ as well. It was fun for a while but not a game I could see keeping my interest for even half as long as EQ did.<br>

You WANKER!</span><hr size=1> Well , hehe first time reading this post. I must admit alot of the post are right, I finally have my first 50 and a another lvl 45. EQ and DAOC are almost the same, they pretty much run and the same principle. Kill Mobs to get xp/gear and you gain lvl's as you do. As far as content goes, EQ has it locked right now, hell the have 3 expantion with nothing but content.<br>
<br>
I Like DAOC over eq due to the fact it has soo much more room to grow where eq can not. If you want rear and uber gear that only you alone can get, one patch could fix that(meaning they can give you better gear, just rare as hell to get). Xp death not really that bad, dunno what camps the other guys hunt, but with me a death and release takes me 20mins to get back in a full groups at lvl 49. You can't lose your lvl, that could be viewed as both a good or a bad thing.<br>
<br>
RvR is one thing that DAOC has done that gives this game room to grown over all the others. You want, uber, we can give ya, you content, we can give ya and expantion. But then the game says i am not giving you this all the uber gear and uber mobs for no reason, it is to get you more decked  so you can take on the bigest and badest mob in the game, another player.<br>
<br>
I liked the uber mobs in eq, till i asked my self, why do i need all this uber gear? To kill more NPC? To wait for the once a year BOTB? So the a newbie can look at me and go what's that? EQ is a good game, but i got sick of killing mobs to get better gear to kill more mobs. Kiiling mobs is cool if it's to better helped me to servive in the battle feild. But killing mobs to get gear just so i look cool when i am inspected, is no longer enuff reason for me to play. <p><BR>

<br>
I have a 42.5 Shadowblade, a 42 Hunter and a level 1 Rogue with ~875 Tailoring.<br>
<br>
Before I get started, let me say that I despise Mythic just like I grew to hate Verant.  It didnt take near as long either.  Possibly because I am jaded, or possibly because they are even more careless and incompetent.  So, stop reading if you are the type who thinks Verant does/did a good job with QA in EQ, or knows their game from their asshole.<br>
<br>
First I will gloss over some of the good.  Then I will go into detail as to what I dislike.<br>
<br>
The graphics are good, the best around in an MMORPG IMO.  The terrain, character models and spell effects especially.<br>
<br>
Melee combat is more interesting than in EQ, because of the styles.  Combat is much shorter in duration in DAoC than EQ.<br>
<br>
Tradeskills are much better here, however they are very incomplete.  More on that later.<br>
<br>
PvP.  I never did much in EQ, pretty much just the Necro BotB.  I didnt ever see a reason for it.  In DAoC, at least in theory, the game is built around the conflict among the three realms, so PvP is very much a big part of the game.  But, if you dont want to PvP, you dont have to. but again, its very incomplete.  More on that later.<br>
<br>
Soloability.  In general, its easier to play DAoC alone.  I know its an MMORPG, but for those times you have only a half hour to kill, DAoC is more accessible than EQ.  You can work a trade, you can solo for xp, you can RvR.  All with maybe 10-15 mins travel time tops.<br>
<br>
Downtime.  There is less overall, but you have to kill a *hell* of a lot more mobs to level, especially 40+.  Its misleading, early on you will feel like its much easier to level in DAoC than EQ, but starting at 41, it changes, and levels 41-50 are very much like 51-60 in EQ, ie. shitty.  Having played a Hunter, one of the best DAoC leveling classes, and a Necro, one of the best EQ leveling classes, I feel like getting to 50 in DAoC is about the same as getting to 60 in EQ.<br>
<br>
My number one beef with the game is that it is not close to being done.  There is no way in hell it should have been released in October of last year.  I still dont think its done, and there will be a lot more nerfs before they get where they need to be.<br>
<br>
There is a distinct lack of high level content, although that is finally being addressed.  Still, there are lots of zones that are unitemized, and very limited 'raid' level mobs/zones.  Quests also become very rare at level 30 on up.<br>
<br>
RvR is half-assed.  The game is sold around it, and yet there is no compelling reason to partake in it aside from pride.  Taking keeps really does nothing aside from replacing the enemies wandering guards with your own.  Relics do jack shit, which is unbelievable 4+ months after release.  RPs, points you get from killing other players, and they are not at all awarded fairly.  Healing classes dont get them for healing or ressing, and straight up melee only classes have a hell of a time amassing them in because AE spells and ranged attacks own the battefield.  They recently added BPs (bounty points), which you also get from killing players, but can be 'spent' on incredibly lame and useless stuff.  Why they need two types of points being awarded for the same thing is beyond me.<br>
<br>
Tradeskills are also not done.  During the beta, which I was not a part of and really had no clue was even going on aside from a few Legendary Euros occasionally commenting on it, Mythic really jocked the tradeskills.  Saying that playermade stuff would be superior to anything in game, blah blah.  Well, as it turns out, it simply is not true.<br>
<br>
Now, the tradeskills are much more extensive than in EQ, and you can actually earn money (good money) by doing them.  And they are more useful than in EQ, but saying they are the source of the best gear in the game is misleading at best, a flat out lie at worst.<br>
<br>
Quickly, a little background on the way items work in DAoC.  Each item has a level.  The relationship in levels between an item and your character is expressed as a color, very similar to the system they use to relate your char against other chars, enemies and monsters.  Grey/Green/Blue/Yellow/Orange/Red/Purple, from lowest to highest.  If the item is too high a level for you, the item is less effective when used by you, and degrades quicker.  If it is too low a level for you, it isnt inherently less useful, but becauase of the natural progression in damage from weps, protection from armor, etc. you will want to get rid of it in a hurry.<br>
<br>
They try to discourage twinking with this system, but it really doesnt work.  Items never really wear out so fast that you wouldnt want to use something that is high con to you for fear of it eventually becoming useless, and in general red/orange stuff is more effective than yellow stuff, because its got higher base stats, and likely a higher enchantment level.<br>
<br>
Item effectiveness is further modified by its quality (a static value from 1-100), its current condition (this is what decreases as an item is used, it can be repaired however), and its enchantment level (static, 0-25).  Ideally, you want to use equipment that is your level or slightly higher, with as high a quality and enchantment level as you can find.<br>
<br>
Two things conspire to cripple tradeskills.  One, the highest level item a player can craft is level 41, and that is limited to weapons.  There are no armors that are even level 40.  By the time you are 40, any item one level above you is yellow.  So at 40, there are no more yellow playermade items.  That sucks for crafters, because at 40 there are red dropped items which blow the doors off the best stuff they can make.<br>
<br>
And two, playermade items have no stat bonuses or weapon procs.  Dropped items are filled with them.  A new trade, spellcrafting, which would allow spellcrafters to imbue playermade objects with stats and bonuses has been promised since before release to alleviate this disparity.  <br>
<br>
As an aside, quality of playermade items almost never approaches the top quested items, which are usually 100%.  In general, playermade items are of superior quality, but it is very, very rare to get a 100quality playermade item because a master craftsman has a 1% chance of cranking one out assuming the item is grey to him/her (tradeskills use a color coded con system as well, which expresses the crafters trade skill vs the difficulty of the item he/she is trying to make.  Grey is never fail, up to red which is hard to make and you often will lose materials).<br>
<br>
Mythic also is worse than Verant when it comes to addressing issues regarding the game.  They are reluctant to discuss how skills work.  They will not comment on stats, much like Verant would not.  Etc.  Basically, since they started charging for the game, they have been getting more and more withdrawn when it comes to the playerbase.  Some people blame the posters on the unofficial official VGN forums for that, as there is a lot of negativity and flames much like what used to be on the station before Verant decided to completely regulate the flow of information there.<br>
<br>
But the biggest cluster of all is class balance.  Simply put, the classes are not balanced at all, not within the realms for PvE, and not without for RvR purposes.  Much like Verant, they have a test server.  Like Verant, they dont do as much testing as you'd expect there, and they disregard the testers comments.  They basically use it as a vehicle to test technical stability of their patches, not content balancing.<br>
<br>
So, classes get nerfed a lot.  Classes get boosted a lot.  There have been more class nerfs in DAoC in 4 months than EQ has had in its history.  Because of the dual PvE/RvR nature of DAoc, and the way you use skill points to definie your character, its a tougher job to balance the classes, and nerfs have the possibility to hurt a lot more.  <br>
<br>
Making a difficult situation even tougher, Mythic has no concept of what they are trying to achieve with balance.  There is no rhyme or reason to the changes they make.  They dont seem to be balancing against the ability to gain xp, and they dont seem to be balancing against the ability to gain RPs.  So what subjective criteria are they using?  What other subjective criteria is there?<br>
<br>
Anyway, my advice in a nutshell is, if you are bored with your current MMORPG, or looking to play an MMORPG to play for the first time, it cant hurt to give DAoC a spin.  The trial month can be used w/o having to pony up a CC.  If you are looking for something groundbreaking, or a company that goes above and beyond, however, DAoC/Mythic aint it.<br>

Dead on, too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think Mythic dug themselves into a hole during beta, and now it's near impossible for them to get out of it. So they end up changing things around constantly, balancing and rebalancing classes, nerfing and then attempting to make the class powerful again.<br>
<br>
Still, I think the game is in overall better shape than EQ was at the beginning. They are at least making a great attempt at calming down the &quot;no content&quot; complaints. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufadreslyblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fadre Slyblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 3:32:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DAoC</span><hr size=1> I think that Hazewire did a great job of showing the pros and cons of DAoC vs EQ.  Here are a few things I'd like to mention in addition.  I have to warn you that although I played EQ for nearly 3 years, I tried DAoC and love it.  I believe that they have fixed all the things about EQ that frustrated me.  I find it much more relaxing to play and I'm able to actually play in much more of a casual manner while still being successful in the game.  The basic concepts are similar but there are quite a few improvements that have been made and content is being added every week with a patch.  BTW, patch times are MUCH shorter than the typical 4 hour EQ patch that turns into a 6-12 hour patch.<br>
<br>
Someone brought up that it is difficult to socialize due to the unavailability of a &quot;shout&quot; channel or an &quot;auction&quot; channel.  In fact these channels do exist but only in the city zones.  Personally I find it very relaxing to not have to read the constant shouting of garbage comments while I'm trying to talk with friends, fight, etc.  I like this feature.  The socializing is not difficult either.  It is very easy to communicate via guild chat or just conversing within your group or immediate area.  Also there is a shout command however it is only heard within a certain radius - definitely not zone wide.<br>
<br>
A feature that I find very nice with DAoC is that there is no such concept as a corpse recovery.  When you die you have to option of releasing your corpse and repopping back at your bind point, or getting a rez on the spot.  In either case your possessions remain with you.  There is no chance of losing any items.  A gravestone is erected where you died and you may return to it to /pray and regain some of your lost experience.  Your spells are not lost from memory and are available for immediate use provided you have enough power (mana).  Like EQ there is no penalty for death until you reach lvl 5, or maybe lvl 6 - it's been a while since I was there.<br>
<br>
Binding is not a spell ability restricted to only certain classes.  There are certain locations throughout the game where you simply type /bind and you are bound there.  It sure makes it easier to do this than to sit at the West Freeport gate and shout for a bind for 15 mins.<br>
<br>
Horses are the main travel mode in DAoC.  Teleport doesn't exist nor is it needed.  You purchase a horse ride 5sp from a stablemaster and off you go.  It's also much more convenient than shouting for a port, etc.<br>
<br>
In essence I have found that all the things that take a long time and take time away from playing the game just don't seem to exist in DAoC.  I have very little down time and very little frustration in DAoC.  I can log on and either solo play or get a group together, or chat in guild, work on tradeskills, work on a quest or an NPC task and have fun.  I can log on and play for an hour and log off.  When I played EQ I would log on and I might be doing what I wanted an hour later after getting a port, binding, getting a group, waiting on the damn boat, etc.  <br>
<br>
But the best thing about DAoC is the graphics ROCK!  Especially the spell effects - they are awesome.  There is nothing like casting a DD spell and having a bright blue lightning bolt streak out of the sky far above the mob and cracking it in the head.  Except maybe casting a fire bolt spell and watching a flaming ball of fire impact and spray molten rock flames across your target, then as the fire dies down the mob is left smoking.<br>
<br>
Anyhow this is just my humble opinion.  <br>
<br>
Take care friends!<br>
