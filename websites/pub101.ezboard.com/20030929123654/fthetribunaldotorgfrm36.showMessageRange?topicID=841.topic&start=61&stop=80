I'm curious though, I don't think anyone has outright said it either - when do you think the &quot;lump of cells&quot; becomes a &quot;person&quot;?  Loegan seems to think its self-awareness, but I think that's foolish, as I have hopefully communicated in my last post.  If it's &quot;viability&quot;, well, we've been there too - almost anything is viable with modern technology, especially in the 3rd trimester (and even 2nd), and abortions are still performed then.  Is it birth, if so, why - what difference does it make whether that baby is still inside the womb, or outside?  Is it not the same baby, just in a different location?  Anyway, please explain for me. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 8/26/03 12:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3851<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 12:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=841.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ectogenesis</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Would a Siamese twin who kills her attached sister in order to free her body be liable for murder? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If a siamese twin died as a result of being seperated, it isn't muder. If the twin just bashed the other in the head, than it is.<br>
<br>
Just like it's the removal from the mother that causes the death of the fetus (or would if the procedure was done so as to leave the fetus in tact) and is thus not murder, if the removal of the twin caused the death, it's not murder. It is just asserting your right to use (or not use) your body as you see fit. The death is caused by your refusing to use your body, not by an act of violence.<br>
<br>
I know that abortion is an act of violence, but that is only because the fetus could not survive outside the womb anyway. If it could, than all efforts should be made to allow it to do so imo.<br>

Of course, if the procedure were an attempt to remove the fetus without harm, yet resulted in its death, that would not be murder.<br>
<br>
The point is that abortions are carried out for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>specific purpose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>killing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the fetus.<br>

Other than in partial birth abortions (which are only allowed to save the life of the mother, correct?) the fetus can not survive outside the womb. That is why it doesn't really matter what procedure is used as the fetus has no chance on it's own.<br>
<br>
-IF- the fetus does have a chance to survive on it's and is not given that chance, then yes, I would call that murder. The mother only has the right to refuse use of her body, not to kill a viable fetus.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So what would you think about a procedure in which one of the Siamese twins was simply killed in order to free the other twin of the burden of her sister?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The procedure should be done so that any chance for the twin to survive on it's own is supported. As I have said, if death results from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>refusal</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to use your body, it is not murder. But, if you do not allow the fetus/twin to survive on it's own, then it is absolutely murder in my book.<br>
<br>
You have the right to deny use of your body, but not to deny survival once you remove that support. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1514<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=841.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ectogenesis</span><hr size=1> Loegan... go google &quot;premature baby&quot; and see what you find.

Children most certainly can and are charged with murder.  They are just subject to different punishments.  So why are not fetus murders charged?  I gave you my answer.<br>
<br>
Siamese twins are both conscious entities.  A fetus is not.  How are they &quot;directly comparable&quot;?<br>
<br>
From your comments, it sounds like you'd be shocked at the extreme restrictions imposed upon 3rd tri-mester abortions.  As the fetus approaches birth, abortion becomes less and less justifiable.<br>
<br>
A lump of cells becomes a person when they are born and draw breath. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 12:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=841.topic&index=69>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ectogenesis</span><hr size=1> Siamese twins are viable forms of life at the age when they're old enough to think about killing one another, and capable of doing so.  Don't see how you can compare the two.  An unborn fetus is a lump of cells until a certain point, when it can survive outside it's mother.  I'm not saying that's not a cold way of viewing things, it is.  I'm morally opposed to abortion myself.  Even in cases of rape and incest, I'd support adoption over abortion.  That DOESN'T however make it right for me to impose my own morals on a woman.<br>
<br>
Ectogenesis is as close to an answer for appeasing both sides of the issue that I've ever heard, except for the aftertaste..  caring for all the lives that will be &quot;saved&quot; will cost a LOT.  I think it was said earlier and I agree...  all those Pro Lifers need to dig deep and give just as much as the Pro Choicers to make this option viable and affordable.  May not actually work out, but they should have this particular technology and outcome as a solid shared goal.<br>
<br>
Both sides win.  An abortion is a process no woman actually DESIRES, and it's seldom entered lightly.  My guess is that most, if not all women would willingly submit to the procedure for Ectogenesis as an alternative to abortion.  All this debate aside.. the breakthroughs in science and tech of late are amazing.<br>

Handing a 6-month fetus to the mother outside the womb, it won't survive no matter how well she cares for it.  It requires an ICU.  However, by the 7th month, WITH that medical intervention, it is nearly guaranteed to survive, and has an excellent chance at 6 months with today's technology.  <br>
<br>
At 8 months, it won't need anything at all except extra care at home.<br>
<br>
All of these are what I mean by the *fetus* surviving.  Once you want to start talking about the *infant* (&gt;9 months) surviving... well, without *some* adult involved, it won't have much chance until about 7 years old.  That certainly isn't where we'd argue life begins =P<br>

However, after birth, that adult doesn't have to be the mother.  Once the child is no longer physically dependant on the mother herself, she no longer has any say whatsoever over it.  So long as its just an outgrowth of her body (one of her egg cells gets its DNA scrambled and begins multiply out of control!), its her choice what to do about it.  <br>
<br>
Now, I interject my *personal* opinion (which does or does not have any place in discussion of any LAW, but certainly is germaine to discussing moral/ethical issues), which is to say that the fetus has a reasonably developed upper brain by about the 6th month, which can lead to the *reasonable* conclusion that it has become somewhat self-aware.  If you haven't decided to abort the pregnancy by this point, you're stuck with it, because if the fetus isn't a unique person yet, it certainly is something more than a creative growth of cells in the womb.  I stand behind disallowing third-trimester abortions except to save the mother. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 707<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 1:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=841.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/bender.jpg height=71 width=59></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ectogenesis</span><hr size=1> Wolvar,<br>

Where do we draw the line?  The answer is obvious - we draw the line where our system of government allows the line to be drawn.  The line is currently drawn favorably to those who favor allowing abortions.  Should our system of government be suitably manipulated so that it draws the line elsewhere, then so shall it be.<br>
<br>
What this means, though, is that the &quot;imposing your morals&quot; argument is meaningless.  We impose all sorts of things on everyone in the U.S. constantly... that's what laws are all about.  That's what political systems are all about.<br>
<br>
Tuwene, if self awareness is the primary determining factor of life, are we alive when we sleep?  Is someone in a coma alive - even if the chances of them coming out of it are nil?  Would a doctor be justified in simply pulling the plug - after all, he's doing nothing more than interrupting the functioning of a large biomass - there's no life there.

Hayzen,<br>
<br>
Self-awareness is where I feel the fetus has sufficiently developed to be a &quot;human being&quot; and a potential &quot;person&quot;, and not just a lump of cells. <br>
<br>
Cal,<br>
<br>
Self-awareness isn't the determining factor of &quot;life&quot;, it's what I would argue grants an individual the rights which we afford to human beings and no others.  And I've been careful NOT to say that it happens at x month or whatever - only to note that self-awareness is a higher-brain function, and that area of the brain doesn't develop until around the third trimester or so.  Draw your own conclusions from there.<br>
<br>
As for your other examples, there is no thinking that a sleeping person or a coma patient isn't possibly self-aware, or at least still fully capable of becoming so again once he/she wakes up.  Plenty of studies have been done to show that many coma patients show healthy upper-brain functions, and its extremely rare that a person in a coma has the &quot;plug pulled&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, you want to talk about being brain-dead -- no registered upper brain function (similar in state to a 2nd trimester fetus, though that doesn't mean we SHOULD kill it in this case) - then yes, I'm all for pulling the plug.  There is no hope of anything except eventually having the lump of cells attached to the feeding tube die of old age.  Just because technology CAN keep the body functioning doesn't mean it SHOULD.  If your wife/parents/child were brain dead, would you keep them on life support for as long as you could maintain payments?  I completely sympathize with the emotional attachments to that question (i share them) but from a realistic standpoint, the only way the FAMILY can gain closure is to allow the body to die and move on.  This is NOT the coma situation - just to state again :P<br>

<br>
Then some species of apes and dolphins, and other animals, should be afforded the same rights we have, right?  Because they've definitely been shown to be self-aware.<br>
<br>
Obviously just self-awareness is not sufficient criteria for determining when a being becomes a person and therefore inherits their rights. <br>

We afford rights to many others things, not just human beings.  Animals, plants, and even inanimate things such as tracts of land, rivers, and forests.<br>
