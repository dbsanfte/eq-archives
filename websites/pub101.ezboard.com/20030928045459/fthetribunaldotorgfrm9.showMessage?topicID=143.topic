I know a lot of people here will want to at least try the game out and frankly, I don't blame you. I'm going to try and be objective, but I'm going to come out and blatantly tell a certain set of people that they don't want to play this game. I'll deal with that now:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If you love the way EQ works, from the levels, to the AAs, to the Endgame bosses, as well as the crafting system, the inability for people to work all the way through without killing something, and knowing exactly how many frogloks are around the third corner in Guk... then SWG is not for you.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I should expand on that a bit more, but I hope that as you read this you will see where I'm going with that. So, without further ado, the review:<br>
<br>
Using the Gamespot way of scoring a game, I list it as the following:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Graphics</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 10<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sound</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 10<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gameplay</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 9<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Value</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 10<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tilt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 10<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Overall</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: 9.8<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Graphics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I don't have anything to post right now. I have a couple of screenies to put up but I want to get in game tomorrow morning and pump out a few more. Needless to say, I can tell you right now that the Screenshots you have seen are true to form. The game is simply <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>beautiful</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. The level of detail is second to none in any online game done to date. Couple that with the fact that as of right now, no graphics card available has the power to put every option to the max without bringing your frame rate to a crawl, and you realize this game will continue to look beautiful for years to come. Despite that, the game runs perfectly on any supported cards (go to the main wesbite for those). My wife runs a Geforce2 MX400 and it's still just as beautiful as on my machine with a Geforce4 Ti4200.<br>
<br>
Everything in the game is spot on as far as graphics go. There's even things in there that add to the immersiveness, though you can only see them if certain options get turned on. These are the little touches, like butterflies that come out of the grass as you run through a field, little centipede like bugs that crawl along the desert floor, or fishes that swim in the river. It's Also, if you can run it, the addition of volumetric shadows take the detail up to the breathtaking level. Simply gorgeous. But you need a card close to my level to run with shadows on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sound</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It’s Star Wars. From the first time you log on to create your character, and you hear the score from the final moments of The Empire Strikes Back, you realize you are here. The level of detail with the sound is there on every level. From the blaster fire, to the various scores used during combat sequences, to the background music you hear when you walk into a Cantina, all the way to the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gonk</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sound that the Power Droids make. Very well done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gameplay</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Not a 10 because at the onset, this game is hard to get the hang of. Luckily, there is a very well done tutorial that extends well into the game itself, and explains everything to you. Once you get used to how the interface works, and understand exactly what you are supposed to do, the game runs very intuitively. There are sub-levels to the gameplay which I will address here now:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Combat</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Some will tell you the combat sucks. Some will tell you it rocks. From my perspective, it’s closer to the latter. Realize that this game is an RPG and it’s going to play similar to EQ in that regards, but that the focus is more on the ranged combat aspect rather than the up close and personal battles that EQ focuses on. Not to say there aren’t any down and dirty brawls to get involved with, most creatures will fight you up close, but primarily, when you fight NPCs, they are going to be taking pot shots at you with a blaster, rather than trying the beat down with a Vibro-axe.<br>
<br>
The basics of Combat is that you engage with your target and depending on your level of expertise with that weapon you have special moves that you can apply that range from simply focusing on a specific areas of the body, to inflicting any one of the various combat states (stun, dizzy, blind, etc), to causing the equivalent of a DoT to your target. Generally speaking you just want to make your target dead, so a lot of the special moves are better off in PvP than in PvE, though there are times when causing Dizziness in your target is appropriate (randomly causes them to fall down if they move). And if you take on more than you can handle, unlike EQ where you basically have to deal with it and take the death or run to the zone, in SWG (because there are no zones) you have a /burstrun option that doubles your speed for 1 minute and has a 10 minute refresh. All Mobs (creature and NPC) have a set limit they will follow you for, so usually it’s easy to get away.<br>
<br>
SWG uses a Con system similar to EQ (actually has the same color levels) and that actually changes based upon the weapon you are using. So if you are very good with a Pistol and you see a mob that’s blue, if you switch to a weapon you aren’t good with, say your fists, then it might turn yellow or even red.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PvP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
A subset of the Combat section I will readily admit that I didn’t toy too much with the PvP aspect of this game. But I know the basics so here it goes. As we all know, there is a Galactic Civil War going on in the Star Wars universe at the time of this game. Anyone has the ability to take part within it, and being that there are no Pure PvP servers at release, this is taken care of with a PvP Switch, similar to EQ. But, it goes beyond that, because once you sign up for either the Rebels or the Imperials, you can cash in your Faction points (gained through missions, Battlefield, and general PvP) for perks, such as ranks within the two factions, uniforms and even something as big a an entire Base for your faction to work out of. These perks are limited to you based upon how you want to participate within the GCW. There are three levels of PvP within the game, 1) Those who want to do it all the time, 2) Those that want to do it some of the time, and 3) Those that don’t want to do it. Number one is considered Overt and they are always available to attack by other Overt players of the opposite faction. They have no limitations in the faction perks available to them. Number two are Covert and they can’t be attacked by anyone from the other faction unless they do something to garnish a Temporary Enemy Flat (TEF). The ways to get a TEF are simple. Basically, if you Heal an Overt, trade with an Overt, or attack NPCs from the opposing faction, you gain a five minute TEF. Covert is for Part-time PvP people and the perks available to them are limited. Number three are neutral, and the only limitation for them is the ability to heal or directly trade with an Overt faction member. Note that if they are a crafter, and they have a merchant under their hire, then the Overt people can buy from the merchant with no problems.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Battlefields</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Battlefields are essentially Arena like events where you can engage in temporary PvP or participate in the GCW with no long term repercussions. There are three flavors: PvP, Imperial PvE, and Rebel PvE. PvP is pretty straight forward. You get to a Battlefield and the game asks you which side you wish to lend your services to. If you are already aligned with a faction you get teleported to that side automatically, but if you are neutral you can choose either or. Those with faction points can buy troops and buildings to place around your base and from there it’s simple PvP combat with an objective (destroy the Power Generators).<br>
<br>
The PvE ones you come across as you to join the specific faction, and the objective is the same as the PvP battlefield except you are facing of against NPCs. Actually, that’s half as I haven’t done this part of the game much. I think there are more types of BFs out there for the PvE crowd, but I’m not sure so take these comments with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Crafting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Crafting is cool in this game because it produces the best items you can get within the game itself. That’s right, no uber loot to be had, though there are Diablo type add-ons that you can place into certain objects that take them. Most everything has a purpose within this game so you shouldn’t run across too many useless items coming from a crafter. Also, one of the greatest things about SWG and crafting is that you never even have to touch the combat portion of the game to experience it. That’s right, no more killing goblins by the score to get High Quality Ore, you simply survey for and then mine for the resources you need. <br>
<br>
Now, there are some things you have to kill in order to get certain organic materials, but if you don’t want to do it, you don’t have to, because there will be plenty of players out there doing it for you. And you can then buy the products off of them. There are several types of crafters in the game. Weaponsmiths, Armorsmiths, Droid Engineers, Chefs, Tailors, and Architects. <br>
<br>
Weaponsmiths and Armorsmiths are easy to figure out. Droid Engineers are easy as well but you may be asking yourself what a Droid does in SWG. Well droids act as traveling crafting stations as well as certain types are combat oriented and can help you out in battles.  Chefs are the ones who produce the buffs within the game. That’s right, your buffs come from food. But not to worry, the foods come in multiple charges and last for hours. Tailors make clothes and those are the things you put your Diablo-type powerups into. Architects make the various building in the game, ranging from the harvestors, to houses, to factories, to PA or Guild Halls.<br>
<br>
There is actually a sub level of crafting which makes this the keystone to the economy within the game. Crafters have the ability to experiment on their products and make them better if they use the right materials. And we’re talking better by leaps and bounds over the base product. So if a certain Pistol does 14 – 28 points of damage, if experimented with it could reach 28 – 56 or even higher. Plus, weapons have their own powerups which can make them even better. There’s much more to go into, but it’s a lot and would take a few days to cover. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Other</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
There’s an entire profession dedicated to the pure socializers out there, and that’s the Entertainer. Ever wanted to start up your own Cantina Band? Well here’s your chance. The Entertainer branches off to the Dancer, Musician, and Image Designer professions. The former two are self explanatory  but the Image Designer is a bit different. Essentially, your character is very customizable in regards to how the look, and if you wanted to you could change the appearance of your avatar even after the initial creation process. Just use an ID to change your hair color, your eye color, your hair style, markings… pretty much anything you want depending on how skilled the ID is. You could very easily simulate an aging process for your character if you wished. Musician and Dancer are cool as well, with the former being able to play a lot of iconic Star Wars music, as well as some original tunes, while the dancer dances to the beat of the tune. They also have a use within the game, taking care of certain battle wounds. A lot of people love these professions so you won’t find yourself lacking in entertainment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Value</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This game has tones of replay value. With ten planets to explore, all of them being roughly 256 square kilometers in size, numerous dungeons and five planets specifically designed to tax the resources of the advanced players, you will not find yourself running out of things to do anytime soon. There are even three Theme Parks within the game, as a bit of side diversion which allows you to meet some of the iconic characters from the original films. This includes Jabba the Hutt and his hirelings, the various Rebels ranging from Princess Leia to Luke Skywalker, and well known Imperials such as Darth Vader and even the Emporer. Of course, to access the primary characters from the films you have to run missions for their underlings but the end result is well worth it.<br>
<br>
The game itself is also a mixture of static and dynamic content. Most of it is Dynamic but more Static stuff is on the way so no worries. The greatest thing about this game is the dynamic portion, which makes sure that if you have to run from one city to another that the trip will never be the same twice. There’s dynamic mission-like Points of Interest that can spawn, ranging from saving a freeing slave from Stormtroopers, to freeing captured farmers from slaves, to helping a Bounty Hunter decide who his target is. There’s other POIs that don’t require you to interact, they basically run themselves. I ran into one that was a confrontation between Jabba’s thugs and the hirelings of his chief rival, Lady Valarian. Needless to say it was quite amusing and the NPCs went through an entire script which ended in a firefight.<br>
<br>
There are tons of things to do in this game, and frankly, if someone tells you they finished the game, then they didn’t really do much at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tilt</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I had to give this a ten because the game is very fun after you get past the any initial issues you have with the interface and the learning curve. I’ve been testing this game since early Beta 2 and it’s simply gotten more and more fun for me as the time went by. I simply cannot see myself playing any other online game ever again.<br>
<br>
The only misgivings this game has is that it was built from the ground up with vehicles in mind for a player’s primary transportation. Well, vehicles aren’t in at release though they are on the slate for a post-release feature. It will be worked on at the same time as Player Cities, another feature cut from release but coming within a few months. Player cities will make it in first, cause I believe the infrastructure is already there it just needs to be finalized and polished. Vehicles will be a bit but should be out within six months or so of release.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Conclusion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Wow, that was a mouthful. But I hope I got my point across. The game is simply awesome and will make gobs of money for both SOE and Lucasarts. However, a lot of people can and will have issues with it, especially the people who wish to transplant from other games. If you are used to another interface, then this one will seem daunting and non-intuitive. Which is different from those just picking up an MMORPG with this game, as they find it intuitive (yes, there were studies done on this during Beta). The combat system may not be deep enough. There is no Endgame (not in the EQ vein anyways). There’s a lot of places to explore, there’s a lot of things to do, and if you have a hard time deciding what to do without someone else telling you, then you will probably have a hard time adjusting to SWG.<br>
<br>
But, in the end, this game is still awesome. For those Star Wars geeks out there, this is your game. As long as you come from a clean slate (not from another Online game), as long as you don’t consider this the be-all-end-all of Online gaming, and as long as you are willing to take everything at face value, then you’ll enjoy this game. Hope to see you there.<br>

Surprisingly enough I do not have alot of good SS's most of them were to display some sort of graphics error to send in with a bug report.<br>
<br>
But I do have alot of neat shots.<br>
<br>
My only real gripes about the game are movement, and the laggy/buggy chat engine.<br>
<br>
Movement isn't true 3D. You can only move in the cardinal directions. Granted you go up and down hills, stairs etc., there are even places where you can look at things directly below you thru semi transparent floors , and catwalks and whatnot. But you cannot swim underwater, you cannot jump on top of stuff, or over stuff, or off things. Jump exists only as an animation your avatar performs, it isn't an aspect of movement. <br>
<br>
The chat engine is very shaky at times. Tells often don't work as well as groupchat and the planetary chats. There isn't really an /ooc channel like there is in EQ. Theres a shout but it only increases the range you can be heard using /say, shout isn't a seperate channel. So with the intermittant chat availabilities I often felt like I was playing a single player game. When the game is heavily lagged there is also this annoying keypress lag that makes chat extremely slow. I find myself typing things and waiting 20-30 seconds for the character string to complete. When you type 100+ words per minute, 30 second lag is HORRIBLE.<br>
<br>
<br>
The game exceeds my expectations in almost every other department tho. Graphics are incredible. Character generation/developement is great as well. There is alot of good content as well.  The galactic civil war provides a great venue for PVP, as well as aa backbone for the player economy.<br>
<br>
Its definately worth checking out. BUT I would wait until a couple of months after release. There is alot of balancing work to be done and the economy still needs to be tweaked. There are also a number of glaring stability issues that will make for a rocky first month or two for SWG. You can expect a TON of downtime and patches for the first month or longer.  I have the utmost respect for the developement team but they have alot of work to do. Personally speaking I will probably play the game upon release, but only because I have thoroughly enjoyed the actual testing process. If you don't enjoy testing games I would recommend sitting out until they iron out the kinks in the game mechanics and client stability. They were pressured for release it seems and release is for all intents and purposes is going to be beta4.<br>

I know it's generally unacceptable to paying customers for a broken product to be live, but when you're dealing with as many parts of a system that all tend to affect one thing or another, then the possibility for problems to erupt with every change are going to happen. That's why I plan on playing on Test Center once I can afford to buy the game. Maybe, just maybe, I can catch a good bug before it hits Live.<br>
<br>
Also, I think the comment about waiting a couple of months can hold true for any new MMORPG. The difference between those other games and SWG is that SWG does have content there for you to consume and there is a lot of things to do within the game that do work and are fun. So while you can wait if you want vehicles, I do reccomend you getting the game before the six month mark so that you'll have time to build your character and get some cash on hand so you can afford that nifty new speeder when they become available. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1031<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 6:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> Agreed - i just think it's unfair on the customers to push out a product in such a bad state when it wouldn't take all that long to fix. <br>

As a side note : i won't accept the complexity excuse. I'll contend that if gaming companies enforced more &quot;robust&quot; software engineering practices, they would have far less problems getting compex software like MMORPG servers off the ground. Having said that, it looks like a lot of the problems are database management related, which is not a good sign.<br>

The showstoppers (stuck characters, permadeaths, items being eaten) have all been basically stomped out - a crash to desktop here and there is nothing (EQ's been doing that in every client build since Velious' new interface).<br>
<br>
I'm more concerned about the general tuning of the game - we'll still have to see, but as of a week before release, they're still trying to decide if selling an item on the bazaar should cost 500 credits or 20.  That's a 2500% difference (and for the non-SWG players, that's also a decent amount of money now that they tuned down $$$ rewards) - and you really should have that sort of stuff figured out by now.  They've routinely been having over 7000 players online simultaneously across at least two servers which are always full - so it's not like thye haven't had full production loads and volumes.  They are still doing wild stabs at the economy when it should be at the extreme fine-tuning stage.<br>
<br>
That said, the developers are 100x better (and by better, I mean more responsive and quick to address concerns) than those for any other games I've been involved in; I have nothing but faith that they'll fix these issues in no time, and I don't see them having a rediculous launch disaster like Anarchy Online and Shadowbane did.  The chat server is probably the only REALLY risky bit of functionality - everything else works reliably enough to not piss off new players and alienate the fanbase.<br>
<br>
I think the review skews a little high, too - it's certainly not god's gift to gaming - but it *is* the first &quot;real&quot; next-generation MMORPG (AC2 fell short, and SB is so mired in technical SNAFUs that it's hard to tell if there's a next-gen game in there).  WoW and EQ2 will be fighting it out against one another when they release, but I think right now SWG stands pretty much out on its own (entirely skills-based MMORPG with PvP being a key part of the game without it being a SB-gankfest).  Oh, and a decent liscense to boot :P (saw Han Solo and Chewie in a cantina recently...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 692<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 8:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/tsukasa.jpg width=50 height=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> What is there to do in the game?

I have seen a team of Jabba's thugs and Lady Valarian's goons fight it out on Tatooine, as well as Rebels and Imperials fighting on some of the other planets. Some creatures also don't like each other and I've seen them fight it out. I think the greatest 'dynamic' aspect of the game is the Strongholds. They are a dynamic spawn, like a base, that just grows and grows over time, with no limit to the NPCs it spits out. The strongholds can even take over an entire area of the game, and it'll be up to the players to clear it out.<br>

But that requires a truly dynamic world with a rich history and lore that characters can actually have a meaningful impact on, and unfortunately nobody seems to want to go that route. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->See, to me, that's exactly the route they're aiming for with SWG.  That's why there's no levels, no restrictions on grouping, almost everything is dynamic, etc.  People working together (guilds?) could eventually build an entirely new city, which the game would then spawn NPCs for and incorporate right into the world.  Many of the professions have absolutely NOTHING to do with going out and farming mobs for exp - because there isn't just the one type of exp.  It's not like EQ where stuff you do feeds your pool of experience - rather, every action has it's own experience pool.  Want to go to a cantina and dance a bit?  You get dance exp.  Go out into the field and kill stuff?  You'll get pistol (or rifle, or carbine, or...) experience.<br>
<br>
There's no artifical limits like &quot;only people who all have &gt; 1 million pistol experience can group together&quot; (like EQ's level restrictions).  There ARE level limits on gear/items to prevent twinking, but it's more like &quot;you can't use uber_pistol_07 until you have enough pistol experience for it&quot;, which makes sense, really.  And because items wear out and need repair/replacement over time, the crafter classes are (in theory) required to keep the 40% or so of the combat players in top-quality gear.<br>
<br>
There also is no restriction on the professions you can take - if you want to be a gun maker AND a marksman, then you've just pretty well covered yourself.  You make your own weapons, and also use them.  The only thing stopping everyone from doing this would be the time invested, and the fact that the more you specialize in one area (say, becoming an absolute master gunmaker), the fewer skill points you have available for other areas.  So you CAN become a generalist, with Novice Medic, Novice Artisan, Novice Marksman, etc, but that will mean you will never have enough skill points to master any profession.  Conversely, if you run all the way up to Master Bounty Hunter, you will almost certainly not have the skill points left over to be anything other than a novice Medic.  Then some people will choose the middle-of-the-road approach, where they are decent medics and decent fighters and decent crafters, and are pretty much self-sufficient (but not masters of any of the three).  Worth noting you can ALWAYS surrender a skill to regain the skill points, so if you make master Medic, and tire of it, you could knock yourself back down to Intermediate Medic and now you have the skill points available to go become something else, as well (the only thing you don't get back is the exp you put into getting to Master Medic and the $$$ you paid for the training).<br>
<br>
The degree of interdependance means that some people WILL choose to forgo the monster-killing treadmill to become more &quot;powerful&quot;.  You want a guild hall built?  You need a few pretty specialized players to do that for you - hire an architect for one, someone to make guildhall parts for you, and assemble them... probably someone who owns a factory to get the raw components, as well.  It'll be a slow and expensive task involving a number of different specialized players you'll have to hire.. but building a new house in RL is exactly the same.  Medics and Entertainers heal wounds that CANNOT be healed in the field (think of them as permanent HP loss wounds, so your pool of mana/hp over time gets smaller until you go to a doctor in a hospital).   Doctors, of course, can then charge whatever they like to heal you.  Entertainers work only on tips, but they also have no &quot;costs&quot; (you can become a master entertainer and never spend a single credit).<br>
<br>
Overall, the economic and strategic interdependance means that there's a LOT more to do here than get a group of 6 balanced, similar-levelled players together and go kill all the ghouls that spawn in the top floor of Unrest for 7 hours.  After you gain &quot;power&quot; you may want a house (which has certain benefits) and if you and your guildmates build houses around your guildhall and &quot;grow&quot; a region up, you'll eventually get a city going.  Running/defending your city can become your endgame, or growing your guild's power/influence.  Naturally, there's the whole PvP side of the game as well - go join the Rebellion and spend your time subverting the Empire (or vice-versa).  This also confers certain perks, but with the downside of also making the game a bit riskier... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=illyanirsilveroak>IllyanirSilveroak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.jnichola.home.dixie-net.com/Untitled-1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/03 9:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> Its odd to me that the movement issue doesnt bug people in general as much as it bugs me.<br>

I mentioned it in my post.  Movement isnt true 3D. Your 3D character and 3D world objects are permenantly stuck to a 2D &quot;mat&quot;. You reach a cliff, and RUN down it, or up it for that matter. If you are on a bridge and theres a AT-ST behind you and a Rancor in front of you, you cannot jump off the brdge in hopes of escape. You HAVE to traverse the bridge. When you are in water is where this is most easily obseerved. You cannot swim under water at all, when you are swimming you swim acros the top of the water (slowly) in only the cardinal directions.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is there is NO implimented z axis in movement. This makes the game very unrealistic to me and no matter how beautiful the graphics or fun the gameplay it grates my nerves.<br>
<br>
EQ is a true 3D game. You can tell when swimming under water, or falling off a cliff, running around with SoE cast on you, fighting Cazik Thule etc. If you are climbing a winding stariway with no railing or wierd cavernous catwalks like in Sol-A, you have to be careful for fear of falling off. In Star Wars Galaxies there is NO falling NONE AT ALL. If you are on a stairwell you can go up the stairs or down the stairs, there is not an option to go over the rail.<br>
<br>
This aspect of SWG is likely to be game breaking for me, although to this point I have found enough enjoyment to see past it, every day it bugs me more than it did the day before. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Illyanir Silveroak<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Archon of the Royal Norrathian Guard<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jnichola.home.dixie-net.com/medic.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=323448" target="top">Me</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=illyanirsilveroak>IllyanirSilveroak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.jnichola.home.dixie-net.com/Untitled-1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/22/03 8:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> And furthermore during beta 2 I made a post about this on the beta boards.

Truth of the matter is, they would have to practically redesign the entire game to impliment a z-axis in movement.<br>

Is that true?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a fairly accurate statement, but terrain in general is made up of two distinct types of construct. Let me clarify. First of all you have your basic terrain mat, this is the foundation of which everthing else is built, and is just a 2D mat molded into hills valleys mountains etc. On top of this mat, there is an additional layer of terrain matting this is further definition and detail for your basic hill mountain structure, This is the &quot;ground&quot; that your character walks upon. Also this layer of matting handles flattening out areas for buildings. When you put a PA building down for example it will lower/raise all terrain at the spot you put the building down, so your construct has a level foundation. This flattening happens in the second layer of etrrain. Anything in this layer of terrain can be shot thru. Hill sides mountain tops building foundations. Line of sight isn't required. However there is one more terrain type: 3D terrain constructs, ie boulders, trees etc. These constructs fall into 2 categories, collision objects , and non collision objects. The collison objects can be used as cover , can block line of sight etc. you cannot jump on them, climb atop them, or jump over them, you must circumvent them. These objects are what SoE refers to when saying things like &quot;Use terrain to your advantage&quot; its highly misleading as evident by enzo's question.  The non collision objects, of course, you can walk thru, shoot thru etc, these can actually be turned off in your options to avoid confusion and lower graphics lag.<br>
<br>
This sort of thing leads to terrible inconsistancies in gameplay. For example, you can shoot thru the side of a mountain, but not thru the side of a tent. I can jump behind a rock the size of a basketball, and be shielded from 100% of all blaster fire coming form the other side of it. But if i have an entire hillside blocking me from view I am fair game.<br>
<br>
I played crafters alot of the time so the combat system didnt bug me that much. I imagine alot of people will be disappointed by this however. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Illyanir Silveroak<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Archon of the Royal Norrathian Guard<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jnichola.home.dixie-net.com/medic.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=323448" target="top">Me</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=felagund>Felagund</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/27/03 2:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> <br>
Too bad you guys took the information blackout so seriously.  From what I read BEFORE the blackout, I thought I might like the game.  Now that I blew 100.00 on, I come back here &amp; see this stuff &amp; am quite disappointed. <br>
<br>
Last night the wife &amp; I wasting a ton of time getting thru an extremely clunky subscription system that was bugged up from people actually buying the game &amp; trying to use it.  Wonder who the moron was that came up with the idea that you should have 6 or 7 different forms to fill out then click next....  why wasn't it done one ONE form?<br>
<br>
From the 2 minutes I had before they shut down the servers, (&amp; they are still down) it didn't appear to me that this is a TRUE 3D game.  Is this true?   <br>
<br>
I still don't know if this is a LEVEL BASED PVP game but as I browse the manual I am beginning to suspect that it is.  Can anyone please let me know?  <br>
<br>
If it turns out that what I suspect is true, I am going to be attempting to get my 100 back.    I know, lotsa luck there.  <br>

You will likely enjoy the character progression, it is time consuming,  but a breath of fresh air compared to leveling up in EQ.<br>
<br>
PVP is and integral part of the game, but on in so much as that glactic civil war provides a central spine for the game. The PVPers will be key to the player based economy, but you don't have to be one to play the game. There is crafting, entertaining etc... I played a rifleman but I didnt start PVPing until near the endd of beta. There was simply too much else for me to catch up on before I started testing PVP.<br>
<br>
All in all you will likely enjoy your time in SWG. I think it is a great game (aside from the few points I have previously covered) certainly not a waste of $100.  I will be playing but I am letting the game get settled in. I think everyone that was in beta knew how big a mess release day was going to be. So, post here what server you and Adriana decide to play on and I will drop a line when I get my copy and whatnot.<br>
