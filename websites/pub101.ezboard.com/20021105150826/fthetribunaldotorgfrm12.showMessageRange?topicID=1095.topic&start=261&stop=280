The AoW will never be wasted as their will be gains made from the fight whether it be the knowledge we gained from getting our asses handed to us or it be phat lewt.  EV stands to lose nothing at a wasted AoW, you guys have bigger and better things to kill.  SI is 6+ months behind EV, this much is true, we have not and do not plan to ever be on pace with you.  We will never be as hardcore as is needed to be on pace with the top most guilds.  This is no way means we do not have the strategies or strategists to figure things out.  If we set out to kill something it will eventually die and we do not attempt mobs beyound our capability.  Obviously on this particular day we were shorthanded, warriors as everyone has pointed out was one of our weaker areas.  I will say we do have the warriors to get the job done.  Karthunk can get 7k hp, mulberry can obtain 6.8k hp and I can reach 6.6k hp.  Also I might add that AoW was done by some guilds before Luclin loot and AA points existed.  Everything past velious has just made this encounter easier and no guild should feel violated when another guild seeks to do this mob.  <br>
<br>
As for rotations, SI was promised long ago a chance at AoW.  I am not an officer of SI and do not know all the dealings that go on, but I do know we were promised a shot.  We have never seen that chance but we did see a spawned Idol so we took things into our own hands on this day.  Work with us as we work with other guilds or do not gripe when we take chances on mobs.  I would prefer we all work together and am not in favor of the greif that all the conflicts put people through but also am not in favor of supressing a guild just because it can be done.  <br>

Wow the funniest thing about that was thats exactly what legs said about roy when you guys were waitning in ToV for them to wipe. I told you hitsory bites you in the in the ass in the wierdest ways sometimes.<br>
<br>
BTW those legs were called gimp mother fuckers for failing and asking for a clean shot at roy without a raid force waiting behind for them to wipe. Sorry guys again the Irony of this all is astounding and its killing me :P. I could probably pull some quotes from the legs thread where they said almost word for word the same things SI is saying now.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have been asking for a shot at roy and getting the run around&quot; Legs<br>
&quot;No one has asked us and your not ready for it anyway why should we give you a shot?&quot; SI<br>
<br>
&quot;We asked but our shot never materialized&quot; SI<br>
&quot;Huh? Why would anyone promise a shot to SI? Who told you that someone promised a shot to SI?&quot; EV <br>

A while back maybe a month ago Tormax and Idol were both up.  EV was heading for Idol and SI was heading for Max.  EV decided they wanted to screw SI and try to take both mobs, so EV moved their raid force to Max assuming we wouldn't attempt Idol.  When EV saw were were definetly going to attempt Idol they offerened to trade mobs and also offered us a future shot at AoW. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uadxo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ADXO</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/pi_devil.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of Illusions</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 11:32:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV's Immaturity</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

You had 30 minutes from when you popped him to pull him, we gave you all the time on that, the fact that the mob was trained on us had nothing to do with us not letting you have a shot. You dont see to understand this, you had your shot, an outside force other then EV fucked something up for you. Imagine if you will the AoW just poofed magically from a pathing error, would you blame EV for being in the zone? Knowing SI you probably would, even if we were in Ssra you would find someone to blame and whine about. <br>

There was an agreement worked out if you wiped we came in, pure and simple, we waited in the wings, giving you a clear shot, staying far enough away so that none of our people could aggro. To ask us to not be in the zone and for you waste this spawn had and when you would of wiped is insane and greedy. You would rather let something depop for a week. If this was a mob that would just reset to its spawn point, I am all with you, I can see your side, but for a mob who is on timer and a once a week spawn, this is a crazy thing to say. We were the backup, the fail safe to insure it didnt despawn and waste. It was part of the agreement, and if you dont like that agreement talk to your guildleader. <br>

<br>
I appreciate your view, and I see where you are coming from, but I refuse to let a mob we can kill despawn for the simple reason you believe wiping on him is a lesson for you. Yes it is a lesson, but when you wipe, we are there to make sure its not lost. You gained some knowledge, we gained some loot, we both came out ahead. You now know you can do idol and spawn AoW, that is an acomplishment, you also learned to ask people hunting for faction to leave, or just horrifying visage them/slay them and rez them after you win or wipe.<br>

I am sorry but this is the most ignorant statement I have read in a long time. You dont really know what the AoW drops do you? One of the best taunting weapons in the game ( wonderful for warriors ), the best monk pants outside of vex thal, the best rogue/bard mask in the game, one of the finest bows in the game, one of the best rings in the game, one of the best warrior helms in the game. To say we have nothing to lose is bascially saying we all have better loot then this, no, we are still gearing people up and putting these armors and weapons on people to help us achieve more. If we had items rotting I could understand you arguement, but even then, we could always sell the pants, I am sure Mindee wants some. We also did kill a very big thing that night, and AoW is still considered a viable source for drops. Please dont make asumptions about the needs and wants of my guild.<br>

You had your shot, reread it, we didnt steal your mob, if we did we would glady tell you we did, spit on your boots, and walk away like we have, but we are telling you, we didnt this time. How hard is it for you to understand, everytime we get accused of shit, we usually admit to like the grinning assholes we are, taking pride in tormenting people, so why is this time different? This would of been delictable to rip the AoW from you and laugh at you, but that wasnt the case. The facts are you had a shot, something went wrong, and you want to blame us. Sorry but this time, you cannot use EV as a scapegoat, if I fucked you over, I would tell you, but I didnt, so stop trying to make yourselves feel better by blaming EV.<br>

Ask Rynnia for facts if you want.<br>
<br>
Facts of the Tormax/Idol incident are:<br>
<br>
Idol was up, Raid time for EV so we head to Kael.  (Comps/EV Rotation and we were up for rotation)<br>
<br>
Guess what spawns when gathering for Idol?  TORMAX.  We move our raid force to do Tormax FIRST, because we did not have the people for AoW online yet.  If you were smart you would see the logic in this reason.  We had at least 1 group at the &quot;Tormax Gathering&quot; Area before one mother fucking SI was in the zone.  Do you know who that 1 person was?  It was Aric.  ONE SI.  UNO.  I had my cleric, Blixt, there and I witnessed everything firsthand.<br>
<br>
At this time, EV members are clearing towards Tormax from Kael Arena.  Another 6-12 EV members show up as well before the  fuckload of zerging SI arrive from Wakening Lands.  SI obviously knew we were forming for Tormax, did they back off?  No, has SI EVER backed off?  No.  Xebantiz you were a moron in Requiem back in your SolB days training EL like every day on poor innocent people and still are.<br>
<br>
This is when Rynnia said they were going to move to do Idol, to try to &quot;pay back&quot;.  This is when my respect for him went to shit, like he's trying to play some type of revenge because we had people gathered at Tormax first.  IMO, it's more of the lines of 'You take our spawn and we'll take your spawn!'<br>
<br>
Rynnia was the one who gave us the option of leaving Tormax, or I quote &quot;We will just do Idol : )&quot;<br>
<br>
So stick your head up your ass a little further, as you don't know what the fuck you're talking about<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm gettin' dizzy here!  : )<br>
<br>
Far as Max / Idol, EV went to Max we went to Idol.  No problem there, as people been wanting to try AOW for some time and we had good turnout that day.  Some 12 clerics and 7 or so warriors.<br>
<br>
I was contacted by someone in EV  dunno if it was you Valero or if I sent ya a tell because of it, wanting to know what we were after.  I mentioned we had amassed for Tormax but it looked like ya all were going for Tormax so we'd be giving the AOW a try.<br>
<br>
Aric was making decisions that day anyways, and was the one who spoke with Mojak and sorted out that you'd do AOW and we'd do Max.  I believe the day was handled without incident, and Aric said he would work something out and that Mojak had agreed, that SI would get a shot at the AOW sometime in the next few spawns.<br>
<br>
Part of this agreement included EV being present in case of failure so that the spawn was not lost.  Something I understand and agree with as well.  My suggestion, considering recent happenings, is a bit more distance between parties. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utarjman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarjman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 453<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/20/02 2:32:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV's Immaturity</span><hr size=1> I think it's funny that how everything that goes on nowadays has some relevance to the Legs in NToV.

BTW doing Idol with 2 (I think) deaths and clerics finishing with 75% mana as understaffed as we were I think demonstrates that AoW is within our capabilities. We will kill him. Soon.<br>
<br>
Darkmask, I don't think any of SI works for charities or homeless shelters or anything like that. Honestly I get paid to lie to people; I'm not the paragon of goodness in the guild or in life. But when the roleplay guild I helped found broke up, I searched for guilds whose members posessed three characteristics:<br>
Good people.<br>
Skilled players.<br>
Mature players.<br>
SI was the only guild I was interested in. Period.<br>

Do him completely unslowable, then increase Idol's difficulty by 30% and that's your AoW fight.<br>

One more prerequisite for SI to consider before they attempt the AoW again:  Make sure you get the spawn before your five minutes is up.  The time is ticking. <p>View <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130889>Tarj's Stuff</a> or view
