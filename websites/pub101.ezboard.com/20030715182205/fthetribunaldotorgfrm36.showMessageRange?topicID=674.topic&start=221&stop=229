<br>
 &quot;My judgment is that there is going to be breaking positive news in the very near future,&quot; Roberts told a Capitol Hill news conference where he joined colleagues in talking about their trip to Iraq. Roberts said scientists involved with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program are talking to the U.S. inspection team.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's classified information now- I am urging the administration and the intelligence community to make at least portions of that public,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;We've had some success; I'm sorry I can't go into detail about that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Roberts later told reporters that while the top Iraqi scientist in U.S. custody, Rihab Taha (dubbed &quot;Dr. Germ&quot;) is not being helpful, &quot;people under her are telling a different story.&quot; He said inspectors are now going through WMD documents.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are several items of real interest I think that really make a breakthrough in terms of a positive thing,&quot; said Roberts. &quot;I'd be a little careful were I overly critical about the lack of finding any WMD. You may end up with WMD and some egg on your face.&quot; <br>
<br>
 &quot;Dr. Germ&quot; was head of Iraq's biological warfare program, suggesting at least that the new information concerns germ warfare rather than nuclear or chemical weapons.<br>
<br>
At that news conference, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Virginia, noted that biological weapons are easy to hide.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very small physical quantities, a couple of gallons, can literally obliterate tens of thousands of people,&quot; said Warner. &quot;Really we want to share with you some of this material but the intelligence community can't do it because they are gaining it through human intelligence.&quot; <br>

<br>
By Walter Pincus<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer<br>
Friday, July 4, 2003; Page A20<br>
<br>
U.S. intelligence analysts lacked new, hard information about Saddam Hussein's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons after United Nations inspectors left Iraq in 1998, and so had to rely on earlier data when they concluded in months leading up to the war that those programs continued into 2003, according to preliminary findings of a CIA internal review panel.<br>
<br>
Although the post-1998 evidence was largely circumstantial or &quot;inferential&quot; because of the inspectors' absence and the lack of reliable agents inside Iraq, the panel said yesterday, the judgment that Hussein continued to have weapons of mass destruction appears justified.<br>
<br>
&quot;It would have been very hard to conclude those programs were not continuing, based on the reports being gathered in recent years about Iraqi purchases and other activities before the war,&quot; said Richard J. Kerr, a former CIA deputy director who heads the four-person review panel appointed in February by CIA Director George J. Tenet. The panel's mission, initially suggested by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, is to provide &quot;lessons learned&quot; from the Iraq war by comparing the prewar analyses and estimates to the intelligence gathered inside the country after the war.<br>
<br>
Kerr said the prewar intelligence reports given to Bush administration policymakers from the CIA, the Pentagon and State Department contained caveats and disagreements on data underlying some judgments, such as whether Hussein's nuclear program was being reconstituted. But &quot;on the whole, the analysts were pretty much on the mark,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Kerr, an analyst for most of his 32 years at the CIA, said his preliminary report is the first half of the review. President Bush justified the invasion of Iraq primarily on the argument that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States.<br>
<br>
On another controversial Iraq intelligence issue, the preliminary report indicates that although al Qaeda and Hussein had a common enemy in the United States, and there were some ties among individuals in the two camps, &quot;it was not at all clear there was any coordination or joint activities,&quot; said one individual inside the CIA who is familiar with the report.<br>
<br>
&quot;There were people talking to each other,&quot; in Iraq and other countries, the source said, &quot;but that was how Saddam kept track of what was going on&quot; in al Qaeda.<br>
<br>
In promoting the war, Bush and his top aides said there were links between al Qaeda and Iraq. They cited contacts going back 10 years and a trip to Baghdad for medical attention by one terrorist leader who had ties to Osama bin Laden and whose associates remained in the Iraqi capital.<br>
<br>
Kerr also looked into whether U.S. analysts changed their views, particularly in light of the administration's desire to gain support for going to war and questions about whether analysts were pressured to promote that cause.<br>
<br>
&quot;My instincts,&quot; Kerr said, &quot;is that they [the analysts] did not change over time.&quot; Based on his experience, he said, &quot;there nearly always are differences between people who follow terrorists and the geographic regional analysts.&quot;<br>
<br>
On the whole, he said, &quot;they were very cautious, explored things carefully and followed evidence as far as could be.&quot; Intelligence judgments are always inferential, he said, and with Iraq they were especially difficult without up-to-date hard intelligence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/03 11:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=228>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Intelligence judgments are always inferential, he said, and with Iraq they were especially difficult without up-to-date hard intelligence.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
