Upon refusal, he goes ape shit on them and does his best to make their game life and sometimes their real life a living hell. Female characters have had to leave our server because of him. He is truly a twisted fuck that our world could do without.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Ialan</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This twisted fuck will lure younger female characters into a bindable KOS area with promises of money or items. He will them start harrassing them to cyber with him, and if they reject him, he will bind them, let their invis go out, and let them go through a death cycle. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>           Hogge,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Orge Warrior.

<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>                                 Loli –</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> He is a well-known crook who has scammed on multiple occations. If you are so stupid to even let him in your group, do not be so stupid as to let him be the master looter. Also known for training. He is a highly unbalanced Frenchman who will go psycho on you. Putting him on your ignore list is a very very very very good thing.<br>
<br>

Give me details about them, as in class, level &amp; race. If I feel that they are worthy, I will add them. I also want to hear details on what they have done. I don't want you to say they are dumbfucks or assholes. I want specicicicifity.<br>
<br>
I will then delete your post. If the name has been added, then I felt he/she belonged up there. If  not, then I didn’t.<br>
<br>
If you spam this thread, I will lock it &amp; put your name up there &amp; make some shit up about you. If I get bored doing this, then I will lock it. If virgins are not sacrificed, then I will lock it.<br>
<br>
Also, a side note, I do not want this to turn into a personal grudge thread. I will not post people who you just hate, or who are clueless about their class, who have called you names, you have gotten mad at you over an arguement, or who is just retarded. This is for the true assholes of the Tribunal. THe people who scam. The people who train, the people who are intentionally malicious &amp; seek to cause harm. This is for the Jaya's, not the Jenni's.<br>
<br>
This thread is for the people that we don't know why the GMs have not permanently banned yet. <p><BR>

<br>
i was approached by someone who wanted to buy some item i was sellin in EC, they said they would trade me a FBSS that they had on their main for it (black ice sleeves maybe i forget)<br>
<br>
 of course i told them to bugger off but they insisted telling me that i should trust them (even tho my logic , that i had no reason to trust an anon newbie and they had more reason to trust me  , a high lvl member of a respected guild)<br>
<br>
so starfox logged on and said that he was said newbie and had the FBSS , to give his alt the sleeves and they were mine<br>
<br>
i told him to take his scam somewhere else and he left me alone... btw havent seen him online since this happend so it may be a pointless addition anyway<br>

i think i member naldara saying she had trouble with this guy too anyhoo<br>

Never posted here and this is my 1st time here also. Just a couple of peeps to add if you would for trying the old &quot;it's on my main , give me the money and I'll log him&quot; scam.<br>
I was in EC Tunnel trying to buy cobalt armor. I get a tell from<br>
Doldeck saying I have a bracer and helm. I said ok how much? He said 8k for both, naturally I said ok. Then he wanted me to give him the plat and he would log his main , Bendhuin said he was in Remnants. This is not a knock at Rems either. I asked him to log his main, Bendhuin on and let me see the items. Never heard from him again. 5 hours later Doldeck is on line again I ask him why he never logged Bendhuin on. He said it was his brother trying to scam peeps out of stuff like he allways does, I took a screenshot of that reply also. When I asked him why he would log on to play a char he knows is known for scamming no more replies. My guild Forsaken Lords was started by old Rem's members a few remembered Bendhuin and said that they thought he wasn't on-line anymore. So I did a /w all Remnants and started talking to a current member and she said nobody on atm knows him and that they all thought he wasn't on-line anymore also.... I was scammed before for a lsoee before it got nerfed and pretty sure it was this guy also, name sounds the same but can't find my list of his alts atm........The next guy was in EC Tunnel and scammed a iksar regen BP from icsee or iscee don't remember which way it was spelled. The scammer was Kandour said he was a alt for a 49 warrior named Munching.. He also tried the scam on me when I auctioned WTB COBALT ARMOR said he had a helm for 3k on his main named Munching I asked him to log his main and he never came back, thats when I saw a /ooc anyone know Kandour. So I asked the guy if he got scammed by him he said yes, that was the iksar regen bp guy named icsee or iscee. Anyways thats all I got.

Hello all, I heard recently about people saying my name is clang.  And people saying they hear it from Flameboard, which I don't read much until someone told me.  I only use this site just to sell items.  But people saying that I associate with lovelily or loveseeker or aka Clangeddins.  Please people I am not Clangeddins or who ever is he.  I play this game for the fun of it and I earn all my item on myself.  I just help others in game no matter who they are I enjoy playing this game.  And I will always enjoy it.  People using shout or ooc about me being Clangeddins I have no clue who is it or where he's from.  People can say a lot of stuff in ooc and shout u can say that you are someone and make people to believe it.  But can they really proof I am him (Clangeddins?) or anyothers people?  Yes You can do screenshot and stuff but you can't really proof nothing about that since I don't know nothing about this guy name Clangeddins.  Like I can put a screenshot of someone is someone but that really proof nothing.  Plus I have never even met or seen this guy name Clangeddins.  Please leave me out of this thing.  I help people when needed.  I play for the game for the fun of it.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day and Lovelily is a whore.<br>

<br>
Goun, druid of somesort, not sure if his char was ultimately banned or not, haven't seen him around in a longtime.<br>
<br>
Story goes back this past September.  Long story, making it as short as possible is as follows.<br>
<br>
I've played EQ for nearly three years now, but this past September I started first year university, so I decided that a break from eq for the year was in order.  I left the account password unchanged, a few guildies knew it.  They started playing Oag on and off, whenever the guild needed an extra tanke etc, which was aok with me.  At some point, I don't really know when, Goun started playing Oagagak primarily.  Oagagak is my 60 war fyi.<br>
<br>
For a while he played Oag without incident.  He even got me a few SS pieces while I was away.  Around October or November I got a frantic email from Laotzu asking wtf was going on with Oag.  Obviously I had no clue what was going on.  Turned out that Freizagin, Goun's friend, who at the time was in the guild, told Laotzu that Goun was attempting to transfer all droppable schiznit from Oagagak to one of his own mules.  Oagagak was only seen online a couple more times thereafter, Laotzu frantically tried to talk some sense into Goun, but Goun insisted that it was now his char and he could do whatever he wanted with Oagagak.<br>
<br>
Anywho, Goun changed the account password so I had to email verant and give them the account key and get a new password.<br>
<br>
When I logged onto Oagagak all my droppable equip was gone.  This includes (remember this was over 6 months ago when this stuff was half decent):<br>
<br>
CoF, CoS, Fungi tunic, Cobalt BP, Incardine BP, Tantor's Tusk, Frostbringer, Red Scale, full set of resist gear, Glimmering mithril torque, Idol of the Thorned, Cobalt Vambs, Heiro Cloak and a whole wack of other minor stuff.<br>
<br>
Some of the stuff was sold off to Dinars... some of it I haven't a clue.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you've all heard it before, I sure have.  Another example of what happens when you share your account info.<br>
<br>
Anywho... that's my story, I hope you all are duley impressed. <p>Oagagak<br>

Lied to me about it when I found out said he didn't, then confessed 10 mins later...<br>

How do you &quot;get Lucky&quot; with a Station name AND password?<br>
<br>
You must be friends with him of some kind because the randomeness of Station names/passwords are too vast.<br>
<br>
Explain more please, If account was hacked that is one thing but if he had information from somone else he is still a shit bird but at leaste we all know how the information was obtained.<br>
