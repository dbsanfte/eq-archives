<br>
The claim that Iraq is building technology to harm American citizens is simply ludicrous.  What I find even more insulting is the arrogant attitude of the West that tries to keep monopoly on nuclear power by using bully tactics to keep every country with nuclear capability (that is not allied to the West) in perpetual poverty and disintegration.  Iraq is a sovereign country and has every right to wield nuclear weapons, as much right as U.S. or U.K. or Israel does.<br>
<br>
I find the sanctions, the No-Fly zones and the constant demands on Iraq, an insult to the sovereignity of that country.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that Iraq does not manufacture WMD's specifically to target American people, if it is manufacturing them, it is manufacturing them to defend itself.<br>
<br>
And defending oneself is a right that every country should have, regardless of creed, race or ideology.<br>

He is fully capable, and has in the past use such weapons against civilians inside Iraq to defend his position of power.  His only concearn for the country is how it relates to his power.  And as long as he sits there in the middle east, he cannot be allowed to pose a threat to a large hunk of the worlds oil supply.<br>

<br>
China and Russia are part of the west now?   The west has not had a monopoly on WMD since the USSR tested thier first bomb.  There was a damn good reason for non-proliferation policiea of ALL the nuclear nations.  The very existence of nuclear weapons in particular are a threat to everyone.  Once the genie was out of the bottle it was hard to put it back in but as long as the players were limited in number and there was a balnce, thier use was unlikely (though human judgement errors NEARLY blew that out of the water in the cuban missile crisis).  Was it fair?  No but very little is in international law, those with the power have always wielded more influence.  That is why ALL the players, not just the west in the nuclear club, bent over backwards to stop the proliferation of said weapons.   Personally I think the non-proliferation attempts are getting overwhelmed, it might be time to move onto a different method of controlling these weapons. <br>
<br>
Isreal's nuclear weapons were acquired in a odd way.  They did not build the tell-tale fuel making installations because they stole the bomb grade material outright and did not have to.  The other parts of the bomb making apparatus are far easier to disguise.  It is thought the fuel was stolen mostly from the US but there is no hard proof(though there is evidence that there was a partnership with S. Africa and some fuel may have been acquired that way).  In 50 years the US has lost track of enough bomb grade material to build a handful of nuclear bombs.  The US did not help Isreal build its bombs (though there is some argument that we did not persue the stolen materials as vigorously as we could have) and we are not particularly happy about them haveing them.  But till Isreal either uses one or rolls one out and says &quot;Hey look we got a big bomb&quot; ther is little that can be done since there is almost no direct evidence of there existence.  <br>
<br>
That all being said, I believe that non=proliferations use as a tool in controlling WMD's is at a end.  It is time for a new method. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
I would say that Russia is pretty damn close to the West now.  I'm surprised myself at how cozy U.S. and Russia became in a matter of a decade.  As for China, lets just say that China filled the vacuum of power that was left by USSR.  China is a formidable foe and U.S. is afraid to antagonize them.<br>
<br>
But take a look at the small countries who are developing and/or testing nuclear weapons.  Iraq, Pakistan, India, N. Korea - they are constantly being antagonized by U.S. because they dont want them to have nuclear power - yet they feel completely comfortable in imposing sanctions, arbitrary restrictions and demands on them simply because the nuclear arsenal of those countries is currently unable to be delivered on U.S. soil.<br>
<br>
Its not only a matter of having nukes, its having the capacity to deliver them halfway across the world that is important.<br>

I am saying that every country should be able to produce whatever weapons they wish, to defend themselves and their sovereignity.  For someone who lives in America, I'm surprised that it is such a difficult concept for you to grasp: Treat others as you wish to be treated.  If you are afraid of the consequences of Iraq having a nuclear weapon - then perhaps you should rethink your foreign policy towards Iraq and relate/negotiate to them on equal terms - rather than destroying them through economic sanctions and antagonizing them with the No-Fly zones and insulting demands.<br>

It's not only logical, more importantly, it is just.  U.S. has no right to tell sovereign countries what weapons they can and cannot be producing and using force as an intimidation tool.<br>

Poor American media.  Cry me a river here.  U.S. gets unprecedented support across the world not because the supporters think that the cause is just, but because they are afraid of American wrath if they dont support U.S.  And there is genuinely something wrong with that, for a country that is constantly trumpeting freedom, democracy, etc.<br>

Unlike you, I can see the unabashed hypocricy in this War on Terrorism, the injustice of U.S. actions and the gross violations of the rights of a sovereign country. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeron>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 755<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/25/02 6:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=50>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> What exactly makes you think Iraq will be negotiated with?

But I digress.  It is amusing that the Christian extremists are allowed free reign, yet everyone points fingers at the Muslim extremists and paints them as some frothing-at-the-mouth psychopaths.<br>
<br>
This might be quite a stretch for you - but ever considered negotiating with them as equals?  No?  Well, it would be a good place to start.  You can't keep bullying them forever and September 11th should have been the catalyst to start bridging the gap between Islam and Christianity, rather than using it as a bugle call to start a new era of hostilities.  It is amazing that you people think that you can keep imposing your will upon Middle East indefinitely<br>

The acknowledgement of mutual nuclear destruction has been a detrrent for over 50 years - and it can continue to function well as it has during the Cold War.  Islam as a religion, does not advocate the destruction of Christianity, it is a peaceful religion that was based on Christianity.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/25/02 11:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Merton... by using terrorism against us, they have in one blow made it utterly impossible to negotiate with them.

Not really an argument merton, I honestly want to hear your opinion on these two questions.<br>
<br>
1.) Do you belive what has been done to Iraq is only justice for them taking the sovereignty of another nation? Iraq Atacked kuwaite after all. We did not just point to it on a map and decide to start a war/ Place sanctions on them for the hell of it.<br>
<br>
Of course many think they have already paid their dues, And been punished far too long for what they did. However, The same leader is still in power, Why should we trust him not to atack another country again. Why should we respect his sovreignty if he does not wish to respect other nations? Some people say it is our right, we did win the war. Others say no one has the right to control another people, which I can relate too.<br>
<br>
I understand there is more then just suddam in this picture, His people will also suffer. Its not an easy call by any means, But I am curious as to what you think we should do?<br>

If anything, by using terrorism - they have opened the lines for negotiation.  They have shown that they will not be bullied around by the West as they have been for decades.  They have demonstrated that they are not without teeth and should be treated as equals.  Their demands are very reasonable - the primary demand of the Islam world is for the West to stop interfering in their affairs.  The Great Satan, infidels, Jihad nonsense is just that: nonsense.  Nonsense that is used to trumpet up support.  I don't think it is unreasonable at all for the West to stop meddling in their business.<br>
<br>
How do you expect them to negotiate with the West on just terms when the West is constantly imposing their will upon them through military threats.  Any given country in the Middle East has no hope holding its own against U.S. in a conventional war.  So how do you expect them to negotiate while the hammer of U.S. military is constantly looming over their heads, making threats, making demands.<br>

YOU ARE THE AGGRESSORS!  Who is threatening to attack whom!?  You have been the aggressors for over 50 years in the Middle East!  When was the last time you have seen France, U.K., Germany or any other major Western country attacked by Muslim terrorists?  Now ask yourselves the question of whether those countries interfere in Middle Eastern affairs of their own volition.<br>
<br>
<br>
This whole Iraq charade has reached the point of utter ridiculousness.  It is an expected tangent of the War on Terrorism.  The WoT needs to be kept going in Bush's mind because as long as it does, the people of U.S. will be more inclined to put up with the bullshit of the Bush administration (Does anyone seriously think that the USA Patriot Bill could have been passed in the peacetime?).  So after the expected romp through Afghanistan, where to next?  Well, U.S. can keep pursuing Al-Qaeda and Bin laden (notice that media and the administration no longer even mention Bin laden and Al-Qaeda) but the victories in that are not clear cut and far fewer in between.  Chasing Al-Qaeda and Bin laden after the Afghanistan campaign would have proved detrimental to the Bush administration in terms of popular support.<br>
<br>
Think about it, Iraq isn't behind the 9/11 attacks, it had nothing to do with 9/11.  Saddam Hussein hates Osama Bin laden, but who is the next best target if Bin Laden is too slick for the CIA and the NSA?  Saddam of course, the favorite bad guy of the 1990's.  It is such a translucent joke.<br>

If my memory serves me correctly, Kuwait pleaded to U.N. for assistance after being invaded.  Bush certainly took the call not out of the humanitarian reasons, but certainly because of oil and in hopes that the war would boost the stagnant economy in '91.  The correct course of action that would have been in the best interests of U.S. was to negotiate and abstain from armed conflict.<br>

If you feel so uncomfortable with him as the leader of Iraq, why did you not remove him when you had the chance?  Keeping a country and its people impoverished for over a decade is hardly a solution to your problem.  It obviously didn't stop him from trying to rebuild a defense force.<br>

Why should he respect your opinion on sovereignity when U.S. has the most violations of sovereignity than any other nation in the 20th century with the possible exception of Nazi Germany?

Of course he can be reasoned with.  He's not the evil madman dictator ruiding around on a camel as the Western media would have you believe.

I mean, they opened our eyes to how horrible we are by killing 2000+ innocent people.  Let's also thank Tim McVeigh for blowing up the government building, opening the path for communication.  I wish more terrorists would kill thousands of Americans when they don't get what they want.  This world would be a much happier and better place.  In fact, I think that anytime a country doesn't agree with us, like Iraq not agreeing with us when we said they can't go into Kuwait and slaughter people so that they could own the land, that country should send suicide missions to kill thousands of Americans.  Let's help make the world a better place by siding with terrorists!  Oh and btw.. forgive me for throwing out the 2000 year number.  I could have taken a moment to do the math and figure out that Mohammedanism is considered to have begun in the year 612, making the religion 1390 years old, and since the first set of Crusades began in around 1095, that would make the holy war 907 years old in the opinion of many people.  In retrospect I'd say I likely should have said the war was going on for 1000 years, not 2000, that way you could have looked like even more anal by saying &quot;It's not 1000!  It's 907!&quot;  Regardless, the point I was trying to make is that this is hundreds of years old, and won't be going away by saying &quot;Can't we all just get along?!&quot;  Some people just don't want to. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.
