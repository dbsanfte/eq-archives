<br>
In fact, there are so many erronous things in that report that I wonder if the reporter who made a living making up stories had something to do with it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>BAGHDAD -- The group directing all known U.S. search efforts for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is winding down operations without finding proof that President Saddam Hussein kept clandestine stocks of outlawed arms, according to participants.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Pure Bullshit, the group directing all known U.S search efforts is USCENTCOM, delegated to CFLCC.  From there the effort is spread out to Task Force 20, SOF, V Corps and the Marines depending upon the district that is being searched.  Depending upon initial results, one of the mobile exploitation teams is called in.  The article mentions there are four of these, there are over a dozen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The 75th Exploitation Task Force, as the group is formally known, has been described from the start as the principal component of the U.S. plan to discover and display forbidden Iraqi weapons<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Funny how they don't mention who described it like that, but Task Force 75's primary responsibility was to counter any WMD attack during the conflict, thus them being decommisioned.  That threat is over, any searching they did was entirely secondary, probably born out of boredom.  I can go through and pick apart the rest of the col's statements if you would like, but there is little point seeing as the premise of this part of the article is entirely wrong.  But, I should point this out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>McPhee, an artillery brigade commander from Oklahoma who was assigned to the task force five months ago<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
and<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Short and powerfully built, McPhee has spent his adult life as a combat officer. He calls his soldiers &quot;bubbas&quot; and worries about their mail. &quot;It ain't good&quot; that suspect sites are unprotected, he said, but he refused to criticize fighting units who left evidence unguarded.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So here we have almost an entire article, quoting, not an intel person, not a WMD person, but a combat arms person?  A person who specializes in putting rounds down range?  Somehow that just doesn't fit with the description they give of TF 75 being in charge of all WMD search in Iraq does it?  Maybe it is just me, but that just doesn't make much sense.  I have to give him some credit, at least he let them use his name.  Probably shouldn't have told them what he does for a living through!  It is nice to know that he worries about his troops mail though, that is important information that really helps lend weight to his information.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Stephen A. Cambone, undersecretary of defense for intelligence, told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday that U.S. forces had surveyed only 70 of the roughly 600 potential weapons facilities on the &quot;integrated master site list&quot; prepared by U.S. intelligence agencies before the war.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is partially correct, the critical sites list is about 600, the master list is the number I mentioned. But isn't it funny that they are shutting down the operation after only 70 of the 600 critical sites being surveyed?  That should sound some bullshit alarms even for you Loegan.  This same article is saying how useless the search is, and at the same time saying that US forces are about 10% done searching just the critical sites?  I like reporters!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>who asked not to be identified<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That makes him somehow more reliable in your world than the arty light bird who is for some reason in charge of finding all the WMD in iraq right?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My personal feeling is we waited too long and stayed too far back,&quot; said Christopher Kowal, an expert in computer forensics who worked for Mobile Exploitation Team Charlie until last week.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Its good to know the opinion of the guy who has no idea what he is doing other than working on computers.  It probably holds alot of weight.<br>
<br>
(skipping a few stupid areas here, with more unidentified random people giving their opinions, let me know if you want them covered!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>soldiers under the Army's V Corps command had secured only 44 of the 85 top potential weapons sites in the Baghdad area and 153 of the 372 considered most important to rebuilding Iraq's government and economy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Says who?  Is this sorta like the fact that 140,000 items were stolen from the Iraqi museum?  Right up until the time they actually went to the museum and talked to the curators and found out it was closer to 42?  At least they didn't make up another person who asked not to be identified.  <br>
<br>
<br>
You should try to read the articles before you post them Loegan.  Sometimes a little bit of logic and going huh?, can really help you figure out some of the problems with an article.  <br>
<br>
<br>
And since I despise people that ask to be unidentified, I will tell you how I know what I post (not my name though, I don't trust you fuckers that much)!  <br>
<br>
As I am sure you noticed from my last dozen or so posts I am in the Army, I am in fact, in intel, I am stationed at CENTCOM, and I was in Qatar at CENTCOM headquarters from Jan-early May for the war, now I am back in tampa at the HQ here.  <br>
<br>
I can tell you the one lesson that just about every person learned while we were over there.  The news is 99% bullshit.  Just think about the coverage you saw of the war, of the &quot;experts&quot; that you saw on all of the news channels.  All retired military, who quite honestly have no real idea what is going on in Iraq, but present their opinion as factual news.  And that is honestly the biggest problem I see with our media now days.  Opinion is not fucking fact.  The media is so desperate to break the story first, to be the one that can put breaking news on their screen to get people watching, that they will report anything, but somehow forget to report the retractions when they are wrong.<br>
<br>
How many times did you see people on TV dismayed over the lose of all of the effects that were in the Iraqi National Museum?  How many of those reporters went to the museum to interview the curators?  I bet if any of them had, they would have found out that 99% of the items in that museum were stored in safes and the Baghdad central bank vault as well as a few other undisclosed locations for the most valuable items.  If they had bothered to ask the curators of the museum, they would have found out that there are about 42 whole items missing.  But tell me, how many of the news channels have you heard reporting that the stuff is safe?  Any?  <br>

<br>
Loegan/Sashanna/Makino/Cyricus...<br>
<br>
How many of you believe that Saddam Hussien did once hold WMD, used them in a dispicable manner in violation of certain conventions of war, and believe that if he did possess them would use them again?<br>
<br>
Pretty sure you can all say yes to that.<br>
<br>
Which of the 4 of you will deny that in the 11 years since the Gulf War he has repeatedly tried to hide the fact that he was still working on them, or at the very least violated the sanctions put in place at the end of the Gulf War by thwarting the efforts of UN Inspectors as they attempted to enforce those sanctions.<br>
<br>
Pretty sure none of the 4 of you can or will dispute that.<br>
<br>
Now tell me how it is utterly incomprehensible to you that whatever WMD he had could have been taken out to the middle of the desert, buried, burned, or smuggled out of the country to an Arab ally friendly to his cause.  After all, he had PLENTY of time to hide, destroy, or otherwise get rid of whatever it was he did have.<br>
<br>
Can you disagree with that?<br>
<br>
I am in total agreement that this war was started with the premise that he had chemical weapons, and something like this needs to be justified at some point in time.  <br>
<br>
See the difference is, I don't hate the US.  You do.<br>
<br>
I am actually willing to give them the benefit of the doubt in the event that these items are never found.  It is quite possible that they were there, but when he heard the footsteps of 200,000 American soldiers, he got rid of them as fast as he could.  Is it not?<br>
<br>
You have given the US a hell of alot less time then you claim the UN inspectors should have been given.  And let's face it...they were never going to find anything...they are not 'inspectors' like as in a detective or something...they are Bean Counters.  They visit certain sites, almost always having thier visits either announced or allowing themselves to be impeded long enough for anything contraband to be removed from the premesis.<br>
<br>
In that light they almost had an advantage over the people scouring the countryside for the US at the moment.  At least the UN inspectors were not respected enough by the Iraqi's to even bother hiding the shit until they were at thier doorstep, whereas now anyone sitting in Iraq with a stockpile of WMD has either destroyed or concealed it to the best of his ability...long before anyone found it.<br>
<br>
And no it's not a historical shift in the reasoning of the war.  The end does justify the means when you consider the 2 countries involved.  We may have proof someday, we may never.  Oh well...the end result of the war was still a good thing (in my opinion anyways, i could later be proven wrong)<br>
<br>
It's blatantly obvious that Merton, Loegan, Sahshanna, Makino, Cyricus, and a few others here have issues with the US other than the dealings of this war.  And I consider it just a little small minded to corral all of your misgivings into this.  Maybe it does give you the right to refuse the US the benefit of the doubt, however you have to remember that the US is still searching, and probably won't stop until they find it.<br>

I believe he had them during the war with Iran and I believe he used them against Iranians. I also believe that during some of those attacks that civilians were caught in the crossfire. The tales of hundreds of thousands being killed have been refuted by the CIA who claim that most of the people simply left to aviod the battle and a more accurate number of casualties was in the 30k range.<br>
<br>
The big problem I have is that while we were arming Saddam with chemical precursors and conventional weapons... while we were supplying him with satellite intel and giving him the benefit of CIA advisors... during that time we were also arming Iran. To me this is far more evil than what Saddam did. Saddam may have been brutal ans gassed his enemies, but we played Iran and Iraq against each other to keep them both weak.<br>
<br>
Who is worse - the man who fights his enemy and wins by any means necessary or the person behind the curtain who pulls the strings and plays both sides against each other for their own purposes? At least Saddam was honest in his efforts.<br>

For one, the inspectors were pulled out - not thrown out. For two - we used the inspections program to spy on Iraq. Maybe if we had used the program for the purpose it was designed for, things wouldn't have gotten so fucked up.<br>

Sure, if our people had not said they had concrete proof. They said they had sources that they couldn't share and that was the reason they couldn't help the UN inspectors do their job. The truth as we now can pretty much see is that we had no more idea of WMD than the UN inspectors did.<br>
<br>
You really buy that story that they destroyed the CW on the eve of war? I heard a guy on Fox saying that all those fires in Baghdad that were orginally thought to be oil in the trenches burning were actually them disposing of their CWs. Give me a fuckin break - like the gas produced from the burning wouldn't have killed anyone breathing it? Like it would leave no detectable trace?<br>
<br>
If they had WMD and it was obvious they were going to lose, why didn't they use the WMD? I have heard right wingers saying that his generals wouldn't obey the order to use it. Fine, but did those same generals cause it to disappear without a trace? Yeah, right.<br>
<br>
Or they tell you that they moved the weapons to Syria... but of course we couldn't see the huge convoys of trailer trucks taking them there... but we could see all the WMD he had before we eneterd the country... saw enough that Bush and Powell said they had concrete evidence. Funny how our intelligence is so powerful when it suits our purposes but it is so flawed when it makes a good excuse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am in total agreement that this war was started with the premise that he had chemical weapons, and something like this needs to be justified at some point in time. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
At some point in time? This was such an imminent threat that we had to go to war before the UN inspectors could complete their job, but after a month we haven't found didley squat? Just how imminent was that threat?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>See the difference is, I don't hate the US. You do.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I don't hate the US, I hate Bush. I hate the idealogy he stands for. I hate the arrogance he employs in his foreign affairs. I despise the fact that he has completely squandered the huge cache of goodwill we obtained after 9/11. I hate the fact that he feels the US answers to no one. I hate that he has pushed the enviromental laws back decades. I hate that he used fear and pressure to get the Patriot Act passed. I hate that he used 9/11 and false threats to get support for a war that was not necessary.<br>
<br>
I love my country and I approved of the direction we took under Clinton. I respected Bush Sr and backed him 100% on Desert Storm. I liked Reagan though I disagreed with him on the economy and I hated his lies put out to change public opinion.<br>
<br>
But none of the wrongs these presidents commited comes close to the damage done under this president. Between our relations with other nations and the implementation of a pre-emptive strike policy based on what people might do, he has fucked us over in ways that will become more and more obvious as time goes on.<br>
<br>
I am not anti-American... if I was I would love Bush as he is OBLs dream recruiter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>but when he heard the footsteps of 200,000 American soldiers, he got rid of them as fast as he could. Is it not?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, right. He knew the end was near so he did us a favor by destroying his weapons and then magically caused them to not leave a trace where they were destroyed. Neat trick.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You have given the US a hell of alot less time then you claim the UN inspectors should have been given.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
NO SHIT. <br>
<br>
A. It's harder to do inspections without far less men and fettered access than it is with thousands of men and unfettered access.<br>
<br>
B. They said they had intelligence proving Saddam had WMD. They knew he had them but they didn't know where? Bushit. They claimed to not be able to the UN inspectors where because it would burn their sources.<br>
<br>
So WTF is the WMD we knew about?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It's blatantly obvious that Merton, Loegan, Sahshanna, Makino, Cyricus, and a few others here have issues with the US other than the dealings of this war.

<br>
If they had said &quot;we suspect Saddam was WMD, but we don't know where&quot; then this war would have never been supported, so they took it to the next level and claimed that they had the intelligence, that they wouldn't share it because it would burn their sources and we are going to war because our intelligence says it's an imminent threat that needs to be neutralized immediatly to save US lives.<br>
<br>
And now we are the bad guys because we won't just forget what this war was based on and the reason given for defying the UN and world opinion? Not having amnesia is un-American?<br>
<br>
The facts are that Bush did not make his case for immediate military action based on human rights violation or suspicions - he made it clear that we were going to war because Saddam was in violation of UN sanctions by possesing WMD. Now he wants us to forget those claims and approve his actions because Saddam was a bad guy.<br>
<br>
This is like a cop getting a search warrent based on false statements and then afterwards calling the judge pro-crime for throwing the case out when the false statements are brought to light.<br>
<br>
It is not anti-American to demand the proof this administration promised before going in. Saddam being a bad guy does not absolve Bush of making false claims as Saddam was a bad guy before we went in and that was not the reason given. <p><br><br><br>

Memo To: Karl Rove, President’s political counselor<br>
From: Jude Wanniski<br>
Re: Saddam Did Not Gas the Kurds<br>
 <br>
(portions snipped for brevity)<br>
<br>
Go to Amazon.com, Karl, and look for the author Stephen Pelletiere. His book is entitled Iraq and the International Oil System: Why America Went to War in the Gulf, published in 2001 by Praeger. It is $70 and worth the money. Pelletiere is also the author of the 1990 report I have previously cited that exonerated Iraq from the gassing at Halabja. It is listed by Amazon but is &quot;out of print.&quot; I believe it was the report Jim Baker cited with Tariq Aziz in their 1990 Geneva meeting, telling Aziz he did not believe the story of Iraq gassing the Kurds.<br>
<br>
Pelletiere is retired at age 70 and living in central Pennsylvania. He is a Ph.D. in political science and was the chief of the CIA Iraq desk at Langley in the 1980s. He left the CIA in 1987 to become a lecturer at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., and was sent in 1988 to investigate Halabja. He based his conclusions that the &quot;several hundred Kurds&quot; who died at Halabja must have been killed by Iranians, because the deaths were caused by cyanide gas, which Iraq had not used in the war against Iran (they used mustard gas), and which, says Pelletiere, they had no ability to produce. He says the Iranians blamed the deaths on the Iraqis and won the public-relations war that followed, even though journalists at Halabja could see the symptoms being caused by cyanide gas. In his new book, Pelletiere again addresses the question of the alleged gassing later in 1988, which Secretary of State George Shultz at the time said resulted in the deaths of 100,000 Kurds. Pelletiere argues that story was a complete fabrication, and that to this day no bodies were ever found. His account is consistent with the account of the Iraqi government, but as time goes on, the Shultz account still winds up being accepted by our press corps.... and our President. <br>
<br>
I’ll return to this issue again and again, Karl, until the President and Vice President give some indication they have been correctly informed on it. Following is Dr. Pelletiere’s brief account of Halabja. I spoke to him last week by telephone and he told me: “You are on solid ground in saying Saddam did not gas his own people.”<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HALABJA<br>
<br>
On March 16, 1988, at Halabja, an Iraqi Kurdish city near Baghdad, the Iraqis and the Iranians both used gas. The Iranians, it seemed, had come to see the advantages of chemical warfare under circumstances advantageous to them - not mustard gas, the persistent agent that the Iraqis used, but non-persistent forms that disorient the enemy but then are quickly dissipated, allowing the human wave attacks to pour through.<br>
<br>
At Halabja the action developed like this. The rebel Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani, facilitated the introduction of Iranian forces into Halabja by night so that the Iraqi commander was unaware of the penetration. In the morning, the Iranians burst from hiding, overwhelmed the Iraqi garrison, and drove it from the city.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi commander, in an attempt to regain possession, called in a chemical barrage (of mustard gas). This had the effect of disconcerting the Iranians, which allowed the Iraqis to regain possession. The Iranians now sprang their surprise, as they dumped a blood agent on the reoccupying Iraqis. <br>
<br>
Mustard gas from the Iraqi side, cyanide-based gas from the Iranian side -- and the citizens of Halabja caught in the middle. Several hundred Kurdish civilians were killed during these successive attacks. <br>
<br>
However, when the Iranians took back the city, they photographed the dead Kurds and subsequently publicized the deaths, making out that Iraqi gas had killed the civilians and denying that they had used gas as well.<br>
<br>
Reporters let into the city to inspect the devastation noted, however, that most of the dead Kurds were blue in their extremities, implying that they had been killed by a blood agent, a chemical that Iraq did not use and, at this time, lacked the capacity to produce. This fact was noted in the press accounts and also by officials of several nongovernmental agencies called to inspect the scene.<br>
<br>
Later, the U.S. government confirmed the fact that both sides had used gas and averred that, in all likelihood, Iranian gas killed the Kurds; however, this new information was not revealed until 1990, so the impression remained in the public mind that the Iraqis alone were responsible for the gassings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On the Jim Lehrer News Hour Monday night, you repeated the assertion that Saddam Hussein &quot;gassed his own people.&quot; As the President’s National Security Advisor, I had assumed you of all people would not make such assertions without having supporting evidence. Early this year, on the supposition that the Iraqi situation would blow up again, I made serious inquiries about this charge. On April 7, I sent the following memo to Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If you have better information, Mr. Berger, I hope you can supply it, as this is the most serious of all charges made against Saddam Hussein. The Iraqis readily acknowledge using chemical weapons against Iran a few times late in the war, but using such weapons in wartime is not nearly as serious as &quot;gassing his own people.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
To Senator Helms:<br>
<br>
I continue to make inquiry into the situation in Iraq, as it is likely to brew up into another crisis one of these days when the United Nations has no choice but to conclude that Iraq is not hiding any weapons of mass destruction -- or if they are, they are so well hidden that nobody is going to find them. As you know, I’m sure, the warhawks in the United States will continue to insist that the embargo remain in place no matter what, and there will be assertions from around the world that we have not been acting in good faith. As you also know, I believe there are serious questions regarding our behavior toward Iraq that go back further. You would agree, I think, that at the very least our State Department gave a &quot;green light&quot; to Saddam Hussein to go into Kuwait in August 1990. The more I read of the events of the period, the more I believe history will record that the Gulf War was unnecessary, perhaps even that Saddam Hussein was willing to retreat back to his borders, but our government decided we preferred the war to the status quo ante. <br>
<br>
In my previous correspondence with you on this matter, I had been in a quandary about the state of our relations with Baghdad during that critical period. In the months immediately preceding the &quot;green light&quot; given by our Ambassador, April Glaspie, a number of your Senate colleagues including Bob Dole had traveled to Baghdad, met with Saddam, and found him to be a head of state worthy of support. Even Sen. Howard Metzenbaum [D-OH], a Jewish liberal and staunch supporter of Israel, gave him a seal of approval. What disturbs me even now, Jesse, is that these meetings occurred after the Senate Foreign Relations committee had accused Iraq of using poison gas against its own people, i.e., the Kurds. Like all other Americans, in recent years I had assumed that what I read in the papers was true about Iraq gassing its own people. Once the war drums again began beating last November, I decided to read up on the history, and found Iraq denied having used gas against its own people. Furthermore, I heard that a Pentagon investigation at the time had also turned up no hard evidence of Saddam gassing his own people.<br>
<br>
This is serious stuff, because the United Nations tells us that 1.4 million Iraqi civilians have died as a result of the sanctions, which is three thousand times more than the number of Kurds who supposedly died of gassing at the hands of Saddam. Many of my old Cold Warrior friends practically DEMAND that we not lift the sanctions because if Saddam would gas his own people, he would gas anyone. Now I have come across the 1990 Pentagon report, published just prior to the invasion of Kuwait. Its authors are Stephen C. Pelletiere, Douglas V. Johnson II, and Leif R. Rosenberger, of the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The report is 93 pages, but I append here only the passages having to do with the aforementioned issue: <br>
<br>
Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East<br>
<br>
Excerpt, Chapter 5<br>
<br>
U.S. SECURITY AND IRAQI POWER<br>
<br>
Introduction. Throughout the war the United States practiced a fairly benign policy toward Iraq. Although initially disapproving of the invasion, Washington came slowly over to the side of Baghdad. Both wanted to restore the status quo ante to the Gulf and to reestablish the relative harmony that prevailed there before Khomeini began threatening the regional balance of power. Khomenini’s revolutionary appeal was anathema to both Baghdad and Washington; hence they wanted to get rid of him.<br>
<br>
United by a common interest, Iraq and the United States restored diplomatic relations in 1984, and the United States began to actively assist Iraq in ending the fighting. It mounted Operation Staunch, an attempt to stem the flow of arms to Iran. It also increased its purchases of Iraqi oil while cutting back on Iranian oil purchases, and it urged its allies to do likewise. All this had the effect of repairing relations between the two countries, which had been at a very low ebb.<br>
<br>
In September 1988, however -- a month after the war had ended -- the State Department abruptly, and in what many viewed as a sensational manner, condemned Iraq for allegedly using chemicals against its Kurdish population. The incident cannot be understood without some background of Iraq’s relations with the Kurds. It is beyond the scope of this study to go deeply into this matter; suffice it to say that throughout the war Iraq effectively faced two enemies -- Iran and the elements of its own Kurdish minority. Significant numbers of the Kurds had launched a revolt against Baghdad and in the process teamed up with Tehran. As soon as the war with Iran ended, Iraq announced its determination to crush the Kurdish insurrection. It sent Republican Guards to the Kurdish area, and in the course of this operation -- according to the U.S. State Department -- gas was used, with the result that numerous Kurdish civilians were killed. The Iraqi government denied that any such gassing had occurred. Nonetheless, Secretary of State Schultz stood by U.S. accusations, and the U.S. Congress, acting on its own, sought to impose economic sanctions on Baghdad as a violator of the Kurds’ human rights.<br>
<br>
Having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us, we find it impossible to confirm the State Department’s claim that gas was used in this instance. To begin with there were never any victims produced. International relief organizations who examined the Kurds -- in Turkey where they had gone for asylum -- failed to discover any. Nor were there ever any found inside Iraq. The claim rests solely on testimony of the Kurds who had crossed the border into Turkey, where they were interviewed by staffers of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<br>
<br>
We would have expected, in a matter as serious as this, that the Congress would have exercised some care. However, passage of the sanctions measure through the Congress was unusually swift -- at least in the Senate where a unanimous vote was secured within 24 hours. Further, the proposed sanctions were quite draconian (and will be discussed in detail below). Fortunately for the future of Iraqi-U.S. ties, the sanctions measure failed to pass on a bureaucratic technicality (it was attached as a rider to a bill that died before adjournment).<br>
<br>
It appears that in seeking to punish Iraq, the Congress was influenced by another incident that occurred five months earlier in another Iraqi-Kurdish city, Halabjah. In March 1988, the Kurds at Halabjah were bombarded with chemical weapons, producing a great many deaths. Photographs of the Kurdish victims were widely disseminated in the international media. Iraq was blamed for the Halabjah attack, even though it was subsequently brought out that Iran too had used chemicals in this operation, and it seemed likely that it was the Iranian bombardment that had actually killed the Kurds.<br>
<br>
Thus, in our view, the Congress acted more on the basis of emotionalism than factual information, and without sufficient thought for the adverse diplomatic effects of its action. As a result of the outcome of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq is now the most powerful state in the Persian Gulf, an area in which we have vital interests. To maintain an uninterrupted flow of oil from the Gulf to the West, we need to develop good working relations with all of the Gulf states, and particularly with Iraq, the strongest. <br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
I wonder, Senator, had you ever read this material? The entire report is worth reading, as a matter of fact, because of its credibility on the threshold of the Iraqi invasion. The authors are quite emphatic, by the way, in stating that Iraq was struggling for its financial survival at this point -- because of its debts from the Iranian war, and the decline of the world oil price. That is, they did not believe Iraq would have expansionist designs in the Middle East for years to come, given how financially flattened they had been. <br>
<br>
It does seem to me that if Congress did act more on the basis of emotionalism than factual information, it may have contributed substantially to the economic distress of our ally in the war with Iran. That is, by squeezing Saddam with sanctions that included a cutoff of IMF assistance, it thrust Saddam into the confrontation he had with the Emir of Kuwait over oil fields and better port access to the Gulf that the Iraqis claimed going back to World War I. <br>
<br>
The more I pull on this piece of string, the more I believe you should commit resources of the Foreign Relations Committee to a review of this history. In this period, the Democrats did have control of Congress and another senator chaired Foreign Relations. It could be that a different viewpoint at a distance of time would enable even slight adjustments of policy. It is now a season where everyone is asking for apologies of events that occurred generations ago, even hundreds of years ago. We should deal today with those issues which could grow tomorrow into embarrassments for which our grandchildren will have to apologize. Meanwhile, I’ll continue to keep you informed as I collect this Iraqi ball of string.<br>

<br>
The war was supported?  By whom?  Blair supported it based on his own intelligence reports.  (I can post yet another link to his own speech to parliament, but you won't read it anyway)  The French, Russian and Chinese didn't support because they stood to loose a lot of lucrative developments, and tied up the UN in vetoes and calls for &quot;more time&quot;.  The allies we had believed the evidence, and it's there for all to see.  They broke the sanctions of the United Nations (hello Tapeworm of the World.. you should support those sanctions as just if you're the citizen you claim to be)<br>

<br>
No, you're anti American because you're a paranoid fuck, Tapeworm.  The reason given was that he ignored the UN sanctions.  They demonstrated his ability to make WMD's before the sanctions, and the fact the facilities and acquisitions made by that government AFTER the sanctions did not in fact LESSEN as was demanded by the UN, but instead increased.  Demanding immediate answers is als unreasonable and in fact, retarded as fuck.  The fact that they got rid of a goddamned monster is just icing on the cake.<br>

Nuffa that.  Why is it that throughout this, your kind sits and puts the deaths caused by UN sanctions (NOT the US), at the feet of the US?  You're a hypocrite and a fucking moron and have yet to respond to that, or the fact that if Saddick would have complied with the sanctions NO ONE would have died (except those several thousand at Anfal,  but hey.. they worship kinda funny).<br>

My motto - question everything.<br>
<br>
Now, when it comes to believeing the CIA who has feet on the ground and eyes in the feild or an administration sitting on their ass in DC who pressured them to give the answers they wanted and when the CIA refused to fudge facts, went out and created their own &quot;intelligence&quot; group to tell them what they wanted to hear.... I'll go with the CIA thank you.<br>
<br>
And I could care less that you disregard my material or call me a tapeworm, because almost anything is better than being a mindless borg like you who is desperate to make a broke down, has been dictator worse than he really was to justify your warmongering hero's actions. I can admit Saddam was a ruthless dictator who maintained his rule with an iron fist, but unlike you I don't need to fudge the facts to make him into some mini-Hitler.<br>
<br>
Saddam is what he is and the US did what it did. Put it on the scales and it doesn't balance out in my book. <p><br><br><br>

<br>
What exactly is your point?<br>
<br>
What do you suggest is done?<br>
<br>
The US still hasn't come up with the smoking gun after 2 months so you hop on one side of the fence or the other, either way it makes you just as much of a mindless borg as anyone on the other side of the fence Loegan.<br>
<br>
I'm not wasting hours of time in front of a computer quoting every fucking line of your symantics, because you can't disprove anything, all you can do is give your own bull shit spin on it.<br>
<br>
To even SUGGEST that any of those things you tried to disprove up there was false just shows you are either<br>
A) misinformed<br>
B) Biased<br>
C) Retarded<br>
D) All of the above<br>
<br>
You freely admit that you are biased against Bush, and this proves a great way for you to drag him around in the dirt for a while.  Have fun dude I don't care for him much either but I'm not pee brained enough to drag the American moral high ground in the dirt behind him.<br>
<br>
You and Sashanna can go get a room somewhere and dream of the world rallying to topple President Bush all you want, it's not going to change the fact that noone in the world can say without a doubt that there was WMD or wasn't...exept George Bush and Saddam Hussien...2 people who niether side will believe.  <br>
<br>
Either they find it or they don't.  Doesn't prove or disprove anything if they don't.  If they do then that's a bonus for the Coalition. This is a fact, a certainty, something derived completely from unbiased logic. Something you either do not posess, or do not understand.<br>
<br>
So keep whining about it and maybe it will change that.<br>

Au contraire moronic fuckwit.  A Tapeworm is a parasite that lives inside it's host, slowly sucking life and corrupting it.  You too gain this illustrious title if you live in the US and truck with the tinfoil wearing conspiracy theorists who rail against the US, provide NO solutions but their pathetic mewling and live here, making a comfortable living off the country or government they so hate.<br>
<br>
Disagreeing with the government is one thing, but sitting in your American home cheering the vomitous maggot that butchered thousands of his own people (NOT counting the ambiguous number gassed (according to Tapeworm Loegan), is something that qualifies you as a parasite.<br>
<br>
Why punch holes in your facts.  I didn't say I agreed with Ranna fuckwit.  I said &quot;good post&quot; meaning it wasn't filled with paranoia.  Why refute your historical facts when I know they're true?  You may also be a Tapeworm, but I don't have to sit there and point out your anonymous or questionable facts.<br>
<br>
Take Loegan the halfwit for instance.<br>
<br>
He goes on and on about how the US had concrete evidence of Nukes, but wouldn't reveal their sources of intelligence, but then he vapidly sits and uses an ex CIA person as &quot;proof&quot; (as if his word alone is gospel), and shows an article rife with anonymous &quot;sources&quot;.  He does that bullshit, and you just throw out 200+ years of history, as if Bush or Powell were currently responsible for Slavery.  Big difference, but still amounts to the same smelly heap of useless pigshit.<br>

<br>
Well first off half of those were only CIVIL rights violations, and not HUMAN rights violations.  <br>
<br>
See here in the US since right after the Golden Era that Merton loves to refer to so much (the 50s), we have had a set of Laws that were put in place that guarantee every one Basic human AND civil rights.  <br>
<br>
Slavery??, please....how the fuck does that have anything to do with Iraq?  At least try to stick on topic Merton.<br>
<br>
Hey you know what...back in 3100 B.C. there was this Caveman who was a Tribal Leader in the US who savagely raped and pillaged every town in America...so America doesn't have any right to say that what Saddam was doing was wrong damn you!<br>
<br>
Why do you think problems like what is going on in Isreal right now exist?  I think it's because of ignorant fucks like Merton that have to constantly drudge up the sins of the father but are unwilling to look at the world they live in and make sound judgements without the bias of the past clouding what should be simple.<br>
<br>
Is there Slavery in the US today Merton?<br>
<br>
Are Japanese people being held in interrogation camps today Merton?<br>
<br>
Did someone tell you recently that you couldn't Golf in thier club because of your yellow belly?<br>
<br>
I am a white american and I don't owe anyone shit for any of that stuff, niether me, nor my anscestors had anything to do with it, and even if they did it wouldn't make it my problem to answer for.<br>
<br>
And trying to sully the image of the current administration by somehow tying them into these past misjudgements is just as ignorant, inflammatory, and wrong. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 2565<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/03 5:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Actually, Loegan is and has been providing solutions.  I was providing solutions before the war even started.  You just don't want to hear them.

I also pay taxes which keep that government functioning.  So I will bitch as much as I please, because that is my money being wasted on this war.<br>

<br>
I want you to point out a single quote where any of the posters here cheered Saddam on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He goes on and on about how the US had concrete evidence of Nukes, but wouldn't reveal their sources of intelligence, but then he vapidly sits and uses an ex CIA person as &quot;proof&quot; (as if his word alone is gospel), and shows an article rife with anonymous &quot;sources&quot;. He does that bullshit, and you just throw out 200+ years of history, as if Bush or Powell were currently responsible for Slavery. Big difference, but still amounts to the same smelly heap of useless pigshit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And you discount historical precedent, as if it was irrelevant.  The crux of the issue is that Loegan is right.  No one is contesting that Saddam is a bad guy, and no one is contesting the fact that he had WMD's at some point and probably did before the war.  What they are contesting is that the war was presented and sold to the American public on a lie.  If American secret intelligence was so good that they could present photos and data of WMD locations at the UNSC, why isn't that intelligence being used anymore to find those WMD's?    You mean Saddam could magically hide and destroy tons and tons of <br>
biological and chemical agents in mere weeks without a trace and these surveillance satellites couldn't find any evidence of where those WMD's were being moved or where they were destroyed?  You got played for a fool and you probably realize it, but nobody wants to be proven wrong - which is why you so vehemently defend it despite evidence to the contrary.  If you don't think that American government would lie to further its agenda, I got 3 words for you:  Gulf of Tonkin<br>
<br>
Who sold the WMD's to Iraq?  USA<br>
Who gave him the green light to attack Kuwait?  USA<br>
Who encouraged Saddam to keep fighting Iran?  USA<br>
<br>
And now you're trying to play the role of the righteous man?  How ironic... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dextromethorphanhydrobromide>DextroMethorphan hydrobromide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/03 6:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> la</span><hr size=1> &quot;Naturally the common people don't want war, neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are going to be attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.&quot;<br>
