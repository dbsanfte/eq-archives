Most of china is a desert. Even tho tecnicly its larger then the U.S. most of its population is along the coast in an area no bigger then California. If you really don't belive that is fine just go look up China's Climate map  see where it is viable to grow rice in that country. You will notice its only a small portion by the coast. Which is where most of if not all of Chinas population is.<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, China has had ICBM's since the late 70's.&quot;<br>
<br>
No they really didn't...They may have had a crude imitation of an ICBM however these missiles were NEVER taken seriously. It was doubtful they would ever  reach orbit much less actually hit  U.S. soil. The technology needed to launch this type of missile was well out of anything China could put together.The only way they could reliably hit the U.S. was from a weapons platform closer to the U.S. That is until Clinton sold our missile system specs to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
On China's ability to maintain a war. I was actually referring to their ability to sustain an assault on the United States using conventional methods. Sorry if I was not clear on that. But no they don't have the technology to sustain their army on any kind of long range attack.  There for it would fall back to the nuclear war I spoke of before. .<br>
<br>
<br>
From a Military point of view..China 15 years ago was not a major threat. However after this deal that has all changed. Before if a war was to break out with China the worst case scenario was another Vietnam. Now if hostilities did come about with China the worst case is that they can and will launch a nuclear strike and have almost a 100% chance of leveling a city.<br>
<br>
And still no one has explained exactly why if Clinton did not &quot;see&quot; the missiles specs being sold. Why was so much money dumped into his campaign fund by Chinese officials? The guidance system specs were a pay off.<br>
<br>
Also I agree whole heartedly Iran was a stupid deal...I also think it was dumb to supply afgahni troops just so we could get revenge on Russia for Veitnam. However I would call those moves stupid. Clintons....Well his I would border on treason. <br>

1) Offshore torture: I wasn't referring to Guantanamo. I was talking about how the US authorities said they had taken Al Qaeda/Taliban prisoners to Egypt so they could be tortured for information without breaking US law.<br>
<br>
2) &quot;Nazi&quot; references: Bush is not a Nazi and I didn't call him one. There are parallels because Bush is a right-winger, and Hitler was an extreme right-winger.<br>
I  said he could be accused of using 9/11 as his Reichstag Fire -- to get emergency powers and put billions into spending that will benefit his backers -- but he's not about to start gassing people.<br>
<br>
3) Propaganda: Sheesh, don't get paranoid here. The mass media in my country is fully behind Bush. Our conservative government is fully behind Bush. A large majority of the population is fully behind Bush. The propaganda is phrases like &quot;war on terror&quot; and fear-mongering about how the evil moslems are in our midst.<br>

There's always propoganda in wars.  Look at everything we shoveled out during WWII, it's hilarious watching the government sponsored tapes they had back then... I don't see this is a serious problem by any means.  Maybe everyone is backing Bush because it's the logical thing to do?  And while I will concede that Bush is very probably using the situation to his advantage (he'd be a fool not to), to state that he is attempting any sort of subversion of the USA or the world is nonsense.<br>

Sol most of SW China, where the majority of its population lives is NOT a desert.  The northeren 1/3 is arid, the NW corner is true desert.  The SW corner is Tibet.  In any case the arable area is much larger than California.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you have a engineering degree and were there in China to evaluate thier missiles.  You are vastly underestimateing the technological capabilities of the Chinese.  They were able to develope Nuclear and Hydrogen bombs in the late 60's, pretty much on thier own. (Even the Soviets were not helping them on that front).  But you can't believe that they didn't have adequate effective ICBM's a decade later?   Nvermind that the engineering and science involved in ours (and the Soviets) oldest ICBM's (crude but accurate enough to hit a city) was public domain by the 70's<br>
They were putting basic satillites into orbit by the late 80's   You seem to think of China as our enemy(they are not.  They certainly are not a frined, but they are far from hostile), but you also are severly underestimating them.  That is a HUGE mistake.  Pardon the analogy but while it IS rocket science, but it is easy rocket science.  Hell the Germans were a couple months from building a ICBM in 1945.  It isn't that advanced technologically.<br>
<br>
And again, the reliabilty of the Chinese missles has far more to due with a lack of ability to test them (no where to test fire them for any distance) than any technological roadblock.  This is still true and will reamin true for now.  A guidance system does not help if you cannot test it and calibrate it.  (Though it DID help there nacsent space program, which was the actual intention of the sale in the first place)  Their ICBM's are just as dangerous now as they were before.   The only reason WE continued to increase accuracy beyond a certain point was the need to pin-point Russian hardened missile silo's.   This strategy was only effective because we had 1000's of missile with which to target them with.  If all we needed was city/base busters, we had adequate accuracy back in the 50's.   The chinese missiles are not accurate enough for that now, nor were they before.  The net <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  strategic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> effect of the guidance systems is negligeble.  They did not give (despite what you believe) the Chinese missles any real improvement in capability.  They are still only good for city busting.  Which they were good for before. <br>
<br>
The most likely scenerio for a direct military confrontation between the US and China has been Taiwan.  That has been true since the end of the Korean war.  WE would be the ones haveing to reach out and touch someone.  That would be a war that is fought in and around China and if it involved any fighting on the Chinese mainland, it would be one we would lose, nukes or no nukes.  There are too many of them with very long memories about western occupation.   The Russians DO have some concearn.  They are getting friendly again, but that relationship goes in cycles.  <br>
<br>
Now as to the campaign contributions.  Only a small amount was donated directly to HIS campaign coffers, most of it went to the Democratic Party.  The reason had very little to do with any missle technology.  It had to do with China wanting permanent normal trade status and support for getting into the WTO.  These were issues that the Democrats were lukewarm too, while the Republicans were generally supportive of.  THAT was what the Chinese lobbying attempts were aimed at.  Isreal has done the same thing for decades (though they are much better at obscuring the trail of money to its source)  And the Gulf States have played that game as well.   They are all a slimy deals, but so is our entire campaign finance system.  This was definatly a case of throwing stones in glass houses.  EVERYONE in Washinton is guilty of this crap, it NEEDS to be changed, but you can't single out any one person as being any more guilty than the other.<br>
<br>
China is not for the forseeable future a major opponant of ours.   China has very little international <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  military</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> concearns beyond Taiwan.  We have issues with them (mostly concearning weapon/technology sales) but those are issues we have with Russia and some of our aliies for that matter.  The biggest bone of contention remains Taiwan and that is unlikely to blow up soon unless either Taiwan or the Chinese get really stupid (not impossible but it hasn't happened yet in 43 years)<br>

We don't tolerate those kind of flights from anyone else, but you expected the Chinese to just roll over?  And the collision was an accident, unless you think they are training kamikazi's now.<br>
<br>
They were not held as hostages.  They were detained so the Chinese would have time to get as much info from the plane as possible.  Do you really think that we would not have also detained a crew of a Chinese spyplane if IT was involved in a collision with one of ours off OUR coasts?  Hell I would hope so.<br>
<br>
In 1973, Isreal shot the hell out of a spy ship of ours in the Mediteranean.  Does that make the Isreali's hostile?  (Official story is that it was a case of mistaken identity but that story has so many holes in it it isn't funny).  During the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq shot one of our Frigates at a time we were supporting them.  (Again called mistaken identity, but a pile of evidence that it was anything but).<br>
<br>
Unless the Taiwan situation blows up, there really isn't an issue that is likely to bring a military conflict between the US and the Chinese.  Non-hostile, does not mean a lack of conflict.  I never said we were buddy-buddy.  But we are not exactly at eachother's throat either.<br>

The linear &quot;political spectrum&quot; is a model of very limited usefulness anyway. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

They were madmen, and the fact that their &quot;idealogies&quot; appealed or followed what we deem as the right or left makes absolutely no difference.

The Chinese have stated very clearly that they are hostile to Taiwan, a nation friendly to the U.S.  Why shouldn't we send spy planes to keep an eye on what the Chinese are doing?  As long as we don't intrude on their territory there's no problem.  You could just as well say that the Chinese have a right to blast our spy satellites out of orbit because they can peek into China.  Yeah, the Chinese should just &quot;roll over&quot;, because there isn't a thing they can or should do about planes in international areas besides monitor them, as they were doing.  <br>
<br>
To suggest that it is the American EP3's fault (which was on autopilot) is laughable.  A big, lumbering prop plane, loaded down with sophisticated, expensive, secret electronic equipment makes a sudden move and rams itself into a top of the line fast, maneuverable jet fighter... suuuuure.  So it is abundantly clear that the Chinese pilot was at fault in that particular incident.  He endangered himself and the lives of Americans, in international airspace.  To have the Chinese hold our airmen hostage afterwards was just icing on the cake.  The Chinese should have been the ones to apologize.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Exactly, Kellianne.  Besides, take a look at Hitler's ideologies... they were all over the place.  Hard to label him right or left, better to just say &quot;evil mad dictator&quot; and leave it at that.  And not try to put any modern politicians in his camp, unless they truly deserve it (Hitler apologists, mass murderers, etc.) <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

What I said was WE don't put up with spy planes flying up and down our coasts in international waters, but you expect the Chinese to be all warm and fuzzy about us flying up and down thiers?       <br>
<br>
And if you don't think OUR reaction to such an incident off out shores would not be similar, you are very mistaken.   We would have kept a Chinese crew detained till the incident had been investigated.  Nevermind that we, quite illegally do not allow anything resembling a recon plane anywhere NEAR our shores, international airspace or not.  (Well not exactly true, we claim 200 miles out to be our territory, while international standards only recognizes 12 miles)  <br>
<br>
Of course the collision was the Chinese pilots fault, that was not doubted by anyone, not even the Chinese leaders.  And we did not &quot;apologize&quot; for the incident.  There were several collisions between US and Russian subs in international waters during the Cold War.  9 times out of 10 it was because the US sub was following too close.  Where was our apology for THOSE incidents?  <br>
<br>
In the end BOTH the plane and the crew were shortly sent home.   And Bush sure doesn't seem to be holding much of a grudge.  If anything his attitude toward China has softened.<br>
<br>
And of course mainland China is hostile to Taiwan.  Taiwan is hostile to mainland China.  Taiwan is the remant of the former national government that the communists overthrew.  It was only recently that Taiwan dropped the claim to be a national chinese government(until the early 70's, Taiwan sat in China's UN seat).  That conflict is a hold over from the Chinese civil war.  China considers it still to be an internal matter, so they DO see any US involvement as interferrence in thier affairs.  However we have an interest in a free, independant Taiwan, so like I said, this IS the most likely spark for a US/Chinese military conflict, but it is unlikely.  China and Taiwan have mutually exclusive goals for the future, but neither wants it to come to a fight that would be disaterous for both.  It would take a lot of bad luck and a lot of stupidety by one side or the other.  Not impossible, but they have avoided just such a result for 40 years.<br>

I am very happy to hear that you were in china with your degree rad to double check they could nukes us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Sarcasm aside.....China developed bombs in the 60's this was considered to be China's move forward in &quot;war&quot; technology, however...In 1968 Lin Biao the Chinese leader died...Most research into weapons technology was halted and in the following years the Chinese republic was reformed. An &quot;agriculture first&quot; standpoint was taken up. Their ICBM's were still on the back burner and still just huge piles of junk with war heads on them.<br>
<br>
Supposedly the U.S. by the 60's had ICBM's that could easily hit Russian cities. Yet we still had trouble launching one rocket into space and retrieving it. Infact even when we did get it down pat it still took months of planning and two huge teems of engineers to pull it off. What makes you think in the 60's we could have really struck a city? It was more realistic that our short range missiles in friendly counties closer to Russia would have done the dmg we would be looking for in a Nuclear war....Hence why Cuba war so important.<br>
<br>
Back to the Chinese....As Defense spending again increased in the 80's they began thier missile devlopment again, but as you said before due to lack of testing they really could not be sure if their missiles even worked. Most in the military knew they probably did not work...Simply because of how long the U.S. had spent perfecting our own missiles to be able to even hit a city. <br>
<br>
That was until they were sold U.S. missle guidance specs....Now they dont have a wild card they have a SURE thing. They dont have to be scared anymore because they know they can hit us. Now we have lost the advantage we have enjoyed for so long. We can no longer say we will definetly wipe you out but you probably cant hit us. Now they can....And with China as much as you say they are not our enemies that is something to fear. Thank you again Clinton...<br>

<br>
You have yet to show me ANYTHING that shows a sudden improvement in Chinses missiles.   They were capable of accurately hitting cites in the US since the 80's.  You keep saying that they couldn't, but everything I come accross says they could.  They are STILL only capable of accurately hitting cities.  There has been a gradual increase in their nuclear capabilities since the end of the cultural revolution.  It is doubful, what use a guidance system, designed for a over the pole flight, would be to a Chinese missle of a different design (wt., aerodynamics etc.) would be since they would be useing a trans-pacific flight path.  And it STILL does not help one iota without a good testing program.  If you REALLY want to find a good scapegoat for the advances in Chinese weapon programs, try all the US educated scientists and engineers that were/are involved in thier missile programs.  THAT is where the largest amount of &quot;technology transfer&quot; has occured.  And even now they have only 10-20 of these high end missiles.  (Which is why they don't like the idea of even a minor missile defense system.  It may not be capable of holding off a massive missile attack, but it could very well be quite capable of holding off what the Chinese can throw at us)<br>

Oh and you won't find a link for the submarine collisions.  The incidents are officially classified.  Niether side will admit that they happened, but both sides know they did.<br>
<br>
It was a result of the tactics used during by submarines during the Cold War.  That portion was as close to real war that the US and USSR ever came.  Our subs and thier subs acted under a war footing, doing everything but actually fireing torpedos's at eachother.<br>
<br>
The collisons occured when a one of our fast attack subs were tracking and following a Soviet missile boat.    The attack sub would try to remain undetected (and often did) because the Soviet missile sub would start trying to evade if it saw the US sub.  The biggest blind spot Soviet subs had was really close behind the sub.  This is where US subs would sit when tracking/following Soviet boomers.  The problem is, the US sub had to be really on its toes because if the Soviet sub did anything unexpected the Amercan Sub would be seen or as happened in a few case, a collision would occur.<br>
<br>
As far is known, no collision actually led to a sub sinking.  The reason niether country officially admits to it is the USSR didn't want to admit that US subs could get so close undetected, and the US was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> technically</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the wrong in most cases by purpously approaching another ship so closely without warning.  (international law really doesn't apply to the situation though) <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

I guess you are privvy to classified information? <br>
<br>
And everything you write implies that it is mainly useless to the Chinese. No, you never actually *say* those words, but the tone of your posts definately implies that it was no big deal. Not that I know a whole lot about the matter, but common sense would dictate that the Chinese would not pay for something they did not need, or would not improve what they have already. I am not saying Sol is 100% right in his argument, but the tendency of your posts to be a Clinton apologist leads me to believe you are greatly diminishing the importance of what he did. In addtion, that sub thing makes your facts highly suspect. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>
