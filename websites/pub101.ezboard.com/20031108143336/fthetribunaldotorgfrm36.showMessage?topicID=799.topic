<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>BILL CLINTON, FMR. PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.:  Let me tell you what I know.  When I left office, there was a substantial amount of biological and chemical material unaccounted for.  That is, at the end of the first Gulf War, we knew what he had.  We knew what was destroyed in all the inspection processes and that was a lot.  And then we bombed with the British for four days in 1998.  We might have gotten it all; we might have gotten half of it we might have none of it.  But we didn't know.<br>
<br>
So I thought it was prudent for the president to go to the U.N. and for the U.N. to say you got to let these inspectors in, and this time if you don't cooperate the penalty could be a regime change, not just continued sanctions.<br>
<br>
But this State of the Union deal they decided to use the British intelligence.  The president said it was British intelligence.  Then they said on balance they shouldn't have done it.  You know, everybody makes mistakes when they are president.  I mean, you can't make as many calls as you have to make without messing up once in awhile.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>BILL MAHER, HOST OF HBO SHOW, “REAL TIME”: You were here many times. <br>
       SCARBOROUGH: And you actually grabbed me, one time, by the collar after the show was over. You said..<br>
       MAHER: I said, get out of Congress.<br>
       SCARBOROUGH: Right.<br>
       MAHER: . and get into broadcasting where we need you.<br>
       SCARBOROUGH: Yes. And I thought that that was actually because you thought I would do a good job on TV. Actually I found out later it was because you loathed what I was doing in Congress. <br>
       MAHER: No. I didn’t at all, but I did think that you were a straight shooter. <br>
       SCARBOROUGH: Thanks.<br>
       MAHER: And I thought, well, this guy’s not going to last long in Congress. <br>
       SCARBOROUGH: And you were exactly right. Speaking of straight shooters, you’ve been fairly critical of the president’s war in Iraq. I’d certainly - if you have seen the show, you certainly know that I think it was a very good thing to liberate the people of Iraq. What do you think? <br>
       MAHER: Well, I think it was a good thing to liberate the people of Iraq. Nobody’s arguing that. Nobody thinks it was bad that Saddam Hussein is gone and his kids are dead. But you might be happy that I think this attempt to take him down over the 16 words, I don’t agree with that. <br>
       I think the Democrats had their chance in October to be against this war. They knew Bush was hyping the evidence then and if they wanted to be against it, they should have been against it then. They were the ones who abdicated their responsibilities. The constitution says Congress should declare war. And they didn’t. So it’s a little too late, and nobody really went to war because of the 16 words anyway. <br>
       SCARBOROUGH: Right. I’m going to ask you, do you really think that people in middle America are just shocked that the president used words that he got from his CIA people that were in British intelligence. Do you think people in Kansas are really, really torn up about the president using the uranium information in the State of the Union Address? <br>
       MAHER: No. But I don’t make my decisions based on what people in Kansas think, necessarily either. <br>
       SCARBOROUGH: Well, what about.<br>
       (CROSSTALK) <br>
       MAHER: I believe they think the jury is out on evolution in Kansas. So, no, I don’t go by that. But yes. But I don’t think the Democrats are going to win this election, or any election, by play hating, and just playing “the gotcha game”. Because I remember, Bush said, I don’t play “the gotcha game”. <br>
       SCARBOROUGH: Right.<br>
       MAHER: So, this is just more of “the gotcha game” I think. And what I’m surprised about is that people are just discovering that George Bush knows how to lie because I was telling people that a long time ago. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
MAHER: I thought we were going to be decimated because I thought when we went into Baghdad he was going to fire off his chemical stuff and we would be suffering for that for years to come. But he didn’t. so-and that’s one reason I’m saying they should back off on this 16 word thing and not try to take down a president. <br>
       I just do not have the stomach to go through another destruction of a president, especially one-it doesn’t matter if he’s not - I’m not his biggest fan. He is the president and we are at war. And I don’t think a president can afford to be fighting his own personal battle and fighting a war of this magnitude. It was one thing when they brought down Bill Clinton, and that was certainly wrong, as wrong as it can be, and what Bill Clinton lied about was certainly not as consequential. <br>
       But now we’re in a war. A fight for our lives. And to be taking down this president while he’s trying to fight this war is cutting off our nose to spite our face. And the Democrats would be very well and very smart, because they’re not going to win this way. They would be very smart to break this cycle of personal destruction because somebody has to. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now do you get it? Sounds like the same thing Clinton is saying to me, excluding the fact that Bill Maher knows we were lied to and will say so when pressed.<br>

<br>
You are right that Clinton said Bush told the truth and Maher stated he lied, but they both seem to be giving the message that it doesn't matter whether the claim was correct or not and that tearing down Bush is the wrong thing to do. Clinton because he seems to think it's the truth and Maher for several reasons, not the least of which is that it is hurting the dems.<br>
<br>
Look, if there hadn't been this argument that we couldn't wait - that we had to go now or the next attack may be a mushroom cloud in Chicago - if they hadn't turned the fear rhetoric up to push the argument, then I could let it go. But they played on peoples fears on something they knew (and if he didn't get the info then he damn sure should have and this administration needs a major overhaul) wasn't true.<br>
<br>
If they had put the argument forth in an honest way and it turned out to be wrong, then so be it, just like I said with Wolfowitz - and yes, I honestly believe they thought the Iraqis would join them and we wouldn't have a guerilla war - there were opinions both ways, but no evidence to back up either side so it was an honest mistake. There was evidence in what Bush/Cheney claimed and to omit the facts the CIA gave that didn't favor them and use foreign intelligence just to have something that did support their side, is dishonest... I just don't see how you can say it wasn't.<br>

<br>
For fun reading, here's the relevant portion of Bush's speech in which he made the mushroom reference:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? And there's a reason. We've experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to use biological or chemical, or a nuclear weapon.<br>
<br>
Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, &quot;Neither the United States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world,&quot; he said, &quot;where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nations security to constitute maximum peril.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991. The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next; they forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass twelve square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above and below the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden.<br>
<br>
The world has also tried economic sanctions -- and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs of the Iraqi people.<br>
<br>
The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities -- only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist.<br>
<br>
The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people -- and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750 times.<br>
<br>
After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

No one believes that Iraq had the range necessary in ANY weapons to hit the Continental US.  The Duct Tape was for terror attacks, and yeah.. Anthrax and the like, but not from Iraq, so much as Al-Qaeda.  Nukes were not seriously in anyone's thoughts, outside the fact that if Saddam DID have them, they'd be pointed our way.<br>
<br>
I admit I was nervous about the non-disclosure of information, and the fact that Saddam's earning potential was rising despite the sanctions to the point where actually purchasing a long-ranged Nuke was possible.  Thats about as far as any real fear goes (though that's certainly enough)<br>

But don't underestimate the stupidity (harsh word... maybe gullibility?) of the &quot;average american&quot;.   These are the same people who thought iraq was behind 9/11 after the Bush PR machine went into full effect (polls at the time indicated that &gt;50% (I think? Loegan would remember) of the US population believed that fact, after Bush started spinning Iraq as The Enemy(tm)).<br>
<br>
it's true people were in fear of terrorism, not being *attacked* by Iraq in the conventional warfare sense, but you forget that at that point Joe American had firmly linked Saddam to Terrorism, despite the fact there was no evidence whatsoever supporting that.  It was all part of the play to build up support at home for a war in Iraq.<br>
