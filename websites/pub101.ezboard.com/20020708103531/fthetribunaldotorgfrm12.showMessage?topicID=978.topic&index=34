<br>
1) Nice story about my ex wife.  Oh wait, I don't have an ex wife.  Sorry, try again.<br>
<br>
2) I was keeping this guild together long before you even joined us.  Just cause you didn't see (namely weren't around to see) any of the behind the scenes stuff, don't assume you have any idea who did what to keep the guild together.  <br>
<br>
3) If I wanted to keep a bond to this game, why would I cancel my account?  Why would I delete my main character and all his stuff?  Oh, and I'm sorry Revenge, but yes...that means all the stuff RNG got me and that I was so priveledged to wear is gone now.  Cause I know that's your biggest concern.  If I wanted to form some type of bond to this game through this method, I woulda posted about this shit LAST YEAR!  Cause news flash dumb ass, I didn't start the thread, but my name was mentioned.  I think that gives me some right to respond to it.  I don't happen to recall seeing your name in the posts though (until you decided to enter yourself).  Who's the one that needs the extra attention?<br>
<br>
4) What have you led besides your head up your ass?  The couple events that I even tried to lead went pretty damn well.  <br>
<br>
I was an Officer for a longer period of time than you've even been a member.  What have you done?  It was only after everyone and their mother held an officer position that I stepped down voluntarily.  And I musta done alright since Broshan asked me to come back a couple times.<br>
<br>
I don't recall you ever doing anything for RNG.  Oh, except whine about how people taking RNGs loot with them when they leave.  I thought it was particularly interesting that these comments were even made about people that were supposed to be your good friends (ie. Shurraco).  What was it you said?  Oh yeah...&quot;There goes all our loot.&quot;  Ok, maybe that's not exact, but it's been a while.  I forget the wording, but not the meaning.<br>
<br>
5) Is that the best you can do?  I state facts, you retort with a garbled mess of swearing.  /golf clap.  I must say though, I do find your stories rather amusing.  I look forward to the next heap of crap.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Needless to say, I've had a lot of bloodwork done with my recent surgery.  I'm clean as a whistle.  But wait...if Talvi didn't get anything from me, and I didn't get anything from her, she musta gotten it after we were together.  How can that be, she's little miss innocent?  /boggle <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.jsp?num=951" target=_blank>Reverance Echoblade</a><BR>

Yeah, I know a bit about you and to be honset a guy who plays a druid in the bay area does not exactly invoke fear in me. I did a bit of checking into things... I am not the least bit afraid Would I get a quicker response from you at the PrivateEmail1@hotmail.com or the PrivateEmail2@hotmail account?<br>
I could post your social security # but that would be too low and a violation of the Privacy act.<br>
You still want a war?<br>
<br>
As for Revenge... pretty funny stuff coming from a skinny white college student with a less than average college transcript. You have been described to me as the guy that Offspring wrote 'pretty fly for a white guy' about. Since none of your insults have any originality-- just the same repetative wanna-be black trash. You are no longer of any consequence. I know a few people at your school that will be more than willing to pay you a visit for free signed gaming books anyhow...<br>
<br>
For the record... Talvi is well below my personal standards. Short heavy Amer-asians do nothing for me. Besides even at my lowest point on the joust circuit I could pick better-- even blind drunk. That is not to say she isn't a nice person at times. I was just verifying some of the accusations that were made before this.<br>
<br>
You two have still produced nothing to disprove the accusations that were made. The best post I have seen was from Avocet... (A guy from the deep Southwest btw.) and all he realy said was that it should not have been here in the first place. I agree with that, but as long as the personal attacks come at me. I will continue on here and take the fight to you if need be.<br>
I leave it up to you, either drop your ridiculous posturing and post something like-- yeah it may be true but you don't feel she deserves this treatment here and we can drop the whole thing. Maybe even ask for the thread to be deleted... or continue and you and Talvi continue to be bitchslapped both here and where you live.<br>
I didn't start this shit, but I am more than capable of finishing it.<br>
