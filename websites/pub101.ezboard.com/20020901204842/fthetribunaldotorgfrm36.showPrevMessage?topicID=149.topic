Seems pretty spot on to me--with quotes straight from the targets.  They are their own worst enemies.<br>
<br>
as far as who is behind it:<br>
The Center for Consumer Freedom represents a coalition of restaurant operators and concerned individuals working together to defend your right to a full and varied menu of dining options. We do this through education, training, research, and public outreach. <br>
<br>

Or so they claim... I do like the spin on demonizing &quot;health groups&quot;. The word terrorist never sounded so good. I'll leave you arguing of the benefits of a McDonald's diet... I'll see if i can dig more on who's behind this site. (Yes - i also read the &quot;about us&quot; page). What I see though is less concern about your freedom being taken away by evil democrats than fiscal year loss of profits for an industrial food industry being hit by &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;healthy food&quot; competiton. Propaganda...<br>
<br>
Btw : dont go get the wrong idea : i -do- think that taxing food based on health risk factors is ludicrous. If we were dealing with insurances, the question would be different though (smokers are paying more insurance which IMHO is pretty reasonable). If you disagree, you can after all purchase a different insurance package. Not the same as a government enforced diet.<br>

ConsumerFreedom.org: Tobacco Money Takes on Activist Cash<br>
by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber<br>
<br>
Full page advertisements in Newsweek magazine are expensive, so who footed the bill for an attack ad aimed at Greenpeace that ran in the January 28 issue? The Center for Consumer Freedom, which produced the ad, isn't saying.<br>
<br>
At first glance, with its photo of a diving whale in the ocean, the ad looked like it might have been placed by Greenpeace itself--until, that is, you read the nasty quote from Patrick Moore, identified as a &quot;Greenpeace Co-Founder,&quot; calling his former colleagues &quot;a band of scientific illiterates who use Gestapo tactics.&quot;<br>
<br>
The advertisement featured a web address, www.ConsumerFreedom.com, which belongs to the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF). Like the advertisement itself, the name is misleading. CCF doesn't represent consumers. It's just the new name for lobbyist Rick Berman's latest front group.<br>
<br>
Until January, the CCF called itself the &quot;Guest Choice Network.&quot; Its name change coincided with the launch of a second website, called ActivistCash.com, which purports to reveal a vast, left-wing financial conspiracy among major foundations and nonprofit public interest organizations.<br>
<br>
Berman's specialty as a lobbyist is what he calls &quot;shooting the messenger&quot;: attacking activists who criticize his clients. PR Watch first exposed Berman &amp; Co. in our First Quarter 2001 issue, detailing his work for the restaurant, tavern and alcoholic beverage industries. Since then, we have uncovered new information documenting his ties to Philip Morris.<br>
<br>
Although ConsumerFreedom.org isn't saying who funded its attack advertisement against Greenpeace, Philip Morris is a distinct possibility. The tobacco giant is also now the largest food company in the United States. Greenpeace is one of the international leaders in the fight for safety and environmental testing of genetically engineered foods, and recently Greenpeace targeted Philip Morris Kraft for its sales of such products.<br>

<br>
Anyway my point being : this page is very misleading in the fact it makes you believe that an &quot;honest group of restaurants&quot; is being victimised by &quot;hippie food terrorists&quot;. <br>
<br>
You will also notice that the Berman PR agency is very careful not to give the slightest hint of their involvement in this nor who exactly is financing this &quot;campaign&quot; or even pays for the bandwidth of this server. This is public opinion subversion payed for by corporate lobbies. Last I checked, McD. is nowhere near as interested in my health than they are in lining their fat pockets with my $1.25 value meal. If their unhealthy meals are the cause of my heart stroke ? Not their problem, who can prove it anyway ? So when that kind of information is being fed down the pipe in the hope that it becomes &quot;mainstream&quot;, I am very dubious. <br>
<br>
The whole GM food debate is being currently subversed by the very same PR group, paid for by chemical wonder brothers companies like Monsanto or Bayer. But that's another story... <br>

<br>
If this is a corporate lobby, is it wrong for corporate lobbies to take out ads?  Would you censor them?<br>
<br>
Why should McD care about your health?  You are not compelled to eat there, and even if you were, they serve salads.<br>
<br>
Your heart stroke is your fault for not eating right.  It is not their problem.  And if fatty food were the cause, they should not be held responsible.<br>
<br>
On another note, those quotes are accurate.  Those groups are terrorists.  The ELF (earth liberation front) tops the list of domestic terrorist groups according to the FBI.  The ELF has recieved cheques directly from PETA.  Therefore PETA funds terrorism.<br>

Now remember : according to this website, these are regular joes activists like you and me who are spending their time and money to convince us ou freedom of food choice is being restrained...<br>
<br>
Just in case there was any doubt... i'll just restate the basics : mad cow disease is caused by prions. Prions are propagated exponentially by the animal flours that are being fed to battery farm animals. Prions cross species boundaries. There are now cases of prion disease entering the poultry food chain. If you have problems with this, I'll let you do the digging, there is about just a mountain of medical publications on the subject by now. <br>
<br>
Where I am having a major problem is that your &quot;hard working capitalists&quot; are here trying to convince me that the mad cow incident was junk science and that British Beef was safe for consumption. Even better : it is backing its claims by a &quot;study&quot; from two scientists PAID by the British government. Nevermind that said study has been blown out of the water within a week of it's publication in about every academic journal around the world. Oh look ! An expert says my stuff is good and safe ! Yum Yum ! Nevermind that I am the one who paid him to find that out.<br>
<br>
This is not advertisement right ? Or is it counter propaganda to that generated by organisations like Greenpeace ? But what exactly do Greepeace and the ELF have to do with your food choices ? They both defend environmentalist causes. <br>
<br>
And when it comes down to it : who are you going to trust ?<br>
- someone who devotes his own time and money to a cause that benefits mankind in general ?<br>
- someone who has obvious shareholder stakes and direct profit tied to where your opinion swings  because it sells more of his product ?<br>
<br>
But remember : Posilac is good for you !<br>
<br>
S.<br>
<br>
8===================================================<br>
The mad cow disease scare that destroyed Britain's beef industry and cost the country £3.5 billion may not have been caused by tainted beef after all.<br>
<br>
According to the London Daily Telegraph, England's Ministry of Agriculture has awarded a quarter of a million pounds to two scientists who claim the theory that people contract mad cow disease by eating beef tainted with the prion protein is incorrect.<br>
<br>
Their new research shows that mad cow disease in humans and in cows is caused by a type of bacteria which is widespread in contaminated water. If they're right, British junk science (and activist hysteria) triggered the most costly peacetime crisis in that nation's history. Oops.<br>

Ugh, it gets so tiresome arguing with you becuase you never seem to really respond. Are you talking about that same &quot;bicycle&quot; logic that I ripped to shreds and you ignored in the other post? It's either one of two things with you, 1) Your a dishonest individual who tries to trick people into thinking spin is real or 2) Your just naive.<br>
<br>
I say that becuase if you honestly think that someone who openly expresses extreme liberal views, and who has devoted his LIFE to getting those views out there, does not present facts and findings in a slanted way - then you are extremely naive. You seem to be too intelligent to be naive though, so I chalk it up to dishonesty. I say dishonest, becuase you quote all these extreme leftists all the time saying that it is objective, true news. A liberal viewpoint DOES way very heavy on what the guy thinks and writes. It DOES way heavy on his view of the PR industry. Just like a conservative viewpoint does the same. Objectivity is an ideal that is seldom reached. Just be honest about it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

<br>
I deemed your post not worthy of a response since there only are 24 hours in a day and that this intelligence you credit me for has to also produce added value to make a living ;) But if you insist... <br>
<br>
Inference logic :<br>
<br>
1) "Chomsky hates America" (premise A)<br>
2) "You think he's intelligent" (premise B)<br>
3) "therefore I deduct you like him" (inference and conclusion C1)<br>
4) "Hence, the connection, Grozzer hates America" (conclusion C2)<br>
 <br>
For starters : both of your premises A & B are very weak. They are  subjective assessments of yours, not established facts. <br>
<br>
Proof they are subjective : I dont think Chomsky hates America and I have no idea how Grozzer evalutes Chomsky's intelligence. Note : I only need one counter argument to make this proof... <br>
<br>
I cannot prove either premise to be true or false. But I can prove you cannot prove it either since they are proved subjective statements. Any conclusion made using these premises can therefore not be proved. Now...<br>
<br>
Inference arguments :<br>
- are TRUE if and only if all the premises are true. <br>
- a conclusion can be VALID if all the premises are false<br>
But a VALID conclusion does not imply it is a TRUE one.<br>
<br>
Here are other examples:<br>
    * All insects have wings (premise)<br>
    * Woodlice are insects (premise)<br>
    * Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)<br>
<br>
Fallacy  : not all insects have wings.<br>
<br>
More subtly:<br>
    * All fish live in the sea (premise)<br>
    * Dolphins are fish (premise)<br>
    * Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)<br>
<br>
Fallacy : both premises are false. The conclusion is true but its not valid.<br>
<br>
Back to the subject :<br>
<br>
Inference C1 : You deduct that since Grozzer thinks Chomsky is intelligent, he likes him. Fallacy because neither of your premises can be asserted true or false. Counter example (and proof your conclusion is not valid): I think Hitler was intelligent; do you also think I like him ? C1 is therefore not a valid conclusion.<br>
<br>
Inference C2 : is based on conclusion C1 that is unproved. Therefore there is zero valid logic in this statement either. You cannot prove it.<br>
<br>
Your "simple" logic is flawed and because it lacks rigor you cannot draw any definitive conclusion as to whether our friend Grozzer does or does not like this country. But don't worry : most political speeches are filled with arguments built on weak logic such as this one, mostly because some of those concepts are a little counter intuitive. It's however the set of rules that all mathematical proofs have to follow. <br>
<br>
In closing, I'll leave you with a definition to ponder:<br>
<br>
Argumentum ad Hominem is literally "argument directed at the man." The abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion. This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.<br>
For example:<br>
"Atheism is an evil philosophy. It is practised by Communists and murderers."<br>
<br>
"Simple deductive reasoning" that applies to liberals and conservatives :)<br>
<br>

I never said you were not intelligent. Quite the contrary, I think you are very intelligent in a diabolical sort of way. You bash America at every turn you get, then claim that you don't hate America. And as shown below, create an artform out of using semantics to try and prove -- well, I don't know what exactly your trying to prove. That you don't hate America? I guess so...<br>

In the real world, premise A is very strong. Neither you nor I actually know Chomsky, but from his numerous writings we can deduct what he thinks. You refused to acknowledge Dumai's many links to what people think of Chomsky, and, I would gather, ignore much of his Anti-American rhetoric. You only want to think EXACTLY what you want to think. That's clearly evident from every point you ever make. <br>
<br>
Premise B - well, you actually stated in a post that he is a genius. Is it stretching that I think you think he is intelligent? Is this not one in the same. Same semantics game you always play I guess.<br>

You may not think Chomsky hates America, and that is why I say you don't live in reality. You can also think the world is flat, but that doesn't make it so. Chomsky hating America is not subjective; quite the contrary, from all his writings once can reasonably conclude this to be the truth. Although, reasonable conclusions to you seem illogical, the rest of the world (reality again) lives that way.<br>

The proof is in what Chomsky says and writes. Just like in what you say and write. Its constantly anti-American, and destructively so. It is not constructive criticism, but more the ramblings of a madman hellbent on the fall of America. Again, I say, I have no way of magically bringing you into reality, so I guess to you, it is illogical.<br>

Quite the contrary, if the source is shit, the information is shit, in much simpler terms then your high and almighty elitist attitude.

You have numerous comments about &quot;reliable news sources&quot;, so to some extent, you believe this also.

No. How about this? In almost every post Grozzer and S. make, they bash America in some way. What made me finally think that both of these indivudals hate America is the fact that they quote and defend Noam Chomsky, going as far as calling the man a genius. Calling someone a genius shows admiration, for you to say it doesn't, is dishonest and not reality.<br>

<br>
&gt;You bash America at every turn you get<br>
Don't worry : I am an equal oportunity basher. I bashed on british ignorant agricultural and economical policies back when I used to live there. Events proved me right about 3 years later, and no, I don't miss the lager too much. Sharing critical opinions on a subject does not necessarily equate bringing down the order of society and tearing the world apart in anarchy... No matter how much certain people would like you to believe this. I could put a few nails on the current corruption in the french governement, but it doesnt look like a lot of the people posting here have a keen interest nor understanding of those... you tell me.<br>
<br>
&gt;well, I don't know what exactly your trying to prove. That you don't hate America?<br>
<br>
Nope. Your question also tells me I did not explain this clearly enough either. Too boring to go through it all again, so I'll just restate the conclusion : your chain of reasoning is flawed and therefore you cannot state as a valid argument that Grozzer hates America. In other words : your &quot;simple deductive&quot; logic does not hold water because it's not simple deductive logic that you are applying, but bad rhetoric and misleading semantics. Nothing more - nothing less. It doesnt prevent you to force on everyone your opinion that Grozzer hates America, but you cannot force a logical proof of it on anyyone just yet. Do you now get the difference between valid and true conclusions ?<br>
<br>
And oh yeah : I don't hate America, nor do I hate Americans. The &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; can take credit for the first draft of a constitution, which is pretty much the foundation of modern democratic systems. If that comforts you in any way : most of the other democraties in the world have copied it (first of all the french, only 2 or 3 years after you). Incidently, the very first concern of this constitution is to guarantee the freedom of speech and to ensure the rights of individuals to have opinions diverging from those of their government. It just so happens that it was economically very convenient convenient to claim independance, as Britain was outlawing slavery at the time... Now if you believe that this system is just as perfect and peachy as the capitalist one, then you are mistaken. It has been created by humans... and last I checked, perfection wasn't in my genetic code yet.<br>
<br>
&gt;Chomsky hating America is not subjective<br>
<br>
This is your opnion - no more no less. The day you can formulate a scientific test that can discriminate between people who hate America and those who don't, make sure you contact the NSA. They'll be very interested and you'll be rich and famous. In the meantime : this is subjective opinion thank you very much. <br>
<br>
&gt;You refused to acknowledge Dumai's many links to what people think of Chomsky<br>
<br>
Correct I have not replied to Dumai's post. Mostly because half of the links are one liner extracts taken out of context by an organisation whose candid goal is to &quot;debunk all the liberal propaganda&quot; (verbatim). Out of the list, I have flagged two links that actually seem to contain facts and quotes that apparently highlight inconsistencies in Chomsky's arguments. <br>
<br>
The rest are editorials containing mostly ad-hominem attacks, which I am dismissing. Why ? First : the text I presented was an editorial. An editorial is not news, it is an analysis of the news. And to jump ahead and save you the quoting, when I criticized the Sun, I should have been more precise in targetting the quality of the Sun's editorials (my wording is actually rather specific there too if you care to check). This is of course subjective and your opinion on the subject may differ. The reason I think the Sun's editorial are cheap is because they tend to present very simplistic arguments based on distorted facts and more often blatantly wrong logic. I also think they tend to advocate a very xenophobic attitude and publish material that will increase their sales by flattering public opinion rather than rigorous journalistic inquiry. Then again : how often have you read an edition of the Sun in the morning while riding the Tube ?<br>
<br>
Since you seem to believe that the messenger is responsible for the news... that if the &quot;source is shit, the content is shit&quot; then I guess we haven't studied at the same school of philosophy then. I did not pull the &quot;ad hominenm&quot; definition out of my furry bottom : this is the foundation of what was called the &quot;Revolution of Reason&quot;, which incidentally is the basis of modern philosophy and science. The precise semantics exist for a reason - the same reason that out of two false statements you actually obtain a true proposition, but that doesn't make it a logically valid conclusion. Read some Voltaire, Rousseau or Newton for the basics. If I were to apply your reasoning, I could just say you are an evil American lover and all your arguments are biased therefore not worth listening to. I could also dismiss your opinion on the grounds that in my eyes you are an uneducated redneck and this would end up on the flame board. Take your pick : both are ad'hominem and neither is valid logical reasoning.<br>
<br>
So yes of course I am looking at the quality of information sources to ensure that the premises I draw my conclusions from are as sound as I can ascertain it. Neither you nor Dumai have even bothered to actually read the text to provide me a single flaw in either the text's premises, the inferences or the conclusions. All your discussion and arguments so far have been to dismiss the content because you didn't like the name of the author or did not find the references. If you are going to prove me wrong, do it using logic, not name calling or blanket labelling. I am still challenging you to find fallacies in the conclusions. Either in the premises because he is using wrong facts, or in the logic because his inferences are wrong. When I get around to it, I will do it for some of Dumai's links. I have skimmed them and found a couple inconsistencies already, when I can put something convincing together, I'll get around to posting it too. It does take quite a bit more time and effort than just dismissing it because you perceive the author as being a liberal subvertive agent of american haters.<br>
<br>
&gt;Although, reasonable conclusions to you seem illogical, the rest of the world (reality again) lives that way.<br>
<br>
Except the rest of the world extends beyond Ellis Island and Manhattan Beach. If you have any doubt, run your perspective by a few more people... you might be surprised at what the world thinks &quot;reality&quot; is. Lately it seems a lot of the developping nations have some kind of itch with Uncle Sam's carrot and stick economical policies, while Europe has it's own axes (not necessarily of evil - if you can excuse the pun) to grind too. And you can label them anti-american all you want, it wont help you understand why they may have a differing opinion until you actually start asking some questions (assuming there is someone left after you're done nuking first).<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Although, I know you are going to tell me now that what you say is not what you really mean <br>
<br>
Never wrote that - I said you did not understand what I meant. If you want to accuse me of turning my coat, at least do the effort of digging two contradicting quotes.<br>
<br>
&gt;On an internet forum, you are what you write.<br>
<br>
At least I back my arguments with valid logic...<br>
<br>
&gt;You only want to think EXACTLY what you want to think.<br>
<br>
Well... I would worry that evil aliens were conspiring to control my mind if that weren't the case. Where's that psychic hotline number already ?<br>
<br>
&gt;well, you actually stated in a post that he is a genius<br>
<br>
And I would think his academic track record would tend to corroborate that. Of course, labelling someone a genius is rather subjective... since even someone like Staline could be quoted as a political genius. I may respect someone's accomplishment without endorsing his ideology or values (note : I -do- tend to think his 1996 editorial to be rather spot on until someone can prove me otherwise). But anyway, generative grammars are the basis of software compilers and how computer languages grammars are optimised into discrete automatons. The direct application of his work was the B language, which has now become the almost universal C. The Everquest client was written in C/C++. Everquest servers, just like all the old MUDs out there, are massive OO language interpreters (LPC or other derivatives) and also make extensive use of those grammatical principles. So yes, most of modern software engineering would probably not be quite the same without this (it would look like Cobol actually... but since you probably have never written any, i doubt you have any idea how truely evil this language is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
&gt;they bash America in some way<br>
<br>
We dont bash America, we point out what we see as problems with several political issues currently in the air. It is your right not to agree with us, but if you are going to try to convince us that we are wrong, then attack our arguments, don't just label us with what you conceive as being derogatory terms. So far for every argument advanced, all we heard back was &quot;LALALA I can't hear you ! You are all a bunch of America haters&quot;. I can't wait to have kids of my own... and no I wont leave them on the backseat of my car.
