I maintain still that we've not given enough time.  We've found mobile units (which I've mentioned till I'm blue in the face), terrorist training camps (which ARE in Saddam's country, even if you believe they are of &quot;no consequence&quot;, tell that to the victims of 9-11 you piece of excrement), and the like.  The documents and research were also on the order for disclosure, but no one sees those as a threat.<br>
<br>
You think I HONESTLY give two fucks about Mustard Gas, outside his using it on innocent civilians?  Its the fucking research/purchasing he can do with the BILLIONS he has stockpiled instead of providing food to the dying, hungry people in his streets.  Blame the sanctions if you want (you're an unintelligent fool if you do), but HE chose to disobey, not the US or the UN, or the people he controlled.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, go ahead and list your names and act like this is the RSI forum.  It isn't.  It's the fucking FLAME board.  If you can't stand the heat, get out of the bowels Tapeworm.  I prefer this forum because I can use a sledgehammer here if I want to, and no moderator is going to do anything about it.  That, and most of the fuckers here know what the Flameboard is really about.  <br>
<br>
If I still played EQ and met any of these people in game, I'd hope they came here to fuck with people and vent like I do, and wouldnt take this shit to the game, but ya know what?   That's their baggage either way, if they don't know how to play rough, they should stay in the pussified moderated forums.<br>
<br>
 I believe we're far from seeing all there is to see in Iraq, but even if I'm wrong, you don't understand.  I quite simply don't give a flying fuck.  If he had to lie to get to Saddam, I'm 110% fucking for it.  I don't believe he did, but I also don't fucking CARE.  Get it now retard?<br>

Seems to me that if you're going to make arguments about Iraq based on evidence of WMDs falling into terrorist hands and terrorist training camps, there's a SHITLOAD more evidence of both things going on right here in the USA.  Or do you deny that Al Qaeda camps were/are running in the US, and that american army strains of anthrax were used as a terrorist weapon?<br>

<br>
No matter how anyone tries to spin it, the reason over which the US went to war was a combination of *many* things, which included Bush's claim over WMDs, and the main goal was to protect and expand US national interest.<br>
<br>
To suggest Bush did it out of the goodness of his heart in order to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people is an insult to the intelligence of everyone who knows anything about recent Middle Eastern history. Being free from Saddam's shadow is an fortunate result of the war for the Iraqi people, not the goal. How much will their lives improve depends on the length of US occupation, and whether or not the new government functions as poorly as previous governments that the US helped set up.<br>
<br>
Before you get all indignant, ask yourself a few questions. Do you honestly believe the US would selflessly go to war just to promote the general welfare of the citizens of the world? Bush lead the US to war in order to eliminate a thorn in his side, to extend US influence in the Middle East, and to control the vast oil reserves of Iraq. On the other hand, the French, among others, tried to protect their investments in Iraqi oil contracts by manuvering in the UN. There are no saints and no devils in this war, just a few countries trying to do what is most beneficial to their national interest.<br>
<br>
The rest of the world has a right to criticize the US for acting alone and for ignoring the UN. In fact, if, say, Russia went to war for similar reasons, the US would be the first to cry bloody murder. However, while the world community has a right to protest, complain, and offer advice, the right to make the final decision rests with the US government, and just like any other sovereign nation, it needs to do what is best for its national interest. Or in this case, what its leader deemed best for its national interest.<br>
<br>
During the course of the events that lead up to war, everyone in the world watched the US government go against many things it preached in the past in order to further its national interest. The world saw that in reality, no matter how much a country speaks of certain ideologies, it will toss them all aside when it perceives its interests are being threatened. Bush's gamble may yet pay off personally, but the US will be criticized as long as it maintains control over Iraqi oil.<br>
<br>
Lastly, here is something worth noting. It is possible that if the US had not portrayed itself as morally superior to everyone else in the past, Bush's questionable reasons for war might not have generated nearly as much criticism.<br>

Seems to me you're going an awful long way out of the way to dodge the truth about camps in Iraq.  I don't give a fuck about anything else right now, because it has no bearing on the truth of the statement...<br>
<br>
There were three terrorist training camps in Iraq.  Do you fucking think that Terrorist camps would be in downtown Bahgdad, idiot?  Because they're out in the middle of nowhere that invalidates them?  You're some fuckin piece of work you mongoloid fucktard.<br>
<br>
As for the units being abandoned..  another stupid attempt to invalidate the TRUTH that they exist.  What goddamned difference does it make that it was abandoned.  By that logic, if we find a Chemical Weapons FACTORY and all the workers and soldier have left, you're dumbass would say, &quot;it's abandoned, there's no proof it was used&quot; or some similar bullshit.   What a fucking pathetic and lifeless joke you are.<br>
<br>
And as to US strains of Anthrax, are they wearing an American Flag or something?  Who cares where they were created?  Some sick motherfucker used them, whether American or not, and should be shot in his face.<br>
<br>
I bet you're the Grand Dragon of Podunk Tuwene.  You've got the mentality for it.  How do you feel about interracial marriage?  Do you hate the Jew and the Black man?  Fess up punk.

<br>
Heh.  Really?  So its a bad thing for us to ignore the UN, but it's ok for Saddam to do it for a decade?  The rest of the world is supposed to BE the UN, who in fact failed miserably on all fronts throughout this entire fiasco.<br>
<br>
To be given the power to govern the WORLD, and then to let some petty third world dictator show you his backside in defiance for a decade is unexcuseable.  The UN is a poorly set up organization if it can be crippled for so long by some of it's members actions.  Once a sanction or action is decided upon, they should follow through.<br>
<br>
If I were ordered in the United States to dismantle the tank I'd built in my back yard, and to produce any plans for creating more, you can bet that I could expect an inspector to come make sure it was done, and produce a legal search warrant to make sure of it.  If I told him &quot;no&quot;, you can also bet it wouldn't take 10 years for the police to arrest me or kill me if I resisted.<br>
<br>
Why should it be any different for the UN?  They establish world law, and should goddamn well enforce it.  Shame on them for not doing so, and shame on them for not giving the boot to nations that would stall the process that long.  There should be NO way to stall the process once a resolution has been passed, and an INTERNATIONAL force comprised of troops from all member nations should enforce the goddamned law the SECOND they are delinquent.<br>
<br>

Of course not, but that is the argument he used to get the US public behind it and to attempt to give it legitamcy under international law. Any other reason except an imminent threat to our national security would have failed to get public support (imo).<br>

True that.<br>

I think Bosnia was for pure reasons. Arleanna suggested there were ulterior motives, but never ellaborated, though we had no pony in that race as far as I could see.<br>

<br>
There are no devils if you (again) believe the end justifies the means. If the police plant evidence to get a murderer off the street, then obviously people are safer, but is the danger of having police mistakenly plant evidence on an innocent person worth that safety?<br>
<br>
In this case we have the danger of a pre-emptive strike policy that has the very real potential to go seriously wrong, 100 american lives lost and over 4k Iraqi civilian lives lost, not to mention increased terrorist recruitment and activity... not going to go through the whole list again, but people need to consider those things when asking themselves if this &quot;show of resolve&quot; was worth the price.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The rest of the world has a right to criticize the US for acting alone and for ignoring the UN. In fact, if, say, Russia went to war for similar reasons, the US would be the first to cry bloody murder. However, while the world community has a right to protest, complain, and offer advice, the right to make the final decision rests with the US government, and just like any other sovereign nation, it needs to do what is best for its national interest. Or in this case, what its leader deemed best for its national interest.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That's all fine and good except you left out on very important fact... like it or not, the US has reached a point where our influence has so saturated the globe that we basically set policy for the world. Is pre-emption a good policy to apply?<br>
<br>
We used to be seen as a benign giant who stirred once in awhile, but only when prodded. Now we are seen more as a angry dog who will bite whther provoked or not. Personally I don't see this as more destabilizing than anything else.<br>

I'd prefer to call it a Vigilante strike or something of the like.  We waited on the UN Law to work, and when it didn't we made it happen.  Pre-Emptive intimates that we struck before the other party.  I don't happen to believe that Iraq was EVER going to actually strike at the US aside from sponsoring terrorist activities (talking the camps that DO have bearing imo, reguardless of whether or not they do to you).<br>
<br>
Saddam was given every opportunity to disarm and provide proof of such.  If the US used the whole UN Sanction thing to set up so we could go in and get a better grip on the MidEast, its something we're unlikely to know for certain.  For now, there will just be two sides.<br>
<br>
I support my government, and if Bush is setting up poor policies (which I believe is happening with the Patriot Act and the current rash of tax cuts) and making bad choices, thank god we have an opportunity in 2004 to set that right through election.<br>
<br>
Before I hear the BS about how he rigged the election to get in, please stop.  That's old shit, and it's history.  I don't believe it, and won't be swayed by anyone.  If ANYONE was going to rig an election, they would NOT have made it that close.<br>
<br>
The policy I feel we set was that if the UN is too pussified to follow through on their own declarations, at least one member of it won't be.  Anyone who would strike in a pre-emptive fashion has that ingrained into them anyway, and any examples we set won't change that, or make them believe it is any more ok than they thought before the war.<br>
<br>
Ah.. and NO ONE here suggested for one second that freeing the Iraqis was anything but a good end to this.  No one to my knowledge suggested that as a reason for the conflict.<br>

I don't know, I don't believe Florida was rigged from the beginning, but I do believe there was some shady shit done to keep minorities from voting (who usually vote democratic) and Florida even payed off on a lawsuit that accused them of just that. Paying off doesn't mean you are guilty of course, but it does make it appear that you prbably are.<br>
<br>
Either way, my concern is with the elctronic voting machines that were made by a company owned by hardline conservatives and that some states where these machines were used had some very surprising wins by republican who exit polls showed had no chance of winning.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't be such a big deal if the machines has some audit option so you could go back and verify the results, but they don't.<br>
<br>
Could be nothing, but it might be something and any system used should be able to be audited by some paper trail imo.<br>

But then you are saying that the US is somehow wiser than all those who disagreed (which were many more than just France, Germany and Russia btw - those just happened to be the ones with veto power) and that somehow we have the authority to intercede in matters that don't concern us.<br>
<br>
I don't think any one nation should have that much power, even if it's benign 99% of the time. If any nation has to have that power, I am glad it is the US as we have alot of internal checks and balances to keep us from abusing that power, but I think this war shows that even those safeguards are no guarentee that there won't be abuse.<br>

That depends on the Iraqis though, doesn't it? If they end up having intertribal wars and just end up with a dictator as bad or worse than Saddam in the ned, will they really be any better off?<br>
<br>
Hopefully that won't happen, but if you are honest you have to at least acknowledge that possibility. Sometimes a known evil is better than an unknown one. But that is a question that only tyime can answer. For what it's worth thoguh, I truly hope Iraq does end up being better off after all this so it won't be a total waste. <p><br><br><br>

Afraid I'm still of the mind that the jury's out on that one.  They're digging up new mass graves in Iraq in alarming numbers, if there were things hidden, I think more time will bear that out.

I have to tell you while I acknowledge it could happen, I have to also acknowledge I don't care.  We gave them the right to decide for themselves, and if they happen to choose a descent into anarchy and tribal war, then we still gave them something they didn't have before.  A choice.  A known evil in my book is an evil best fought and desposed of, unknown evils can be faced and overcome.  Why tolerate evil of that magnitude at all.  To be worse than Saddam, that evil would probably require being deposed again anyway, even if it weren't by the US.<br>

You spent a lot of energy pointing out that it's natural the camps were in rural areas, but forgot to address the fact that we have/had Al-Qaeda camps in the US, as well.<br>
<br>
This either means that a) camps can be everywhere, and the fact they exist doesn't even remotely prove that the government of the country they're &quot;supporting&quot; those camps or b)  the US government supports Al-Qaeda camps.<br>
<br>
As for the WMD labs, the FBI was looking at domestic terrorists using home-grown anthrax.  This further goes to show that either a) the central government can't completely contain terrorists within its borders, or prevent them from getting that government's WMDs, or b) the US government sponsored anthrax attacks against.. itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/03 12:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=234>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la</span><hr size=1> What's to address, you shitstain?

<br>
The US government doesn't have a history of supporting terrorism, while Saddam does.  Does that factor into your Idiot Math, maggot?<br>
<br>
As for what the FBI was looking into, I'm sure you have your l33t inside connections feeding this to you, or you'll quote some fuckwad reporter who apparently does.  Even so, the fact remains, Iraq was NOT the US.  We have freedoms here Tapeworm (which you revel in, despite railing against your government).  Iraqis DID NOT.<br>
<br>
That means they lived under the constant influence and supervision of a government that would kill them if they broke the law, not slap them on the wrist.  One of the &quot;negatives&quot; of Freedom is that even lawbreakers have it, and so the government here does not have the control it had there.  People have rights here, the only right they had there was to Obey or to Die.<br>
<br>
See the difference dipshit, or do I need to draw pictures for you?  We can't completely contain terrorists within OUR borders because until they commit acts of terror they're free to act any way they wish.  Iraq is different by far, and any activities of that sort were sponsored by the government or would have been expunged.

The Director of the CIA, George Tenet, has named a team of investigators to scour the classified intelligence reports that were circulated inside the government before the war on a range of issues related to Iraq, including those concerning Baghdad's links to terrorism and unconventional weapons, officials said. (Again man no idea who the officials are, so it must be a fake investigation.)<br>
<br>
The team plans to compare those reports with what has actually been discovered in Iraq since the war ended (Which is nothing)<br>
<br>
The review will wncompass reports produced by the CIA, NIC, and DIA along with a number of other agencies. <br>
<br>
With the war over and the review under way, the climate within the intelligence community has changed sharply.<br>
<br>
The failure so far to find proof of either Iraq's ties to al-Qaeda or unconventional weapons has added urgency to the study.<br>
<br>
A senior official (again no name so it is all a lie) cautioned that the review is not a &quot;witch hunt&quot;<br>
<br>
The review will focus on a few sensitive issues, includung whether the US overstated Iraq's program to develop Bio/Chem. weapons, according to officials.&quot; <br>

Just found a better (full) post here by Loegan<br>
<br>
I'll give you all the time in the world to find the major stockpiles that were threatening the US and the world, but your not going to find them.<br>
<br>
This wr was ment to secure security in the region and the world. What has happened since? Numerous bombings, a falling respect for American policy world wide, lowered safety for American and Westerners abroad etc etc.... Oh ya, thanks for increasing global security.<br>
<br>
I have to ask Dante, have you ever admited to being wrong before? Not saying you are in this thread or not, but your name calling and agitation and failure to acknowledge the possibility that others could be right seems to imply to me that you cannot admit to being wrong. Your closed minded nature to alternative points of view is another matter entirely.<br>

Hello lowest number of terrorist incidents in 30 years in 2002. Watch it decrease even further in 2003. OH MY GOD, AL QAEDA'S ATTACKED ONCE WITH BOMBS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE IRAQ WAR... IN SAUDI ARABIA!! Thanks for increasing global security, indeed. <br>
