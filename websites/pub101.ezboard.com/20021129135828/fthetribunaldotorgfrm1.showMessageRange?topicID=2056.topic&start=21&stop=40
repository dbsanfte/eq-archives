<br>
Whether or not I find time in the near future is entirely based on my workload.  If I have the time, while I am at home, I will have it done.  If not, so be it. it'll have to wait till I do get some time.<br>
<br>
I find it so fucking funny that you are bitching.  You are one of the morons I am talking about.  It isn't like I charged you a fucking fee to enter the contest. I was giving shit away that I dont need.  It's kinda like shit in RL, no matter how good the giveaway is, theres always the moron who complains that it isnt enough.<br>
<br>
Lol now you complain that I never had the money and will never give it out?  Prove this, asshole.  Crimson Robe of Alendine at the time I sold it was 35-40k, Add in every possession that I could sell and you dont think my entire character could easily gather 110kpp?  Fuck dude, just about any char can make that much when they sell everything they have.  But you're too much of a dildo and think that pp in EQ is fucking worth something.  <br>
<br>
From what you're telling me, you think that I actually took time out of my fucking life to post some bogus contest giving away cash just to see who would enter it so that I can laugh at them? Lol, do you actually think like this?  Are you actually that moronic?  Do you actually think that I would either find the situation funny or take the time out of life to waste it on such a dumb post?  Dude, if you're naieve enough to complain about an honest contest (that you didn't have to put down a fucking cp to enter, mind you) then youre a retard.<br>
<br>
Oh, I got it, you're probably one of those people who I had to deal with as a guildleader who said stupid shit like 'someone in your guild did someone bad to someone else some other time.  I dont know who did what to who or when they did it but they must be /guildremoved because I think that is the right thing to do.'  If so dude, take this time to go fuck yourself.<br>
<br>
The contest was a good idea (imho) and was offered with good intentions (and the money to back it up).  Just because you wouldn't do something for someone else and would rather have all your shit deleted with your account doesn't mean I never intended on handing the prize out. <br>
<br>
You should spend some time away from your computer. I know it's hard, but try to find a place where people don't make fun of you and grab a book, or go buy some tickets to a football game or something.  EQ is fun, there are some cool people in it, but you take the game far too seriously, chief.<br>

And when someone calls you on it, you desperately try to distract everyone from the simple truth that you're a liar. Anyone else find it amusing that he resorts to penis size insults? I'm quite happy with mine, thanks, Olav.<br>

Before you even posted, I disqualified myself from the competition (see above). The &quot;greed&quot; arguments don't work.<br>
<br>
P.S. - Here's what Olav promised the Tribunal community: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1818.topic">pub101.ezboard.com/fthetr...1818.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

I do not plan on playing anymore, but my account has some decent money. The winner of this competition will receive the approx. 115 kPP that I raised when I sold my items.<br>

Did he announce a winner yet?  I must of missed it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, you're all wasting your time trying to get this guy to fork over the money.  You have just as much luck getting that fungi tunic back from Bacc Stabb.  VI isn't going to help you, the board moderators can't help you, not even George W. Bush can help you.  So he lied (or whatever), get over it.  It's not like he charged you for entering.  <br>
<br>
You should of had your doubts when Olav said that he hasn't been on for over a year.  I'm not saying that this was his plan from the start, but would you by a TV from the back of some guys car and not expect it to be stolen?  I wouldn't spend the 15-30 minutes it takes to install EQ, wait online for hours waiting for you to log on, then having to run to your lazy ass to give you the money.<br>

Free time? lol. Has it occurred to you that the only time I have to post is while im at work?  Now, posting to an internet forum is a bit different than installing eq at work.  When you know about an executive workload, I would be very happy to discuss free time with you my friend.  <br>
<br>
Lol Grozzer, who the fuck are you besides a n00b with a small prick?  You complain that i didnt give away free money.  Wow dude, tell me what exactly you caught me on?  Are you actually trying to brag to the world that you unearthed some elaborate scheme that I had to tell someone they were going to win some cash and then just not deliver?  Are you also they type of dude who would bitch at a druid because he didnt give you the buffs that you needed to PL your way towards 60?  Lol man, I was playing EQ far before the thought ever entertained your mind.  Whereas there are others who played it longer, I'm imagining that you didnt enter the game until at least after Velious was released and are one of those whiny pricks that could've never gotten to 60 without the help of the early generation of EQ players.  <br>
<br>
As far as strutting around... lol dude, what crack are you on?  You're right, I strut around wearing nothing but a thong telling people how good I am because I make fun of people... HAHAHAHAHAHA dude, your crack must be high quality shit.  First the conspiracy theory, now this.<br>
<br>
Insulting those who play the game? LOL, Normal people play EQ just as normal people are in RL...  I only insult the morons in EQ as well as in RL.  I am nice to people who aren't morons.  Just because you happen to fall in the moron side of the line, dont take it out on everyone else.<br>
<br>
Estevan, lol you lack the most important part of your story, Motive.  Tell me, dickhead, what possible reason does one have to offer something and then not give it out? <br>
<br>
Don't think someone could get over 100kpp?  Just because you can't doesn't mean it cant be done.  I paid close to 100k for a fucking horse when I was playing. Fucking easy, was a cobalt bracer &amp; greaves set. Lol as I said before, try to sell all the items on your char, bet you'd come close.    <br>
<br>
Actually dude, the only motive I had was to give some shit away (which I did in a couple of Olav's grab bags, just not the main prize... yet) and have people share their journey through the years.  If you see it another way, that's your choice.  not my fault you would never consider doing something for nothing.<br>
<br>
So what was my motive for announcing the contest?  Did I steal peoples screenshots in an elaborate plot to sell them on the black market? Heh, you better get with Grozzer and expose this conspiracy.

<br>
But I agree with Estevan and Grozzer.  You don't come on here and make up some fictional contest to stoke your own ego, getting everyone to jump to your wishes then withdraw the prize you dangled in front of them that got them to do it after you've filled up the talcum-laced sock you use to whack off in.  That not only screams 'low self-esteem attention whore, please somebody talk to me!' but also 'pathetic panty-waist welsher'.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> welsh</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->   Pronunciation Key  (welsh, welch) also welch (welch)<br>
intr.v. 1.) To swindle a person by not paying a debt or wager. <br>
2.) To fail to fulfill an obligation. <br>
<br>
Whether anyone paid to get into it or lost anything by doing it is irrelevant.  You posted a contest, with a verbally agreed upon prize, then went back on it.  If I signed up on www.pch.com to win the millions they offer, I didn't spend anything -- and sure as hell if I won come the next Superbowl and they rescind the award, I'd be fucking pissed.  And so would anyone else.<br>

You're an executive, with an executive workload, but all your free time is at work, where all your 'Im so busy I can only play video games that are NOT EverQuest' time is at home.  That's facinating.  So what kind of executive is busy only when he's NOT at work?  I would like to submit my resume to your boss, I think I could do your job better than you. <p><br>

<br>
Whether you believe I have the money or not doesn't much matter to me.  If you're dead set on proof that Olav had the cash, you can work shit out with Verant and get the account reactivated.  Station name is Cerrano, PW is MightyMighty.  Best of luck, and I won't expect an apology once you find out the cash is in the bank of Parappa Drappa (lvl 30 bard) (it could also be in the bank of VietkongHookah, Female Ogre shaman?).  However, dont be a jackass... give at least some of the cash to the winner.<br>
<br>
Dvinstat et al. - Plain &amp; simple, I put the contest out there to give someone some shit I was never going to use.  Ya it was shitty that I wasnt able to get the cash out to anyone, but my RL comes above any obligations in EQ.  It was always my intention to pay the winner. However, I wasn't able to return in time to follow through.  To that end, I apologize to everyone who entered.  BTW, so I have a sock, you got a problem with that? Nice use of the word Welch btw. Going to have to add that one to my vocabulary.<br>

Executive what? I have an 'executive workload' too and I am well paid for it. I'm not playing EQ this week because I have major deadlines to meet. But at other times, I have something called 'time management skills' that enable me to play some EQ and perhaps even follow through on my promises. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2056.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2056.topic&start=41&stop=57>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2056.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2056.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2056.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2056.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2056.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2056.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2056.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
