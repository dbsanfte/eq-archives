Ah beastly creature!</span><hr size=1> Ladida, that is &quot;Titus&quot;. Shakespeare's first success, and his most violent play ever. It is, like all Shakespeare's stuff, very hard to understand, but well worth the effort. I've seen the movie twice so far, still looking forward to seing it again, and picking up more stuff from it. Aaron the moor is amazing. The movie is amazing. I admit, it is very vulgar of me to splash such a violent image up like this. And it sort of ruins it for people, but hey, I don't have any hopes of turning people onto Shakespeare, I don't think. <br>
<br>
But for those that have seen it, this image is just a nightmare. Steven King, Clive Barker, eat yer hearts out, doesn't matter WHAT damn special effects you got on your side bud -- Shakespeare got you beat hands down, done it iwth a helluvalot more style and class than joo'll ever had, and he's been around for 500 years -- and will still be around in 500 years, when fucking &quot;Pet Cemetary&quot; and &quot;It&quot; will be long forgotten. <br>

Joo know wut? There was this good ol' boy, lived in Ft. Myers his entire life, never been outside the state of Florida. I was working there, and asked the guy if he wanted to join us fer lunch. Japanese. We asked, if he'd been to a Japanese place before, he had not. But he'd been to a Chinese joint -- once. But he'd heard about this raw fish stuff, he didn't want none o' that. We offered to order something for him, but no, he didn't want that either. So he made a random pick, and ended up with some seriously weird stuff. Octopus tentacles were sticking out of this bowl, it was a &quot;challenging&quot; dish. He took one sniff at it, and didn't touch it. It was awesome. Next day, he said he were off fer lunch, and I asked him, jokingly, if he'd try some sushi this time, and he replied HEEEELLL NO, I'M HAVIN' RIEEEBS, I AINT EATIN' NON' O' THAT VIET CONG SHIET NO MORE. <br>

Wes Craven has nothing on the Bard.<br>
<br>
Poor Titus' daughter is ravaged by the sons of the Queen of Goths. Formerly his prisoner, now the empress of Rome. They cut off her hands, and cut out her togue. I know it sounds like a fucked up plot line, but watch it and you'll get the idea. Titus id forced to kill one of his own sons out of loyalty to the emporer and the others are killed in a plot by Arron to frame them for another murder of the emporer's bother. Arron tricks Titus into cutting of his own hand (He's a cunningly evil bastard), and his eldest son is banished from Rome. There's some good interacial sex and about a dozen more murders along the way.<br>
<br>
So what does this mean ol fuck do to avenge all this? He bakes the empress' sons in a pie and feeds it to her. Oh, after he kills his own daughter, of course.<br>
<br>
This movie is the contemptible side of human nature, and not in a &quot;oh my, the big-titted blonde is about to get knifed&quot; kind of way. Those movies are good too, but nothing is better than a trip to the darkside of human behavior with Shakespeare.<br>

Aaron's confession is the best damn monologue in the world, makes Hanibal Lecter look like Kermit the frog<br>
<br>
Lucius: &quot;Are you not sorry for these heinous deeds?&quot;<br>
Aaron: &quot;Yes, I am sorry I had not done a thousand more. Even now I curse the day that I did not do some notorious ill, as kill a man, or else devise his death, ravish a mad, or plot the way to do it, make false accusations on someone innocent, make deadly enemies of good friends, make poor men's cattle break their necks, set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night, and bid the owners quench them with their tears. Oft have I dug up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends' door, even when their sorrow almost was forgot, and carved upon their skins, &quot;Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead&quot;. I have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly. And nothing grieves me more, that I cannot do ten thousand more.&quot;<br>

Ah beastly creature!</span><hr size=1> The examination of the darker sides of the human personality is something that people have an unhealthy obsession with. For some people, it is is manifested by them seeking it out, rolling in it like some demented pig in their own filth, or holding it up in others' faces, to shock them. <br>
<br>
But there is another obsession, that nobody notices, but nearly everyone has: the unhealthy obsessive notion that the darker sides of human behavior must be avoided at all cost; never spoken of; never thought of. <br>
<br>
It is (I think) important to understand what makes us tick. To understand that a mob of people would do things that the people would never dream of doing, if single -- a crowd can change human behavior more than any drug can (well nearly). I am not saying that criminals shouldn't be punished. I am saying we shouldn't think &quot;He/she/they are a monster, a beast, destroy them&quot;. Well go ahead destroy em, but you must consider that whatever made that human do such evil acts -- although not an excuse, perhaps an explanation may be found? <br>
<br>
Movies with a big payback, revenge, are always popular. People DO have a dark side, an evil side. Every vicious act that has been comitted by one person upon another, you could find someone out there, that seems perfectly peaceful, but under the right circumstances would do the same exact thing. Most people really cherish the idea of revenge. <br>
<br>
And in fact, the acts depicted here were done in revenge for other deeds. The fall of an Empire, the descent of a man, murder, madness. <br>

The director of this fantastic tale isn't just some horror-movie freakzoid either. Julie Taymor created and directed &quot;The Lion King&quot; on Broadway.  <p><p>Minng Merciless<BR>

Ah beastly creature!</span><hr size=1> My dark side is something that I've somehow come to respect and even sometimes embrace.  I find that being in touch with this side helps to control it.  I am not scared to admit that I have a very short fuse when it comes to certain things, and the penalty for crossing that line is not something that most people would ever want to contend with. To give you a bit of backround before you write me off as a nut, I'm the oldest of three boys and both of my younger siblings have learning disabilities and chemical imballances, OCD, ADHD and Bipolar disorder (Manic Depression) among others.  As a result, I've had to grow up fairly quickly.  In this growing up, I've had to deal with a lot of situations that a teenager shouldn't be faced with.  A lot of these challenges have made me a lot stronger, and have enabled me to become in tune with all aspects of myself, good and bad.  This is where the dark side comes in.  In October of 2000, someone in a play I was in decided to haze my little brother, since the school refused to do anything about it, I made it CRYSTAL clear to him that if he even tried anything with any of my friends or my family, he would not be a happy camper.  When people force me into a possition where I have to let out a bit of my other side, things happen, but they remain controlled.  Another example is slightly more recent.  A different individual has sort of a personal vendetta against me in the sense of &quot;The Prince&quot;.  Well, after a confrontation in which I recieved a stab wound to the upper arm.  After he stuck me, the dark side came out totally. However, unlike the Dark side in titus, again, it was controlled.  I broke his arm, three ribs, dislocated a sholder and several fingers (Yes, that's controlled when the fucker wants to kill you).  The police ruled it self defence and this boy is spending a very long time in jail.  Being intune with both sides has saved my life several other times.<br>
<br>
I may have lost my point somewhere, so let me say it again.  I think that being in tune with both sides is important to being a whole and adjusted person.  It just  has to be in balance. Feel free to disagree and/or flame.
