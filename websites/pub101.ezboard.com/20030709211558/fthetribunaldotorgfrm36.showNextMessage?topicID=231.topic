Martinez - Legalizing Police Torture</span><hr size=1> Well, my read is that the officer saw the knife and made a split second decision that the man was an active threat. I can't fault the police there.<br>
<br>
Then however, it seems they decided to take out some insurance to make sure they got a clean shooting report and made up the part about the man trying to grab an officers gun. Unfortunatly, unless the non-shooting officer breaks and testifies against his partner, there is little chance of proving it. Of course the partner won't testify against the shooter... your life depends on your partner. You never, ever burn him.<br>
<br>
The interrogation of a critically wounded man in obvious agony is truly frightening. Even more frightening is the fact that even though his statements can't be held against him in court (under the 5th Ammendment), their stance is that any evidence obtained as a result of the statement is admissible... what BS. Any evidence gained from a coerced statement should be considered &quot;fruit of the poison tree&quot; and not allowed in court (unless they can clearly show that it is evidence they would have obtained without the confession of course).<br>
<br>
I knew Bush would support some tyrannical shit, but this is extreme for even a conservative. Truly, truly frightening. <p><br>

It was dark, maybe he flailed around and put his hand on the gun without even realizing it... maybe he was actually reaching for it... maybe he wasn't.  I don't know.  It was pretty important that they find out, though.<br>
<br>
I can't believe you're quoting Huey Long about something like this.  You DO know who he was and what he did... right?<br>
<br>
Conspiracy theory nuts... sigh.<br>

Let the police do their job.<br>
<br>
This ties in directly to the information thread everyone's so up in arms about.  People who are innocent have nothing to fear from government knowledge of terrorist or illegal activity, quite the opposite.  Obviously applying torture to extract information is wrong and should not happen; it did not happen in this case.  Information acquired by interrogating people who have said they don't want to talk, while inadmissable in court, can be critical in an investigation.  It doesn't bother me.<br>
<br>
Of course, everyone's argument to the contrary is, &quot;But it opens up America to enormous abuse of the power granted by the information collected!&quot;  Yeah... well... all the more reason to keep Republicans in power instead of Democrats, huh?

I doubt seriously that the knife was ever seen by her, much less that Martinez even thought to use it.  The guy paniced and desperately tried, right up until Martinez was drugged, to get him to admit he tried to grab his gun thus justifying the shooting.<br>
<br>
Cops are people too, these two sound like a couple of kids that lost their cool in a big way.  The female cop should be brought up on charges for excesive use of force, the male cop for the nazi interrogating.<br>

Questioning a critically injured person or a person who is in pain is BS and you know it... especially if you are part of the system that injured him.<br>
<br>
And no, the interrogator didn't torture him... he didn't need to. The man was already in extreme pain, so inflicting more would most likely only result in the man going unconscious. How much do you want to bet that he wanted to delay the man receiving any pain meds until he got the answer he wanted though? The officer knew that a person in severe pain is extremely open to suggestion and also under enough physical and mental duress to tell him anythin he wanted to hear. Not only did the officer interrogate him, he led him to the answers he wanted.<br>
<br>
So what do we allow interrogators next? Withholding medical care until a person confesses? Threatening physical harm as long as they don't actually go through with it? Using sleep deprevation? Chemical interrogation? Questioning a man who is critically injured and in extreme pain can be nearly, and in some cases more effective as any of these other techniques.<br>
<br>
I will be so thankful when Bush finally leaves office. The man is out of control. It's obvious no matter how much Iraq complies, he is still going to try to go in there. And now he is fucking with our right at home as well.<br>
<br>
Then again, when a man touts the death penalty as deterrent, but ran a state who executes more people than all other states combined and still has one of the highest crime rates... it's clear that the obvious eludes him.<br>
<br>
Fuckin madness. <p><br>

The police didn't fire because the man was grabbing for the gun.  They fired because he tried to run, was then tackled, and had a weapon on him.  The assisting officer had to make a quick decision, without knowing if his partner was in immediate danger or not.<br>

The right to remain silent and the right to a fair trial are firmly entrenched in Australian common law couresty of Hall vs The Queen, Petty vs The Queen and Dietrich vs The Queen, and more further expanded upon in Azzopardi vs The Queen. Said rights are also affirmed by the various Federal, State and Territory statues, which include several others such as the right to contact a legal representative before interrogation and the right to not have excessive force used in the process of arrest. What happened in Chavez v Martinez would not even be remotely legal in Australia. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/4/02 5:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chavez v.
