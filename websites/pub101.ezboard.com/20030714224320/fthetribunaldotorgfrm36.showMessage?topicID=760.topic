He's posted <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://foi.missouri.edu/polinfoprop/warcrime.html">this</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> particular New York Times piece by Stephen Pelletiere a few times to point out the doubts. After looking into it myself for a bit I gotta say that Mr. Pelletiere was simply looking for attention to sell his book, because he distorts or ignores a few facts in order to make his case.<br>
<br>
To make it quick, quoting from the Spinsanity website (which just recently <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://spinsanity.org/columns/20030630.html">ripped up</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Ann Coulter):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Another persistent myth in wide circulation is that Iraq never used poison gas against Kurdish civilians, a point often cited by those opposed to war. The main source of this myth is a series of articles, including a January New York Times op-ed by former CIA Iraq analyst Stephen Pelletiere (who, along with two co-authors, has also written a book on the subject). The argument centers on a 1988 attack on the northern Iraq village of Halabja in which thousands of Kurdish civilians were killed. Pelletiere contends that it was Iranian gas rather than Iraqi gas which killed the Kurds, a point he substantiates by citing a US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report produced shortly after the attack which reaches that conclusion. His key piece of evidence is that &quot;The condition of the dead Kurds' bodies, however, indicated they had been killed with a blood agent - that is, a cyanide-based gas - which Iran was known to use. The Iraqis, who are thought to have used mustard gas in the battle, are not known to have possessed blood agents at the time.&quot; In a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3441">letter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> to the New York Review of Books, Pelletiere and two other authors go even further, denying that Iraq ever used gas against Kurdish civilians.<br>
<br>
Pelletiere's claims are contradicted by an <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2063934">overwhelming body of evidence</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> from multiple sources. Eyewitness accounts, including those cited in a 1993 Human Rights Watch report and survivors quoted in a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?020325fa_FACT1">2002 New Yorker article</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, point to Iraqis as the source of the gas. In addition, as Spencer Ackerman has pointed out, survivors of the gas attack had symptoms consistent with exposure to mustard gas or the nerve gas Sarin. And - in direct contradiction to Pelletiere - a 1991 DIA report noted that Iraq did, in fact, possess hydrogen cyanide gas (though it is not likely that they used it at Halabja).<br>
<br>
Other less direct evidence also points to the likelihood that it was Iraq, not Iran, who gassed the Kurds in Halabja. Human Rights Watch obtained a tape of Ali Hassan al-Majid, the Iraq commander in charge of the campaign, telling Iraqi politicians in 1987 or 1988 that &quot;I will kill them all [the Kurds] with chemical weapons!&quot; Moreover, Iraq waged a brutal campaign against Kurdish civilians in 1987 and 1988, killing at least 50,000, according to Human Rights Watch. And Physicians for Human Rights has proven conclusively through chemical analysis of soil samples that Iraq used Sarin against Kurdish civilians on at least one occasion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ackerman's piece in full:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is by now a well-established fact that chemical weapons claimed the lives of over 5,000 Kurds in the northern Iraqi town of Halabja on March 16, 1988. It is equally well-established that responsibility for this atrocity lies with Saddam Hussein. Indeed, there is virtual unanimity among the dozens of journalists, government delegations, and international human rights groups who have investigated the matter that Halabja was the first frightful act of Saddam's Anfal campaign, a genocide that consumed almost 100,000 Kurds in all. Yet according to a chilling and incoherent op-ed published in Friday's New York Times, Saddam had nothing to do with the massacre after all.<br>
<br>
The author of this revisionist account is Stephen C. Pelletiere, a retired Army War College professor who served as a senior Iraq analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency during the Iran-Iraq war. Pelletiere is the co-author of the 1990 book Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East, which concluded that Iranian gas, not Iraqi gas, murdered the Kurds at Halabja. In his Times op-ed Pelletiere recycles this argument, only this time against the backdrop of a second war with Saddam. He's no more convincing today than he was 13 years ago.<br>
<br>
Pelletiere begins by reprising the usual facts--namely, that Halabja was the site of an intense battle between Saddam and the Iranians. He first concedes that Iraq did use chemical weapons, but argues that the Iranians did as well. The Kurdish victims of the chemicals &quot;had the misfortune to be caught up in the exchange.&quot; Pelletiere then cites a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report, issued shortly after Halabja, to support his conclusion that Iranian gas killed the Kurds. His evidence? The Kurdish corpses &quot;indicated that they had been killed with a blood agent,&quot; which the Iraqis, &quot;who are thought to have used mustard gas in the battle, are not known to have possessed.&quot;<br>
<br>
But this claim is wildly implausible. First, interviews by international human rights groups with scores of Halabja survivors reveal no such confusion about who deployed the chemicals. Kurds who were outside their houses during the mid-morning attack &quot;could see clearly that these were Iraqi, not Iranian aircraft, since they flew low enough for their markings to be legible,&quot; concluded Human Rights Watch in its 1993 report Genocide In Iraq. In any case, the argument for Iranian culpability neglects the logistics of the Halabja battle itself. The Iranians, who controlled the town on March 15, would have no reason to use chemical agents against the Iraqi counteroffensive on March 16, since the Iraqis retaliated with air strikes and placed no soldiers on the ground against whom such weapons could be used.<br>
<br>
Second, even if the victims died of exposure to blood agents, this would be perfectly consistent with the claim of Iraqi responsibility. A 1991 DIA report, since declassified, concluded definitively, &quot;Iraq is known to have employed ... a blood agent, hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN) ... against Iranian soldiers, civilians, and Iraqi Kurdish civilians.&quot; Nonetheless, it is far more likely, according to the standard accounts of the attack on Halabja, that mustard gas and the nerve agents sarin and tabun--and perhaps even VX and the biological agent aflatoxin, which the Iraqis were also known to possess--were the instruments of Kurdish murder. For example, Human Rights Watch noted that survivors excreted blood-streaked urine, &quot;consistent with exposure to both mustard gas and a nerve agent such as Sarin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Third, the 1988 DIA report Pelletiere cites to pin Halabja on the Iranians was not the end of the DIA's inquiry. The DIA's April 19, 1988 cable--a month after Halabja--took note of the fact that the Iraqis were already forcibly resettling &quot;an estimated 1.5 million Kurdish nationals,&quot; including &quot;an unknown but reportedly large number of Kurds [who] have been placed in 'concentration camps' located near the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian borders.&quot; This in mind, the far more plausible story is that Halabja was part of a concerted effort to settle the Kurdish problem &quot;once and for all,&quot; in the words of an October 24, 1988 DIA report--by wiping out the Iraqi Kurdish population.<br>
<br>
This brings us to the biggest problem with Pelletiere's argument: If the Kurds were legitimate battlefield casualties, why is it Saddam subsequently felt the need to slaughter nearly 100,000 more of them? Pelletiere writes that any other examples of Saddam's chemical deployment on Kurdish victims &quot;must show that [the dead Kurds] were not pro-Iranian Kurdish guerillas who died fighting alongside Iranian Revolutionary guards.&quot; But even if Saddam's goal was to root out traitors, it's inconceivable that all or even most of the residents of the dozens of Kurdish villages Saddam subsequently razed were treacherous peshmerga, or that Saddam believed this to be the case. Certainly the testimony of hundreds of Kurdish refugees, who have provided remarkably consistent accounts of the genocide despite being dispersed from Iran to Turkey, refute this. So does the fact that Saddam kept gassing the Kurds after signing the August 20, 1988 ceasefire with Iran, as Samantha Power points out in her 2002 book, A Problem From Hell. And in unguarded moments, members of Saddam's regime have given lie to this rationale as well. Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, entrusted to carry out the Kurdish slaughter, was caught on tape at a Ba'athist meeting in May 1988 boasting about the Kurds, &quot;I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them!&quot; (Human Rights Watch believes the tape is mislabeled, recording a conversation that really took place in 1987--i.e., before Halabja.)<br>
<br>
What's perhaps most infuriating, though, is that Pelletiere is now reviving his decade-old hobbyhorse as a cynical argument against war with Iraq. &quot;President Bush himself has cited Iraq's 'gassing its own people,' specifically at Halabja, as a reason to topple Saddam Hussein,&quot; Pelletiere writes. Considering the Bush administration's &quot;lack of a smoking gun&quot; in the U.N. weapons inspections, he continues, &quot;perhaps the strongest argument left for taking us to war quickly is that Saddam Hussein has committed human rights atrocities against his own people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even if Pelletiere had his facts straight on Halabja, his would be a noxious and dishonest argument against war. To begin with, it is an insult to the principled antiwar critics who recognize and condemn Saddam's record of genocide but who still oppose an invasion of Iraq. One such critic is Maryland Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen, who as a staffer for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September 1988 visited Kurdish refugees in Turkey to determine what had happened in Kurdistan. Van Hollen's team documented Iraqi chemical attacks on 49 Kurdish villages, leading him to conclude that &quot;at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, all evidence pointed to the fact that [Saddam] used chemical weapons against the Kurds.&quot; More important, though, Van Hollen grasps the distinction that eludes Pelletiere, which is that while Bush invokes the Kurdish genocide in his brief against Saddam, the president does so to establish Saddam's willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, not to argue that, as Pelletiere ludicrously puts it, &quot;we go to war over Halabja.&quot; The only one fighting a war over Halabja, it seems, is Stephen Pelletiere. And it's one he'd lost before it had even begun.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I've not been able to find a single reply by Pelletiere to any of this stuff, or even a detailed defense of Pelletiere by a single person with decent credibility and knowledge of the subject.<br>

Well, there is little confusion with the Iraqis that the US fired a missile into that mosque. The US says there was either a weapons cache or a bomb making class that caused the incident.<br>

So does the fact that hundreds of Iraqi eye witenesses claim the US did it make it fact?<br>

<br>
Perhaps because they were trying to overthrow his government? The Kurds have been a constant of trouble for Turkey, Iraq and even Iran at times.<br>
<br>
Nobody is trying to make Saddam a good guy, but neither is he the mini-Hitler that Bush has made him out to be. I will freely admit that Saddam ruled with an iron hand, but at the same time, you didn't hear about his soldiers getting picked off by snipers or car bombed on a daily basis.... did you?<br>
<br>
Iraq is a cluster fuck of blood fueds and you have to be pretty damn scary to keep them all in line. The US will learn this - the hard way.<br>

So then we are evil as well as we have shown what we are capable of - Nagasaki &amp; Hirosima. Seems that fits the bill of mass mudering civilians.<br>

Look, CWs are just that - a weapon. We have our own stocks of them. We use Napalm which is a pretty ugly way to die. We have used CW in the past and we even have a huge cache of the most horrible weaponss ever devised imo - bio weapons.<br>
<br>
We are now trying to implement new tactical nukes for use on the battlefield and have threatened to use what we have already more than once under this administration.<br>
<br>
Saddam used CW against Iran who was also using them. We used nukes on a country who didn't have them. Do I think we are evil? Not at all.<br>

I don't know about mass muder, but we certainly murdered civilians and burned many homes. And don't even get me started on the atrocities commited on blacks, like cutting babies out of live black women and killing them in front of their faces.<br>

Kurds are not part of Iraq, Turkey or Iran. Nobody wants them, but everybody has to deal with them. They are like Palestinians - a people without a country. Do you accuse Isreal of killing their own people when they go after Palestinians? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1077<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/3/03 10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=760.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraq didn't gas the Kurds...</span><hr size=1> Going back to the original subject : this isn't the first article challenging Pelletier's article.

Your use of the euphemism &quot;methods&quot; was not meant as methods to kill civillians, it was meant as methods to retain control, basically presenting it as his only option of survival.  I don't care what kind of methods he has to kill people, i care what and who he uses them on.<br>

Kurds were born and raised in Iraq, therefore they are Iraqi.

The difference is there is a large amount of evidence that supports the witnesses in the 1988 incident. What about the facts dug up by Human Rights Watch and others?

Anyway, I will read through it. It's not that I find it hard to believe that Saddam would do such a thing, but it's just that so much of what he has done has been spun to put him in the worst possible light. Not that I am worried about his reputation mind you - I just don't like my country playing me any more than I like it when the other side does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3528<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/03 3:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=760.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraq didn't gas the Kurds...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In the first, the March 16 poison gas attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja, near the border with Iran, the Iranian authorities made it their business to show off the site to the international press within a few days of the bombing. Even so, the illusion has long persisted, fostered initially by reports from the U.S. intelligence community, which &quot;tilted&quot; strongly toward Baghdad during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, that both sides were responsible for the chemical attack on Halabja.7 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>This is false: The testimony of survivors establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Halabja was an Iraqi action, launched in response to the brief capture of the city by Iraqi peshmerga assisted by Iranian Revolutionary Guards </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->The thousands who died, virtually all of them civilians, were victims of the Iraqi regime.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
When it comes between believing our DIA/CIA or a group of Kurds who claim to have seen the markings of low flying aircraft, I chose to believe our intelligence. But even if it is true, it was in response to Iranian occupation of that city, which makes the civilians collateral damage in the attack on Iranian forces... yes?<br>
<br>
But whether or not Saddam actually gassed Halabja is not really the point I am making. The point is that he was fighting a rebellion as is even admitted by this report:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Each of these states has balked at assimilating its Kurdish minority, and each of the Kurdish groups has rebelled against the authority of its new central government. Of these traditions of rebellion, none has been more persistent than that of the Iraqi Kurds<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
They even admit that Iran too used CW:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Chemical weapons were banned by the Geneva Protocol of 1925, to which Iraq is a party, and many countries subsequently destroyed their stockpiles. While Iraq, and to a lesser extent Iran, had broken the battlefield taboo on many occasions since 1983, the Halabja and Badinan attacks marked a new level of inhumanity, as the first documented instances of a government employing chemical weapons against its own civilian population. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The problem here is that they contradict themselves by claiming the Kurds are part of his own population. I don't think that it could be any more clear they are not:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet for all their antiquity, the Kurds have never been able to form an independent political entity of their own in modern times. From the 16th to the early 20th centuries, their territories formed part of the Ottoman and Persian empires. With the collapse of the Ottoman empire after World War One, the Kurds were to be granted their independence under the 1920 Treaty of SÃ¨vres. But that promise evaporated as the nationalist movement of Kamal Ataturk seized control of the Kurdish lands in eastern Turkey and the Kurds saw their mountain homeland divided once more among four newly created states--Turkey, Syria, Iraq and the Soviet Union, and one ancient land--Iran, or Persia as it was then known. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
As I have said though, I have no problem believing Saddam is capable of such actions. Even his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, made this quote in one of the articles you provided:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them! The international community and those who listen to them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
While that doesn't confirm that Saddam felt the same way, I doubt Ali Hassan al-Majid would have lived long after making that statement if it was against the Baath party's stance. But the US paints it in a different light by claiming he gassed his own people, without making mention of their long history of rebelling against Iraq and their attempts on Saddam's life. These are not simply innocents who Saddam decided to commit genocide on one day. They are combatants who present a real threat to his government.<br>
<br>
I am not arguing that Saddam would not have done this, but rather that according to our own DIA/CIA, he did not do this and that the Kurds are combatants, not just some hapless victims of a dictators misplaced wrath. Perhaps that doesn't justify the methods used, but it does make it a different matter than presented.<br>

I worry about this type of hyperbole, considering that, although a ton of people were slaughtered on both sides, the noncombatant casualties were extremely low.
