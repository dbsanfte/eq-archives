He was a tactical numb nut.<br>

<br>
After going over all the stuff that Cook has gone on record for concerning this war, I am wondering if anyone here for the pro-war side will disagree with him.  The two points that stick most prominently in my mind are 1) WMD and their production facilities are extremely hard to hide, thus being able to hide them to the extent that the US administration is saying is not feasible, 2) to the people who keep saying he had WMD back in 91 so he must therefore have them now, these old weapons have a shelf life and they would have expired long ago.  If you do disagree, can you please explain? <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Walkabout, I don't take your rants seriously because of bits like these:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The fact that there was no substance to any of the US claims was clear to most of the world before the war.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So nice of you to mention this, as if it were both obvious and meaningful.  &quot;Most of the world&quot;, i.e. the handful of generally European nations polled at various times was opposed to war.  Now please tell me why this means that the &quot;rest of the world&quot; believes that there was no &quot;substance&quot; to US claims.  I can think of many reasons to oppose the war besides a lack of belief of substance of US claims.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Rumsfeld, Bush and Blair repeating twice each week that not only will the WMD soon be found, but proof will be presented too.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is getting really old.  You weren't given a timetable or a deadline regarding the WMD discoveries.  Chill out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The fact that it was actually discussed as if it was to be taken seriously is the &quot;coalition&quot; decided to go to full scale war on it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Here you go again with your ridiculous attitude.  &quot;Oh no - the war was all about corporate interests, Bush is the debil, I was right all along, it's so obvious!!&quot;  Maybe to yourself.  It's kind of enlightening that you throw in these tidbits, but if you're going to scream out &quot;He was lying!!  There are no WMD!!&quot;, you'd better be amazingly sure that you're right.  I'm looking forward to seeing that shoved right back down your throat.  Of course, when proof is presented, no doubt you'll say it was planted, or not enough, or some other bullshit excuse.  &quot;We all know&quot; that!!  Your arrogance is astonishing.  Those &quot;same right wing nationalist americans&quot; - the ignorant, idiotic pigs!  The &quot;rest of the world&quot; (read, Europe, generally the ones Walkabout likes) is so much smarter and more refined than them, they just won't realize it in their ignorant stupidity!  It's... obvious!<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not the one that had my country bombed, turned into anarchy and soon to be exploited by american commercial interests.&quot;<br>
<br>
So funny - you imply that Iraqis, in general, are bitter about it all.  Naturally, you assume this.  Oh, wait.  Naturally its true - you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>know</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it.  Naturally, it's also true that we're just out to exploit Iraq for our own Big Bizness, the evil fat cats that they are... Iraq is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>so obviously</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> just another victim of evil expansionist Imperialist stupid American right-wing nuts!<br>
<br>
Get a grip, Walkabout.  Quit the ranting tirades.  If you want to point out that, in the case that we do not find WMD, Bush and Blair's credibility will be hurt - go ahead.  If you want to explore the possibility now, sure... it would be interesting.  Examine, like Mr. Sullivan above, the possible explanations and outcomes of the situation.  Just please don't spout emotionally charged, intellectually insulting and meaningless garbage.  Of course, most arrogantly confident conspiracy theory nuts have a hard time saying anything based on well reasoned evidence, due to a lack of such, but hey... that's not my problem... after all, if there's no evidence, it must have simply been suppressed or lied about!  That good ol' USA back at the same old tricks, trying to dominate the world and cover it all up.  Fight, little Europeans, fight!

Maybe to you, your local GOP chapter is THE WORLD, and hence anything that goes beyond that is insignificant.  It's no secret that most of the world condemned this attack, most of the world derided US for going to war on flimsy evidence (if any evidence) and its no secret that the global opinion of US has dropped like a rock.  The real losers in this war are the American people.  Not only are they footing a gigantic bill for the war and then a bill to get Iraq back up, but they also continue to lose soldiers in there every day even though the war is over.  And what will happen after US pulls out?  The Baathists will return, religious factions will emerge and you will possibly end up with a government that is worse than what you fought against.<br>
<br>
The point is, Walkabout is right.<br>
<br>
<br>
This war was extremely short sighted.  I understand if Bush fought it for political reasons (which I dont agree with) and managed to hoodwink the American people for a short term increase in popularity.  But Americans will be paying for it for years to come not only with money but with political prestige. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1232<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/3/03 12:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=168>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Still no sign of WMD</span><hr size=1> &quot;The world&quot;.<br>

Who do you mean, exactly?  Last I checked the figures were around 70-80% of Europeans, speaking generally, opposed to the war.  Figures for Britain were much more even.  China, Africa, India, and South America, among other places, were not polled.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I don't live in a plastic bubble any more than you do, or Walkabout does.  I've lived in Europe for a considerable length of time.  I read the news in three languages, although it takes a dictionary and I don't do it all the time.  I'm not stupid, and I don't have horse blinders on.  Believe it or not, intelligent, well-informed people can disagree with you, Merton.  I'm glad you think Walkabout is right, but that's still all it is - your opinion.  Back it up, argue it, that's what the forum is for.  At least you do that much, when you're not jabbing elbows into people's ribs.  At least its fairly obvious when you're just screwing with people as opposed to making rational arguments...<br>

China and India also opposed the war.

It's one thing to go to war in the face of global opposition based on your convictions when you at least give them the consideration they deserve. But when you simply say everyone is wrong and brush them off as a focus group... that is a whole different matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makino>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/3/03 1:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=171>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://roforums.dhs.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/Avatars/mage-female.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Still no sign of WMD</span><hr size=1> Well, some Iraqis are <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=574&amp;ncid=721&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20030603/wl_nm/iraq_dc" target="top">bitter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

By Andrew Marshall <br>
<br>
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Muslim clerics led thousands of protesters through Baghdad's streets Tuesday, telling U.S. and British forces to withdraw or face violence, as Iraqi political groups demanded more say in their country's future. <br>
<br>
'PLEASE GO HOME' <br>
<br>
Many Iraqis who welcomed the fall of Saddam are growing impatient with the pace of change. Angry crowds take to the streets almost daily to demand that foreign troops leave. <br>
<br>
&quot;We advise you to leave our country or you will make enemies out of us,&quot; said Shi'ite cleric Muaaed al-Khazraji in a speech after a march by Muslim protesters to the headquarters of the U.S.-led administration. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please go home and we will be very grateful because you got rid of Saddam.&quot; <br>
<br>
The protesters, both Shi'ite and Sunni, demanded an end to body searches of Iraqi women at security checkpoints, and called for the establishment of a government run by Iraqis.<br>
<br>
Repeated attacks have been mounted on U.S. troops in Baghdad and nearby provinces. U.S. Central Command said an American soldier died Monday after a checkpoint came under small arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire near Balad, 55 miles from Baghdad. <br>
<br>
Local farmer Mahmoud al-Ubaidi said hostility toward the Americans was mounting in the town. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Iraqi people have just started war on them. The uprising of the Iraqi people has started now,&quot; he said. &quot;They are treating us in a humiliating way, searching our cars and women. We will teach them a lesson if they continue.&quot; <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I have been given some hope that the Americans corporate rebuilding of Iraq is not exactly all evil though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Bechtel, the U.S. firm given the prime contract to rebuild Iraq, said it would farm out most subcontracts to Iraqi firms, not the thousands of foreign ones clamoring for a share. <br>

What everyone else thought doesn't matter, IF WE WERE RIGHT.<br>
<br>
If there was evidence of WMDs and we did the Right Thing(tm), I will probably sleep ok at night.  However, there was no evidence.  There MAY be WMDs... some people will say until the day they die &quot;there must be!  We just haven't found them yet...&quot;  this is the same system of belief that led thousands of Spaniards to their deaths looking for the 7 Cities of Gold, though...<br>
<br>
My point continues to be, did the Bush Administration outright lie and run a propoganda campaign about WMDs?  The answer, quite clearly, is yes.  They gambled.  They were SO SURE there *HAD* to be WMDs, they lied about it, knowing in their hearts they'd find them as soon as they got to Iraq.<br>
<br>
Problem is, either a) there were no WMDs or b) they were sufficiently taken out of the picture (buired, sent to Syria, put into condoms and shoved up mexican's rectums, whatever) so that now their little bluff isn't paying off.<br>
<br>
I know *I* am pissed I was lied to on a bluff...

<br>
LONDON - A British parliamentary committee announced Tuesday it would hold an inquiry into the government's decision to go to war with Iraq.<br>
<br>
The existence of weapons of mass destruction was Prime Minister Tony Blair's crucial argument for joining the United States in military action against Iraq. Pressure on him has grown as occupying British and U.S. forces in Iraq have failed to locate chemical, biological or nuclear arms.<br>
<br>
The House of Commons Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold its inquiry in public. Its reports are usually published.<br>
<br>
Blair's office has resisted the idea of a broad independent inquiry and suggested it would favor an inquiry by the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. But that committee reports to the prime minister, not to parliament, and some lawmakers had pressed for a more open inquiry.<br>
<br>
The committee said it plans to take oral statements from witnesses in June and publish a report in July.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
