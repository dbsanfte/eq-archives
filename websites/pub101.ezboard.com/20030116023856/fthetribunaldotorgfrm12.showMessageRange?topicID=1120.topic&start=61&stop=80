Please don't ban this moron yet. I want his name due to a unexpected opening on my ignore/no rez list due to the retarded errrr retirement of Questin. The vacancy is so lonely so please fill the vacancy with my name. Also so I can do my best that you will NEVER visit high level encounter places such as Crushbone and Unrest. BTW the VV website can be found at www.visveres.com. Please come enlighten us with your useless knowledge of the game. <p><img src=http://www.rit.edu/~jgs1536/media/quote1.gif

Within a week of FoH killing Seru, AL killed him - same for Emp, Aten - I think AL they got Cursed first but that was primarly because another guild on Veeshan were in an earlier time zone and kept doing glyphed/exiled and Cursed would go to waste (this was before the basement cycle was changed) - FoH had him dead within a few days though.<br>
<br>
Triton were indeed the first guild to kill Emp, however, you have to stack that against the fact that both FoH and AL both killed Lord Seru (a 2 month time sink getting bane weapons) and then still managed to kill Emperor within a couple of weeks of Triton's kill (who hadn't done the Seru timesink). Has anyone other than than AL and FoH even killed Seru yet (I honestly don't know)? I know most top guilds went straight for Emperor and VT.<br>
<br>
FoH is definitely the higher &quot;profile&quot; guild, as far as cross-server fame goes, but in terms of &quot;ability&quot; (meaning guild efficiency and mobilisation ability more than anything else), I honestly think they are now too close to split. PoP will be the first real test of which guild is &quot;better&quot;, since they will both start in almost the exactly same position (ie. same amount of time spent in VT, same amount of Cursed/Emp/Seru/etc loot). Whichever your personal favourite is, however, there is no denying FoH and AL are the 2 top guilds in EQ.<br>
<br>
AL seem to very deliberately keep a low profile. Their guild leaders, Hobben and Thott, are very well known in their own class, but don't have the publicity (public in this case being the EQ population only =) that Furor does. Whether that &quot;fame&quot; that Furor and FoH has is a help or a hindrance - who knows =).<br>

I havent grouped with Whimsy since she was like level 40 something, and havent really seen her since Bacris hid her away. BASTARD!<br>
<br>
The only time I remember grouping with a paladin with Whimsy was Mugen and I doubt you are Mugen, cause Mugen was hella cool and wouldnt have to had a labotomy to have a frenzied spitting post like this.<br>

Really tell me who ninjaed something and when, and what. If this is true, I will personally set you up with our highest ranking officer, Minng.<br>
