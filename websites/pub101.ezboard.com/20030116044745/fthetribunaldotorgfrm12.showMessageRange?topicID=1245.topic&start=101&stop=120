A rich kid gets busted shoplifting.  While the store is holding him for the cops his parents show up.  They don't want their precisous little angle to have a record so the give the store manager $1000 to let him go.  The manager agrees to this, but the assistant manager doesn't like it.  Let's just she has an over developed sense of justice and doesn't like to see thieves get off scott free.  So she places an add in the local paper saying what a thieving little shit the kid is, and how is parents buy him out of trouble.  The parents of course are pissed, but there's nothing they can do about it really since the assistant manager has not commited slander or libel.  The parents should have let the kid take his punishment then they wouldn't be seen as assholes who try to buy their kids freedom. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrozzer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 4:25:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> I liked Unnone's story better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usashanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sashanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 5:00:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> So let me get this straight.<br>

So Panolas is now sitting on 60k of plat that belongs to the rightful owner of the property.  So when is SI getting its plat back?<br>

pola was targetted for guildremoval at first, and one of her chars was actually removed. just so you know. i was rather inactive at this time due to visiting relations, and im annoyed that i couldnt deal with this as it occured. we did react by removing her. punishments are handled in guild, not for the general public to see. we investigated the situation, pola on her own tried to fix the situation, she completed the effort, even before any guildremoval happened. thats a smart thing for her to do, dont you agree?<br>
<br>
now some personal thoughts. if someone is an evil ninja looting bastard, they're gonna ninja lewt their lewts, say &quot;fuck you&quot; to the guild, and not try to repay. they're going to go frollicking in the eq lands happy as a goat. they dont try to fix things. i cant believe that just after they ninjad theyd go &quot;omigawd i made a huge mistake!&quot; people think before hand, in most cases.<br>
<br>
you know why we still defend her? because we are talking about it. constantly. in game and outof game. its not solved yet, we cant react just because the flameboard is out for blood. its not fair to our guild, and its not fair to pola. this shit is<br>
driving.<br>
me.<br>
insane.<br>
<br>
you all like to pretend that dark virtue is a piece of shit because we defend her, but we're not. she is one of us, thorns, warts, herpies and all, until we are absolutely certain in how we should deal with it. ill defend anyone in this type of situation until i am satisfied that they're are bad people. when it comes down to it its a moral thing. someone fucks up, and either loots something on purpose or by accident... they make up for their mistakes. what do you do? do you punish them (which would happen... sorry to you flameboard people that dont see our inner guild workings) do you remove them and never speak to them again? i am very fond of second chances, myself.<br>
<br>
lilum, as for your real life analogy... that kid... when he got home, if he lived in a home anythin like mine, he wouldnt be sitting down for a week. punishments generally are done in private, and in my case, on my butt so id have to go naked if i ever wanted to complain to child welfare~~ <br>
<br>
<br>
in any case. ill leave this rather interesting thread alone from now on. its very difficult to express what i feel here.. on the net and in real life too, ive noticed some things.. you cant change what people think, its like slamming your head against a brick wall. youll all be the same tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, no matter what i say. if you want to believe dark virtue are evil hippies, do so... i know that its not true, i know what we are, and what we are capable of, and i know that those who say we are &quot;insert random mean adjective here&quot; do not know us at all, and therefore might as well be talking outof their ass, because its all shit. <p>-----<br>

Especially since Podaman ( as we know him now ) has quite the history.<br>
<br>
Several months ago, out of the blue we get a new Bard addition to Transcended, except this bard is lvl 46 or something, and our level requirement is 55.  Hmmm, so as we here the explanation, Thinkness explains that Offbeat is really a uber guildleader from another server who became disenchanted with leading an end game guild and it's raids.  We are told that he will be a valuable addition to our team, as he knows the strats for all ToV (still an uber raid area, and Transcended's main goal at the time.)  It's only a matter of time before Offbeat starts taking charge of raids ( granted, he really did know his shit and was a good leader. )<br>
<br>
Podaman was originally a Transcended warrior who gradually started playing less and less.  Shortly after his auction began on Ebay, we are told that Offbeat was 'Given' the account by the real Podaman, and would be played by whoever was playing Lukee (another ebayed character.)  Soon, Offbeat makes Podaman his main ( there is a blurp in the story here about Offbeat trying to steal Coliostro from the guild, but I don't know everything about that. )<br>
<br>
Next, Podaman leaves Transcended to form Dark Virtue, and right off the bat there are familar faces from the past (accounts that were known to be Ebayed) with that guildtag.   Xavre tells me that the guy who bought his account is in DV, and would be guilding Xavre, and that he typically 4boxes DV toons on raids (all or most of which are Ebayed, Im sure.)<br>
<br>
So what I wanna know is:  What was the story with Podaman(Offbeat/Whoever else) and his old guild on his old server?  Why did he really leave and come to the Tribunal?  Was he forced out due to spoiled rep caused by incendents involving lying/ninjalooting/ebaying, etc?  Did he destroy his credibility through shady negotiating like he did here with Rynnia?  Does he have more to do with this scale looting incedent that he's admiting? <p><br>

He wasn't my recruit nor did I invite him.  Dooks was the one that invited him and convinced the officers to give him a chance.  Those who know Podaman, know he can often be good with words.  Dooks was impressed with the conversation with Podaman and tagged him trial till level 55.  As time went by he only got on the officers nerves and dooks and offbeat started to not get along.   <p><hr>

This whole incident could have been avoided but I got greedy.<br>
<br>
Here is the true story.....<br>
<br>
Pola handed me the scale saying that I should return it to Chutoi for her since she was going on vacation. I asked her how she got it and she told me this.<br>
           I was looking for a TL in Skyfire when I had to go afk. I had my friend play the game for me. She didnt know much about the game and looted the scale thinking nothing wrong about it. When I got back and realized what had happened I hit /q. Later I contacted the officer and spoke about returning it.<br>
<br>
So I agreed to do the transfer for her. She logged off and I sat around in the bazaar waiting to find Chutoi. When I sit in the bazaar its like a little kid sitting in a candy shop. I decided I would try to sell the scale and I would pay Chutoi back when I got the cash, I thought no one would miss a dragon scale.<br>
<br>
I tried to sell it but couldnt find any buyers. Thats when the Gms contacted me about it. They never once told me that I had to return it. Later I realized the scale was gone, I assume that they confiscated it from me.<br>
<br>
I made up the story about her getting me to sell it because I was afraid that I would get banned.<br>
<br>
Call me a liar because that is what I am. Begin to flame me because that is what I deserve. I crumbled and fell prey to the wickedness of greed. <p><p align="center"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~cyclonis/_uimages/panhead2.jpg" width="250" height="277"></p>                   </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 12:32:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> Was that a page eight?<br>
