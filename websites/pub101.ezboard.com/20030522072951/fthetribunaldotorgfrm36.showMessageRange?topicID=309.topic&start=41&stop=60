  I do have to agree with one point.  We are giving up way too many of our personal freedoms for security when in the end it will do just the opposite of make us secure.<br>
  <br>
  It's getting the point where you will end up in jail if you say the wrong thing aka freedom of speech. They are trying to take our right to bear arms as well.  Track our money through chips.  Develop X-ray machines that see through you so it looks like you have no cloths on.  Look at the taxation not suppose to be double taxation?  Anyone ever bought a car and had to move states?  It's not just two state taxes they hit ya with.  That is NOT what this country is suppose to be about.  And ALL this was in place long BEFORE Bush took office.<br>
<br>
  I don't see us as trying to take over the world or kill off a race.  I would hardly compare this to Nazi, Germany.  <br>

<br>
No, that was caused by problems within all our intelligence agencies imo, especially the CIA. The blame for that can be spread over many administrations and especially on the US public, who can be too liberal when it comes to matters of defense. Grant it, I am liberal on social issues, but when it comes to allowing your intelligence agencies to do their job, then common sense should be the rule, not liberalism or conservatism.<br>
<br>
What I am sick of is Bush cronies who try to sell the idea that an act that happened 9 months into the Bush administration is Clinton's fault. I am sick of hearing that the economy was already going down when Clinton was in office. The economy has to do with public confidence and Bush has had plenty of time to instill confidence and at least show some positive signs in the economy, but there is only negative. Why? Because evey time the economy starts to pick up a little, he starts rattling his saber again and everbody gets nervous. The economy will never get any better with a cowboy looking for trouble at every turn. Not to mention that most people (imo) know better than to think that tax cuts will icrease spending in any significant measure. You have to get money in the hands of the buyers, not the sellers.<br>
<br>
I am pissed with this Patriot Act and Homeland Security. If your actions will actually have a benefit at the cost of some privacy, fine. -BUT- (and this is the major problem) most of this shit is only effecting citizens and not doing a dman thing to stop a terrorist.<br>
<br>
It's like these ass backwards gun laws. Waiting periods and gun restrictions do nothing at all to stop criminals. Criminals don't play by the rules so changing the rules doesn't effect them. These gun laws make about as much sense as having a waiting period on buying cars to combat drunk driving... one has nothing to do with the other.<br>
<br>
If we want to fight terrorism then we need to secure our sea ports. Anything can come on those containers with no checks.<br>
<br>
The way to make our planes safe is to reinforce the cockpit and order pilots to not exit for any reason. Fucking with ticket sales, airport screening and not allowing security officers to concentrate on people of Middle Eastern decent instead of this bullshit random checking (since when is an 60 year old American woman a threat?) is just fucking with regular people to be PC.<br>
<br>
With all the mistakes that made 9/11 possible, it still boiled down to pilots thinking that saving an attendent was worth putting a whole plane at risk. Grant it, they had no real precedence to know better, but now they do. The first priority is control of the plane. If people onboard die due to a pilot not leaving the cockpit, so be it. Better 250 passengers than 250 passengers plus whoever is on the ground when they crash it. It's only common sense.<br>
<br>
The Isrealis have it right. They never negotiate with terrorists/hostage takers and they will kill the fuckers, even at the cost of innocent lives. It's all about keeping the terrorist from accomplishing their goals. They are willing to die if they actually accomplish something, but not even terrorists are so anxious to die as to go on impossible missions that yeild no results for them.<br>
<br>
Eavesdropping on telephone conversations will do nothing against terrorism. Terrorists cells get their orders from coded messages over public airwaves, like TV and radio. Operatives don't use phones and mail (though computers can be used if you can get a public access node that can't be pinned down to one person) If they get direct messages it's operative to operative. They don't just pick up a phone and get their orders, that would make them too easy to track down. All these wire tapping laws are just fucking with regular citizens, not terrorists.<br>
<br>
There is more, but you get the idea. It's common sense. Why make laws effecting things/actions that don't even pertain to foreign terrorists? They might catch some domestic terrorists who are stupid enough to use direct uncoded communication, but is that worth all these hits on our privacy? I do't think so.<br>

<br>
Wrong. Clinton negotiated with them and kept them from producing nuclear weapon for his term. He did trade them some tecnology for producing power as part of the bargain, but there was no problem while he was in office. He understood that the Korean people are very, very poor and were more ineterested in geting fuel oil and food than nuclear weapons.<br>
<br>
Now comes Bush with his hard ass attitude, agressive policies and his assclown speech on the &quot;axis of evil&quot;, talking about punishing every country that doesn't conform to American policy. Is it any wonder they said fuck the US?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Who benefited from a grossly inflated stock market?<br>
<br>
Clinton.<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Amazing how this inflated market started when Clinton took office and ended when he left it.<br>
<br>
Look, alot of things go into the economy and I agree that the President doesn't have alot of control over most of them, but what he does have control over is public confidence and Bush does nothing but hurt that. He is a wild card who could go off on any country, anytime and that helps to make the market unsure and people unwilling to spend, especially lower and middle income families who know that Bush will cut their throat to benefit the rich and the big business.<br>
<br>
People had faith in the Clinton administration and that as much as anything helped the economy to stay strong while he was in office. As soon as it got close to the end of his turn is when people started getting nervous... and with good reason imo. <p><br>

The world had an economic boom because of computers.  First off, do a ratio check 10 years ago of how many PC's were in peoples homes and businesses, and today.  That alone was the boom of the economy.. EVERYONE had to buy a PC.  And with the mass market of PC's coming into the homes, people discovered the internet, shopping online, searching, advertising, and everything else that can be done on a computer, and everyone said &quot;This is the wave of the future.&quot; and everyone invested in the future.  Clinton didn't cause this, OR the decline that is being pinned on Bush.  Clinton and Bush were merely in office when it happened.  Clinton got lucky in that respect, and Bush unlucky.  I just see it for what it is.  A luck of the draw.  Neither of the two presidents have anything at all to do with the up or the down. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
When people feel secure and like things are on an even keel they invest freely. When people feel insecure and there is talk of war or conflict or they don't trust their leaders to boost the economy, people hold onto their money in fear of rising prices and needing emergency funds for things such as a losing their job.<br>
<br>
I am confident that if it were possible for Clinton to be elected to a third term, our economy would be in much better shape (although I do think there would have been a downturn, just not as severe) and people would have felt much more secure. Clinton may have seemed like a dove, but I think most people realized he was a negotiator first and an agressor second, which made for a much more stable economy.<br>
<br>
Presidents who talk like they are ready to jump ugly at anytime, whether they actually do it or not (which Bush hasn't thus far and maybe never will), shake investor confidence.<br>
<br>
Perception is a huge part of the economy... maybe more than reality. Bush gives the wrong perception. <p><br>

Thank you.. really.. thank you..  How hilarious is this statement?  So what exactly would make someone un-American if its not not supporting the AMERICAN government?  Not supporting the sports teams during the Olympics?  And leave the flame board stuff for the flame board.

Loegan makes a good point here. Why do you think people say Greenspan does a good job as chairman of the federal reserve. It is because under his reign feceral bank policy has become extremely predictable to investors. By being predictable he dimnishes market risk. <br>
On the other hand Bush's policy creates insecurity increases market risk and decreases investment and consumer spending. <br>

The market started to crumble because of poorly designed companies specifically making business plans to loose more money than usual during the starting years when operating on the Internet.<br>
<br>
Venture capitalists bought up internet companies like no tomorrow-- not because the people had a sound business plan, but because the internet industry was the &quot;next big thing&quot; to invest in. And yet take a look at people like Amazon.com, who are just finally starting to turn a profit (if they haven't slipped back into debt yet).<br>
<br>
Hundreds of thousands of companies sprung up and got millions of dollars of VC for failing concepts. Now granted, business fail every day, but the particular thing with this industry is that far too many of the companies did fail.<br>
<br>
Add in the fact that more than most of these new startups decided to IPO waaaaaaaaaaaay too early, to make a buck fast, and you end up flooding the market with companies who don't belong in the public trading arena yet anyways.<br>
<br>
It was doomed from the start, it just took a while for it all to come crashing down. And the consequences are severe and far reaching.<br>
<br>
a.) Companies who make computers-- now have severe debt from purchases of servers and workstations by companies that don't exist anymore.<br>
<br>
b.) Companies who make computers-- now have to fight their own products because the used market is flooded with liquidated assets from failed companies.<br>
<br>
c.) It's no wonder that all the major telco companies are doing bad. They just lost millions of dollars in revenue for phone and leased line service... granted most of the telco CEOs were also crooks, but they wouldn't have been found out without as much going on as happened.<br>
<br>
It goes on and on and on. Unemployment taxes for new companies are higher, and pray you don't have to lay someone off, because then they go up even more. Utility companies, office buildings, office supply companies... everyone looses when such a large amount of companies just poofs and leaves a big financial vaccuum.<br>

I see where your mistake lies however.  The terms of &quot;country&quot; and &quot;government&quot; are synonymous within your sphere of understanding and that is a fundamental error.<br>
<br>
No one is obligated to support the government to be an American.<br>
<br>
Want to know where your notion came from, however?  It came from the Vietnam War when the media was accused of sabotaging the war effort by portraying the Vietnam campaign for what it really was.  But it was the first televeised war and the media didn't know any better and wasn't aware that the public opinion would be influenced to such a great degree by televising Vietnam.  If you notice, the U.S. media has not criticized any major American military actions ever since. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=manndrakke>Manndrakke</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/30/02 10:11:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mandrakke.free.fr/Manndy.gif width=150 height=190 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Keep da bombs away from mah head and I will be fine.<br>

All I said was the new tension over North Korea was manufactured by the Bush administration. He's not doing it to take over the world, he's trying to destabilise the world to benefit his financial backers and stimulate US industry. Do you realise how much of your money Bush is handing over to the arms industry through new military spending, and to the drug industry through bioterrorism &quot;precautions&quot;?.<br>
<br>
Saddam and Kim Jong Il are evil dictators who are trying to better themselves, not their countries. But they have a record of responding to negotiation on the basis of &quot;if you behave, we will help you&quot;. Under Bush, that is not offered -- negotiation now consists of &quot;if you misbehave, we will hit you&quot;. <p>--<br>

<br>
England made sure germany was not producing arms....<br>
<br>
The U.S. Has inspectors in both countries, Iraq and Nkorea.<br>
<br>
Germany began to produce arms/weapons....England Afraid of another conflict ( Partially because they were still recovering from WW1) Turned a blind eye to the build up.<br>
<br>
You would like the U.S. to respect Iraq/Nkoreas Sovereignty. Which means to avert war we will apease them by turning a blind eye to their weapons build up. Now if they do nothing but defend themselves with the weapons they produce then that is great, However that is not what happened 60 years ago.....<br>
 <br>
Germany/Japan quickly began striking other countries after their weapons build up. And the war quickly escelated into world war 2, Involving many nations and countless millions died.<br>
<br>
What IF North Korea is thinking the same thing, The death tole of WW2 would be magnified 100 times if nukes were used. <br>
<br>
England and france could have saved the lives of countless millions by taking action against germany, The U.S. could have saved millions by taking action against germany. None of us did anything, And 50 million (or so) people died because of that.<br>
<br>
60 Years from now, Will our children be talking much like we are now, And asking why the U.S. did nothing when Nkorea was arming up, Why we ignored Iraq's Agressive actions. Could we have stopped 500 million peoples deaths?<br>
<br>
Todays situation has a startling simmilarity to the start of WW2, However if it does go down the same road the next war might be the end of us all. In WW2 people with power chose to do nothing, Should we also do nothing. Would we be making the same mistake we made 60 years ago? This time would more people die because of our blunder?<br>
