If your were unwilling, or unable to kill Phara Dar, there's no reason to vent your frustration on another guild who could.<br><br>Err, when did any Comps join RNG? We've had 40-50 VP keys for a long time, it just wasn't such a high priority, much to the angst of our casters. We were concentrating on ToV to equip everyone in the guild, and on FB dragons for ST.<br><br>Hmm, seems like your problem is that you feel that clearning VP is a huge acomplishment that you hold dear to your heart, and you take offense when another guild goes into VP and kills the final boss which you left up for one reason or another, then posted VP was cleared. VP = no nameds left = cleared. Most people don't even think killing things in VP is that much of an accomplishment, it's just something else to do, and a chance to get caster drops.<br><br>If you are under the impression that the screenshots on our website is a source of adoration, then perhaps you'd like to stop by and look at it from time to time, then you'd realize it changes periodically, and mainly for humor. If it makes you feel better, the caption can be changed.<br><br>What you are doing is trying to interpret the actions of a gentlemen with the mentality of a scoundrel. If you really wanted VP to yourself, you could have let the rest of the server know. If you really wanted to kill Phara Dar, then kill her. Just because everyone else on the server's ignoring VP most of the time, does not give you exclusive rights to it. If two groups of RNG wants to go into VP and off Phara Dar, we hardly need Revo's permission.<br> <p><BR>Boinshar Harlishambar <BR>Oracle of War<BR>First Officer<BR><a href=http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com>Royal Norrathian Guard</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xaviera>Xaviera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I know why dogs hump legs,<br>I wont tell you why, but i do.</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/29/02 8:51:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Guards cleaned out Veeshan's Peak </span><hr size=1> Could have been EV people..

I'm not sure how exactly you reached the conclusion that RNG jumped your raid. How were we supposed to know you wanted to kill Phara Dar the next day? Did you tell any RNG member you wanted to try and was ignored or something?<br><br>I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but 32K dragons are not difficult to kill. I'm well aware of Hoshkar's (sp) abilities, and let me point out Phara Dar died in under 20 secs to RNG, so no, he would not be a problem with the right resists.<br><br>Hmm so we've moved beyond the chest thumping, be it implied or interpreted. If you guys want to kill a mob, kill it, unless perhaps you are under the impression that other guilds should ask for your premission to enter VP?<br><br>Besides, to the best of my knowledge, VP is not part of any rotation, so any mobs left up is free game. I can understand you feeling shitty because someone killed Phara Dar because you were unable to do so for whatever reason it is, but why you expect people to know your intentions without saying anything is quite beyond me.<br><br>In summery, the caption can be changed since you guys seem to care so much about it, and don't leave up any mobs you want to kill. <p><BR>Boinshar Harlishambar <BR>Oracle of War<BR>First Officer<BR><a href=http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com>Royal Norrathian Guard</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujsmiff69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jsmiff69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Just Has One Testicle. <br>Laugh About It. <BR> Kick Him In The Ball.</span><br>  Posts: 1615<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/29/02 9:02:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Guards cleaned out Veeshan's Peak </span><hr size=1> I believe the person you're thinking of that joined RNG was Feck from EV... as for strats being given to them by him, nfi, but I believe Feck was in RNG before Vag's and then EV. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xaviera>Xaviera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I know why dogs hump legs,<br>I wont tell you why, but i do.</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/29/02 9:06:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Guards cleaned out Veeshan's Peak </span><hr size=1> thats who it was..   <br><br>I dont know what guild anybody is in..

I'd much rather die 10 times and form my own strategy from experience earned and researched information. I believe this holds true with any self respecting raid leader, so honestly any implications of any RNG raid leader following others' strategies are quite off base.<br><br>Currently the server's FCFS for most zones, so if a mob's up, chances are some people are going to kill it. VP's just a special case since not many people go there, thinking risk/time vs reward isn't as worthwhile as some other zone/mobs. I'll be honest, if a mob's up, and RNG is the first guild to have the forces to kill it in the zone, we'd do it. We don't intentionally jump other guild's mobs or raids, because whatever loot that drops ain't worth the effort, and we think ourselves above such acts.<br><br>As for the caption, I still think you read too much into it, but it isn't totally acurate, so it'll be changed. <p><BR>Boinshar Harlishambar <BR>Oracle of War<BR>First Officer<BR><a href=http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com>Royal Norrathian Guard</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usaeamdar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saeamdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/29/02 9:17:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Guards cleaned out Veeshan's Peak </span><hr size=1> Did you ever consider the fact that the person who updates our website is not able to attend all of our raids and, therefore, must get much of her info second-hand?<br><br>What most likely happened is she came on, asked what we did today, and someone said that we killed the last dragon in VP, Phara Dar.
