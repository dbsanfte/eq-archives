<br>
WHAT CNN CLAIMED ABOUT ITS REPORTING WHILE SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS IN POWER: Yesterday I blogged about CNN's admission that there were many things it couldn't report while Saddam was in power, for fear that Saddam would retaliate against their employees and sources:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Over the last dozen years I made 13 trips to Baghdad to lobby the government to keep CNN's Baghdad bureau open and to arrange interviews with Iraqi leaders. Each time I visited, I became more distressed by what I saw and heard -- awful things that could not be reported because doing so would have jeopardized the lives of Iraqis, particularly those on our Baghdad staff.<br>
<br>
For example, in the mid-1990's one of our Iraqi cameramen was abducted. For weeks he was beaten and subjected to electroshock torture in the basement of a secret police headquarters because he refused to confirm the government's ludicrous suspicion that I was the Central Intelligence Agency's Iraq station chief. CNN had been in Baghdad long enough to know that telling the world about the torture of one of its employees would almost certainly have gotten him killed and put his family and co-workers at grave risk<br>
<br>
Working for a foreign news organization provided Iraqi citizens no protection. The secret police terrorized Iraqis working for international press services who were courageous enough to try to provide accurate reporting. Some vanished, never to be heard from again. Others disappeared and then surfaced later with whispered tales of being hauled off and tortured in unimaginable ways. . . .<br>
<br>
We also had to worry that our reporting might endanger Iraqis not on our payroll. I knew that CNN could not report that Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Uday, told me in 1995 that he intended to assassinate two of his brothers-in-law who had defected and also the man giving them asylum, King Hussein of Jordan. If we had gone with the story, I was sure he would have responded by killing the Iraqi translator who was the only other participant in the meeting. After all, secret police thugs brutalized even senior officials of the Information Ministry, just to keep them in line (one such official has long been missing all his fingernails). . . .<br>
<br>
I came to know several Iraqi officials well enough that they confided in me that Saddam Hussein was a maniac who had to be removed. One Foreign Ministry officer told me of a colleague who, finding out his brother had been executed by the regime, was forced, as a test of loyalty, to write a letter of congratulations on the act to Saddam Hussein. An aide to Uday once told me why he had no front teeth: henchmen had ripped them out with pliers and told him never to wear dentures, so he would always remember the price to be paid for upsetting his boss. Again, we could not broadcast anything these men said to us.<br>
<br>
Last December, when I told Information Minister Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf that we intended to send reporters to Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, he warned me they would &quot;suffer the severest possible consequences.&quot; CNN went ahead, and in March, Kurdish officials presented us with evidence that they had thwarted an armed attack on our quarters in Erbil. This included videotaped confessions of two men identifying themselves as Iraqi intelligence agents who said their bosses in Baghdad told them the hotel actually housed C.I.A. and Israeli agents. The Kurds offered to let us interview the suspects on camera, but we refused, for fear of endangering our staff in Baghdad. . . .<br>
<br>
I felt awful having these stories bottled up inside me. Now that Saddam Hussein's regime is gone, I suspect we will hear many, many more gut-wrenching tales from Iraqis about the decades of torment. At last, these stories can be told freely.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here, however, is what CNN was saying about this last Fall (emphasis added):<br>
<br>
BOB GARFIELD: I'm sure you have seen Franklin Foer's article in The New Republic which charges that the Western press is appeasing the Iraqi regime in order to maintain its visas -- to be there reporting should a war ultimately break out. What's your take on that? <br>
<br>
EASON JORDAN [the author of the article I cite above, CNN's chief news executive]: The writer clearly doesn't have a clear understanding of the realities on the ground because CNN has demonstrated again and again that it has a spine; that it's prepared to be forthright; is forthright in its reporting. We wouldn't have a team in northern Iraq right now if we didn't want to upset the Saddam Hussein regime. We wouldn't report on the demonstration if we didn't want to upset the Saddam Hussein regime. We wouldn't have been thrown out of Iraq already 5 times over the last several years if we were there to please the Saddam Hussein regime. So the story was lopsided, unfair and chose to ignore facts that would refute the premise of the article. . . . <br>
<br>
BOB GARFIELD: Back in '91 CNN and Peter Arnett in particular were heavily criticized, mostly by civilians, for reporting from within Baghdad during the U.S. attack in ways that they'd consider to be utter propaganda and to -- out of context and not reflecting the overall reality of Saddam Hussein'[s] regime. Have you analyzed what you can get access to without appearing to be just a propaganda tool for Saddam? <br>
<br>
EASON JORDAN: Well absolutely. I mean we work very hard to report forthrightly, to report fairly and to report accurately and if we ever determine we cannot do that, then we would not want to be there; but we do think that some light is better than no light whatsoever. I think that the world, the American people will be shortchanged if foreign journalists are kicked out, because even in Peter Arnett's case there were things that he reported on -- and this is a long time ago now -- but things he reported on that I don't think would have been reported at all had he not been there. We feel committed to our Baghdad presence. We've had a bureau there for 12 years with occasional interruptions when we've been thrown out, but we're not there to please the Iraqi government -- we're not there to displease the Iraqi government -- we're just there to do our job. <br>
<br>
BOB GARFIELD: Let's say there's an -- a second Gulf War. Is that the mother of all stories? Do you have to be there? Are there -- decisions you'll make on the margins to be s -- as certain as you possibly can that you will have a presence there? <br>
<br>
EASON JORDAN: We'd very much like to be there if there's a second war; but -- we are not going to make journalistic compromises in an effort to make that happen, being mindful that in wartime there is censorship on all sides, and we're prepared to deal with a certain amount of censorship as long as it's not -- extreme, ridiculous censorship where -- which we've actually seen a number of cases in previous conflicts -- not just with Iraq. But -- sure! We want to be there, but it's -- we don't want to be there come hell or high water. We want to be there if we can be there and operate as a responsible news organization. . . .<br>
I actually sympathize with CNN's plight in some measure; and I realize there are various ways of interpreting what Jordan was saying. But I do think the combination of their concealment, and their denial of their concealment, is at least potentially troubling, so I'm passing along both these stories so readers can decide for themselves.<br>
<br>
     At the very least, it seems to me that we need to keep this in mind in the next situation when Western news organizations report on a regime like Saddam's, which can threaten their employees with death and use this threat as leverage to keep certain stories quiet.<br>
<br>
     (Thanks to ScottM's comment at the Command Post for the pointer.)<br>
<br>
UPDATE: As I've also blogged about above, here's what especially troubles me: CNN had a chance to admit what it was doing at the time, at least in general terms -- to warn readers that they might not be getting the full story -- with relatively little risk, and probably even relatively little loss of credibility. In the interview that I quote below, Eason Jordan could have simply said:<br>
<br>
Yes, there are some things that we unfortunately can't report, because if we do, our people or our sources could get killed -- or at the very least, we could get thrown out of the country. But we do think that some light is better than no light whatsoever. What we do report, we report accurately; at most, we'll sometimes not report certain stories, but we report the overwhelming majority of what we think is out there to report. It's unfortunate that we can't report everything, but that's the way things are, given the nature of the Iraqi regime. We hope our viewers trust us that we're doing the best job we possibly can under these circumstances.<br>
<br>
I doubt that this would have yielded violent retaliation from the Iraqi government; and I even suspect that many viewers would have understood CNN's point. But that, unfortunately, is not what Jordan said -- what he said, it seems to me, was considerably less candid. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 4/11/03 5:04:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 464<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/03 6:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=612.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraq Coverage</span><hr size=1> If only Ted Turner should live so long as to have his stock become worthless.<br>

<br>
On Fox News tonight they showed Iraq's UN ambassador leaving for wherever. Just as he was about to get in his car he turned around and yelled at CNN's UN correspondent, ran up to him to say goodbye personally and hugged and kissed him. The Fox News anchor of course made a big deal out of this because of CNN's recent admission, &quot;UH OH look at the friendship between CNN and Iraq's UN ambassador! Look how horrible CNN is!&quot;<br>
<br>
These are supposed to be my &quot;fair and balanced&quot; trusted television news sources? I wish Walter Cronkite were still around.

NBC had some good reporting, and one piece by Ted Koppel while he was &quot;embedded&quot; was pretty interesting. I liked the footage and mostly the interviews with the troops. David Bloom's work was very good. I can pretty easily tune out the editorializing, or at least recognize it as such.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=612.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=612.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=612.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=612.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=612.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=612.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=612.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
