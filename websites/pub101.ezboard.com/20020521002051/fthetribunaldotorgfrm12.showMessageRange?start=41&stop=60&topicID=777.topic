It also sounds like Trans wasnt ready either if you had to keep coming back, when we killed him for Diel, after they placed him outside, the entire fight took less than a minute with 3 groups.

<br>
here are the facts (I was playing my druid kiting near the RF pop since we also have a few clerics in guild at this stage and I can watch the pop on 2nd puter while in VP, ToV , etc between pulls)<br>
<br>
I saw RF pop and see amojoman and guild (SoC) getting people to SF while kiting the human form (not claimed till they have force and the human form is killed *per VI rules*<br>
<br>
They decide to spawn RF (dragon form) as other guilds start piling into the zone. SoC decided to bind a few of their chars on the wall close to continue fighting in case they die...(amojoman went from 58/59? to 56) as I watched ragefire get low and SoC had a few members getting rezed/joining in battle from bind point in SF. Transended's groups attacked Ragefire (while some SoC) still were engaged and managed to get the kill/loot the heart.<br>
<br>
The most obnoxious /ooc was some member of Transended /ooc &quot;thats right we said we would do anything to get the next Ragefire&quot; while the guild they ksed/took RF from was still rezzing the 50+ corpses on the wall.<br>
<br>
Then a cleric from RNG? came by with a rez stick and assisted.<br>
<br>
Would SoC have won the fight?..not sure<br>
<br>
/cheer the nameless cleric with rez stick for helping on a bad situation.<br>
<br>
while I don't agree with Ravlow's opinion's on much his take on SoC is dead on (from my 2.5+ years on Tribunal) I have not seen a guild less interested in loot and more about fun.<br>
<br>
Amojoman is a class act and (as far as I saw) didn't even complain/shout/ooc/flame anyone <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxanthiumbladesong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xanthium Bladesong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/7/02 12:00:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gushy bullshit</span><hr size=1> I don't usually get involved in shit slinging like this, but I had to point something out about Wolvar's &quot;facts&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here the Quote from Wolvar:<br>
<br>
&quot;They got Rage to a sliver and whiped&quot;<br>
<br>
Here's Grixx from the Trans Board:<br>
<br>
&quot;SOC had taken Ragefire down almost 70% before we wiped out&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I was no math major, but 100% - 70% = 30% right?  Getting a mob down to 30% is pretty nice, but is 30% of a mobs life a sliver?<br>
<br>
This kind of reminds me of my High School baseball coach When I was a freshman he told us a story of him hitting a homerun to with the championship, it just cleared the fence.  Of course by the time I was a senior the ball cleared the stadium and the street and hit a car in the parking lot a block away.<br>
<br>
Pretty woon Wolvar will be like SOC had Rage killed and fucking Trans ran in and rezzed him!  Those dirty whore KSers!<br>

He'll post the same shit anywhere offering no real concern for anyone but himself and being an ass to boot calling names and making various sperm references in peoples names, possibly a hang up for him I dunno.<br>
<br>
If you werent in the exp group Estevan then you really have no facts on who got the kill just peoples word on it or your own perception. Both the words you go on and your possible perception are argued. <br>
<br>
Do I think when somebody fails another guild should come rushing in to save the day? No, not really its hardly practical and in the scheme of things we're in guilds to look out for our guild members not another guild. Do I think a guild warrants a second shot when they come close? Yes I do and unless anyone can say they have seen the new Rage despawn its just opinion and in this case a weak one to back up greed anyway. Odds are he despawns same as last Rage but even that took a little while. Think one trip I was on to help somebody it was roughly 45 minutes before despawn. Couldnt have been more than a 3 minute fight to start so use your best judgement as to whether they took another 40 minutes trying to regroup.<br>
<br>
Some guilds will sit and wait in zone hoping for another guild to fail and take the kill when they do. Some guilds will assist if needed or move along their merry way. Nothing wrong either way. What is BS is acting as if you have some greater concern for anyone but yourself. If its a question of nobody getting Rage then there really shouldnt have been any problem with assisting SoC in getting res'd to take a second shot with Trans waiting to finish if they failed again. Its more a questiong of Xavre not getting his epic though not Trans or SoC.<br>
<br>
Nice guys finish last and Xavre gets a res stick. I've seen the banter of Xavre claiming Rage in SF when he wasnt even up as if he's the only cleric ever there. The banter seeming to show how much more deserving he is since he got the new pearl before anyone, completely disregarding the fact many clerics before him had a pearl too. <br>
<br>
Grixx, regardless of any assumptions on age (and oh how I love baseless assumptions to attempt to prove anything), has always shown a lot of class and people dont always express that under pressure. If he was out of line he'll come round eventually and admit it. Odds are though he was more reactionary than anything.<br>

*attempting* to sound righteous on a mob that you obviously engaged while being engaged by SoC is very funny.<br>
<br>
No doubt this won't be the last time someone KSes Ragefire, but call it what it was. Simple put : Transended didn't respect another guild (whomever it was not just a stand for SoC) from killing a target they spawned &lt;I'm not sure they could have...but that is almost irrelevent since they were trying when Transended interfered&gt;<br>

It's all about how you play the game, I personally am glad for guilds like SoC and people like Mojo and Grixx.<br>
If Grixx said things in anger then that's what it was, something said in anger defending a friend.<br>

When I was checking out guilds I was interested in KoT as one of the choices. And I think I went as far as one Chardok raid, and helped someone kill Ixiblat, speaking of cleric epics. That was about it. But I like KoT alot. Great stand up guild, they play a different game.. with different rules.<br>

<br>
Wolvar, were you there?<br>
<br>
I didn't think so. So before you go spouting off about how Estevan can't be sure this or that happened, take a look at some of your own quotes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  They got Rage to a sliver and wiped.<br>
<br>
A group of them got the kill and could have looted the container except Grixx stopped them. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You say he's wrong, but where were you when this happened? Can you be sure your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> facts</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are correct? <p><HR>
