<br>
True, we haven't killed Aary yet.  We got him to about 40% on our first shot at him, not a bad first effort I'd say.  We lost basically due to inexperience with him.  I'm confident we will work out the details and drop him eventually.<br>
<br>
I was at the Doomshade fight, DS was behaving exactly how he would if he was being chain blurred.  Could it have been from something else?  Anything's possible but no one here has suggested anything else plausible.  Sorry, suggesting we zerg everything and have no aggro control is just the usual flameboard bullshit.  And frankly, its not even that clever an insult.<br>
<br>
In terms of logs, my logs were turned on but I have all casting text turned off but my own to reduce text lag.  Maybe someone has a log that shows the blurr, but the absence of such a log does not prove/disprove anything unfortunately.  Even if we had a log showing the blurr it would be impossible to show who did it to my knowledge unless someone came forward which is real unlikely.<br>

I didn't.  I didn't pay a penny for Podaman.  It was a straight up trade between two friends.  My character (Keadaian Songborne) on Vazaelle for Podaman.  I can categoricaly state I have never bought or sold any character or item for RL money or other RL consideration.  <br>
<br>
As for the why?  I didn't want to play on Vazaelle any longer.  I had already done the 0-60 grind as a warrior and didn't really feel like doing it again.<br>

You're right... it proves and disproves nothing.  So don't come here and accuse us of doing it.  In fact, not only does nobody have a log of a memory blur, not one person has stepped up and said they saw spell text that would indicate a blur.  All you have is a mob that aggro bounced during a surprise pull with people sitting in an extremely laggy zone.  Based on that you accused us of blurring your mob.<br>
<br>
In contrast, we can not prove anyone dispelled doom while we fought.  However, multiple casters in the guild did get &quot;such and such has worn off&quot; messages right after landing the spells.  Furthermore, we've said we don't know who did it.  We didn't see who cast, we can't prove it, and with over 130 people in the zone it could have been damn near anyone.  <br>
<br>
Besides, why are you worried about us blurring your mob?  According to Synap, you weren't really trying to fight him anyway, right?  You wanted NGoH to get first crack?<br>
<br>
From Phalanx's message board...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In Phalanx, while we do have hunger, we are tempered by our need to respect our fellow adventurer's.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Another Synap quote for Ravlow.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Last night we went to UP for Doomshade. When we started coming in the zone, NGoH already had a killing force in the zone. As per Phalanx policies and proceedure, if a guild has a killing force before we do, we bow to them for the first shot. I contacted NGoH and informed them of this, that we would not get in thier way since they were there first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Which explains why Synap told me we had 30 seconds to pull doom or Phalanx was going to pull it.  This also explains why Phalanx engaged the mob first.<br>
<br>
But hey... if you didn't really wanna kill Doomshade, maybe it was you who blurred it, Synap?  You know, to give NGoH every opportunity to pull it off of you and get the first chance you soooo badly wanted them to have.  Badly enough that you were willing to let Doomshade kill half your guild while you softened him up for them.  <br>

Face it Synap... your 41+ people did half as much dmg and lasted half as long as our 22 people.  Claiming that we blurred it is just a desperate attempt to justify your own ineptitude and claiming you didn't want to kill it is nothing more than sour grapes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uteneran67.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teneran67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/22/02 3:54:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Virtue Doomshade Fiasco</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Quote: Maybe someone has a log that shows the blurr, but the absence of such a log does not prove/disprove anything unfortunately.

Podaman, show me in my post where I accused Dark Virtue of blurring the mob.  If you're going to quote me, don't tack extra stuff I never said onto it.  I said the mob behaved that way, period.  I never accused DV of it.  Read a post carefully before shooting your mouth off.  And since it was my first ever flamboard post, I certainly can't be accused of having done it earlier.<br>

<br>
Never said what he did was right,  but given the circumstances of that night..  he wasn't totally wrong in what he did..  nor was he the only man guilty of cheating someone.  <br>
<br>
It is true that he spoke to NGoH,  there was a channel set up with him, and the raiding force of NGoH..  where he explained why he looted.. why he felt they were wrong..  .. and then said he would willingly have the item moved to the person who was to be awarded the wand.   He did not go groveling to NGoH ,  begging for forgiveness etc.   In the end, after all was said.. altho many were pissed at what he did..  the majority did understand why he did what he did..  respected his confession and explanation to what he did.. his willingness to have the item moved.. and forgave him for it.  <br>
<br>
Why are we considered his friends?  Well probably because he's someone worth your time..   I sincerely doubt you'd see people posting in his defense if the guy was a chronic ninja looter who brought nothing but trouble to everyone he's met.   <br>
<br>
So,  you may hate the friends of so-called ninja looters..  who try and &quot;defend&quot; them?..     that's fine..  but you know what i think is worse?... <br>
<br>
Dick lickers who love to destroy people for their mistakes..  especially when they have no fucking clue as to what happened that night..  and have no fucking idea as to who that person is.   God forbid you yourself.. or anyone else have their mistakes pointed out by people who know jack shit about the happenings..   as im sure it would be equally unpleasant.. if not worse.  <br>
<br>
As if anyone here is a saint.  Stop tryin to play EQ judge n' jury ,  and grow the fuck up.  <br>
<br>
Take care folks.  <br>

Nice flame.  'cept that I never lost aggro when we fought Doomshade.  That quote was in refrence to the reasons Phalanx lost agro.  It's amusing tho that you would consider us a zerg guild... since our active roster is approixmately 50 people and our average raid force is around 25. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxebantiz2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xebantiz2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/22/02 4:28:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Virtue Doomshade Fiasco</span><hr size=1> Podaman will you just shut the fuck up.<br>

Don't you get it?  You're a fucking moron.  YOU DIDN'T EVEN LEVEL THE CHARACTER YOU PLAY!!!  You may not have bought him off ebay but account trading is no better.  It's against the EULA.  Nobody gives a flying fuck what you did on your old server, with your old guild.  Here you're just a shitty guild leader of a shitty guild.

I don't think I'll ever comprehend as to why people take this fucking &quot;GAME&quot; so god damn seriously.  Its not as if Doomshade is no longer a part of the game.  Its not as if Kaspian &quot;ninja'd your wallet&quot; or DV stole you house (and I'm not saying DV KS'd anything or anyone)<br>
What ever happened to respect for others...IT'S A GAME!!<br>
Fuck, next we're going to hear about people blowing themselves up over a lost camp or ninja'd loot.  Maybe at the next Fan Faire someone from Phalanx or another guild is going to kill a member of DV at the same FF.  I have more respect for people coming to defend themselves than I do for the accusers.  <br>
You people act like 10 yr. old kiddies fighting over a piece of candy.<br>

If Poda leveled a character to 60 on another server and then traded for another character I dont see anything wrong with that.  He is certainly way more knowledgeable about the game than you, so its not like he's some newbie who bought a char on Ebay.  And he did in fact &quot;pay his dues&quot; by leveling his own characters to 60 on another server<br>

Blah blah blah, long story short, you ebayed. No one fucking cares or wants to hear you life story podafag. For all I know, you probably bought half the accounts making posts on this flame and are using them to defend your sorry ass. Save yourself the hours of rigorous typing and pondering plot twists and buy the whole fucking flame on ebay next time. Hell when dont even fucking buy a life on ebay.

Learn to use a computer.<br>
<br>
Uninstalling/reinstalling EQ does not delete your logs. The only way you could lose your logs is if you deleted them or your hard drive failed.<br>
<br>
My guess is you manually deleted your EQ directory because you thought there would otherwise be an entropic clash of new and old data sending a stream of ball lightning down the wires to your local telephone exchange where it would be earthed and disturb the earth's tectonic plates, creating a small nuclear explosion somewhere off the coast of Madagascar.
