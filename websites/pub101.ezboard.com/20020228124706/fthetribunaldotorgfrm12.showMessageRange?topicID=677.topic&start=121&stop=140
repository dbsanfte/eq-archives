Thanks for not telling me all of this when I was sticking up for you in tells to Sash.  Thanks for letting me know the story you told me wasn't how it happened when I set my rep behind ya to Sash.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about the resist gear I lent you, I don't expect it's still on your character anymore.  Now you can argue it's all a game or whatever, but you told me that you were just hoping that everyone wasn't going to hate you - Well I have to admit, when I said they wouldn't, I lied too.  Of course I didn't know the shit that went on.<br>
<br>
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  Guess I shouldn't have trusted the old &quot;my account was hacked&quot; scam.<br>
<br>
Anyway, you are both pieces of shit.  And your mothers are whores, and you smell of rotten fish.  That's about all I have to say about that.<br>

<br>
 It was a rhetorical question because he knows the answer. I doubt if any guild on this server would refuse a recruit because he kept droppable gear from his previous guild. In fact, it is seen as a bonus, that is one character that you don't have to equip up. I know for sure that EV , Comps, Legendary or SI wouldn't demand for them to return their gear.<br>
<br>
 The reason this is such an issue is because Nexxon isn't a &quot; clique &quot; player, being an outsider, it is pretty easy to target him, damn, how many EBayers can the big 4 guilds boast ? you don't see them trashed on the boards or the people who bought their characters ( filled with guild loot). In fact some of the big guilds would recruit the characters knowing that they were bought on ebay, which again, shows that no one cares about other guilds looting rules. ( btw, when I say would, I meant HAVE ).<br>
<br>
  But of course, that is neither here nor there, it is just an interesting point, which you can be pretty sure won't be addressed ( which being guild business is fine). I just want people to keep that in mind while their crucifying those involved ( and I repeat, Telymon and Nexxon deserve the shit their getting) but I do laugh when I see such a blatant double standard.<br>

I can't speak for EV, obviously, but I don't see anywhere in the Comps requirements where it says you must have uber gear to join.  Do we care that a character has epics?  No, not really.  Do we care if they have a trak bp? No not really.  In all the time we have had to evaluate recruits in our guild forums, I have yet to see a person say, &quot;This person has XYZ loot, whew that makes this evalution easier because we don't have to equip them&quot;  I always see comments along the line of &quot;This person is nice, great personality.  I like to hang out with her&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course if, say, a level 60 warrior asking to join showed up with a pair of yaks and a full suit of crafted, then that would be both problematic and comical at the same time.  That person obviously has some issues if they were still in level 30 gear. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Back to the issue, the only loot that I personally care about that was lost was the Gnome Illusion mask, becasue hey, those are irreplaceable and a nice bonus to our rogues and bards in our guild who have earned them.<br>
<br>
That said, I'm curious to hear Revolution's take on this.  I know Xav posted something but take a look at the log Sashanna posted...  Can you really defend this guy?  Actually can you even trust this absoluate liar? <p><hr>

<br>
If they leave and go to the other side of the fence... well at least we know that the people there... have spent the same time, shed the same blood, and earned the same phat loots. Granted, we'd rather have the items to strengthen ourselves, since they were earned on our time and effort... but it's less of an issue when its something that they would have been able to obtain in the other guild. That's my 2cp... speaking from opinion and not for anyone else.<br>
<br>
If someone left Comps or EV to join XYZ newbie_guild_04, I think we'd be a bit more pissed off...<br>
<br>
Though it all depends on who it is, too, and under what circumstances they leave.<br>

<br>
You've stated similar.  My post did not deal with them being placed on the list, merely used them as an example of contradiction.<br>
<br>
My question still stands, and I fully expect to not get a straight answer on it.  Spare me the &quot;it's ok if they go to XXX guild with guild loot and refuse to return it but not ok if they go to YYYY guild.&quot;  Is the book on this thicker than an English dictionary?  It's ok for someone to leave a guild and keep the loot and move &quot;up&quot; or &quot;across&quot; but not &quot;down&quot; correct?  If so, then why is that?   The only reason I can see for it is that that attitude is ONLY beneficial to the guilds who deem themselves the most important and or powerful on the server, since they can accept members from any guild and look the other way when they keep ther former guild's property without feelings of &quot;guilt&quot; or without going against their own ideals.  It's bending the rules in your own favor when this is done.  It also allows them to flame the shit out of anyone and everyone that leaves their guild and does not return the guild property, because according to their own rules you may move up (which is impossible in their eyes), side to side (again not likely to happen and as the weeks go on on Tribunal, side to side is looking less and less of an option as the distance between the &quot;top&quot; 2 grows significantly), and not down (which is the only option).<br>
<br>
Or am I not reading the responses to my question correctly?<br>

As one recent example, I personally spoke with both Chatja and Nicolee before they joined to make sure that all droppable loot from them was returned to Legendary (both had already done so before I spoke to them).<br>
<br>
We have not done this 100 percent consistently in the past - and there are decisions that were made that I am not proud of - but on the whole I think we have tried to do the right thing.<br>
<br>
In a sense its easier for someone going into a very strong guild to give up their guild loot - they know that they will be able to replace it with equivalent or better gear in short order.  Its much harder for someone going into a smaller guild who knows that they will likely not see equivalent gear for a long time. <br>
<br>
So in that sense it is much easier for a strong guild to have this sort of policy - having a SoD on the MT of a small guild would represent a major strategic advantage for the small guild - and would represent a much tougher decision for the leaders of that guild.<br>
<br>
In summary, we do try to make people return droppable guild loot, but I am know damn well that Rynnia is lying in the weeds here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and will jump on me if its not enforced seven months from now in some strange circumstances and call me a hypocrite - so no Im not prepared to say every single time in every single circumstance would someone be forced to return their droppable guild loot - but yeah I think its generally the right thing to do, even if they are left naked for that slot for a short period of time.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, as I alluded to earlier, this isnt a policy that I think is necessarily suitable for a smaller guilds which dont have guild loot structures, its really something that is particular to the larger organisations.  It would be wrong of me to say that small guilds should have these sorts of rules in place - because Im not sure that these rules fit their needs or the needs of their members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://www.ebay.com>Psst...I have a lvl 18 Ranger,<br>only $800 American</a></span><br>  Posts: 388<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 9:44:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=129>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/nosey.JPG WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=178></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Add Nexxon(Qrit) to the ***list for stealing from his fr</span><hr size=1> Good job COVERING YOUR ASS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrakkan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krakkan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/9/02 12:22:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Add Nexxon(Qrit) to the ***list for stealing from his fr</span><hr size=1> Not like matters much, but when i left EV before joined comps I offered my droppables ( which was one item the SoD ) back to high ranking peeps in EV.

Back when I was an officer in SP, Naldara left our guild. SP also had a special rule about Kunark BPs and legs - they belonged to the guild. <br>
<br>
Naldara refused to return those legs. He/She eventually made a post on SPs board where she said they would be returned &quot;when she got something to replace them&quot;.<br>
<br>
When this happened I was told she was trying to join Comps. I got in touch with them and explained the situation about the legs, and she was refusing to return them. <br>
<br>
Naldara was vetoed because of those legs she didn't return to her former guild.<br>
<br>
If I knew that someone was trying to join comps didn't give back their former guild their droppables, when asked to do so, I would attempt to prevent that person from joining. It's all about values, and it's even logical. If person A is willing to steal from guild X, what stops the same person from stealing from guild Y ?. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">
