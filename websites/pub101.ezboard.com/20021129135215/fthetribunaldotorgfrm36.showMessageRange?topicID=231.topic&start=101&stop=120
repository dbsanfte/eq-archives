 Why argue against Merton when he does such a good job of it all by himself? Its kind of funny watching him trip over himself trying to best me...<br>

&quot;As Germany discovered a few years before it is difficult at best to invade a country on its own ground...&quot;<br>
<br>
Germans Defeat the Russians over..And Over...And over...They reach Moscow and the Russians pull in thier troops and make a defensive stand and begin to push the Germans back...<br>
<br>
Of course Merton assumes that the Germans would have not made a simmilar defensive stand on their own ground if they had not been fighting a 2 front war and had not been eating american bombs.. (73% of wich were droped when the Russians began thier drive into europe)<br>
<br>
And of course Merton discounts what would have happend if the Germans still had control of the Air....Of course he knows they did not...Because the RAF/U.S. had it...<br>
<br>
Did I draw it out well enough for you Merton I know your a little slow. Next time I will try to explain  it more clearly so you can ask your special ed teacher all the questions in detail...<br>
<br>
btw there were only 33 Divisions in the East waiting for Japan....<br>
<br>
I honestly dont know how many divisions got moved...Those quotes were posted to show how Merton double talks And to show that Japan not being in the war was a major factor for the USSR as it could commit 90% of its troops to the Germans. <br>

the USSR received lend-lease aid, mostly from the United States, valued at over $11 billion. Among the more significant items were 409,526 trucks, 12,161 tanks and self-propelled guns, 14,000 airplanes, and 325,784 tons of explosives. Furthermore, the Soviet Union was able to commit more than 90 percent of its military strength against Germany, while the Germans were forced to retain a large part of theirs (35 to 45 percent in the years 1943 and 1944) in other theaters. <br>
<br>
Merton Of course claims that the Germans at even 100% would have ment nothing...And he also claims the 409,000 Trucks and 12,161 Tanks did nothing in helping Russia move forces into Eastern Europe...<br>

I believe this is a misconception. If you read the reports of journalists who give their personal impressions of the Iraqi, they all say that Iraqi people tend to like Americans and treat them very well when they are in Iraq. It is the American government that they hate. All the signs (even at the airport there are signs that say 'Down With America' along the ramp) are the results of anger at our policy makers. It seems the Iraqi are smart enough to realize that the US government and it's actions do not represent <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of it's citizens.<br>

Kuwait on the other hand, a country that we liberated, tend to hate American citizens as well as the government and treat them coldly, if not outright rudely, when visiting their country.<br>

Quick answer:  The effects of Allied Strategic Bombing are a myth that was built up over the Cold War years by the RAF and the USAF.  Its obvious, the facts are right there.  So much for breaking down the industrial output of Germany when their production continues to rise continually, heh.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you seriously think that if the Germans made a final stand, that the stand would actually be strong enough to stalemate a 13 million men army at the gates of Berlin?  Surely, you jest.  Unlike the Germans, the Soviets never took their eyes of the prize, which was the cpital.  The Germans blundered when Hitler ordered them to attack in Southern Russia in 1942 instead of resuming an offensive against Moscow in Spring of 1942.<br>

No doubt that the Lorries were the greatest asset to theSoviet army, not the tanks, not the airplanes, not even the raw materials as much, the lorries ( trucks, jeeps, etc.) were the most important.  They helped make the Red Army into a mobile army.<br>
<br>
Now, In regards to tanks. They sucked.  Simple as that.  The art of armored warfare was perfected on the Eastern Front through the uses of sloped armors (thanks to the T-34) which implemented that design in mass production, to elongated gun barrels which increased muzzle velocity (improved armor piercing capacity) to other features, like diesel engines (tanks were less likely to catch fire when hit and had a greater travel distance) and specifically designed wide tracks (that were were handy when traveling over the vast Russian steppes)<br>
<br>
The American tanks, which had no fucking clue how to conduct mobile armored warfare, still clung the the tank concept of World War I, that a tank was an infantry support unit.  Hence the reasoning by beginning of the war was to deploy tanks in piecemeal numbers to support advancing infantry.  Heinz Guderian pioneered the concept of mobile armored warfare in &quot;Achtung Panzer&quot; in 1936, a technique which was further refined into what was known as Blitzkrieg that was implemented with stunning success in 1939 and 1940 in Europe.  The theory basically made the infantry revolve around the mobile armor, instead of having mobile armor revolve around the infantry.<br>
<br>
Basically, the armor of American tanks had the thickness of a condom, and the muzzle velocity was horrible considering that the standard mode of thinking in the US Army was to have tanks use short barrels because tanks were meant to be supporting infantry.  So the Shermans, Stuarts, and other American tanks sent to USSR were utterly useless.  As were the British tanks, the Churchills and the Matildas.  Same thing for the  self propelled guns (the SU series) were designed on the T-34 chassis and were vastly superior to their Western counterparts.  The planes sucked too, aside from the Kittyhawks and Aerocobras, of which very few were sent and even those became obsolete by the time the Red Army start churning out mass quantities of Yak-1 which were yet again superior to their western counterparts and superior to the majority of German planes.<br>
<br>
So, thanks for sending USSR a lot of useless shit.  I'm sure it was appreciated.  And thanks for sending it so late as well, vast majority of the shipments were received in 1944 and 1945 when the Soviet industry was already producing obscene quantities of its own equipment and it was obvious that USSR would win the war.<br>

I believe it was 4-5 divisions, I'll try to find the source for you.  As for tracking down divisions, it is a lot easier to track down German divisions because so many intact records were recovered after the fall of the Reich, its nigh impossible to find data on Soviet divisions during World War II considering a lot of those records werent kept, and furthermore the ones that were kept, were kept in the Soviet archives for 50 some years.  By that time, a lot were missing, destroyed, what not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/10/02 8:51:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: USA supplied Iraq with bioweapons :(</span><hr size=1> It is funny when Merton pretends he's not an American. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 543<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/10/02 10:50:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: USA supplied Iraq with bioweapons :(</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>

It was better than the planes we sent them, but it wasn't better than their western counterparts.  The engine used in the Yak was copied from an older engine designed in the US.  The Russian airforce was in shambles.  There was a time that they didn't have a plane in the sky.  Their earlier and more plentiful aircraft couldn't even reach the german fighters.  Their service ceilings were to low.<br>
<br>
Service Ceilings<br>
Yak-1's - 33k ft (Max speed didn't reach 400mph, all those below did, except for maybe the Wildcat)<br>
Thunderbolt - 43k ft<br>
Mustang - 41k ft<br>
F-4 Wildcat - 34k ft &lt;-piece of shit, was the fighter used by the navy at the start of the war<br>
ME 109 - 34.5k ft (built in 1935, 5 years before the Yak-1)<br>
FW 190 - 35k ft (built 1939)<br>
<br>
The russian airforce was pitiful.<br>
<br>

<br>
A lot of things that were said by Stalin and the Party were done purely to stroke American ego because Stalin was counting on receiving postwar Western aid to help rebuild USSR, something similar to the Marshall Plan.  Aid that never materialized because right after the war, USSR and the West became hostile over Berlin and Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe.<br>
<br>
As for the Yak-1.  It had thick armor, and had 37 mm guns mounted.  Speaking from memory, I believe that a majority of German aircraft were equipped with 20 mm guns and so were the American planes (speaking from memory, not 100% sure about that) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/11/02 12:39:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Weapons on planes can be changed out dependant on the mission role they needed to perform.<br>
<br>
It is likely that the Russians equiped their planes more for a ground attack role.  I could see them equiping their planes with 37mm guns for "tank busting" missions.  Also the Yak series of aircraft had bad high altitude performance, so their plane vs plane fights were avoided, since the German planes were superior in dog fights.<br>
<br>
With that said, the most common configuration for the various planes was:<br>
Yak - 2x12.7 mm mg. ; 1x20mm cannon(mounted in nose I believe, hence all of their aircraft would have had this weapon)<br>
FW-190 - 2x13 mm MG 131 , 2x20mm MG 151, 2x20 mm MG 252 cannons or 1x30 mm MK 108 cannon (This is 5 different configurations, not one)<br>
P-51 - 6 12,7 mm mg. , up to 454 kg of bombs<br>
ME-109 - 2x7.9 mm MG 17 , 2x20mm MG FF cannons, 1 optional MG FF/MM cannon in the engine.<br>
<br>
As for Stalin kissing ass.  I wouldn't doubt that he was on cautious to offend FDR, but that wouldn't explain the lack of credit given to the US for their aid to the USSR during WWII.  So while he didn't want to offend FDR, it's apparent that he didn't want to steal the victory that the Russian people achieved with much cost to life, by giving credit to the US for their aid.<br>
<br>
You have to realize that the aid the US gave to the USSR wasn't just in Tanks and Planes.  As you've said and I agree, the equipment we were sending them was crap compared to the equipment they could make.  It was the raw materials that they needed.  We sent them a shit load of trucks.  The steel that would have been used for those trucks was instead put to tanks.  The reason for this is that the USSR didn't have a large supply of rubber.  So with us making their trucks, it allowed them to make more tanks.<br>
<br>
But back to the raw materials.  Remember the "Scorched Earth" policy given by Stalin.  That scorched earth was some of the best farm land owned by the Russians.  How do you think they fed that huge army of theirs that marched across eastern europe?<br>
<br>
I'm going to look into buying that book I mentioned, and another book I've since found.  I imagine that it will discuss more of the impact of all the foods and raw materials that we sent to Russia, rather than the crap extra equipment we had.  The Russians were bleeding all over the place, they were needing anything and everything to help stop the hemoraging.<br>
<br>
Oh before I forget.  Do you know why the Germans were producing more and more each year, despite the bombing from the Western Allies?  Germany's economy wasn't put into full war effort gears until later in the war.  In the early portions of the war when the Germans were kicking ass, their people were living high on the hog.  They didn't start making sacrifices like the UK and US civilian economies did, until much later.<br>
<br>
So you can't look at how much more they produced from the year previous.  You have to look at how much less they produced than what they were expecting.  Those expected figures were taking into account the retooling of their industries to output more war orientated materials.<br>
<br>
I'm also guessing that the reasons behind you thinking that the Allied bombing campaign played little part in the victory, is because of the source books you've been reading.  I'm betting that the source books are probably very pro-Stalin, pro-Russia.  Stalin was of the same idea as you Merton.  He thought that the allied bombing was doing nothing for him.   He wanted a REAL second front.  He wanted US and UK troops in France, fighting German troops.  He wanted this so bad, that he discounted any kind of bombing campaign.  It also doesn't help that the only serious Russian attempt to bomb German industries met with complete failure in 1941.  The planes used by the Russians were out dated, and frankly pieces of crap compared to allied warplanes of the time.  Plus they had the problem of having to travel over farther distances than the other allies.<br>

The way you and I perceive the facts, being from 2 different cultures is of course different.  But if you're wondering whether I read pro-stalin/russia books, I dont think they as such.  The foundation upon I started building my understanding of the conflict was Alan Clark's Barbarossa, I've read a ton of smaller books that focused on individual operations and political figures in that period, but I do regard Alexander Werth's &quot;Russia At War&quot; as the definitive magnum opus on the conflict on the Eastern Front.<br>
<br>
Werth, was a BBC correspondent (was not born in USSR and I dont think he even has rootsa in Eastern Europe which might cloud his opinions and objectivity) who spent 1939-1945 on the Soviet front lines documenting facts, data, and interviewing Soviet military leaders.  The amount of access he had to various areas during the war is astounding.  He was one of the very few correspondents to see Paulus immediately after his capture at Stalingrad, he interviewed Chuikov right after the counterattack on Nov 19th, 1942 (the man who orchestrated the defense of Stalingrad), he was present at Stalingrad, Battle of Kursk Salient, Moscow counter-offensive, Leningrad right after the siege was lifted, Operation Bagration, he was retreating alongside the Russian forces in the summer of 1942.  Not only does he provide excellent and I think unbiased analysis (he discounts a lot of Soviet statistics and points out a lot of discrepancies in stories given by various Soviet generals) but he also provides a &quot;human&quot; aspect to the conflict.  He interviews civilians, describes his experiences, etc.  Its about 1300(?) pages I think, it is an excellent source on Eastern Front in my opinion and I havent found anything in 5 years to rival it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uyolk44.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yolk44</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/11/02 2:00:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> ok merton give it a rest already you fuckin dick head. bottom line is your country sucks and so do you so please shut your fuckin face for everones sake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 554<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/11/02 4:20:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=113>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thanks</span><hr size=1> Yolk, why don't you STFU.

<br>
Merton, you mentioned that we are from two different cultures.  From all that I've gathered you live in Chicago, now you may not have grown up there I suppose.  (I'm from Chicago as well)  What culture did you grow up in?<br>
<br>
What did Werth say about the food supplies that the Russians were receiving on the lines?  IIRC war rations fed to the US troops had no paper labels, but rather black ink, so I'd imagine that even the Russian military could hide where the food was coming from.  Unless we had printed the labels in Russian.  /shrugs<br>
<br>
I'll admit that I'm not well versed as to the geographic climate of Western Russia, but how far east is the land usable for farming?  With the scorched earth policy, the land that was given to the Germans wasn't useful, and the peasants that would have had to stay to farm it had retreated with the armies.  Where did Russia get it's food resources to feed its people?<br>
<br>
I'll have to look into grabbing that book as well.<br>

I don't hate America, and whilst it seems that I am some sort of America hating foreigner, since I mostly argue positions that are against U.S., I simply grow weary of the vast amount of jingoism that is trumpeted, particularly after 9/11.  And nothing irks me more than when some ignorant hack comes on the boards and starts preaching to Europeans how &quot;america saved their ass from Hitler&quot; every time Europe disagrees on some foreign policy move that U.S. makes.<br>
<br>
Werth mentions multiple times about the food quantities that USSR receives, he does not go into the specifics like food labeling and such.  As for food supplies themselves... people starved.  That was one of major reasons that Soviets basically did not start taking German POW's until 1943, the reasoning was that if USSR could not even feed its own people, why in the hell would they feed the German POW's?  From 1943 and onward, taking POW's became more common since Stalin wanted bargaining chips for the post war discussions.  Some food came from capturing German supplies (more than you'd expect).  As for the land, although Germans penetrated fairly deeply into Southern Russia in 1942, the Northern Russia was left unscathed since the fighting mostly revolved around operations in Southern Ukraine and such.  As for farmable land, in the middle of the country, USSR is split by the Ural mountains from north to south, to the east of Urals is Siberia which was basically unfarmable land due to the massive forests that stretched for thousands of miles.  Finally, Stalin's scorched earth polciy was not enforced very diligently, due to rapid German advances in 1941 and 1942, Soviets more often than not did not even have the time to scorch the land because the retreats were so massive and disorganized until they managed to make a stand at Stalingrad at the end of 1942. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 556<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/11/02 6:57:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=117>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Interesting...</span><hr size=1> You're the second person that I know from Latvia.<br>
