Well yes Aaladorn, but wait! How many people did RNG first use to kill emp? Of course you don't think it's enough to make a sound attempt on emp, I mean if RNG has to use 100+, obviously no other guild can do it with less!<br>

<br>
Now let's begin....Blood is up - fine...you want to kill him and waste Emp spawn?  fine..however let's get the facts straight - Lego was actually in the zone to originally do cursed.  We knew blood was up but we also knew emp was not yet.  Once we found out both were up we went up to the portal and went in.<br>
<br>
With 20/20 hindsight we should not have ported in if we knew you were there.  But also with 20/20 hindsight you may also admit to purposefully going after blood to waste the emp - especially when both were up.<br>
<br>
You should know how the prep room works....if you are in it while the emp room is engaged it becomes a death trap - you also can't click out.  So when your group of 22 engaged blood we had to move and move fast....we ran into the room on the opposite side of where you were, careful to not get close enough to aggro.  Not sure you know how close you actually have to be to get the aggro...but it's close.  We sat in the corner and watched you wipe.  At which point all of a sudden a monk from DA looks to be running at us and FD's -- with the mobs on him bringing them close enough to aggro us..now I personally can't confirm who it was as my pc names were off and I was a little busy assisting and doing my raid job to check - but this is how it &quot;looked&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, we camped a few people out, let the mobs reset, and logged back in and set up.  We were ready to go again when all of a sudden there was a Guide there - not a Senior Guide either but a newly made Guide (not an apprentice.)  He asked who our raid leader was, I decided to go ahead and step in to talk to him (I am not the raid leader but I am one of the guild leaders of lego.)  I explained what had happened, explained the #'s involved of each guild and explained the Emp  encounter to him -- he told me his guild on his play server has killed him twice but he didn't understand the encounter at all -- At this point he says he has to wait for a GM as he is not allowed to make any decision on a high end mob (Sony for some reason considers Emp a high end mob.)<br>
-----<br>
Side note -- I talked to a higher end guide later about 2 hours after this incident and she said what they are supposed to do in this situation is just give it to the guild/party who has sufficient force - and if you need an example of this I think FoH at their best did Emp with 30, so don't tell me you can do it with 22 (although at the zone in after the roll you claimed it was possible for you)<br>
-----<br>
At this point was guild was livid - we were buffed and ready *IN* the Emp room ready to go.  DA was at zone in with the 22 people while slowly gathering more forces to show they had a force (that wasn't there at the start mind you - and this is something they HAVE done before.)<br>
<br>
Instead of just taking the spawn like some guilds might have - and looking back we should have just done so as we see GM's don't reprimand guilds on Tribunal for anything - we waited.  A chat GM finally told this Guide to invoke the PnP (I doubt without fully understanding the *entire* situation.)  So this guide sends me a tell saying &quot;You will both roll and the winner will have 5 minutes to engage or lose the spawn&quot;<br>
That seemed acceptable(even though DA still did not have enough for Emp at this point) since we knew a GM would be a long time in coming IF at all, and I had some ancy guildmates ready to kill Emp.<br>
<br>
The Guide summons me to zone in and we roll.  Oh darn I lost the roll.  Here is where I got pissed however.  The Guide then says ok DA now has 5 minutes from entering the prep room to engage or lose the spawn.  This is *NOT* what he had told me.  Notice the HUGE difference between 5 minutes to engage and 5 minutes from enterinng prep room to engage.  This gave DA an unlimited ammount of time to double+ their force before going to prep room.  In other words it gave them as much time as they wanted - not 5 minutes.  This was not a fair compromise, not a fair situation, and definitly was NOT what I had agreed to.<br>
<br>
I tell the Guide that we do not abide with this rule as he changed what he had me agree to.  I don't care if he messed up - you keep to your 1st agreement and honor it.  As a Guide you don't make a mistake like that and uphold it.  We never got away with that when I was a Guide (yes I did that crap and it sucked.)  I also mention that since we don't abide with his decision since he contradicted what he said we would wait for a real GM and not move from the room.  However we still did NOT engage blood at this point.  We did the honorable thing by waiting (which I guess is not what we should have done - perhaps we should have been like everyone else and just did what we wanted.)<br>
<br>
Now after multiple tells to this Guide asking if a GM is coming, saying we are still waiting etc, he won't respond to me.  He flat out ignores me - now there is great customer service =/<br>
<br>
After 45+ minutes DA shows up in Emp room.  Now at this point I could care less about the eye, the wiz who cast it, who killed it, etc - that's moot - if he was casting the eye he was doing it for a mez target hopefully.  If not then he should not have been casting it.  Regardless of how he should have been sitting so he wouldn't move when the eye was dead - frankly I don't know as his english isn't the best - regardless what happens DA wipes - at this point I had to log so I could go home from work - yes I work where I can play eq too - but from what I heard afterwards we decided to go ahead and leave for possobly causig that wipe, and we were losing people as our raid time was getting further from us and people were logging.<br>
<br>
There's the story, there is the situation that happened and the outcome was DA got Emp, thanks to calling in a Guide to stall while they gathered forces.  Look at it anyway you want, but that is what happened - there was a huge stall.<br>
<br>
If you were ONLY going after Blood like you say you would not have waited for the forces for the Emp.  If you say you wanted Emp then you stalled.  Either way it doesn't look to good does it?<br>
<br>
By the way after finally speaking to a GM over the incident - I contatced one not because of DA but due to the crappy way the Guide handled it - the issue is being further looked into to see if the Guide was in the wrong etc.  But this is all moot for most people here...I just don't want crappy Guides on our server since we already have a lack of GM's. <p><p><table border=0>

Well, since I was there and the Lego raid leader at the time, let's go over what actually happened.<br>
<br>
DA is there.<br>
<br>
- True.  DA has 22 people farming insignias when we arrive to kill Cursed.  (Emperor has not yet popped).<br>
<br>
Lego comes.<br>
<br>
- True.  Emperor pops, so we get ready to go for Emperor with a force of about 50ish.<br>
<br>
Lego is getting ready to jump DA.<br>
<br>
DA petitions.<br>
<br>
DA decides to give it a whirl, since Lego has the reputation of being fucknut spawn jumpers (*points at Ntov*)<br>
<br>
Lego gets caught in the wipeout.<br>
<br>
-  Not exactly.  Shortly before we get to Emperor, DA jumps into the Emperor portal.  (Yes, we had a watcher planted there who saw you enter the portal).  So, knowing that you can't kill Emperor (just try to say that you can), we zone into the portal room just in case you manage to kill blood.  We set up in the opposite corner (because we don't like having our asses chain ae'd), give strict instructions not to interfere and set targets.  We're not going to touch blood, we'll either watch you wipe, or wait for you to TL out after you've looted blood.  (You didn't actually expect us to skip emp and let you cockblock us did you?)  DA however wipes, and the mobs are trained onto our camp.  Were mezzes broken?  Not sure.  Things were rather chaotic.  However, DA did wipe, and we were trained.<br>
<br>
Guide arrives, tells them both to roll.<br>
<br>
- True.  DA has the gall to tell the Guide that in fact Emperor was their intended target with a raid force of 22.  Keep in mind, this is at 4:30 pm EST, long before their prime raid time.<br>
<br>
Lego loses.<br>
<br>
- True.  The guide informs us that DA will have 5 mins to engage which we are willing to accept.  20 mins later, the guide says that actually he meant 5 mins from prep room.  In this time, DA has increased it's raid numbers to 40.<br>
<br>
Lego wizard fucks around while DA preps. <br>
<br>
- True.  That wizard was casting eyes of zomm in order to target mobs.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
DA kills eye, Lego wizard aggros Blood, both die.<br>
<br>
- False.  DA did kill the eye.  Lego wizard did run into blood (a bonehead move).  DA did wipe.  We never got aggro.  Our entire raid force was still sitting in the corner.<br>
<br>
Legendary leaves. (Good move. I'm sure the guide would have been very unhappy to find out you stayed there and interfered with their attempt).<br>
<br>
- We left because the whole affair was beyond stupid at this point, and it was 2 hours past our normal raid time, and there were no GM's online, and it looked like DA would be another hour of prepping.  (Shock, it took DA another 90 mins before they engaged Emp after we left).<br>
<br>
And it's supposed to be Dragon Army's fault that they died the second time to a train caused by a Legendary member?<br>
<br>
- No, considering we didn't wipe from blood aggro.  Just DA wiped from the AE, and one wizard.  Was it DA's fault that blood aggro'd?  No.  It was that wizard's fault.  He screwed up.  End of story.<br>
<br>
Now, where does this all put us?<br>
<br>
Did DA intentionally try to blow blood just to cockblock Emperor knowing there was a full raid force in Ssra already AND that the odds of killing blood were slim?<br>
<br>
Yes.  Deny if you wish, however I personally recieved tells from multiple members of DA admitting that the only reason they tried Blood was they had nothing to lose.  IE, if they lost, we got emp.  If they won, they would cockblock Emp for a period of 8 hours.<br>
<br>
Did the guide make the correct decision?  Of course not.  A Senior guide AND a GM did eventually contact us about 5 hours later and told us that sufficient force should have been the standard.  IE, 22 isn't enough to kill emp, so get the hell out.  OR, if blood is your intended target, take a run at blood, if you lose it goes to someone else.<br>
<br>
It's simple.  If you want to jump another raid force in place, there's nothing in the Eula that says you can't.  However, don't think you'll make friends that way.  If you don't care about friends, that's a choice you make.<br>
<br>
As for the NToV comments.  *waaaaa*  Sorry, but when someone's not actually a member of a rotation, OR applying for that rotation, then what exactly are you whining about?<br>
<br>
Aside from that, get over it.  Every guild on this server has made questionable decisions in the past.  Would we change some here and there?  Sure.  Who wouldn't.  As for what you do today, what's your excuse?<br>
<br>
And as for DA being on track?  Um, excuse me while I die of laughter in the corner.<br>
<br>
How many times did you clear VT again?<br>
<br>
How close are you to Sol'Ro/Elemental flags?<br>
<br>
Oh, what's that? Zero?  And 15 flag events back?<br>
<br>
No, sorry.  DA isn't even on the radar.<br>
<br>
Come back after you've ganked some pre-elemental gods, racked up some VT clearings, and flagged up most of your guild.  Then maybe you'll be on the Radar.<br>
<br>
Is DA progressing?  Yes.  And I'll be the first to congratulate you on your recent wins.  (Grats on Manaetic Bahemoth a few days ago btw).<br>
<br>
However, maybe you better look long and hard at the pop progression path before you let that ego spin too far out.  It's a long road baby.<br>

<br>
There was 17 or so odd DA in Zone when we got there.  Sufficient Force for Blood? Doubtful...need right classes...which they did not have.  There was 22 when we clicked in...still a sufficient force issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lego is getting ready to jump DA<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Jump them?  Welcome to last year.  If your guild zones in with 65 people and sees Emp+Blood up and the most any other guild has there is 22 what the fuck would you do?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>DA petitions<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually both guilds petitioned...they trained thier failed attempt on us, after refusing to stand aside for sufficient force and engaging Blood to attempt to get him down before we could get prepped for Emp.  Kinda makes thier wipeout in the prep room due to the Eye seem a little less signifigant because at least we can say it was an accident, partially caused by Filwen killing Reistling's Eye.  They engaged knowing we were in prep room, either that was a purposeful attempt to wipe us or just inexperience since thier antics later proved they didn't know what happens in prep room when Blood is engaged.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>DA decides to give it a whirl, since Lego has the reputation of being fucknut spawn jumpers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmmm well if they followed our reputation closely they would know we only jumped a spawn after some fucknutted guild trained us for being in a 3 dungeon zone on thier turn in 1 of those dungeons.  You aren't still obsessed with that are you Challia?<br>

Guide changes circumstances surrounding the incident and DA spends a FUCKING HOUR prepping...tell me you would just stand there after finding out you just got fucked...and correct me if I am wrong the ruling was 5 minutes from entering prep room...they were in prep room longer than 5 minutes already...so throw what the dipshit Guide said right into your outbox buddy.<br>

<br>
Come on Challia...that's just a tad biased...he made an Eye for targetting, DA Enchanter kills it, Wizard confuses the death and switchback with initial switch...and runs into snakes thinking he is the Eye.  Now reguardless of how dumb it was of him to be standing when he ran with the eye, if the DA Chanter had not made the hostile and interfering move then it never would have happened.  Therefore the CUASE is the DA Enchanter interfering with the Legendary Forces inside chamber waiting on a GM.  Pretty simple to figure out if you ask me.<br>

<br>
Where the fuck did we say we trained them?  Anyone who said that about the Eye incident wasn't in full possesion of the facts, much like yourself.  And for the record I believe the Transcended response in NToV when we asked why they trained was this almost exactly:<br>
<br>
'We trained them and they died, haha, they r teh n00b'<br>
<br>
You got so mad at Legendary because of the end result of the dispute, Trans got screwed out of a couple of Dragons in NToV.  To date that is still about the only thing you really talk about on the Flameboard.  It has absorbed you within itself.  You are surrounded by bullshit.  Did it ever occur to you that Training Legendary at the Zone in and getting booted from the Zone by a GM might have just pissed them off enough to do something like that?  I'm not taking sides either way because both guilds fucked up.  <br>
<br>
It just amazes me at how convinced you are to this day how that one day like (?) 14 months ago in NToV Transcended acted as pure as the driven snow and got totally and maliciously screwed by the evil Legendary who zoned in only to fuck you over that day.  It's really quite pathetic.  And the degree of how bad it warped you is evidenced above in your bungled and biased interpretation of what happened yesterday in Ssra.<br>
<br>
An instance where we got screwed by a guild trying to hold a spawn while they are desperately low in numbers and a clueless guide got involved and we got trained, sabotaged, robbed, and utterly screwed.  And you know what...it really doesn't bother me all that much.<br>
<br>
Next thing you know you will be supporting ass fucks that claim a camp from the ZI just as long as it's a Legendary group that wants to move in there.<br>
<br>

Actually it was because Filwen killed his eye.  <br>
<br>
And the fact that you guys sat there and died like dumbasses...at least we had the sense to LEAVE the prep room when the AE started going off after you engaged Blood the first time.<br>

The spawn is not wasted.  He is up again in 8 hours.  Loot is still gotten from that spawn.  It is not like statue, where if you killed him and didnt kill AoW, the AoW was gone till next week.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you were ONLY going after Blood like you say you would not have waited for the forces for the Emp. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
We were only going for Blood two weeks ago, when we killed him at like 1 or 2 am PST with 24.  Lego got the respawn of that emp in the morning.  AN was pissed because they would have got emp if we hadn't killed it.  That was what my previous post was about.<br>
<br>
No one is saying we only planned on killing blood that day.  The plan was to kill blood early (when we had 22 on), so he would respawn later when we had people on.  We were trying to block emp from lego so we could kill emp later and get enough shards to do VT.  Lego has been trying to block / delay DA from getting into VT by killing emp to prevent us from getting enough shards (left VT early last week to make sure he died before our raid time).  I do not have a problem with that, its how the high level game works, so I also don't have a problem if people kill blood just for loot, or to knock emp back 8 hours.  I would be pissed if some guild did it so emp would respawn during their raid time, but I would understand why they did it.<br>
<br>
Back to us killing blood two weeks ago...killling blood just for loot without any intention of killing emp is less &quot;bad&quot; than killing statue and not trying AoW was back before Idol was added.  No one gave a shit when you did that back then.  When you let AOW despawn, the loot / attempt was lost.  If you let emp despawn, the same emp with the same loot will be up again 8 hours later, and the loot will still enter the game. <p><hr>

Reist casting an eye is nothing out of the ordinary and if Filwen hadn't killed it then his failure to sit down would have never even mattered.<br>
<br>
Cause/Effect relationship.<br>
<br>
Rieslting casts an eye...no effect<br>
<br>
Riestling forgets to sit...no effect<br>
<br>
Filwen kills eye while Riest is maneuvering it...Effect: DA sits in the prep room cussing while they all die.<br>
<br>
Is it Reistlings fault that they just sat there and died Bagazan?<br>

That you were expecting it, and they weren't.

Well actually it *was* contested thats the whole point here isn't it?<br>
<br>
And while on that subject -- there was more than one post in this thread saying you were only going after blood, not emp, well if this is case why are you now saying you were going after emp?<br>
<br>
Which one is it?  It doesn't matter how you slice it...it still looks bad.<br>

As for the AoW thing, we didn't mean to intentionally blow AoW - we were trying to kill it back then, learning strats, unlike some guilds...contrary to popular beleif we don't go in and zerg everything on site -<br>
<br>
However you are admiting to intentionally blowing emp spawn for 8 more hours....that is different isn't it?<br>

No one said Royal Norrathian Guard had to use 100. RNG may of had a massive raid force but they did not require how many ever showed up for their first emp kill, guild pride not heard of within your guild? It is just plain retarded and ignorant to use the excuse of 22 people to kill Blood for &quot;just loot&quot; and blow the encounter for a guild who is there in force; and maybe hoping to postponing the Emperor to fall into your raid time.<br>
<br>
Just curious. How many did EV tag to be the first ones on the Tribunal to down Emp? I am guessing it was over 10, right? How many did they have for the Emp kill while your at it aswell since numbers are relevant in this matter.<br>
<br>
I hoped I wouldn't have to put a disclaimer in my posts saying that my opinions are mine alone and should not reflect my guild. But you drones think that everything someone says is of a collective mind and expressed these thoughts to me in game, not on the message board where they belong.<br>
<br>
So here's my disclaimer: My opinions on this, and any other, matter is mine alone and should not and does not reflect the way Royal Norrathian Guard views this or any other matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aaladornastrielflare>AaladornAstrielflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/03 11:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ghost.3drealm.net/webshare/dorfcat/dorfcat-th.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragon Army</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>OMFG SIT AFTER YOU CAST EYE OF ZOMM/TALLON <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No surprise there.  The fact that they pretend that they have a shred of respectability left is what makes this highly amusing.<br>
<br>
Don't tempt me, Arec.  I might just reactivate the account and come back, if the account isn't somewhere on Zeboxurok by now.<br>
<br>
Or better yet, sell Merton to DA for 50$ so they can perma camp him in Ssra or VT to train you losers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td
