19.07.2003<br>
<br>
<br>
LONDON - Police searching for a former UN weapons inspector at the heart of a row over whether the British Government twisted intelligence to justify war in Iraq have found a body. <br>
<br>
David Kelly, a soft-spoken microbiologist at the Defence Ministry who had worked for UN inspectors in Iraq, disappeared after he went out for a walk on Thursday with no coat despite heavy rain. <br>
<br>
&quot;The body of a man has been found,&quot; said Acting Superintendent Dave Purnell, but he could not confirm the man's identity. <br>
<br>
Kelly had been grilled by parliamentarians on Tuesday after admitting he spoke to a BBC reporter, Andrew Gilligan. <br>
<br>
Gilligan said in May that a senior intelligence source told him the Government &quot;sexed up&quot; intelligence on Iraq. <br>
<br>
Gilligan's report sparked parliamentary hearings into how the Government made the case for war, forced Prime Minister Tony Blair on to the defensive and pitted Government officials against the BBC in a heated war of words. <br>
<br>
Clearly uncomfortable in the spotlight, Kelly, 59, had told the foreign affairs committee he had met Gilligan, but denied telling him that Blair's communications chief, Alastair Campbell, had ordered intelligence to be hyped. <br>
<br>
The Government said it thought Kelly might be Gilligan's only source, suggesting that differences between his account and Gilligan's proved the BBC story was wrong. <br>
<br>
Gilligan has not said whether he had a source for his report other than Kelly. <br>
<br>
Under questioning from the parliamentary committee, Kelly said he did not believe he was the main source of the story. Committee members appeared to agree, labelling him a Government &quot;fall guy&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dr Kelly is a scientist. He's not used to the media glare, he is not used to the intense spotlight he was put under, and frankly, even hardened professionals can find that type of pressure hard to cope with,&quot; committee member Richard Ottoway, an Opposition Conservative politician, told Sky television. <br>
<br>
&quot;We concluded he had been given rather bad treatment by the Government. So let us hope nothing sinister has happened here. But it does bring into question exactly what the Government thought it was doing by putting him up as a witness on its behalf.&quot; <br>
<br>
Gilligan quoted his source as saying Campbell had pressed intelligence chiefs to insert into a dossier on Iraq a dubious assertion that Baghdad could use weapons of mass destruction at 45 minutes' notice. <br>
<br>
Campbell has denied the allegation. <br>
<br>
MPs grilled Gilligan behind closed doors on Thursday and said the reporter had backed away from his allegations against Campbell. The reporter himself called the questioning an &quot;ambush&quot;. <br>
<br>
Three months after Saddam's overthrow, no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq. <br>
<br>
In a sign of the pressure Kelly faced this week, he told the committee he was unable to answer questions about just which journalists he had met in recent months because he was unable to get home to consult his diaries. <br>

Chronology of Dispute Over Iraq Dossier<br>
Associated Press<br>
<br>
Key dates in controversy over British government dossier on Iraq weapons:<br>

<br>
May 29: British Broadcasting Corp. defense correspondent Andrew Gilligan reports a senior British official claims the September dossier was &quot;sexed up&quot; to make a more convincing case for military action.<br>
<br>
June 1: Gilligan, writing in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, says Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell, was responsible for adding the 45-minute claim.<br>
<br>
June 19: Gilligan testifies before House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.<br>
<br>
June 25: Campbell appears before committee, denies adding material to dossier and demands apology from BBC.<br>
<br>
July 7: Committee, on a party-line vote, says Campbell did not add material to dossier.<br>
<br>
July 8: Anonymous Ministry of Defense official acknowledges meeting Gilligan to discuss dossier, but denies mentioning Campbell.<br>
<br>
July 9: Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon, in a letter to the BBC, identifies the official as David Kelly, a weapons adviser.<br>
<br>
July 15: Kelly tells Foreign Affairs Committee he believes he was not the source of Gilligan's report, but confirms that they met.<br>
<br>
July 17: Gilligan recalled to private session of Foreign Affairs Committee. Chairman Donald Anderson said Gilligan was an &quot;unsatisfactory witness&quot; who changed his story; Gilligan rejects charge.<br>
<br>
Late that night, Kelly was reported missing.<br>
<br>
July 18: Body, tentatively identified as Kelly, found in woods near his home.<br>

I was hoping for comments more along the lines of whether the pressure being exerted on him by government and the claims he was a patsy contributed to his suicide and if so, what if anything should be done about similar cases in the future.<br>

I don't know of anything that could be done. He came forward and admitted to an unauthorized meeting with Gilligan, he says many things mentioned in Gilligan's report are similar to the things he had talked about, Hoon writes a private letter to the BBC and his name eventually comes out. Folks are trying to blame Blair's people for his death now and it's complete nonsense. Both sides had put equal pressure on him for their own gain.<br>

<br>

Mr Mackinlay: &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dr Kelly: &quot;I've met very few journalists.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr Mackinlay: &quot;I've heard 'few'. Who are the ones in your mind's eye at the moment? What's their names?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dr Kelly: &quot;That will be provided to you by the Ministry of Defence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr Mackinlay: &quot;No, no, I'm asking you now. This is the high court of Parliament and I want you to tell the committee who you met.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dr Kelly: &quot;On this occasion it would be proper if the Ministry of Defence communicated that to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr Mackinlay: &quot;Do you know of any other enquiries which have gone on in the department to seek the source, to clarify, in addition to you or instead of you, or apart from you? None whatsoever? No?<br>
<br>
&quot;I reckon you're chaff. You've been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like the fall guy? I mean, you've been set up haven't you?&quot;<br>

Dr Kelly: &quot;No, I accept the process that's going on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sir John Stanley, Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling: &quot;You were being exploited to rubbish Mr Gilligan and his source, quite clearly.&quot;<br>

<br>
That certainly shifts the heat away from the government and towards the BBC. They're now forced to dispute Kelly's honesty when he spoke to the committee. And it seems that pretty much everyone believed Kelly's version of events. It makes it appear that the government was right all along... and the BBC's refusal to admit it forced the spotlight to be put on Kelly, not Blair's handling of the situation or a 'leaked' name.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The admission casts further doubt on the report that sparked the battle with Downing Street because Dr Kelly told a Commons committee last week that he could not see how he could have been Mr Gilligan’s source on the basis of their conversations because it ascribed views that he had not expressed. “I believe I am not the main source,” he said. <br>
<br>
The BBC continued to maintain that it “accurately interpreted and reported” the factual information that it obtained during interviews with Dr Kelly. Mr Gilligan last night issued a statement saying: “I did not misquote or misrepresent Dr David Kelly.” <br>
<br>
MPs on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee branded Mr Gilligan an “unsatisfactory witness” who had changed his story when he appeared before them for a second time last week. <br>
<br>
And it left a big question mark over the head of Richard Sambrook, BBC director of news, and Greg Dyke, the Director-General. Mr Sambrook said on June 26 that the story was based on “one senior and credible source in the intelligence services”. <br>
<br>
Mr Dyke is understood to have persuaded the BBC Board of Governors to back the story on July 6 when they issued a statement that journalists could use single sources if the information came from “senior intelligence”. <br>
<br>
Dr Kelly, a weapons expert, was not a member of any intelligence agency and could not accurately be called an intelligence source...<br>
<br>
Mr Jackson said that he believed that the BBC’s conduct was appalling. He said: “If they (the BBC) had made this statement while Dr Kelly was alive, I believe he would still be alive and I think the Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors should resign over this matter. <br>
<br>
“I believe Gavyn Davies knew Dr Kelly’s name and he clearly misled his Governors in telling them that this was a senior intelligence source. I believe the Chairman of the BBC Governors as a matter of public accountability should resign from his office forthwith.” <br>
<br>
Mr Jackson was also critical of Mr Gilligan and called for the journalist to resign. He said: “It seems quite clear that Mr Andrew Gilligan systematically invented a substantial part of his very damaging story.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Informed sources said that Mr Davies and Mr Dyke - both past Labour donors - had felt the need to prove their independence. &quot;Greg had a rush of blood to the head and sexed up Richard Sambrook's letters,&quot; a senior MP said.<br>
<br>
Later Mr Davies blocked Mr Dyke seeking to seize peace feelers. &quot;If it emerged he'd found some accommodation with the government it would have destroyed his credibility within the organisation. He'd have been dismissed as a Labour patsy,&quot; the MP said.<br>
<br>
However, there are signs that BBC executives feel the pugnacious strategy was ill-judged, with hindsight at least.<br>
<br>
One well-placed source said last night: &quot;The question that is being looked at very seriously is whether it was right to mount an all-out defence, or whether it required more moderation: an admission perhaps that there were some aspects of the story that we cannot be entirely sure about.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Senior BBC executives seemed isolated from their own staff last night when the corporation implicitly accused David Kelly of failing to be entirely open when he appeared before MPs last week.<br>
<br>
Andrew Gilligan, the journalist at the centre of the row, said he did not misquote Dr Kelly in his original report. Executives believe privately that the scientist, who committed suicide on Thursday, held reservations about Downing Street's involvement in the notorious September dossier which he did not air to the foreign affairs select committee.<br>
<br>
But journalists, editors and presenters contacted by the Guardian yesterday questioned - on condition of anonymity - the credibility of this stance. They expressed doubt about the positions of Gilligan and Richard Sambrook, the director of news, who has given unswerving support to the reporter since he learned that Dr Kelly was his source. A few even talk darkly of revolt. Support for Gilligan, outside the increasingly fraught confines of the Today programme where he is defence and diplomatic correspondent, is slipping away. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's one thing if the top brass choose to go to the wall for Gilligan. It's quite another if they expect us to do it too,&quot; one insider said...<br>
<br>
The change in mood could not have been more stark. Until 9.30am on Friday, when Thames Valley police announced the disappearance of Dr Kelly, the BBC had occupied a large expanse of sure ground. Its determination not to reveal its source was seen as a principled stand that contrasted favourably with the cynical and shadowy Whitehall moves to push Dr Kelly unwillingly into the spotlight. Last night, however, the sure ground was rapidly shrinking.<br>
<br>
A cloud of gloom descended over the organisation when it admitted that Dr Kelly was Gilligan's source. One well-known BBC name said of the BBC's announcement yesterday: &quot;It's a bombshell. Like many others here, I had the impression that the source was not Kelly. My worry is that we may have misdescribed him right at the start, when we called him a senior credible intelligence source. Is that really what David Kelly was? All I can say is that I hope Andrew Gilligan has got very good shorthand.&quot;...<br>
<br>
Many hoped that Gilligan had another source, other than Dr Kelly, for the key claim that Downing Street &quot;sexed up&quot; the September dossier. &quot;We were all willing to support him, but we were desperately worried that Kelly - as it has turned out - was indeed the source.&quot;<br>
<br>
The BBC's confirmation that Dr Kelly provided the information upon which Gilligan based his story has rocked many at the BBC. &quot;Now that it's been revealed that Kelly was the main source, we think Gilligan should resign, and - reluctantly - Sambrook too,&quot; said one journalist.<br>
<br>
Another said: &quot;The BBC statement is a disaster. On the face of it, based on the evidence to hand, Gilligan sexed up his story. The only other explanation is that David Kelly wasn't being truthful to the committee, but I tend to think now that Gilligan did what he accused Campbell of. And our boss backed him. If that's true, they have tarnished each and every one of us. Until they prove otherwise they have lost my confidence. They should go.&quot;...<br>
<br>
One well-known BBC presenter said Gilligan was damaged by his bruising reaction to the select committee's claim on Friday that he had changed his story - Gilligan claimed to have been set up in front of a &quot;hanging jury&quot;.<br>
<br>
This was &quot;lurid language&quot;, totally inappropriate for the circumstances, the presenter said. &quot;The Today programme is tarnished.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The top people aren't in a big flap about this. But we can't come out and say Kelly misled the committee because the man's a national hero. That's the hook the BBC finds itself on.&quot;<br>
<br>
But BBC journalists believe this is a position that is indefensible. One said: &quot;If that's the case, they have to prove to Lord Hutton that Kelly misled the committee. Who will any right-minded person believe? A man, seen as hero who has taken his own life, or a journalist who appears shifty and evasive?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
heh Just yesterday I thought it was quite probable that Blair would end up resigning because of this... everyone believed that Kelly was not 'the source' and people were constantly asking him about the &quot;blood on his hands&quot;. Now it looks as if the BBC has put itself into a position that'll make the New York Times/Jayson Blair situation look tame. No one's going to much enjoy the BBC calling David Kelly a liar... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 7/20/03 6:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1408<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/21/03 5:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Heads should roll at the BBC for this.<br>

There have been former US generals saying the same thing - in the short term this may result in more attacks as Saddam tries to assert himself and exact revenge. Not much can be done about that though and even if it does result in increased attacks in the short term (which I hope it doesn't) it is still well worth the long term results.<br>

8&lt;============================<br>
<br>
The BBC has a tape of David Kelly expressing serious concern about how Downing Street made the case for war, the Guardian can reveal.<br>
<br>
Susan Watts, science editor of Newsnight, recorded her conversations with the weapons expert, who killed himself on Thursday.<br>
<br>
In her report she quoted a &quot;source&quot; - now known to be Dr Kelly - suggesting that No 10 was &quot;desperate&quot; for information and had exaggerated &quot;out of all proportion&quot; the claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
The BBC believes the tape is the &quot;smoking gun&quot; that will exonerate Andrew Gilligan, the Today programme correspondent who originally reported the suggestion that No 10 included the 45-minute claim in the September dossier on the case for war &quot;to make it sexier&quot;, against the wishes of the intelligence community.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1519<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/03 8:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> All the reports I've seen about that today suggest that it's not really a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, as far as proving that Gilligan did not hype up his report.  <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The publication of evidence from the BBC journalist at the heart of the David Kelly affair was delayed yesterday following a personal plea from the corporation's chairman that publication might affect the journalist's health.<br>
<br>
In a surprise move, the Commons foreign affairs select committee said it would not publish the transcript of last Thursday's evidence session with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan that ended with the committee expressing serious doubts about his reliability as a witness.<br>
<br>
Although the committee had pledged to publish the evidence this week, it reluctantly decided not to do so after Gavyn Davies, the BBC chairman, privately contacted Donald Anderson, the committee's chairman.<br>
<br>
According to a committee member, the FAC had no choice but to heed Mr Davies' concern. &quot;There appear to be compassionate grounds not to publish the evidence. We're in a situation here where if we publish the evidence and something happens to Mr Gilligan we'd be in a very difficult situation,&quot; said a committee member.<br>
<br>
Mr Davies' office said the BBC chairman had told Mr Anderson in a letter that Mr Gilligan was &quot;stressed&quot;.<br>
<br>
Following the evidence session with Mr Gilligan, Mr Anderson described the BBC reporter as &quot;an unsatisfactory witness&quot;, especially relating to the allegation he has made that Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's media chief, added a claim in last September's weapons of mass destruction dossier that Iraq could fire WMD within 45 minutes of giving an order. One of the critical questions that the transcript of Mr Gilligan's evidence might answer is to what extent the journalist stated that the notion that Mr Campbell added the 45 minute claim was based on &quot;a reasonable inference&quot; or hard fact.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
----<br>
<br>
Gilligan said just a few days ago that this transcript would prove that the committee's unsatisfactory witness comments were a &quot;deliberate misrepresentation&quot; of the evidence he gave and would undeniably clear him. Now he's &quot;stressed&quot; and doesn't want this evidence which would &quot;clear&quot; him out in the public. The committee member's comment makes it seem as if Gillgan's taking advantage of Kelly's death and putting out the &quot;I'm stressed and may die if the evidence comes out&quot; defense heh<br>
<br>
**Too bad for poor Gilligan. The transcript is out.<br>
<br>
Sir John Stanley, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling: Mr Gilligan, listening very carefully to what you have been saying ... I have to say that it appears to me that you have completely transformed the nature of your evidence to this committee ...<br>
<br>
I am myself in absolutely no doubt that every single member of the committee, indeed beyond this room, believed that you were repeating your source saying to you that Mr Campbell had been responsible for inserting the 45-minute claim.<br>
<br>
You are now today making a dramatically, totally, totally different allegation - which is that Mr Campbell ... with some slightly different wording changes to the draft of the 45 minutes, made it sound just slightly more dramatic. That is a totally different allegation.<br>
<br>
Gilligan: Not at all.<br>
<br>
Stanley: ... If what you are now saying is the case, I think that you have led this whole committee, and the wider public, up the garden path in a most staggering way ... This is very, very serious, Mr Gilligan. I cannot tell you how serious it is to mislead a committee. I must ask you very, very straight: are you saying Mr Campbell did or did not have responsibility for inserting into the document the 45-minute claim?<br>
<br>
Gilligan: I have never said in respect of the insertion of the 45-minute claim that Mr Campbell inserted it. I simply quoted the words of my source. The claim was that the dossier had been transformed, and I asked &quot;How did this transformation happen?&quot; And the answer was a single word, &quot;Campbell&quot;.<br>
<br>
I then asked &quot;What do you mean, Campbell made it up?&quot; And he said, &quot;No. It was real information - this is the 45-minute claim - but it was included in the dossier against our wishes, because it was not reliable.&quot; We may draw the inference, and indeed the committee may reasonably draw the inference, that the decision to include the 45-minute claim was made by Mr Campbell. That was the allegation of the source ...<br>
<br>
Stanley: You know absolutely that was the interpretation being placed on your remarks. You know perfectly well, from what you have said to us now, that there was no justification for such an interpretation ... Can I ask whether you wish to consider before the committee moves to private deliberations, which I think will be extremely serious, whether you now wish to make a very full and frank apology to this committee for having, in my view, grievously misled this committee?<br>
<br>
Gilligan: I think that would be a mistaken view. I have never, ever misled the committee.<br>
<br>
Eric IIlsley, Labour MP for Barnsley Central: Is it reasonable that your colleagues from the BBC drew that inference during the interviews they carried out accusing Alastair Campbell of &quot;sexing it up&quot;?<br>
<br>
Gilligan: It is an entirely reasonable inference for them to draw. It is not, however, something we directly said.<br>
<br>
Illsley: It is not true basically, it is fiction.<br>
<br>
Gilligan: All I can tell you ...<br>
<br>
Illsley: It is fiction pursued by the press, by the BBC. You have allowed this fiction to stand and it is a complete fiction, is that not the case?<br>
<br>
Gilligan: Absolutely not.<br>
<br>
Donald Anderson, committee chairman and Labour MP for Swansea East: Are you being a Mail on Sunday reporter or a BBC reporter when you say that?<br>
<br>
Gilligan: It would be wrong to overinterpret what I said to you ... I am happy to put on the record to the committee that I believe and still believe it is a wholly reasonable inference to draw that Mr Campbell inserted the 45-minute claim. I was merely trying to say in a rather pedantic way why it was not a direct link we had made. It is wrong to accuse me of misleading the committee.<br>
<br>
Illsley: You have misled the whole world, let alone this committee.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 8/1/03 5:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aandaie>aandaie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/8/03 2:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/aandaie/aan_gu.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <br>

45-minute claim on Iraq was hearsay <br>
<br>

<br>
The Guardian <br>
<br>
Tony Blair's headline-grabbing claim that Iraq could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order to do so was based on hearsay information, the Guardian has learned. <br>
<br>
The revelation that the controversial claim is even weaker than ministers and officials have been saying will embarrass No 10, already reeling after the first week of the Hutton inquiry into the death of weapons expert David Kelly. <br>
<br>
It came as the Hutton inquiry announced that Alastair Campbell, Downing Street's communications chief, will testify on Tuesday. Underlining the danger of the inquiry for the government, Lord Hutton has called virtually every member of the prime minister's inner circle. <br>
<br>
The government has been under fire for including the allegation in a September 2002 dossier used to justify the war against Iraq. <br>
<br>
The revelation that the 45 minute claim is second hand is contained in an internal Foreign Office document released by the Hutton inquiry. It had been thought the basis for the claim came from an Iraqi officer high in Saddam Hussein's command structure. In fact it came through an informant, who passed it on to MI6. <br>
<br>
The document says the 45 minute claim &quot;came from a reliable and established source, quoting a well-placed senior officer&quot; - described by intelligence sources as a senior Iraqi officer still in Iraq. <br>
<br>
The government has never admitted the key information was based on hearsay. On June 4, Tony Blair told the House of Commons: &quot;It was alleged that the source for the 45 minute claim was an Iraqi defector of dubious reliability. He was not an Iraqi defector and he was an established and reliable source.&quot; <br>
<br>
Adam Ingram, the armed forces minister, said of the claim on May 29: &quot;That was said on the basis of security service information - a single source, it wasn't corroborated.&quot; <br>
<br>
The irony is that the government launched a furious attack on the BBC for broadcasting allegations that the dossier was &quot;sexed up&quot; based on a single, anonymous, uncorroborated source. That source was Dr Kelly. <br>
<br>
Mr Campbell told the foreign affairs select committee: &quot;I find it incredible ... that people can report based on one single anonymous uncorroborated source.&quot; <br>
<br>
In fact, the foundation for the government's claim was even shakier, according to the document: a single anonymous uncorroborated source quoting another single anonymous uncorroborated source. <br>
<br>
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said the revelation damaged the government's credibility. <br>
<br>
He added: &quot;This is classic hearsay. It provides an even thinner justification to go to war. If this is true, neither the prime minister nor the government have been entirely forthcoming.&quot; <br>
<br>
A Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;The joint intelligence committee made a judgment on the basis of knowing everything about the nature of the source and the context.&quot;<br>
