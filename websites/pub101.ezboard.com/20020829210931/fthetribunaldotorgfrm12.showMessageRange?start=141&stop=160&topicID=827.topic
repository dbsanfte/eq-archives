My opinion of Matan hits an all time low each time I hear him talk in /ooc. I have known this loser since our days in EH together.<br>
    We had a nice exchange at the end of his stay in EH in which I was helping out with a CR in fear, where plenty of EH members were dead and were watching their rez times approaching critical levels.<br>
    Matan logs on and starts claiming loot drops in Fear. His insensitivy provoked me to have an exchange with him in guild chat in which I told him not to be an ass. He then goes off on me in guild chat spouting obscenities. He deserved to get kicked out of EH at that time and was encouraged to leave the guild. Sure you removed yourself. But you had little choice.<br>
I once read this article in some magazine while I was waiting in a doctor's office about a restaurant in africa that was training baboons to wait tables. The baboons would deliver the food and even clean up afterwards. I think that if Matan would purchase a baboon and train it to play his char, he would not only finally hit 60, but might actually prove to be a useful group mate. As an added bonus he might have some one to take out on dates on those lonely nights, instead of planting those wity comments on other guild's message boards. <p>Sorcerer of the Royal Norrathian Guard</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatancoindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/02 4:38:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.muppets.com/profiles/graphics/StatlerWaldorf_s.jpg width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: People on Power Trips</span><hr size=1> 1 Year and 9 Months ago that happend.<br>

Lets give everyone a chance to see just how much integrity you lack shithead.<br>
<br>
Since you know the whole story, up and down back and forth, and your memory is that good.<br>
<br>
Why dont you get together with a old guildmates and try to remember what exactly caused that wipe you mentioned..<br>
<br>
Hell, If you can remember what I did, you surely can remember why EH got wiped.<br>
<br>
I doubt you can do it, at least not without help.<br>

I told him no, I aint having you loose an officer.<br>
I will leave instead.. and I did.<br>

The reason why you speak up so much is because your a lame fucking crybaby who cant deal with somone telling you to fuck off.  <br>

I saw an average of at least 1 incident every 3-4 days with you pulling the same shit with other people.<br>
