To give a fetus the right to develope no matter what, is to take away the mothers right to refuse to carry that fetus. I am not going to tell you that the mother should feel good about making that choice, but it is her right none the less.<br>
<br>
The day a fetus can be kept alive outside the mother, it is no longer dependent on the mothers willingness to give up her rights and carry it, so then it should be  granted it's own individual rights. <p><br>

Self defense has always been protected even by 99% of the right wingers (there are nuts on both sides), If the life of the mother is in danger, the life can be terminated.<br>
<br>
You are given the right to life, not the right that everything will be &quot;peachy&quot; if you make a stupid decision. (not including rape).<br>
<br>
What you are saying, is that if the life is an &quot;inconvenience&quot; it can be terminated.  Hell, I find it an inconvenient that my neighbor parked in front of my driveway once, can I shoot him? No.  <br>
<br>
However, if he shows up inside my house in the middle of the night, I'll probably shoot first and ask questions later... (I live in PA, we get to assume deadly intent on break-in and entering).<br>

<br>
No, what I am saying is that the fetus can't be given individual rights until it can survive on it's own. You can not force the mother to carry a fetus, because it is her body. The fetus is dependent on her body to exist, which means it can not have individual rights without infringing on the mothers rights. <p><br>

Our American forefathers knew a thing or two about the intrusion of religious ideology into public policy.

After substantial strides in the previous 8 years under Clinton all the progress, now quite promising, is lost.  Know why Michael J.

The world has the ability to clone a human being, however primative the techinque, the ability still exists and May have already been accomplished.  Even if the United States of America opts out of the attempt to perfect the technique, for what ever reason, moral, religious, or political, the technique will still be perfected, just not here but in some other country.  And then the US will be playing catch up from a decision made by a politician with no gonads and some bad advise.<br>
 <br>
Fact: There will be cloned human beings!<br>
<br>
Who are we in the US to dictate to our own people or to the world what is moral or right in this matter.  If George wants to go on record of being against it and not supporting it, that's good; thats our way.  But to completely ban or unreasonabily restrict research and  to make it a felony if you do is too much.  No federal funds is ok, but let private research alone (which is also our way). <p><BR><center><img src=http://bakamon.freeservers.com/mysig/Bakasig.jpg width=400 height=150><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufleviuskot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>flevius KoT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/10/02 2:54:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> The pregnant mother thing is pending trial now actually, but it wasn't murder, it was voluntary manslaughter.

For the most part, I'm not against stem cell research, it's what it could lead to that I'm against. Cloning of human beings and basically anything else is wrong. If it's done for medical purposes, as in transplanting organs, that's even worse. The clone will have a life of its own, it will just look like the person it was cloned after, so killing this clone to create spare organs will just be plain cruel.<br>
<br>
Abortion is also a heated topic. For the most part, those who have killed doctors and bombed abortion clinics and killed homosexuals in the name of Christ are blind and have lost their way. No true Christian would do that, because it is not a human being's place to judge, that is God's place. So basically, Christians don't deserve to be grouped into one category.<br>
<br>
My problem with abortion is that it is used as a form of birth control. &quot;Oh well, I'm pregnant, I'll just get an abortion.&quot; I'm pro choice in the sense that the choice should be made before intercourse. No human being NEEDS intercourse to survive, so just going out and sleeping around with the idea that &quot;Well, if I get pregnant, I'll just have an abortion,&quot; is wrong. I'm not against abortion if the life of the mother is in danger, but it should never be used as a form of birth control. <p><center><img src=http://sayree.homestead.com/files/adolensig.jpg></center>

It contains gills, as well as a tail.  Only after I believe 5 weeks or so does it start to lose those features.  <br>
<br>
I like to hear religious fanatics try to explain why we have gills and a tail during our embryo stage if evolution doesn't exist.  Why do whales have the bone structure for their rear legs still, if evolution doesn't exist?  <br>
<br>
Would god create humans that once had gills and a tail?  If so, for what point could it possibly be for?  <br>
<br>
When an embryo contains overwhelming human characteristics, that is when, in my opinion, it is a human.  That time of course could be debated, but I'd say around 5 weeks or so.  That's ample time for a woman to determine if she's pregnant, that should be the cutoff line for an abortion.  Again, my opinion of course.<br>
