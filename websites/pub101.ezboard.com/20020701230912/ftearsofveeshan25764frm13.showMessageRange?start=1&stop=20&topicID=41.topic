Before she can confirm if she hit her target, Salvia changes to wolf form and ducks behind the bar to grab more arsenal.  The bartender steps in her way to try and stop the madness before it gets to far.  Salvia tries to stop, but only ends up flipping head over tail into an ale cask sending it rolling across the room.  It smashes into the wall and splits in a few spots, sending foaming ale spraying into the air and all over those who were too close.  With a satisfied smirk Salvia runs to the kitchen to get some bread dough. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umirahze521.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirahze521</A> at: 5/29/02 9:25:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umoline.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 7:56:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something new....Salvia is a troublestarter again</span><hr size=1> &lt;Moline enters the guildhall to tune her lute strings and get a glass of honeyberry nectar. she strolls over towards an empty table to find a cozy place to sit.&gt;<br><br>*Thwaapp!*<br><br>a meat roll hits her upside the head<br><br>&quot;owie!&quot; <br><br>&lt;Moline looks around to see where the object was launched from and sees salvia quickly turn into wolf form and duck behind the bar.&gt;<br><br>&quot;oh now you've done it ms meat roll throwing wolfie&quot;<br><br>&lt;Moline watches as the cask of ale salvia crashed into rolls across the floor and spews ale everywhere&gt;<br><br>*teehee* &lt;Moline grabs a bowl of fruity oatmeal and hurls it towards salvia. trying to be sneaky like Salvia.. she equips her lute and changes into a werewolf and hides behind Ennya&gt;...<br> <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=185754><b>Moline Bladesynger</b></a><br>Minstrel of the 52nd Note<br>The Tears of Veeshan<br> <br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umirahze521.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirahze521</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tears of Veeshan</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 10:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something new....Salvia is a troublestarter again</span><hr size=1> &lt;Salvia watches with delight as her guildmates slip and slide in the foaming ale that is slowly covering the guildhall floor.

You'll be sorry when Baroness Solarianne gets a hold of ye!&quot; He storms off while one of the maids yanks off her apron, wads it up, and throws it on the floor.  &quot;Cook!&quot;  she calls.  The cook enters the room and also throws his apron on the floor.  The three march out, all the while grumbling about how the Baronesses and other Elders had assured them that this sort of thing would never happen again.  <br><br>After all, it had been hard to get new servants after the old ones had told the tale of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> last</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> food fight.<br><br>As food had flown, a young maid--a scullery maid, really--had crouched out of the way in the corner, with her eyes wide.  Now she watches the other servants leaving, the bartender wiping clumps of oatmeal off of himself.  She herself has a bit of pudding on her, but is otherwise unscathed from the fight.  <br><br>Being a scullery maid, she is used to doing the hardest work and being treated rather poorly behind the backs of Solarianne and the other Elders.  <br><br>She watches as the maid, marching out indignantly, slips on the ale.  The cook, attempting to help the maid keep her balance, loses his footing and both fall, becoming covered in the pudding-oatmeal-ale sludge from the floor.  <br><br>The two fallen servants stand up, cast a glare around the room, then the three complete their departure.  Salvia watches them leave, worrying slightly, wondering what Solarianne <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> say to her, for making all the servants quit again.  Even Ennya--with all of the holes in the roof--has not scared the servants away, let alone doing it twice.  The other Tears, looking around at the guildhall, are starting to think along the same lines.  The mood in the room turns rather sober.<br><br>&quot;Ye will never get another servant to come to the likes o' <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> this</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> place!&quot; shouts the bartender angrily, slamming the door behind him.<br><br>Then, in the dead silence that follows, the scullery maid bursts out laughing.<br><br>The members of the Tears, hearing the noise, turn and look at her.  To her credit, the scullery maid tries to stop laughing, but the memory of quivering pudding dripping from the hair and face of the cook starts her up again.<br><br>&quot;I beg yer pardon, misses and masters, but serves 'em right.&quot;  She chokes back another giggle.  &quot;I'll stay.
