For wizards, gear WILL make or break you. There is no more drastic of a change to a wizard's ability than can be achieved with a rend or conflag robe. Do melee get large boosts from AC/HP, sure do. But as Sorran is pointing out, for casters in luclin, its all about SUSTAINABLE DAMAGE. When you see a caster posting 120+dps and 80k+dmg to luclin ubers with ac that makes monks and rogues look like paladins, you will realize why gear makes a difference for wizards. *note not saying all casters*<br>
<br>
Because without a nuke robe, and a chunk of FT, that wizard will not come close to those numbers. Give that wizard a rend robe, and watch his DPS skyrocket and become very sustainable while also being inflated. A rend robe makes more of a difference in a wizard's DPS and TDPS than primal makes for any melee. 56 *raw* and instant DPS/TDPS inflation which is indefinately sustainable is more on its own than most melee can achieve on any end game mob in luclin.<br>
<br>
Now, for simple reasoning, have that wizard just rotate the rend robe and ice spear. You will see his DPS, and more importantly TDPS, break 100+ and you will see that same wizard be able to sustain that longer and longer as his mana pool grows. Making mana another important key. <br>
<br>
Now, add in the mana regen factor Sorran is talking about on top of this fairly simple example. The rend robe takes 14 seconds to cast, that means you get 2 full tics of standing regen every robe cast, and pic up a bonus tic every 3rd use of the robe. Never sitting, this wizard will need as much standing regen as they can get. C3, potg, epic, gfam, mc3, chorus of repl. and FT. The more FT, the closer that wizard can reach to the equillibrium of mana usage. The more nukes he can add between each robe usage, pushing his DPS/TDPS up that much more.<br>
<br>
Quick illustration, for a wizard with low mana pool, no FT, and no nuke robe compared to one with 4300base mana, ft5(low even), and a nuke robe.<br>
<br>
60 non uber wizard, most efficient nuke, Ice Spear. <br>
<br>
Ice spear, 1200dmg 300mana 13sec recast, 3.4 second cast with focus ring.<br>
<br>
We will assume, since this wizard needs to sustain this damage for 25+minutes he will cast no other spells (concussion excluded cause of insignificant cost) but Ice spear.<br>
<br>
Focus bracer will be excluded from this example as a way to counter the exclusion of resists and fizzle loss.<br>
<br>
1200dmg/16.4 sec = 73 DPS <br>
<br>
Used 300mana, regained mana for 2.7tics standing (wont sit due to added aggro).<br>
<br>
C3 14, BoF 3, GF 4, Potg 6, MC 3, Bard 18(with IM3) = 48 standing regen...<br>
<br>
<br>
2.7 * 48 = 131 mana regained for a net loss of 169 mana per round.<br>
<br>
3500mana pool from 3100base pool, c3, and familiar.<br>
<br>
3500mana pool/169mana used per round = about 21 rounds<br>
<br>
21 rounds at 16.4 sec each = 5 and a half minutes of sustainable 73DPS before running oom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now compare that to a wizard with a nuke robe, and a bit more regen, and larger mana pool.<br>
<br>
Rend robe = 784dmg 14 seconds for 56TDPS<br>
Ice spear, 1200dmg 300mana 13sec recast, 3.4 second cast with focus ring.<br>
<br>
1984dmg in 17.4 seconds = 114 DPS<br>
<br>
C3 14, BoF 3, GF 4, FT 5, Potg 6, MC 3, Bard 18(with IM3) = 53 standing regen...<br>
<br>
17.4 seconds = 2.9 tics of regen for 153.7 mana regained.<br>
<br>
300-153.7 = 146.3 mana used per round.<br>
<br>
4700 mana from 4300 base pool, c3, and familiar.<br>
<br>
4700/146.3 = just over 32 cycles.<br>
<br>
32 cycles at 9.2 minutes <br>
<br>
That has boosted this wizard's dps by 41 points, and made it almost twice as sustainable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, this was a very very simple breakdown. When you add in the effect of Spell Casting mastery 3, and a focus earing you will see those sustainable times increase quite a bit. Then take in the use of MR2 and the bonuses from mind wrack regen and those numbers extend even further. Just wanted to keep things simple, and this post is already long.<br>
<br>
I am not saying all casters, I don't know about all casters. I know about wizards, and you included me in that blanket statement. Wizards are very gear dependant and it will show in their efficiency.<br>
<br>
Look at those numbers again, the difference between the two wizards. 41dps variation, almost twice as long endurance meaning that much longer before needing rods and that many fewer rods needed to sustain that can now be used by clerics. Not to mention the wizard with the nuke robe could use no more rods, and continue nuking at 56dps with just the robe while standing and regening at a higher rate. <br>

Actual damage done<br>
<br>
Non Geared Wizard<br>
<br>
21 cycles at 1200 damage for a total of 25,200 damage before needing rods in the example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Geared Wizard<br>
<br>
32 cycles at 1984 damage for a total of 63,488 damage before needing rods in the example.<br>
<br>
So, the geared wizard will output 60 percent more damage, while taking twice as long before needing the use of MR2s in the example.<br>
<br>
At the very least you need to concede that gear will make as drastic difference for wizards equalling the difference in gear between a uber/nonuber monks/rogues/other dmg dealing melee (only ones to really compare them to since they are melee equivalents).

<br>
These guilds have a core group of members that average 40+ hours a week played.  For many of these people, when they are not playing, they are pouring over message boards and fan sites to discuss and learn how to better help their guild succeed.  Many of them have been doing this now for going on two years.<br>
<br>
EV's focus is bringing down Emperor and hitting every other high end mob that will help their guild out -- and that's really it.  While it would be nice to think that they can drop everything to help a new recruit get his/her epic, it simply isn't realistic -- there simply isn't time.  Since this is the case, it makes sense that they require it prior to joining if the epic is deemed necessary.<br>
<br>
I play a class that can port people.  Generally, I don't turn down anyone who asks for one.  However, there comes a point where you simply cannot continue running around porting people, but instead have to get to your raid, xp group, or the zone you were originally heading to.  <br>
<br>
Making this decision can be difficult.  The people you turn down might think you are a jerk, too good to do something for them that is very eary, and so on.  However, it is a simple matter of time constraints.  There just isn't enough time to get stuff done for yourself and make everybody else happy.<br>
<br>
The same is true of guilds.  The ones that get stuff done are focused completely on accomplishing these goals.  <br>
<br>
Could they help you get your epic?  Sure.  Once they have gotten you your epic, could they hit ST and ToV to fully deck you out?  Sure.  If they were to help you, would they then feel obligated to help others who still may need?  Again, yes.<br>
<br>
The thing to ask now is should they?  They will be giving up a month or so of progress in order to bring others up to speed.  The reality is that they have hit and passed a point in which they decided it was no longer in their best interest to pursue these goals.  In the case of EV, they have passed several of these benchmarks.  Every time they have passed them it has caused pain, possibly caused some people to drop from the guild, and (as seen here) caused flaming.<br>
<br>
If you doubt any of this, take a chance to talk to members about some of these difficult decisions.  Ask their members without primal, epics, or full suits of ToV armor where they have been spending their time for the last couple of months.  I'm sure they will tell you that have been in Luclin farming items that their guild will need to succeed with their current goals.<br>
<br>
From the outside, it may appear that being in an &quot;uber&quot; guild means phat lewtz, but the reality is that it is about sacrifice which is occasionally rewarded with loot.  Far more often though, the only reward one can expect is being a part of a good group of people that has figured out how to work together in order to kill something new.  If this is not enough for you, perhaps you should consider doing something else with your time.<br>

I have to conceed that on the long encounters .. the 20 minute boss fights..  Equipment is every bit as important to a wizard as it would be to a melee ..   I was speaking in general..  in general most fights are not those 20 minute boss mob fights.. even the most uber person in the most uber guild will still spend MAYBE 5% of their eq time involved in one of these fights...   When it comes to the other 95% of the time when you are doing exp, camping keys, or moving to the boss mob or whatever.  The gear on a Caster is not near as important as the gear on a melee..    But since that 5% of the time you spend in big fights is why most people spend that other 95% online.  I guess I have to agree with you.. <br>

I don't remember anyone having those statistics pre-Kunark. Back then it was a miracle to have 1000 AC. Also, Oneton and Pigg were in TA in those days, while EV warriors had better equipment. I think the most senior TA warriors had AC in the 900s. The best-equipped warrior on the server would have been Crush.<br>
<br>
Ogre warriors had more hitpoints in those days because other warriors did not max their stamina. AC was considered more important as nobody had discovered a soft cap and the concept of MTs with CH chains had not yet developed.<br>

<br>
There's one thing that is bothering me about the whole &quot;whose more dependant on gear&quot; debate going on. Everyone is arguing the logistics and mathematics to prove their points. But why don't we take the only realistic event where both a caster and a tank would be without gear; After being rezzed during a fight.<br>
<br>
The argument is that tanks can't do much of anything without their gear so they need to have it on to be of any effect. So right after being rezzed during a fight, they couldn't just run back into battle without picking up all their shit first. But neither could a caster. Upon being resurrected, a caster has all of his mana (his primary source of power) completely drained. Not to mention that he has to rememorize all of his spells (his weapons) which could take just as much time, if not longer than a tank to put all his gear back on, get some cleric buffs, and run back into battle. <br>
