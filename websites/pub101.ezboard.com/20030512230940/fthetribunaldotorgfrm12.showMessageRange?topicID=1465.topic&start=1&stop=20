<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Markey,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> male erudite necromancer, a killstealing asshole. He is the only person on Thistleburr's ignore list. With good reason.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kindas</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a male wood elf druid. He helped Oron kill the triggered mob and then helped fuck Oron's mother. Avoid these two. They are extemely fucked up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Judeis, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> human wizzy.

He is a 31 year old total fucking loser. He will harasses female players of any age into cybering with him. Upon refusal, he goes ape shit on them and does his best to make their game life and sometimes their real life a living hell. Female characters have had to leave our server because of him. He is truly a twisted fuck that our world could do without.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Kaspian,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Necro. Ninjalooted some shit off of Doomshade over a dispute on the kill. Thought he was doing his guild a favor. Not surprising. But they booted his sorry ass. Hopefully he will eat shit and die.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Calabok,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Midlevel Human Warrior. Been caught scamming people in the bizarre. Recently took 15K off one dude. Don't trade with this fucknut or allow him into your guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Supernus,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Dwarf Paladin. Enjoys walks on the beach, Kill stealing, training people, and laughing about it. He played one of Biff's cronies on BTTF. Also he hates his father and lashes out at everyone to expess his anger.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natakaz</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Enjoys training people to take their camps. Likes to hang out with that jackass Supernus. He has been kicked out of at least 4 guilds for his actions. Good luck if you take him into yours.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Ialan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This twisted fuck will lure younger female characters into a bindable KOS area with promises of money or items. He will them start harassing them to cyber with him, and if they reject him, he will bind them, let their invis go out, and let them go through a death cycle. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Hogge, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Orge Warrior. Also plays, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Cebula, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Iksar Shaman, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Whood, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Halfling Druid, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Micarlin, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Human Warrior, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Magelo</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Citijys. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This tard is known for scamming/stealing from people. Has even managed to scam a Cobalt Breastplate. Also likes to scam while pretending to help with Multiquesting. Or asking to try things on. He has scammed tons of people &amp; somehow has not yet banned. He is definitely somebody you don’t want to group with and especially don’t want to ever trade with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Clarinet</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> name changed from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Poladara, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Level 60 Bard.

Twinks include: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Mamalo. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Apparently, he is an annoying little shit, but the reason he made this thread is because he stole a bag of resist gear from a guildmate who was trying to help him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Loli – </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Moved to a different server. He is a well-known crook who has scammed on multiple occations. If you are so stupid to even let him in your group, do not be so stupid as to let him be the master looter. Also known for training. He is a highly unbalanced Frenchman who will go psycho on you. Putting him on your ignore list is a very very very very good thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Alexandr-</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Necro of some sort. Also plays Munyo his monk. This guy has ninjaed more loot that anyone else on the server.

She has been know to try &amp; scam people out of items by offering to duel item for item. She then has an “impartial” person who also happens to be Clangeddin, come hold the items. During the duel she will also have Clang heal her. She has also been known to train groups in Lguk to get their spawns. SHe recently fucked over Merton's epic just because she didn't like him.<br>

Give me details about them, as in class, level &amp; race. If I feel that they are worthy, I will add them. I also want to hear details on what they have done. I don't want you to say they are dumbfucks or assholes. I want specicicicifity.<br>
<br>
I will then delete your post. If the name has been added, then I felt he/she belonged up there. If  not, then I didn’t.<br>
<br>
If you spam this thread, I will lock it &amp; put your name up there &amp; make some shit up about you. If I get bored doing this, then I will lock it. If virgins are not sacrificed, then I will lock it.<br>
<br>
Also, a side note, I do not want this to turn into a personal grudge thread. I will not post people who you just hate, or who are clueless about their class, who have called you names, you have gotten mad at you over an arguement, or who is just retarded. This is for the true assholes of the Tribunal. THe people who scam. The people who train, the people who are intentionally malicious &amp; seek to cause harm. This is for the Jaya's, not the Jenni's.<br>
<br>
You can fucking bitch about arguements over camps and mobs, but do it on a seperate fucking post on the flameboard. Because I am not going to add your new little enemy to the thread just because you think he is ebayed or he called you names or you and him got in a fight over who was first in a spot. You do that sort of pussy ass crying on the flameboard.<br>
<br>
This thread is for the worst of the worst. The shit piles. Not for whatever fag you have a personal grudge over. It's for the people that we don't know why the GMs have not permanently banned yet.<br>
<br>
Sometimes these pieces of shit will change their name for 50 bucks after no one will group with them anymore. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/renames/server.jsp?server=The%20Tribunal" target="top">Check this link to see who is changing their name on the Tribunal server.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
