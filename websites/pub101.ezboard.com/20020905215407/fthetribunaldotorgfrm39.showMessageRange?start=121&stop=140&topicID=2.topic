I think that would be fantastic if ya did.<br>
<br>
Cogito, good tips. But the thing is, the fact that is a game of scoring rather than just PvP is what makes this so interesting.<br>
<br>
WHo knows who is going to be the first to die, depending on the situation. I imagine bards are going to be a huge target, but hell, maybe high level warriors with their huge number of HPs may end up being the biggest threats, scoring wise.<br>

Who knows.<br>

I never noticed anyone come to a firm conclusion as to how deaths will work.  I see a few possabilities:<br>
<br>
1) Person dies and they are done.  Out of the game.  Simple but that might prompt what I like to call 'Mutant League Hockey' syndrom where people try to kill everyone else instead of score.  [<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ]<br>
<br>
2) Corpse is taken to a rez station (by a ref?) where An_Epic_Cleric_001 click them and they go on their merry way.<br>
<br>
3) Too damn bad!  Find your own corpse or get it rezed/revived/pulled and bitch at everyone in guild chat!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, there is the question of binding.  For casters, it's a non issue, really.  I don't think there should be binding restrictions.  I can't think of anywhere that popping up naked without spells memmed could be to your advantage.  But for melees, they can't bind in the zone anywhere, can they?  Where is the most convinient bind spot?  Should both team's melees bind at the same point?  Or is that just one of the unique challenges your team just has to overcome with melees NEEDing at least a revive? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucoffinnunforgiven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coffinn Unforgiven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chairman of Guildwar Gnomeball</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/02 10:42:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.orionsafari.com/images/eq/coffin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildwar Gnomeball?</span><hr size=1> As for deaths, Number 3 would be accurate.  It's up to you and your team to get you back in the fray.<br>
<br>
Binding is about like you said.  To each their own.  Casters bind where they want, melee bind where they can.  Qeynos, Surefall and the gypsy camp in NK are best, but we won't penalize anyone who binds in Thurgadin.  We'd just point and laugh.<br>
<br>
Does this give casters an advantage?  I would not call it that, this is a team event.  Both teams will have casters and melee so work this into your team strategies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 1683<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/02 10:49:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=126>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ladida5000.homestead.com/files/ladidadwarf3.jpg height=147 width=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildwar Gnomeball?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, we need to get firm on the whole binding issue. Here is what I would like to see, but it is okay if we don't do it. <br>
<br>
Allow casters to bind in zone, either in a set area like near their base, or we can allow them to bind anywhere. But if we allow them to bind anywhere, I don't want to hear people crying about being killed repeatedly while naked. Get a freakin necro to summon your ass and don't bind near hot spots.<br>
<br>
Have Melee bound wherever close. But, do we allow Wizards to go get them &amp; bring them back. As in going outside the zone, not due to death, to help bring Melee back to zone? I would love to do that. Mainly because it will add complexity. Both giving wizards extra responisbility &amp; a chance for chaos at the WK rune. If we do it though, I don't know if we should allow porters to port naked players to other runes though, like say NK, because that would be an unfair advantage in my mind for those on the East side.<br>
<br>
Also, I have no clue where Evac takes you, but it may have to be disallowed simply because it may give one side a better advantage, if they can get everyone over to attack zone easier. <p><BR>

<br>
1.)  zone, north karana<br>
2.)  2 rules, naked people cannot drag, attack or be killed.<br>
3.)  bridges are goals, most gnome corpses on your bridge after 30min wins.  possible scattering of 3-9 corpses (odd number, so there is a winner).  the fewer, the more pvp it will become.<br>
<br>
anyway, i hope you enjoy my cut and paste.  it looks like we are trying to get together a gnomeball on eci, because it sounds like wicked fun.<br>
<br>
Zone: North Karana <br>
1.) the two bridges in the zone can be goals (ek/sk). they represent well known places that are both easy to locate and fairly easy to defend. <br>
2.) melee can bind in the gypsie camp. this means that when you die, you can re-join the fight fairly quickly and don't have to run from say... qeynos. this is also good because it is actually equadistant from BOTH goals. neked people won't be running through the other teams &quot;goal&quot; line to get back into the fight. <br>
3.) druid AND wizard port sites in the zone, so it is VERY easy to get to (not to mention nexus goes here too). <br>
4.) fairly low traffic zone, but also not totally empty. you have to admit, who the hell goes to NK? people headed for SK and Nexus maybe... there really isn't much in the way of &quot;hunting for exp&quot; going on here. <br>
5.) mob range from low (5ish?) to mid-high (30ish). this will provide a certain amount of dynamic to the game. you might have to stop and snare/root that griffon or hill giant you just agro'd. a variaty of factions are present such as druid and qeynos factions. <br>
6.) WK is just freaking gigantic. without bardsong or sow/e it could take you 20min JUST to run accross it. we want big, but we don't want obsenely big. <br>
<br>
Team Setup: <br>
create two guilds with easy and similar names (A Team, B Team). the advantages (and disadvantages) are as follows <br>
Advantages: <br>
1.) the guild war used to allow pvp style combat without being in a pvp area will NOT effect your real guild. <br>
2.) telling who is on what team will be very easy. noone can use /role or /anon to become a member of the other team. (purple vs. blue team style). <br>
3.) using /who one can easily tell how many people are on each team, and weather or not they are anon (/who all 'Guild Name' when in the same zone appears to show EVEN anon people) <br>
4.) people violating any rules can VERY easily be removed from the pvp aspect of the game with a simple /guildremove &lt;player&gt; <br>
5.) since in theory this would be fore more than 1 group, using /gu chat would make coordination MUCH easier AND hidden from the other team (rather than saying okay, team 1 use /auc, team 2 use /ooc). it also cuts down on the spam to the zone itself. <br>
<br>
Disadvantages: <br>
1.) 10 chars PER team will have to be found BEFORE the event to create the guilds. <br>
2.) leaving YOUR guild and re-joining it could be a pain in the ass. if an OFFICER of you guild comes, he could just create a mule officer and camp him at the bridge and fix things when it is done. <br>
<br>
Ball Itself: <br>
1.) a gnome would be borrowed or created. a few VERY colorful robes would be given to the person and he would then die with it on and not loot the robe. <br>
2.) if there are multiple balls, we can have X number of red or X number of blue, just to help distinquish corpses and make it more colorful. <br>
<br>
Game Play: (my version!) <br>
1.) 10 &quot;gnomeballs&quot; (or some decently high number) would be scattered ALL around the zone randomly. <br>
2.) bodies would be collected and brought to the respective bases. the bodies would THEN need to be defended (or raided by the other team) <br>
3.) at the end of XX minutes (30 would be a good number) the bodies at each location would be counted and the winner would be the one with the most bodies. <br>
<br>
optional possible rules: <br>
1.) from the movie &quot;Harry Potter&quot; we could create a &quot;moving&quot; ball. this would be perhaps a GNOME in... a yellow robe with soe (and what ever spells they have like invis or what not). if this person were high level, it would be much more fun as they would be harder to catch. this &quot;live&quot; gnomeball could be worth more if killed and the corpse brought to your teams home. to make this work as it should, each team might have a designated &quot;gnomeball&quot; so the gulid war pvp aspect works properly. you would want to keep YOUR gnomeball alive, and kill the other teams. <br>
2.) different colored bodies are worth different amounts of points. <br>
<br>
rules: <br>
1.) naked people cannot CARRY BALL or BE KILLED. <br>
this lets naked people return to the game, but prevents them from abusing their status as untouchable. i thought about this a lot, and fighting naked would totally suck. i would rather not be able to carry the ball, but be able to loot my body and start fighting again. this ALSO does put a penelty on death. finding and looting your body might take you more time, so you want to be alive and not just suicide. <br>
<br>
2.) no intentional training of mobs on people. <br>
this one is a no brainer. with lvl 30+ mobs in the zone, this could be used to cause people to not only die, but to lose exp at the same time. of course, i ALSO realize that while dragging a body you might agro something, but since the goal is to get the body back to YOUR camp most trains will/should be on your own team. <br>
<br>
3.) i wouldn't really call these rules, but rather clarifications: ANYTHING GOES. ANYLEVEL IS WELCOME. this means bards can use their run song, rogues can use sneak/hide, druids/wizards can port/evac/egress, pet classes can use pets, necro's can summon corpses (but not the gnomeball, they would probably be sitting in SK or EK to prevent this), warriors can... oh, they don't have any special abilities, epics can be used, right clicks can be used, basically what i'm saying is that ANYTHING besides the first two rules is fair game. <br>
<br>
if ANYONE were to die and lose exp, i KNOW i would personally have my 54 cleric there most likely NOT in the event just for rezes. i'm also sure that should a 56 cleric with rez stick (or not) be there, they would be happy to provide rezes as well. <br>
<br>
enforcement of these rules is easy. /consent can be taken away AND they can be /guildremoved, thus elimineting them immediatly from the game. <br>
<br>
Some ways of making the whole thing run smoothly: <br>
<br>
1.) TWO &quot;guildleaders&quot; will be picked, one for each team. they will take turns choosing their team. this way, it won't be a free for all of people saying &quot;i want this team, i want that team&quot;. this also makes it fairly easy to invite people on the fly. if the event starts at say 9pm, team picking will go until 9:15pm on a first come first serve basis. the guildleader who's turn it is will have a VERY SHORT TIME to pick his next person and invite him. as people zone in, they will be snatched up by the guild leader. of course, if the teams are wildly unbalanced (due to say LD people or people who just leave) the refs can re-assign people. by having the event start quickly, people won't lose interest while waiting 30min for all the people to get there. <br>
2.) the &quot;guildleader&quot; would probably appoint 2-5 &quot;officers&quot; to aid in the /guildinviting and/or /guildremoving of people. <br>
3.) leadership of the actual team will be left to the team itself. the &quot;guildleader&quot; will hold NO power except that of choosing the initial team and actually HAVING the ability to invite/remove/officer people. before the event, guildleader status will be on a mule. after the event, it would be transfered BACK to the mule for future events. <br>
4.) since there are only TWO real rules (no trains, naked people can't be killed or drag gnomeball) it should be easy to referee AND easy to play. <br>
<br>
Play Suggestions/Questions: <br>
1.) dead people should drag their own bodies to a safe place before attempting to loot, because once they have something on they are fair game  . to prevent abuse of this, it would include killing ANYONE once they have ANYTHING on (yes, partially looted bodies would count as wearing something). i would consider a &quot;wait until body is gone&quot; but then, someone might just not loot their whole body or just sit there looting until the other person got bored and gave up. definatly open to suggestions on WHEN someone is considered GAME for killing. <br>
2.) does getting /consent for X player actually apply to ALL of their bodies now (assuming all the bodies exist at time of /consent?) <br>
<br>
Major Problems: <br>
1.) ShowEQ usage. since this shows player position (to a limited extent) and corpse position (exactly, even when being moved) people using this will have a HUGE advantage. there really is NO way around it nor any way to prevent it, aside from asking people not to use it. Since there is no &quot;prize&quot; up for grabs, it should be fairly easy to do. <br>
2.) how many monkies CAN you actually fit into a 55 gallon drum? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufryfrog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fryfrog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/20/02 2:13:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oops</span><hr size=1> i don't see a way to edit... the 2 rules should be &quot;naked people cannot carry ball, attack or be killed AND no training.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladielbravesword.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladiel BraveSword</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/20/02 2:55:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=129>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildwar Gnomeball?</span><hr size=1> Greetings...i was wondering..is the guildwar for all classes? becouse then i wanna join in. it sounds like a fun idea.<br>

The signup info is posted on the second post. <p><BR>

As for the zone choice, however, I consider NK a poor choice for a couple reasons:<br>
<br>
1) Too small - We're looking at over 100 players.  The more space, the more strategy and player knowledge and abilities come into play.<br>
<br>
2) Guards - The stone bridge is guarded by &quot;Good&quot; aligned guards, one of which is blue to 60.  This would be a problem, especially if it is a goal. WK has guards, but they're much lower level and nowhere near the goals we've set up.<br>
<br>
3) Grimfeather - This bish is annoying as all hell, repops instantly sometimes, fast as SoW and will drop a lvl 60 nekkid tank like nobody's business.<br>
<br>
4) Non-Gnomeball Population Density - This zone is well traversed, with it's two major teleport hubs.  We don't want to bother those not playing, and we also don't want to be bothered more than necessary.  Nobody freaking goes to WK anymore.<br>
<br>
5) Nexus Scion - I hate that damn Mystic Voice.<br>
<br>
6) Bind points - I don't want to force melees to bind in the playzone.  WK has 3 bind spots in neighboring zones.<br>

Multiple gnome corpses really won't work in a large scale game. You're talking about having your poor gnome have to reconsent EVERYONE everytime a goal is scored! You'd have to paus the game very often for that to work...<br>
<br>
Also, I'd love a couple of volunteers to help out as goal referees, while I should be able to keep track of the ball for the duration of the game, if I go LD or miss a goal for any other reason it would be good to have a couple of stationary refs watching those areas. If you're not interested in participating, but would like to help ref, maybe send Coffinn an email as well? <p><b><a href="http://darkmask.windsofstorm.net/images/ladies/fullsize/muse.jpg">Muse</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.the-elitists.com">Elitists and Vagrants</a>>

<br>
Also, as for setting the timer for the game. Correct me if I am mistaken but when you /guildwar, I know it can be manually ended, but I thought there was an option to /guildwar and then imput the duration you wanted the war to last. And then after that time was up, both guilds would automatically no longer be at war. I could be wrong on that though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 658<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/20/02 10:36:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=139>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildwar Gnomeball?</span><hr size=1> The default on guildwar is 14 days.
