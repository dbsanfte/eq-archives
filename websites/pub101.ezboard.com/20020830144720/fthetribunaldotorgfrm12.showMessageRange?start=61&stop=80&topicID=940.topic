We've been over this you dumbass. Do you understand english? I can dig up Trig's quotes from the other thread if you'd like. I left Trans when trig/aro/terrik did. The SSBP I had was returned to the guild as it was guild property. They bought me an SSBP... you can see my thank-you thread in the good times board if you give a damn. I returned to Trans in mid Feb. I checked with them to make sure this was alright, and they had no problem. I'm sorry you do, must still be sore about getting booted back in January. ^_^ Around mid March, I obtained a vindication bp, and true to my word, I gave it to Rishyr.<br>
<br>
Rishyr might not mean anything to you, but she's a good friend of Intrigued, Arorot, Terrik &amp; myself. Before I did this, I asked Trig/Aro/Terrik if that was alright, they said it was completely fine with them, that the SSBP was mine to do what I pleased with. I turned around and benefitted another one of our circle of friends. Friends... there's a concept for you. No wonder you're guildless at 60, no one can fucking stand your attitude.<br>
<br>
I quit the guild because I respected and supported my friends. As time went by, I realized I didn't have to leave the best group of people on the server to show my support. When I originally left, trig/aro/terrik counciled against my leaving, but I went ahead and did. Was it a wrong decision? Yeah, but it at least gave me a break to level, otherwise I'd prolly still be 58 =p<br>

In respect to a previous post i was told about by another guildmember that was written by Quaichin please accept my apology for making a post on the E/V message board...I was told by friends that 5 class officers left and the guild was falling apart, i honestly thought i was in the market for a new guild, that is why i posted on the ev board...Due to the information i was given by various guildmembers i thought the guild was truly going to disband...I was informed that 10 or so members left 5 of them being class leaders...I was also told that we would soon not be able to raid again because of the members we had lost, then the guild would end up disbanding...I did not know that everyone intended to stay together and now that i know these facts i intend to stay with Transcended. Please accept this information as the truth and an apology, I want to stay and did not know that the guild would not disband.<br>

So... tell me again about loyalties and only sticking around during the good times? Transcended had lost 3 class leaders &amp; 4 active members. You claimed that you had heard the guild was breaking up. Bullshit. You knew what had happened, Trig had told you. Yet not even a week later you're applying to E/V (AT 55 mind you, you fucking tard). Zing. You just owned yourself. ~_^<br>

I just ignored him and hit my hide key.<br>
<br>
The fact that you refuse to apologize in a public forum, after making an attack in a public forum only goes to prove how much of a little boy you are.  Adults own up to their mistakes children get deffensive about them.  <br>
<br>
Sliik I don't think I have ever done anything stupid that I didn't appologize for.  See that's the difference I make a mistake I say I'm sorry and take my lumps for it.  I don't get pissed off, and go into childish fits when someone calls me on my mistake.  Your friend did that, and if that's the kind of person you want to associate with that's fine.  I personally try to avoid hanging out with people who have proven themselves to be as immature as Moran.<br>
<br>
Moran your &quot;flames&quot; calling me a fag are getting really old.  Can you at least come up with some new material?  I will have to admit you have moved up to a sixth grade level from your previous &quot;you first&quot; come backs, but seriously how long can you find calling me a fag be funny?  Do you honestly think you're witty for saying it?  I am honestly starting to think you have some latent homosexual tendencies.<br>
<br>
Quit associating me with the other people flaming you.  The only thing we have in common that I can see is we think you're a fucking idiot.

Yeah, he left with the Byu's for some time.  In retrospect, I personally believe that we were wrong for pressuring them to do things that led to their exodus.  And I see nothing wrong with friends buying him a Trak BP.  And yes, Aeadiin eventually returned and was welcomed with open arms.

Bottom line is that I tried to be nice and tolerate you, Morannon over the past few months.  But the truth is, Aeadiin has been an instrumental part of the guild's growth and is a person of remarkable character which is something that I can't say for your worthless ass.<br>

Old for who? I find it quite amusing that you keep coming back regardless of me telling you simply no, I am not going to apologize to you.

I'm not a comedian Lilum, I don't come up with &quot;material&quot;, I improvise. Flaming is never about being witty Lilum, it is about seeing that the opposing side is scathed more than you. Most companies don't care how they get a certain job done, as long as they complete it in a reliable and effective manor. On the topic of comebacks, flames and insults, where are yours witty one? You keep refering to wit and me not having any and you can't even back yourself up. You flaming my flame. Flames don't even have feelings, sorry Lilum.

<br>
That's what happens when the MT and class leaders leave a guild. We lost probably the 9 people I liked best, (yes I even though you were cool at the time). Not to mention I still grouped with you guys WHILE you guys weren't in transcended and I was, I risked getting booted at multiple occasions to xp with old friends, you should take it as a compliment since that's about all your going to get from me. Now why exactly is one in a guild when they cannot raid because scumbags like Aeadiin leave every time a fog horn blows, and then come back when they realize that they seriously fucked up. You can try to convince yourself that im owning myself to your heart's content. I would have went on to become and applicant in their guild but I had not achieved a high enough level yet. So with this information I decided to stay with what I had, transcended, stating it was a mistake (which it was) since I definately didn't think i'd be able to get 60, who knows it could have worked out. I'm willing to accept responsibility for getting booted for applying to a different guild. You can try and mock me saying I &quot;own&quot; myself but I think that since I am the one who made that post that I would know at least a little better than you, the situation and and I was talking about. You can go back to rolling up in a ball and crying in the corner now.<br>

Merton, this is completely what Im tyring to get at. Aeadiin, thinks he's immune and he can sit there and blatantly talk shit about things he has no idea about. So, I decided to level the playing field and return the favor. I can stir shit around which I don't know much about just like anyone else can.

It's obvious you aren't going to do it though because you aren't man enough to admit when you are wrong.  You were more than happy to come to a public forum pointing out anothers mistake/accident, but now you aren't man enough to accept your own mistake.    <br>

Yeah Moran is now a member of Phalanx, I seriously considered posting on their message board concradulating them on their newest loot whore.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/9/02 7:32:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: tarded?</span><hr size=1> LOL That sentence will teach me to type when I am still half asleep.<br>

Lemme explain one thing to you. When I left Trans, I lost exactly *two* pieces of loot. SSBP, and Selo`s Drums. I got Selo`s Drums from a friend. Trig/Aro/Terrik bought me the SSBP. I returned to Trans... wowowow. I gave my ssbp back to Rishyr (friend of Trig/Aro/Terrik's) and drums back to challia.<br>
Where's all this loot I was deprived of?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  That's what happens when the MT and class leaders leave a guild. We lost probably the 9 people I liked best, (yes I even though you were cool at the time).

<br>
9 people??? Trig... Aro... Terrik... Me... wow, that's only 4 by my count. MT? Trans has (and had) many MT, like most guilds do. Poda, Sixtie, Colio, Kabul? Oh wait, you conviently forgot them. As to grouping, bullshit, not like you were the only one who grouped with us, you were at no risk of getting deguilded for it. You WERE at risk however for your tard actions in velks and by applying to e/v. Look what happened~ Oh, and by the way, I used to dread it when you came to group with us, you barely knew (I'm praying you've learned by now, not sure tho) how to play the monk class, wtf would I take your near killings of us as a compliment?<br>

You can try and mock me saying I &quot;own&quot; myself but I think that since I am the one who made that post that I would know at least a little better than you, the situation and and I was talking about.

Dodging the issue I see. You were a &quot;sunshine patriot&quot;, to coin your term Moron. You didn't even ask an officer or Thinkness about what was happening. Shall we get Sly, Chal &amp; Teyr to come confirm your story? because I sincerely doubt anyone had thoughts Trans was going to disband. 4 members will not cripple a guild, not even one with only around 60 members (what trans had at the time). Trans had other tanks, other druids, &amp; other bards. Only thing that *might've* crippled them was the loss of Aro. But Gumor was around, and Enchanters can slow Doze &amp; Statue, as kaldun has demonstrated time and time again.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you can accept responsibility for your tardedness, but the truth is, the only reason you posted is because people had asked you wtf were you doing. Shame you can't take responsibility for falsely accusing lanfearr (which I believe started this entire shit in the previous thread) and publicly apologize for being a tard. I know you're a slow learner, but keep trying and you'll get it one day Moron!<br>

Uhhhh... if I remember correctly, *YOU* were the one who started the shit regarding the SSBP, and promptly got shot down when trig came and dashed any fantasies you had about my supposed looth00rness. The lame excuse didn't fool anyone. You said that truthfully, and when someone called you on it (just like trig did on the ssbp) you make up some cop out. Practice what you preach you shitstain. I realize you're just a young kid, and don't wanna admit when you're wrong, but sometimes its time to just cut your losses. <p><HR>

You were not in a guild, therefore you were not getting new raid loot that you obviously wanted since you had people give you things like trak BP's and selo's drums. That's the loot you were deprived of. So again, you abandon whoever you leave with and revert back to your old whorish ways. You toss a trak BP back and leave everyone else in the dust.<br>

You can't remain impartial and say it &quot;might've&quot; hurt us, but since you said it did, then is doesn't. I'll just put one and one together and tell you straight up that losing your most dynamic class leaders and your main tank was quite a detriment. There was not a single person in the guild that could fill those positions like they could. If you're so fucking stupid you can't see that, then all hope is lost.<br>

Now Aeadiin, I realize your a sensitive fuck, and you probably got WAY too much more than your fair dose of estrogen when you were born, but I really think it's crucial that you just stop posting all together or you'll get traumatized and act like a fucking baby your whole life. Oh wait, you already do, nevermind. No one want's to hear more of your stories about me in crushbone on the eve of the crescent moon during the year of the yak. I've given you my response, you're not getting a public apology, I've given lanfearr and in-game one. I've accomplished what I wanted to already with this thread which was to tell octracula that we rezzed his guildies with the cleric, im out, later.<br>
