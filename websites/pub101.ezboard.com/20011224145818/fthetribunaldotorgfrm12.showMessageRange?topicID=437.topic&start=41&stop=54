<br>
Let me address a few points. <br>
<br>
I have viewed guides/GMs, if not the same exact way you do Arleanna, at least in a similar way. They do have the power to suspend or ban, so I avoid them. They have never done anything to improve my enjoyment of the game -- in the cases where they have attempted to help, they have either made it worse, or at best, they have done something for me that I could have done, in less than half the time. This is the reason why I have avoided guides and GMs. <br>
<br>
I would never view cops as CS reps. And I would not view guides/GMs as cops. In effect, they are CS reps, but they behave like corrupt cops with little fear of retribution. They will help those who kiss their asses, and refuse help to those who don't. Example: players died in lguk on king raid, one corpse get stuck in wall, guide summoned it. Just for the hell of it, the players asked if the guide could summon the other corpses -- even though they were not stuck. The guide naturally refused, saying it would be illegal. Players said something to the effect of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    &quot;heheh ok, we had to try&quot;.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The guide then started chatting with the players, about her upcoming wedding to another guide. The players all promised to attend her wedding. She was so happy about this, that she said <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     &quot;I shouldn't be doing this, but here goes...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and promptly summoned everyone's bodies. <br>
<br>
Incidentally, if I really wanted to fuck with the guides, I could have posted the chat, and screenshots -- the guide she was getting married to was the prick who gave me a warning over the player name &quot;Natural&quot;. Wouldn't it have been fucking spiffy to show up at the wedding and announce that I'd posted it, getting her thrown out of the guide programme as a wedding gift. So yeah, you may think I'm a bad guy, but I could sure as hell done a lot worse, than tell a guide to go fuck himself. <br>
<br>
So the point is -- this last encounter that I posted, where I fucked with the guides, yes of course I went overboard, and of course it was unwise of me to say those things. It was a spur of the moment thing. As Bowynn quite correctly pointed out, it was a long overdue FUCK YOU, for all the shit the guides and GMs have done all this time. <br>
<br>
Do guides have to put up with a lot of bullshit? Oh hell yes. But until the above incident, they never had to put up with bullshit from me. If you get bullshit at work, you may have to accept it, because you need the money. But if you get bullshit doing something you volunteered for, you have NO reason to complain about bullshit. None. Zip. I remember back when my father volunteered to help out and drive some handicapped people around, they complained because the guy who normally drove them had a much better car. They didn't wanna drive in his car; they all fought to ride in the fancier cars, and my old man stood there waiting for the &quot;losers&quot; to dejectely come ride in his not-so-fancy car. Now, my dad loved helping people, but he promptly said &quot;fuck this&quot; after that. <br>
<br>
Ie., if guiding isn't fun, then quit. <br>
<br>
And here's the diabolical kicker: if enough people gave enough guides shit, Verant might just have to invest some more money into their CS programme and hire more GMs, pay them better etc. I dunno how likely that is, but if that's what it'll take to keep customers paying, then it will happen. And if enough people cancelled their accounts, well -- same deal. <br>
<br>
Another issue about the guides/GMs on this server: I have played extensively on Vallon, as a Shank. The Shanks are a hardcore roleplaying, no-mercy PvP player killer guild. They are revered, and viewed as a very honorable bunch by the decent players on the server. But they are hated (and harrassed) by the d00ds. And that means we would get petitioned a lot. False accusations were made constantly, our accusers would lie and accuse us of training, corpse camping -- all the things that they would do to us. If a guide/GM were to make a mistake, and punish me because of those lies, I would forgive them, because it is very hard to see through the lies. You'd have to be pretty smart to figure out exactly what happened. But they hardly ever did. Sure, some mistakes were made, but my god, those guys were on the ball like you wouldn't believe it. <br>
<br>
And appart from that job, you should fucking SEE the Vallon Zek GM events! The last GM event I took part in, on The Tribunal, was the bixie invasion. This event consisted of giant GM controlled bixes who shouted &quot;BZZzzzZZZzz!&quot; and slaughtered people, newbies and high lvl people alike. It was an absolute, utter joke, and a classical &quot;Lets blow some steam off by fucking with our customers&quot; GM event. <br>
<br>
Just after this happened on The Tribunal, I took part in a GM event in the same area, on Vallon Zek. It was an absolute ball. A GM controlled dark elf female wizard rallied her crowd of players against a dwarven male palladin -- oh my god what a fight, it went from Nektolus, through the commonlands, into Freeport, and I think back to the commonlands again. It was a full blown roleplay event, and we had a shitload of fun. The GMs were really good, and in character at all times. After the event was over, they walked around rezzing people. Fat fucking chance the crew on The Tribunal would bother doing that. <br>
<br>
Guides and GMs aren't cops. But if they were, then the lot we have been blessed with here on The Tribunal, are a bunch of stoned, lobotomized Keystone Cops, and Vallon Zek's are Sherlock fucking Holmes. <br>
<br>
This fact, that I have seen with my own eyes, how good the crew on Vallon are, compared to these miserable jizmops, is the key element in my frustration. <br>
<br>
What will I do next? No idea. I'm mighty tempted to go with DAoC, and become a Shank once again, but would need an upgrade, which I don't see myself doing right now. <br>

I've also worked in CS for about the last 6 years and would of hung up on someone talking to me like Cogs did. But, I respect you Cogito and know why you did it.<br>
<br>
The problem with Verant's CS is that they have this guide program. First, it's truly not worth a free account to put up with the crap and no power to help. Second, a company like VI which is part of SOE should not have been nor still be so cheap as to not have paid guides. You can say, well Sony didn't want to front that much money from the beginning but you have to do it. Look at Mythic, fully paid employees, higher paid I might add then VI's customer support staff. And the only problem at the moment which is not really their fault is the wait time. If players wouldn't /appeal &quot;How do I shoot my bow?&quot; &quot;Why do I lose con when I die?&quot;, simple freakin gameplay issues which are in the damn manual. Then the wait would be alot less. <br>
<br>
This is not a bash Verant praise Mythic post, but.... I truly believe that while Mythic is not reinventing the MMORPG, they are showing others how a company should be run and players should be treated.<br>

Okay... they work for Verant dealing directly with a customer.  They are REPRESENTING Verant.  They are working in a service capacity, serving CUSTOMERS.<br>

They can summon corpses, rezz, set up rotation on spawn disputes, summon people when the boats mess up (not often anymore), keep an eye on exploit spots, keep an eye on known trouble makers to help cushion the other players and they can (though quite a few don't I guess) explain policy, it's purpose and what options you have if you don't agree with a decision made.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, guides can (if they choose) be a person to vent to when a policy or player makes the game less enjoyable. That doesn't mean you have to be a punching bag, but there were many times that there was nothing I could do but listen to the player and sympathize with them. Sometimes that was enough. Some players just needed to know that their frustration was heard and understood.<br>
<br>
Being a guide is great if you have patience and like working with players. You learn alot about the game and the perspective you gain from seeing both sides of EQ (CS/Players) allow you to make sense of most of the things you read on the message boards. Just don't expect to be all powerful, because guides have to follow policy, else all hell would break loose.  <p><br>

<br>
BULLSHIT<br>
<br>
Verrant created the system in which they chose CS - whether or not Guides are paid affiliates of the VICS System, THEY ARE A PART OF THE SYSTEM.  If I convince my neighbor to KILL you does it matter if I pay him or not?  Verrant created the institutions of their Customer Service - They created the position of Guides.  So is VI responsible for the actions of their Guides?  YES.<br>
<br>
And as for the analogy of dealing with a Cop, I can tell a cop to fuck himself and as long as I don't resist arrest or break any other laws he can do fuckall about it.  There might be some bullshit charge he can hit on me, but being disrespectful to a police officer is NOT a crime.  Cussing at a Police officer is NOT a crime.  So that whole analogy is a bit off base if you ask me.<br>
<br>
I just get tired of everyone going &quot;Don't blame the Guides, they work all this time and get $10 a month for it.&quot;  They fucking volunteered.  I have no sympathy for someone who hits themself in the nuts repeatedly with a ball peen hammer and then complains because their balls hurt.  If you are being a guide for the $10 a month, retire now.  If you think they're underpaid for what they do, don't apply to be a guide.  It's not like there's a lottery every month to pick the CS People.  I don't sympathize with Guides for the amount of work they do for the pay - I can say I might respect or understand that they're doing it because it might be fun, and I'm generally respectful to Guides... only once have I ever had to contradict one... but that was a GM.  To make a long story short, I was unencumbered and fell 15 loc points in WW for 10k.  I reported and petitioned and the GM said he jumped off of that cliff and it 10k'd him.  I said to read the report and mentioned that I didn't have inside info on the coding - but I thought it was nearly impossible to fall from an elevation of 15 locs for 10k, let alone with safefall maxed.  What happened?  He read, reconsidered, and got a rez.<br>
<br>
So I'm sorry but the VI CS people aren't Martyrs - they may not get paid for what they have to do, but they volunteered for it none the less.<br>
<br>
So the excuse of VICS Guides aren't paid and VICS Guides aren't part of VICS is bullshit to me.  They created the institutions of their CS, and people volunteered to be guides.  So don't pull the fucking martyr card on it.<br>

I never had anyone be rude to me. The reason I quit is because the other guides on the server would log on and the que would be full.  They would say &quot;I'm not here to guide I want to explore velious for a while&quot;, this was when velious was available to guides and not players yet. so I would be there with 20 petitions trying to get through them and there would be 3 other guides exploring velious and ignoring the job that they were supposed to be doing in the first place. I admit that I explored Velious a few times,  but I would only do it if there were no petitions, which happens more than you'd think. Ever since then I've had a low opinion of guides I think they are lazy and self serving, for some one that is there for costumer service. <br>

Don't be a fucking guide.<br>

If we all followed this advice, VI's guide program would be a total failure and they would need to look elsewhere for their CS needs...paid, monitored employees perhaps...<br>

seriously though i do agree with u minisin, we shouldnt have to police ourselves. we pay $10 a month, we should get better service than the crap we get now.<br>
