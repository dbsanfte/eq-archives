Only because, according to the Christian view, He is the one who gets to decide what &quot;infinitely good, just, wise, etc.&quot; means.<br>

Oh, and somewhat related to your post....<br>
<br>
Even if we are all biological machines created by chance Life can still have value, because life is a prerequisite for value, since one must be alive to value things in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 776<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/7/03 7:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=242>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> God would not command me to do anything that was not a part of his plan, which is Good and moral.  That is the test of faith - if God commands you to do something evil, like kill your child, would you do it?  The answer for someone who truly believes is yes, because God would not command you to do something evil, so either killing your own child is not Evil, or there are/will be mitigating factors which will interfere and cause the actions you take to be Good.<br>
<br>
Force is not the only way He can enforce His rules.<br>
<br>
That is why He was not content to have the world remain the way it was in the Old Testament.  He was enforcing His rules - but even that didn't work!  People are too perverse.<br>
<br>
So God doesn't enforce His rules any more.  He has truly given humanity free reign.  He provided the sacrifice of His son, and then said, &quot;Look what I have done for you!  The ultimate sacrifice!  What greater proof could there be of my good will toward men?  I offer you eternal life.&quot;  And now he sits back and watches the show.  He's not enforcing His rules any more because He knows exactly what you just implied - that people who follow rules under threat probably won't truly believe in those rules, they just follow them because of the threat hanging over their heads.  We are free to choose for ourselves, with only one threat hanging over our heads.  But even that threat is only applicable for those who have faith in the existence of the Christian God anyway!  If you don't believe in Him, why should the prospect of Hell scare you?  If you don't believe it exists, it's no more frightening than any other old fairy tale or horror movie.  I've always been dubious of fire and brimstone sermons, precisely because of the reasons outlined above:  you're either preaching to the choir, or conversions made out of fear are generally relatively fake.<br>
<br>
Point is, that's not how God is operating right now.  He could, of course.  And He would be perfectly justified in doing so.  But He would rather us come to him out of love for Him, and true faith and belief, rather than intimidation. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 777<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/7/03 7:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=243>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> So how much value does life have, then?

Okay, again, this was my point.  I understand this thinking, and that's what I was pointing out.<br>
<br>
It's ALWAYS just and good, because God does it.  That's the big loop.  That's the circular reasoning.  If God commanded Hilter to lead the Holocaust then it was just and good.  If God commanded Osama to coordinate the Trade Tower attacks it would be just and good.  If God brought about events for a nuclear holocaust it would be just and good.<br>
<br>
Don't you see the problem with that?<br>

First, it was simply a response to show that you're wrong.  Notice I haven't really taken either side through this whole discussion?  I'm being a bit of a sophist and playing both sides to get people thinking and stimulate the discussion.<br>
<br>
Second, you can't even answer that question now based upon the existence of God.  You can't quantify things like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 685<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/7/03 7:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=245>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> Not to mentiont he problem that if God speaks to Caledhon, i usually can't hear the whispers...

<br>
He commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.  He did not let him do it.  You are leaving out half of the equation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course it is. How else can He do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Like I just explained - by relying on the examples of His sacrifice and the lessons passed on through the Bible to draw people to Him.  Of course, this isn't really &quot;enforcing&quot;... to actually enforce His rules, he would have to eliminate human free will.  What's the point of that?  He's got angels for the unquestioning obedience and praise schtick.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I'm not really asking you to quantify the value of life.  Obviously that is impossible.  I'm asking you to justify your valuation of it, as opposed to someone else's.  You have explained why life can be valued without the existence of a Creator - but is life the only thing of value?  Is it of paramount value?  What about people who place greater value on, say, wealth than life?  Who are you to tell them that they are incorrect, immoral, in a relativistic universe?<br>

If there were two of us, I would probably line up behind my absolute morality friend to fuck the goat after him.<br>
<br>
Answer your own question, what kind of morality do you imagine you would have ? What would provide you with your morality ?<br>
<br>
Before you keep maintaining that relative morality is no morality, let me quote a dictionary on the word morality :<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct.<br>
2. A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct: religious morality; Christian morality.<br>

If you had any idea how idiotic these claims on behalf of Christians look like to an outside observer you would cry in shame.<br>
<br>
You have absolutely no grounds for claiming absolute morality because your entire opinion stems from your belief that your god is superior to everyone else's god.  Look at where you and Dumai are getting your definitions of absolute morality - the US constitution?  The Bible?  Heh.<br>
<br>
There is no point in arguing with you because you defer all the difficult points to god and pass it off as god's will or god's great plan or whatever you want to call it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigadoondemortis>Rigadoon deMortis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 327<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/03 4:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=253>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Walkabout don't make me cringe again by taking the definition of a complex concept debated for thousands of years from a dictionary.<br>

If you want to make fun of people because they hold beliefs that you disagree with, go post on the flameboard, Merton.  If you want to hold a civil discussion to learn more about your own beliefs as well as those of others, post something here worth reading.

<br>
No, like I said before - posting anything worthwhile in the context of this thread is a futile expenditure of effort because zealots like you defer responsibility to God when you paint yourself into a corner.  Everything that you cant explain, or everything that contradicts with a view of an atheist is supposed to be explained by God, and in your mind, because it is explained by God, it is automatically right as well.  You can't &quot;win&quot; these arguments if you are an atheist, and it's really futile to even bother.<br>
<br>
Whereas atheists build their arguments on what is known (facts), theists build their arguments on what is unknown (faith).<br>
<br>
If we substituted Christianity in this context with Shintoism, or Islam - I'm sure you'd be singing a different tune.<br>

Someone who relies completely only on &quot;hard facts&quot; will be unable to discuss this sort of thing with most people, since most people do not deny, like you do, the existence of the spiritual.  I say this in the broadest possible sense, meaning anything from God to the existence of universal truths or ideals such as Elche proposes.  You're blinding yourself to half of the playing field, and then complaining because the rest of us don't.  Well, sorry... but you're the one handicapping yourself here.
