All else is fact.<br>
<br>
1) Poladara loots (ninjas) two red dragon scales off of an SI killed Ragefire<br>
<br>
2)  She gives the scales to Panolas (since gms usually don't bother tracking items past one owner)<br>
<br>
3)  Panolas sells the scales (since once an item is sold, gms usually tell you you're SOL)<br>
<br>
4)  During this time period, Pola gets in touch with Chutoi.<br>
<br>
5)  Pola goes on vacation<br>
<br>
6)  Chutoi and Podaman get in touch with each other.<br>
<br>
7)  Poladara is either removed or is flagged to be removed from DV  (for ninjaing)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Someone coughs up FT3 boots to SI.  Poladara is either reinvited to the guild or is removed from &quot;Deguild her next time you see her on&quot;<br>
<br>
9)  Mulberry posts about Poladara ninjaing scales.<br>
<br>
10)  Podaman is pissed that this incident became public and demands the boots back with two scales that he somehow came into the possession of.  He also tries to make Mulberry look bad for bringing this incident to the attention of the flameboard.<br>
<br>
Poda, you were going to remove her for, if not ninjalooting, shall we say 'protracted possession and distribution of an item not acquired through approved means.'  You don't remove people from the guild for accidents that are taken care of in a proper manner.<br>
<br>
Something similar happened in the past.  If I remember right, Alexandr did something that one of the guilds he was in provided compensation for, to keep the guild's good name.  Except... they booted Alexandr.  By providing the compensation, you kept Dark Virtue's name clean on the ninjalooting account.<br>
<br>
Poladara's personal reputation is another matter entirely.  She *did* acquire the scales, which she had no right to have in the first place.  She did *not* return them to the guild to which they 'belonged'.  She provided compensation for the scales, not the scales themselves - Panolas sold those.  Isn't Panolas in Dark Virtue?  Why aren't you blaming him for selling the scales?  Hell, you're blaming anyone except Poladara.  Mulberry is a bitch for telling people she took the scales.  Rynnia is a bitch for working for the best deal for his guild.  Ladida is a bitch for still saying she's a ninjalooter. But not Poladara.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, boys and girls.  Here's a bedtime story for you.<br>
<br>
Meet little Poladara.  Poladara is an angel who is being wronged because she was accidentally forced to loot two (not one, two, GM confirmed) scales off a dragon by the evil lag demon, said dragon having been slain by King Rynnia and his loyal band of SI-ians.  She didst then giveth them to an evil troll..er, halfelf, named Panolas who with a gleeful cackle sold them off and used the money for...er....what happened to that money anyway?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, she came back, and her great uncle Podaman didst cometh uppeth to her and didst sayeth, &quot;The people of the land have decided that you were an evil person, and we no longer want you as part of our family.&quot;  Upon hearing this, she pointed to the evil troll Panolas, whereupon Podaman didst take his sword and um....er....what happened to Panolas?<br>
<br>
Anyway, he didst telleth her this, and she didst weepeth mightily, and went and sold her virtue on the street corners at night, and washed dishes during the day, to make enough money to pay for magical slippers, that she might appease her mighty uncle Podaman, and the evil King Rynnia.  Upon seeing this mighty gift, uncle Podaman didst relent, and allowethed her to remain among his most loyal nobles.  &quot;Ho, Loyal Sir Chutoi, I do bringeth a gift!  Nay, not some scruffy dragon scales, but magical slippers of the highest quality!  No, no garters and stockings come with them.  Canst we husheth this up?  My neice is mightily begreived by the fact that she didst um...er...getteth caughtethed, yea, and verily!'  And they didst agree that the slippers were indeed fitting and sexy, and wouldst be fair replacement for the dragon scales that the lag demon didst maketh poor Poladara loot, and give to the evil tro-er, half elf, who didst betray her and selleth the scales.<br>
<br>
But during all this time, a knight of the SI-ians had been spreading word of a foul theft of dragon scales by poor Poladara, which, while it was the truth, was not the truth, at least, not the truth which uncle Podaman wanted to see postethed.  And he didst wax wroth, and spew many invectives and language for which there doth not exist pidgin Olde Englishe equivalents, and he didst bite his thumb at any who didst point at his neice and sayeth, &quot;There she goes.  She is the one who took the scales from the dragon Brave King Rynnia didst slayeth with his SI-ians,&quot; even though it was the truth, for it was not the truth as uncle Podaman saw it, since indeed he had given a bribe...er, a fitting recompense to King Rynnia.  And he didst demandeth the return of the hush money...er, gift, since he didst magically go out and slayed two dragons and skin them with his teeth.  For had she not returned the scales?  Ergo, she therefore didst not looteth the dragon scales, and all of this saga didst therefore not exist.  And he didst wax wroth upon Mulberry, the knight who wast spreadingeth word of the foul deed; and upon the court chronicler Ladida the Short, for not listening to his bellows, and upon evil King Rynnia himself, for wrongs long in the past, that people didst know that Poladara hadst been made to loot the evil scales of the dragon, and he didst take his niece Poladara under his wing and return to his manor, while whipping any peasant who didst point at Poladara and sayeth, &quot;She is the one who looted the scales.'  And whilst whipping his peasants, he would shouteth at the toppe of his voice, &quot;SHE DID NOT!  She gave the scales back!&quot; To which the peasant who wert being whippeth would reply, &quot;But she did still taketh the scales.'  And uncle Podaman wouldst whippeth the peasant all the harder, until the peasant didst agree with him.  And he didst go on like this, until the King's tax collectors caught him using royal moneys for female escorts in the wee hours of the morning, and didst throw him in a dungeon for the rest of his life.<br>

<br>
She doesn't have the scales to return.  Panolas is not now nor has he ever been in DV.  He attended two raids as a guest and we decided not to invite him before this incident ever took place.  He has never had a DV tag, not even as a raid invite.  I did suggest a while back that he should be receiving the brunt of this outrage since he sold the scales and has told at least 3 different stories as to what happened to them.<br>
<br>
Poladara contacted Chutoi before Panolas ever had the scales, and before she left for vacation, and before a GM ever replied to Charsi's petition.<br>
<br>
Rynnia isn't a bitch for working out the best deal for her guild, I'm not a bastard for working out the best deal for my guild.  Rynnia is a bitch for breaking a deal she made with DV when the deal wasn't in her guilds best interest, that is the difference.<br>
<br>
30 DV do not equal 30 SI and nobody has ever claimed otherwise.  Being a stronger guild does not give anyone the right to change the terms of a deal when it suits them to do so.  It gives you the ability to negotiate a better deal at the outset and Rynnia failed to do that, then changed the terms of the deal after the fact.<br>
<br>
The 2 scales I gave Eusa on Monday night came from the 2 Ragefire and 2 Talendor kills we had over the last week or so, despite your attempt to imply they were tainted.  <br>
<br>
SI has nothing to gain from arguing the point other than to reinforce my belief that it's not worth attempting to deal with them beyond an individual level.  There are many people in SI I enjoy talking to and grouping with.  However I can't see working any kind of deals with them on a guild level while their only defense for breaking 2 deals with us is that they were bad deals.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umorannonubermonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorannonUberMonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 6:01:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> The accepted DV conversion rate is as follows:<br>
<br>
30 DV = 15 Bog Bridgade<br>
15 Bog Brigade = 5 Anklebiter's United<br>
5 Anklebiter's United = 2 SI<br>
<br>
So, that's exactly 30 DV for every 2 SI. If my calculations are correct, despite DV having 30 characters (approximately 120 truncated limbs excluding toes, fingers etc...) in the wee hours of the chinese new year during the year of the yak, they did not indeed come close to the amount of power SI had present in fear at the time. Assuming that SI had the 30 people they claimed and using some simple math calculations, DV had only 1/15 total of SI's net power present. If all of the above is true, Podaman and his merry band of followers would truly not have been able to control and slay a powerful god like cazic-thule. In case you didn't know, the little drakes in WTOV don't count as dragon encounters, they won't give you much practice for the real world Podaman. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157701>Sensei Morannon McJohnson</a></center><br>

&quot;I only have one, the other one was passed to a twink.&quot; I say.<br>
&quot;Oh, I'm just warning you that they might be stolen. Later dude!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, so i heard that and went to sleep that night. The next day I log on and try to sell the scale (i was still trying to sell because the gm never confirmed that it was stolen.)  I look in my inventory a little later and realize the scale is gone? How did it go missing? I'm not quite sure. Then a GM sends me a tell.......<br>
&quot;Wasssssssssssssssssssssu!&quot;<br>
&quot;hey&quot; I reply.<br>
&quot;why were you trying to sell the scales?&quot;<br>
&quot;cause someone asked me to.&quot; i say<br>
&quot;ok thanks, stay cool freak.&quot; the gm says.<br>
<br>
Ok, getting to the point of my post......<br>

That is a distraction and you know it. Panolas was the laundering agent, Poladara was the thief.<br>

What is the big secret that makes it worth defending Poladara? Unless you give us some reason to believe in Poladara, everything you post is going to harm your guild further. Give us her side of the story in full.<br>

i offer her support because she is part of our guild, our family. we support her because she is one of us. if theres a dv member i hated with every bone in my body, i would support them over random people that arent in my guild. guild is all. thankyou.<br>
<br>
personally, i think pola is an idiot. erm.. if i see a guild raiding, and a mob die, i am NOWHERE near the damn corpse, and i certainly wouldnt check the body. its her mistake totally. and.. im infuriated as a person that she doesnt place guild reputation over the comfyness of staying in DV. in her position i would force myself to leave, no matter the pain it would cause me. but of course.. i wouldnt be stupid enough to get myself into this particular position. its her responsibility. if she had looted and not tried to fix it at all, i guarentee she would have been guildremoved instantly. but she did not. she tried to fix it. and that is where the ole second chance thing comes in.<br>
<br>
guild = all. you guys can scream bloody murder all you want.. i dont really care what you say, i care about how this effects people in my guild. and the fact they get upset. if there was a way to make everything perfect again id do it in a second, but its human nature to bitch and complain... and theres no way to fix this. not since it was brought to the flameboard *poke mulberry*<br>

No deal was actually completed.  Yes, the above was offered, but was never set in stone.  You never agreed to anything.  You said you had to think about it, you said it sounded fair, and then shortly thereafter, after going LD, you said you could not hold connection and greyman was going to take over speaking with me.<br>
<br>
When you went ld and left, and several of your raid force left, the chance you had to take down Cazic was reduced from a small percentage to a flat 0.<br>
<br>
As far as my people went, we had approximately 32 people there, and a good spread of classes similar to the spread of classes we had when we killed CT the other night with 34.<br>
<br>
Therefore when I spoke with greyman I certainly did alter the original &quot;propsed&quot; deal, and I asked him if such an agreement were acceptable.<br>
<br>
SI / DV roll.   Highest gets 2 items and lowest gets 1 item but gets first pick.<br>
<br>
He said that would be more than fair as far as DV was concerned, because without SI present DV wouldnt be getting any items.<br>
<br>
<br>
CT had not even been engaged yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
After CT died and the roll happened the trade for the SBOZ was made.   This was not forced. This was asked ONCE and DV agreed to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/upodamandv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PodamanDV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 8:41:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No deal was actually completed.

It was offered and I accepted.  That constitutes a deal in my book.  The fact that you changed it after I told Grey to accept the deal settles it in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Glad to hear you finaly admit that that was the deal in place when my connection crapped out.<br>
<br>
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Poladara fucked up, and fucked up bad.  She's sad as much.  She said it to me, she said it to Mublerry and Chutoi.  She apologized and attempted to make ammends.  I respect that and in my eyes she's learned her lesson and paid the price (incidentaly, I'm holding on to the boots until she repays the guild for the red scales I gave SI out of the guild bank).  On the other hand, Mulberry and Rynnia both admit to renegging on deals and are totaly unremorseful about it. <br>
<br>
I'll take Poladara in my guild over either of those two any day of the week and twice on sunday.  <br>
<br>
DV and SI made a deal.  SI renegged on the deal.  DV and SI made another deal.  SI renegged again.<br>

I understand all about family and unity and loyalty. I was in a guild at one time. I have also stepped to the defense of friends and guildmates. Even at times when I was not in total agreement with them.<br>
<br>
But I have never defended scamming or stealing or ninjalooting. In fact, I remember blasting a fucker in our guild named Jama who fucking scammed this one guy &amp; lied his ass off to. Our wizard captain rode his ass as well and the dude who got scammed got his crap back. Nobody backed Jama. Nobody.<br>
<br>
But you guys are not just defending this ninjalooting whore. You are fucking blasting the people she stole from. To me that is just brilliant. What a wonderful guild. <p><BR>
