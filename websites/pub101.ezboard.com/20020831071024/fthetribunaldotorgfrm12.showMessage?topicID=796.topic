<br>
Someone I know in game because of dealings with them a couple years back (not in RL) decided he was gonna purchase an EQ account and happened upon a level 60 monk / rogue account for sale.  He bought it, and got the account intact, and played it for a month or so.  On the account was a level 60 monk, Akari, and a level 60 rogue, Plexx.  This person also plays a twink on another account named &quot;Uberbish.&quot;<br>
<br>
Goes to log on the other day and can't.  The password had been changed.  He contacted the guy he bought it from I guess and was told he could have it back.  He didn't want it back, he wanted a refund, and the guy would not give him a refund and now is basically telling him to go screw himself, AND playing on the account that the guy he sold it to is still paying for, and cannot cancel payment on without access to the account or without calling his CC company.<br>
<br>
So since this guy would never go posting here I'm gonna, cuz this kinda shit pisses me off  (fraud, theft etc.).<br>
<br>
The characters in question are Akrai / Plexx / Uberbish.  Akrai used to be a member of Legendary and seems to be back in the guild.  I'm not so sure of what guilds Plexx and Uberbish are in.<br>
<br>
Be careful of these characters in NBG groups.  They have rather poor equipment (most is GM issued recovery gear I guess) for their level, and may try to snatch up things claiming they died and lost their corpse or something and got stuck with all this junk GM gear.<br>
<br>
Also take care that they are not using their current guilds and or lying to their current guilds about &quot;what happened.&quot;  What happened is the guy sold his account, and then stole it back from the buyer.  Take care in issuing them loot that may end up on ebay in a month.<br>
<br>
That's about it.  i don't really know much more on this.  If anyone is overly concerned about this because of in game affiliation I can probably get a bit more info for you if needs be. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolveren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolveren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/02 4:13:03 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://everquest.station.sony.com/library/images/c_warrior.gif width=71 height=177></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Akrai / Plexx / Uberbish (Legendary read)</span><hr size=1> Hmmm, I can't remember an Akrai ever being in Legendary, maybe as a trial for a short while?

And her brother Sold the account to a member in Sol Invictus via Ebay. Said member in sold Invictus sold/destroyed everything on Akrai except her Epic. Akrai gets back from school finds out her brother sold her account. Calls Sony/Verant and gets her account reinstated. GM gives her summoned GM armor. She sends me a tell. With this story. I confirmed the leaving for school bit with a member in the guild. And wala she is let back in. But not the Rogue. So sounds fishy to me on both sides of the account. <p>Imotep Eaglespirit<BR>

<br>
In my opinion, the looser who bought the Ebayed account finaly reaped the reward of loserdom. The person who sold then snatched back the account is a true lowlife as well and should be branded as such. The lowlife would not have been able to pull off such actions if the loser hadn't bought the account in any case.<br>
<br>
Ebay Buyers and Sellers (of EQ accounts/items) are all losers and lowlifes (respectively) to me and deserve whatever misfortune they happen upon. I find the story heartwarming in a way.<br>

<br>
I bought a monk awhile back, (like over 2 years ago  : P ).  I did, though, take necessary precautions at the time of purchase so as not to get screwed in this fashion, or at least that if I did, I would have some recourse.<br>
<br>
I'm not quite sure I understand the &quot;he deserved it hahahaha&quot; mentality.  What I gather happened here was akin to someone buying a car, the owner keeping a key to it, and then the owner coming and stealing it back while the buyer slept.  I fail to see the humor in it.  Regardless of the circumstances, theft is theft. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/useshet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seshet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/02 12:41:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Akrai / Plexx / Uberbish (Legendary read)</span><hr size=1> Actualy, I think it's more like illeagly subletting out a house, doing lots of improvements, and then getting evicted. <br>
<br>
The essential difference to basic theft is that the account was aquired inappropriately to begin with.<br>
Even though I am not a big fan of licensing agreements and intellectual property concepts as they currently exist, I did think that the point deserved being brought up at least. <br>
<br>
My personal objection to ebaying accounts/items is that it cheapens the efforts of people who choose to play the game legitimately and, in my opinion, is contrary to the spirit of the game itself. Therefore, when they are tripped up in doing this activity that I disaprove of, I find it amusing. I don't really have any power or say in the issue, but this is the flameboard and all so I gave vent to my amusement.<br>
