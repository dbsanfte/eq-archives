        The Lesser Faydark was a magical place; fairies and brownies made their homes there, occasionally venturing into the rest of Faydark.  Brownie spider herders kept their charges away from the unicorns that roamed through the forest.  An enclave of Kelethin rangers kept the vampires of Mistmoor castle within their walls.  They didn't notice when another ranger entered Lesser Faydark and started her hunt of Tunare's unicorn.  It was found that evening, left for dead, its horn missing and no sign of its desecrator.<br>
<br>
        The first thing that Voldraxx was aware of was that his head ached.  He heard some chanting in dwarvish and then even his headache was gone.  He opened his eyes and sat up.  He was in one the sleeping chambers of Boab's Tavern in the Butcherblock Mountains. In the room with him were Muse, Ralerien and Beened.  Beened's gruff face brightened as Voldraxx meet his eyes.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Well, it about time you woke up, Voldraxx.  Ralerien and Muse found you with your head bashed on the road to Felwithe.  You sure made someone mad! Pigg is already downstairs sharpening his swords.  Give us the name -and we'll make sure they don't do this again!&quot;<br>
<br>
        Voldraxx searched his robes, the book was gone.   &quot;Where is Kess?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
        &quot;We didn't find her, &quot; replied Ralerien.  &quot;Was she with you?<br>
<br>
        &quot;Someone attacked you and Kesselee?&quot; growled Beened.<br>
<br>
        &quot;No, it was Kess who attacked me&quot; said Voldraxx.<br>
<br>
        Into the shocked silence that followed, Voldraxx explained the events of the previous night, how he has discovered that only Kesselee could read the book of the Innoruuk's ritual and how he had tried to get to Felwithe so the priest of Tunare attempt to destroy the book but that he had been attacked in the wood of Great Faydark.<br>
<br>
        &quot;There have been many tales of this ritual,&quot; Voldraxx explained.  &quot;The Gods aren't really of this world, so their power is limited and equal.  If a God ever gained the flesh of this world, that one would be supreme, and unstoppable.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Well, why didn't you just destroy the book?&quot; asked Ralerien.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Well Zenra and I tried!&quot; returned Voldraxx.  &quot;We couldn't mar it.  I had hoped that by staying away from my people that I could keep it away from Innoruuk's chosen.  I never dreamed He would take a Fier'Dal!  I was sure that Tunare would protect her children.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; asked Muse.<br>
<br>
        &quot;We have to find Kess and get that book away from her.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
        Aauminki couldn't remember the last time he had been at Surefall Glade. He wasn't sure if he had entered the glade even though he had passed it many times on his way home to the island of Odus.  Surefall Glade was an isolated haven for rangers and druids.  Here, they exchanged tales of their travels, honed their skills and watched over Tunare's bears.  Poachers rarely ventured there, they were swiftly stopped.  The followers of Tunare declared that it was a glimpse from their Goddess of her Sacred Home.<br>
<br>
        He glanced at Tuwene. &quot;Stop blaming yourself. You didn't know&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;I know,&quot; replied Tuwene &quot;but still, if I hadn't dozed off!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;From what Voldraxx said, it was simply a matter of time - let's inform the rangers of Surefall Glade and get back to Boab's as soon a possible.  The sooner we find Kess, the sooner we can stop this.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Tuwene and Aauminki entered the mountain pass that lead to Surefall Glade.  If they had been there before they would have realized that the silence was unnatural.  As it was, they just thought it was peaceful.  That notion was shattered as soon as the entered the glade.<br>
<br>
        The bears of Tunare lay slaughtered across the glade.  The residents of Surefall Glade struggled against the black thorny vines that imprisoned them which crackled with dark energy as they tried to free themselves.  A blood splattered figure knelt beside the largest of the bear, removing something from the inside of the butchered carcass.  As it rose, Tuwene and Aauminki recognized Kesselee, holding the quivering heart of the dead bear in one hand, her blood soaked sword in the other. <br>
<br>
        Aauminki positioned himself between Kesselee and the pass out of the glade. Tuwene pulled her sword free and stood beside Aauminki.  Aauminki saw that a few of the rangers were beginning to break free of the black vines.  In a few minutes, they would be able to overpower Kesselee.  Then, they could get the book away from her.  Hopefully, that would be enough to stop Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Kess,&quot; said Aauminki gently, &quot;put the sword away, and let's talk.  Tell us why you doing this, what you need, maybe we can help you&quot;. <br>
<br>
        Kesselee stood there, making no answer.  The point of her sword trembled.  Light and shadow seemed to swirl in her eyes.<br>
<br>
        &quot;We just want to talk to you, that's all, Kess.  No one wants to hurt you.&quot;  Aauminki turn to Tuwene and motioned to her to step away.  &quot;Free the rangers and then together, grab her&quot; whispered Aauminki to Tuwene.<br>
<br>
        Tuwene made a wide circle around Kesselee who never glanced at her.  Aauminki was talking softly, asking how Kess's trip to the glade had been, what was the purpose of the heart, any thing to get a response, to stall for time.  Tuwene made way to the nearest ranger, sheathed her sword and started to break the vines.<br>
<br>
        Kesselee charged Aauminki, her sword poised.  Tuwene heard Aauminki chanting a spell.  She whirled around in time to see the point of Kesselee's sword lower as she stabbed the erudite wizard in the abdomen.  Aauminki's spell ended in a scream of pain as he collapsed to the ground, a pool of blood forming around him.<br>
<br>
        Tuwene raced to Aauminki, lay her hands on him and the wound vanished. She helped him sit up and then looked around.  Kesselee was no longer in Surefall Glade.<br>
<br>
        &quot;She's lost, isn't she? Kess would have never hurt you, Minki. Innoruuk has destroyed her?&quot; asked Tuwene.<br>
<br>
        &quot;I don't think so, Tuwene.  I saw her eyes as she charged me.  Innoruuk aimed for my heart.  Kess broke through long enough to push the point down.  She is in there, Tuwene but I have no idea for how long.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        It was night on the plains of Karana.  Most travelers in the board plains camped near bridges over the rivers or by the merchants or near the farms.  Most travelers gathered closed to hold back the darkness of the night with the light of fire and companionship.  One traveler chose to rest far away from these isles in the blackness.<br>
<br>
         The first thing Kesselee felt was the tree against her back.  She tried to flex her fingers, she could.  This time, it had been a whole day that she had been shunted aside.  Every time she fought to balk the dark force that held her, she lost a little more strength; Innoruk's gripe on her became a little stronger.  But it had been worth it, Innoruk had directed the blade to Aauminki's heart, she had forced it down, and held on long enough to run out of Surefall Glade, to give Tuwene a chance to heal him. <br>
<br>
        She shifted position and gazed up at the stars, the small lights in the darkness.  He wouldn't even let her kill herself. Even though she had fought for an instant of control, long enough to change a killing blow to a stunning blow, she had not been able to bear the thought that her friends would think that she had tried to kill Voldraxx. After the attack, when she had finally surfaced, she had raced to Felwithe, planning to attack the guards so they would kill her, stopping Innoruuk.  But just as she was within eyesight of the gates of Felwithe, she had lost control again. She had realized then that she grew weaker each time she fought him.  It was just a matter of time now until she was totally lost. She couldn't fight him, not without some help.  She had to save her strength, to stop the ritual he was planning.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Tunare, mother of all, hear my pray,&quot; Kesselee prayed. &quot;Help me break free from the grasp of the Lord of Hate.   Give the strength the to end this, even at the cost of my life.  Please Mother, help me. I can not bear to hurt more of those that I love.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;MY CHILD,&quot; said the soft female voice that had haunted her before, &quot; I CAN NOT HELP YOU.  I HAVE GIVEN YOU TO INNORUUK.  YOU ARE NO LONGER MINE, NOW.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Kesselee ran across the broad plains of Karna, to try and escape the knowledge that the Goddess she had served all her life, had tossed her to Innoruk. She ran to escape a new emotion, one that had never taken rooted before in her heart. It was hatred and it was all her own.<br>
<br>
        &quot;YES, MY CHILD, TUNARE DISCARED YOU.  NUTURE YOUR HATE AND I WILL NEVER ABANDON YOU.&quot;  <br>
<br>
        Innoruuk whispered in her head.  She ran harder to try and escape the truth that He spoke.  He NEVER abandoned those who served him faithfully in hate. As the fog, swirled around her, she lost her footing, tumbled to the ground, got up and ran deeper into the fog.  Her hatred kept pace with her.<br>
<br>
        Gradually she became aware of the sound of hoof beats behind her.  She turned and saw a mounted knight, obscured in the fog, reaching out to her.  As she reached out her hand to him, a dark wind blew the fog away.  There was only time for their fingertips to touch and the voice of a lost friend to whisper in her ear:<br>
<br>
        &quot;Be true to your own heart and endure.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
        Boab's Tavern was off the beaten trail in the Butcherblock Mountains. Today it was a hive of activity as the regulars of Boab's gathered.  There was no music, no laughter.  Each realized that every hour brought Innoruuk's Ritual closer.  <br>
<br>
        Voldraxx sat in his dark corner.  Zenra, Aauminki, and Tuwene were already beginning to plan how to assault the Temple of Innoruuk in Neriak.  Voldraxx wondered how he, a nercomancer of Innoruuk, had gotten himself in this situation, assaulting the temple of his god.  He knew the answer; caring and friendship had seduced him.  He knew that Innoruuk would destroy those feelings if He was supreme.  Voldraxx could not face that emptiness again, now that he had been warmed by the glow of fellowship.<br>
<br>
        If only there was some way to stop Kesselee before she went to Neriak, the assault would be unnecessary.  But there had been no pattern to her trail, no way to determine where she would go next.  The unicorns in Lesser Faydark, the bears in Surefall, the treants in the Karanas, the only constant had been the utter destruction of creatures sacred to Tunare. And now reports were coming of druids being slaughtered in their rings.<br>
<br>
        Druids in their rings!<br>
        <br>
        &quot;And when the interlopers in my land are no more, and their blood consecrates their ring to Me, proceed then to...&quot; whispered a memory of another night in Boab's.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Ralerien, Tuwene  - I know where she is going.  I know where we can try and stop her!&quot; called Voldraxx.<br>
<br>
        Ralerien and Tuwene came over to Voldraxx's corner.  &quot;Where Vold, where is she going?&quot; asked Tuwene.<br>
<br>
        &quot;The druid circle in the Nektulos forest - that passage she read to me must refer to that ring.  Go get Sashanna, Tuwene.  The three of you will go the ring and wait for her there.  Ralerien will steal the book and then this will end&quot;<br>
<br>
        Tuwene raced out of the tavern, looking for Sashanna.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Do you really think taking the book will end this Vold?&quot; asked the half-elven rogue, doubtfully.<br>
<br>
        &quot;No I don't, Ralerien.   But if you can sneak behind someone to pickpocket them surely you can do other things also&quot; said Voldraxx.  He forced down the regret that came with the memory of an elven ranger, who had always greeted him with a hug.<br>
<br>
<br>
        Sashanna, Tuwene and Ralerien cautiously approached the druid ring.  They all knew what they had to do.  Ralerien had to steal the book, Tuwene, to back him up if he was discoverd and Sashanna to get them out if she could but at all costs she was not to get involved.  If they weren't successful, that assault would have to be started immediately.<br>
<br>
        But they were almost too late; Kesselee had already come to the ring.<br>
<br>
        Sashanna had already called upon Tunare's power to camouflage them.  Tuwene and Sashanna crouched behind a bush on the edge of the ring, while Ralerien slowly made his way into the circle.<br>
<br>
        Ralerien glided silently towards the center of the druid ring.  Kesselee still had her back to him, intent on the stone in front of her.  Her backpack was in the center of the ring, forgotten it seemed.  As he entered the ring, he saw what was the left of the druids.  Their heads had been smashed, their throats slit.  Cautiously, he made his to the backpack, checking each footstep, making sure that nothing could betray him.  He paused for a moment, she didn't appear to have noticed him.  He removed the cursed book from the pack and stowed it away.  As he rose, he finally got a clear glimpse of what she was doing.<br>
<br>
        In her left hand she held a bowl that gave off a wisp of steam in the chill morning.  Her right hand was dipping into it.  When she pulled it out, Ralerien was that it was dripping with blood.  Her blood-soak hand wrote symbols dedicating the ring to the Lord of Hate. Dip, write, dip write, again and again, she wrote the symbols, without a change of expression, without any awareness of what was going on around her.<br>
<br>
        The opportunity was too good to waste.  Ralerien pull out his daggers and silently positioned himself behind her.<br>
<br>
        When Ralerien had pocketed the book, Tuwene had breathed a sigh of relief.  They would take it and destroy it, she had faith that somehow, they would figure a way to destroy it and free Kess.  Then she saw Ralerien pull his weapons and position himself behind her.<br>
<br>
        Ralerien drew back his daggers, gleaming with poison, and stabbed with all his strength toward Kesselee's unprotected back.  But before they could even graze her armor, an invisible force shattered the blades.<br>
<br>
        &quot;You should have contented yourself with the book, thief,&quot; said something in Kesselee's voice.  &quot;I have no more use for it. Suffer the consequences of assaulting the Lord of Hate!&quot;<br>
<br>
        Kesselee whirled, her bloody hand now glowing with dark power.  She touched Ralerien with it, pulling the life essence free of his body.<br>
<br>
        Tuwene heard the taunt and saw Ralerien crumble to the ground.  She sprang forward, she had stop this.  It had to end now!<br>
<br>
        Sashanna began chanting the words that would open a portal away from this place.  She would hold it as long as she could.<br>
<br>
        &quot;So, paladin,&quot; Kesselee's voice almost purred, &quot; you have decided to take your turn at Me.  I will indulge you.&quot;  Kesselee pulled out her war hammer and sword and swung at Tuwene's head.  Tuwene battered the blow away with her shield.<br>
<br>
        Tuwene had sparred with Kesselee when they had both tried to hone their skills.  This wasn't Kess that she was fighting.  The movements were not as fluid; there was awkwardness in the wielding of the weapons, a heartbeat's pause before a parry or a swing.  It gave Tuwene the opportunity she had been looking for; she drove her lance towards Kess's heart, to kill Innorukk, to free Kess's spirit. <br>
<br>
        The point of the lance grazed against Kesselee's breastplate and then shattered.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Did you truly think that I would allow your weapons to hurt me?&quot; Innorukk sneered. &quot;Suffer the fate of your foolish comrade!&quot;<br>
<br>
        The bloody hand reached out as before, covered with dark energy, to drive Tuwene into death.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Tuw, &quot; whispered Kesselee &quot;get Ralerien and get out of here, now!&quot;<br>
<br>
        Tuwene met her friend's eyes, saw the pain, saw the horror, saw the struggle to hold Innorukk back long enough to allow Tuwene and Ralerien a chance at life. The bloody hand was frozen in front of her eyes, visibly trembling as if something was trying to push it forward while something else pulled it back.<br>
.<br>
        &quot;Kess, how can we help...&quot; began Tuwene.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Hurry, Tuwene, please&quot; broke in Kesselee's whisper,  &quot;I can only hold Him back for a few moments more.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Tuwene ran to Ralerien, called on the power of the Prime Healer to keep Ralerien from falling into death, and started to drag him away.  As she reached the edge of stone ring, she glanced at Kesselee's eyes.  The dark power was overwhelming the last glimmer of her friend; Tuwene grabbed Ralerien and drove into the brush, falling against Sashanna.  As the portal that Sashanna had just opened engulfed them, a bolt of dark power towards her, to be shunted aside by the energy of the portal. <br>
<br>
        It had been too easy. Innoruuk smiled in satisfaction as he removed the items he had compelled the ranger to collect and dropped them to the ground like they trash they were.  Tunare had been most foolish in her choice.  One ruled by her love of her friends was easy to weaken.  It hadn't been necessary to complete what had been set out in the book for that purpose.  All that had been necessary was to hurt those that the ranger loved and she used up the last of her strength to save them.  Foolishness.<br>
<br>
        He would spend the time remaining before The Ritual seducing her with the satisfactions of Hate, weaning her from the last of the weakness that Tunare fostered in her children.  Then, once that they were both passed that last moment of vulunerbilty, she would be a most appropriate symbol of His power.  Who better to destroy the works of Tunare than one who had learned to protect their weaknesses?  <br>
<br>
        A solitary ranger, in the center of bloodstained circle of stone blurred into a black wolf, and loped toward the city of Neriak.  <br>
<br>
