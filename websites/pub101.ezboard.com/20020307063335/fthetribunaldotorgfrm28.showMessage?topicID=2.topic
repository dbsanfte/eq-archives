Let me tell you a few things about it. Some of the coolest things that I have ever heard of PvP encounters are rogue stories. And to be honest, I think it is only in a PvP environment, that a rogue can be roleplayed to their fullest extent. OK... <br><br>It is a huge challenge. Being melee in PvP is hard enough, but of all the meleer's, the rogue has it the worst. Warriors have so many hitpoints that it takes forever to kill them, plus they have extra MR. Rangers have snare (and root) so they can snare their assailant to escape, or snare their prey to stop it from escaping. Shadowknights, ditto. Even monks are better off, as they can kamikaze into a crowd of mobs and FD -- a last ditch effort, of course. So, it is hard, but you DO earn people's respect, if you play well. <br><br>Once, I scared off a halfling druid from Freeport. She conned red to me, and even a blue conning druid could easily kill me if they knew what they were doing. I basically bluffed, threatened and intimidated her, and finally ran her off with a single blow: a backstab while she was sitting down. BS lands for 100% if the target sits down, and I think she didn't realize that this was a BS, she thought it was a normal hit, and it was enough to convince her to run. <br><br>Now, nothing I ever did could compare to the legendary halfling rogue Wiggo Sneakypants. This guy is awesome. He'd work his faction up with Neriak, until he could actually enter the city, and kill tier'dals in their own city... Talk about sneaky pecks... Mr. Sneakypants has actually managed to kill dark elves in the Neriak bank. <br><br>I ran into Wiggo in the east commonlands once. &quot;Haargh ye filthy ditch-digger, drop yer coins on 't ground and bugger off back to Rivervale with ye, mabbe I'll let ye live!&quot; I shouted. I knew it was a suicidal thing to do, Wiggo was a red con to me (there is an 8 lvl difference, max -- if you are 9 lvls above or below,you cannot fight each others), and he is exceptionally experienced. But as a proud Shank I can't just let dirty, furry footed pecks roam around at will! <br><br>I snuck/hid and approached him. He shouted back &quot;Aack pppplease don't kill me mister Shank /shiver!&quot; <br><br>When I was right behind him, I said, &quot;yer coins, on 't ground peck, NOW!&quot; and he giggled and asked me to show myself. So I landed a good solid backstab, and OFF we were! <br><br>I'd laced my dagger with some Muscle Lock poison (root/dot), and desperately tried to circle-strafe around him to land some backstabs, but he was too fast. The fight was brutal, and loopsided. Being a barbarian, you are so tall, it's damn hard to see a little halfling, and as soon as my poison wore off, the little swine was zooming in and out, jousting me, landing backstabs in passing, making me feel like a big clumsy barbarian idiot. He was laughing it up all the while, complete peck roleplay. I was outclassed, outmatched, and started my retreat. <br><br>I'm not really a very good PvP player, to be honest. But I've gotten quite good at escape. Against a meleer, I will run around a tree, sneak, hide, and then STRAFE away. My foe still has me in their target window, but they have to be in melee range to hit me, so they have little chance of locating me. However, if they use a range weapon, they can still hit me -- in fact, you can see the missile change direction in mid air. I can still get away from this, especially in spot with my trees, like the commonlands, strafing invisible from one tree to the next. But against Wiggo, I was still losing. I pulled out all the little tricks I knew, tried to outwit him in every possible way, but no go. I ran into a hut, and hid behind a vendor, so that he wouldn't dare to use a range weapon and aggro the vendor, but he predicted it, and just walked up and use melee instead. I ran around a hut, clicked to open the door, but didn't enter, and jumped around a tree instead -- that was the closest I got to losing him, but he found me again immediately. <br><br>I just barely made it to the zoneline and into West Commonlands... I lucked out, and zoned over faster, and manage to hide. He no longer had me in his target window, so I was safe. But I didn't move. Bad mistake. Wiggo said he was gonna give me his money like I had demanded, please were are you Sgean? <br><br>Oh NO!<br><br>Up comes the trade window, with a bunch of bronze and silver coins <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  AAAGH SNEAKY PECK!!! HAhahahaha! But then, a poison potion was placed in the window, and he pressed TRADE. <br><br>Now, that was pure CLASS. Some griefers will try to give you coins, so as to bring up the trade window in a middle of a fight. This is an exploit. Doing it, to find an invisible foe, is a totally different thing -- nobody does that kinda stuff. It isn't an exploit. And dying to a worthy foe such as Wiggo is never a bad thing (I have done since, of course, heheh). But he let me live -- which for a Shank is of course a humiliating thing anyway. <br><br>Wiggo Sneakypants is a member of the rogue-only guild Order of the Black Rose on Vallon Zek. This guild is a truly great, and old institution on that server. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ushadowcloaked.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowcloaked</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 10:00:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hahah u sux0r</span><hr size=1> well ok i'm a rogue i come to claim MY board back  naughty chanter get lost =P   sounds like a heck of a fight wish i coulda seen it <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umildaene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mildaene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.multimania.com/mildaene/whiterose2.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/01 1:34:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/mildaene/rose.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hahah u sux0r</span><hr size=1> Heh yup, there are many ways to detect invisible foes without see invis.<br><br>The most basic one is to use an emote (/poke &lt;name&gt;), the emote will only work if they're close enough. <br>Then it's just a matter of movin around a bit until ya bump into something invisible, and hand them a copper coin to target (the coin trick also works with invisible mobs when ya know where they are btw).<br><br>Also, hide now clears your enemy's target box unless they have see invis, which gives even more of an edge to rogues in PvP (good old backstab, attack, stop attackin, escape, hide method - that will scare most people :) ).<br><br>But I agree PvP is quite a rush (heh I will have a Shank too... well when she finally manages to get on at the same time as an officer that is :) ), as long as both opponents understand it's all fer the fun (griefers=bad), and nobody's play time is hampered (corpse campers = bad).<br><br>Mildaene, White Rose of Kelethin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ualajan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alajan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/01 7:34:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hahah u sux0r</span><hr size=1> We are ALWAYS here, whether or not we wish you to see us is of consequence. /grin<br><br>A few things to know if you go a' Roguing:<br><br>1&gt; Learn how to charm damnit!
