<br>
&quot;DV would loot the first item. SI would loot the second item. DV would loot the third item. SI would loot the fourth item if there was one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Call me crazy, but isn't that deal a little one sided? That has DV not only looting 2 items, but also getting first pick. What guildleader in their right mind would agree to that deal? That reason alone would make me beleive that Rynnia's interpretation of the deal (whichever guild got two loots didn't get first pick) is a little more accurate, and one that both leaders would actually agree to. <br>
<br>
Now the negotiating thing is another issue. Personally I think pulling out a 4th seperate item to work into the deal is a little... reminiscent of a greasy car salesman. CT had already died, the loot that dropped was known to both guilds, and an agreement had been reached. You rolled a die to decide the loot order; why was it neccesary to change that later? Throwing another variable into the equation while not incorrect or.. neccesarily unethical can still be confusing, especially when the person initially negotiating with Rynnia, couldn't continue half way and had to have someone else take over. When that happens it's easier to slide additional deals into the mix. <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, you trusted Greyman to adhere to the original deal and he didn't. Rynnia couldn't have just &quot;changed&quot; the terms of the deal without Greyman accepting this change. You told Greyman to stick with the agreement you originally worked out, but when Rynnia proposed the alternative deal, he accepted it. If he didn't know what the original deal was, that's your own fault for not divulging more details. Weren't their other officers on at the time, or was Poda the *only* person in DV to know the exact specifics of the original deal. How could Greyman not know that the swiftblade was worked into the deal and not part of the original? After all, both guild leaders did a roll to decide the original looting order, which im sure all the members from both guilds in fear at the time were witnessed to. So if the swiftblade was used in negotiating to switch the looting order, (which was initially decided on by die rolling) that right there is enough to know that it couldn't have possibly been what was first worked out; and subsequently a new deal which Grey was aware of, yet still accepted the terms of.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the CT loot should have been handled irrespective of other loot and there shouldn't have been any additional deals worked in. Rynnia didn't really do anything wrong, he was just a little... slimey.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162713" target="_blank"><b>Sage Croneus Titanis</b></a><Br>

You are right. Podamen was the one who showed that there was no deal for secrecy. I guess Mulberry actually assumed that you guys who were crying about disclosure actually knew what you were talking about.<br>
<br>
As far as I am concerned DV is a shit guild. You guys not only defend ninjalooting &amp; happily allow ninjalooting whores to stay in your guild, but you throw rocks at people who for some reason get upset about ninjalooters.<br>
<br>
What has Mulberry done to you? I will tell you, she has exposed the truth of one of your members. Instead of facing the truth and the little whore in your guild, you attack Mulberry for exposing it to everyone. I like your style, fuck the truth, lets argue the ethics of releasing it.<br>
<br>
Good luck with that guild of yours. It has fine excellent qualities. You should put out a flyier that says, &quot;Come to our wonderful guild. If you ninjaloot or scam or steal, we will defend you and attack the people who are hurt by your actions.&quot;<br>

Maybe I should just change the title of the POMS list to DV's Recruitment List. <p><BR>

<br>
I didn't tell him what the deal was Rynnia had proposed.  Silly me, I didn't expect Rynnia to change it as soon as I left.<br>
<br>
For those of you that weren't paying attention I'll say it again...<br>
<br>
The original deal offered by SI was relatively one sided... but why not since we had just spent the time clearing fear.  They were concerned that if I we tried CT solo and failed by the time we were finished they wouldn't have enough people left on to kill him (it was late at night and they were down to 30 people, I guess some were ready to log fairly soon).  At least that's the way it was expressed to me. <br>
<br>
The deal was DV gets first loot, SI gets second, DV third and so on.  There was no ambiguity about it.  <br>
<br>
I accepted the deal but due to some connection issues had to leave the raid.  I told Greyman we had made a deal with SI, I told Rynnia Grey was taking over me.<br>
<br>
The final deal was also fair, and nowhere here or elsewhere have I said otherwise.  But is still is NOT the deal that was offered and accepted.  <br>
<br>
None of which matters to most of the people reading here since it was between SI and DV alone and would have stayed that way if Rynnia hadn't brought it up.  Why Rynnia chose to bring it to the flame boards when DV had let it drop is beyond me but there you have it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Custom title</span><br>  Posts: 986<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 10:08:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> Wasn't slimey.<br>

I asked if DV would prefer getting first pick of items in turn for trading a SoZ.  I didn't try to slide it in, and I was quite clear that I was offering a swap.  If DV did not find this favorable then we'd just go with how the roll turned out.<br>
<br>
It worked out in SI's disadvantage, anyways, as the main item we were interested in was the choker by far.  The brain and robe were a distant second and third (according to members present, time / loot ratios, and interest in the three items). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhealzzyoilz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HealzzYoilz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 11:11:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> Ladida,<br>

My cleric's name is Healzz Yoilz.  You have never met me in game to my knowledge.  I wear a DV tag plz add me to you PoMS list.  I truely beleive what you do here is of value in pointing out true scammers and crappy players.  I have played this game since the release of Kunark with limited success.  Then i joined the group of excellent people that make up Dark Virtue.  I really think you maybe frustrated with what might seem like the stupid defense of a ninjalooter.  I think that the DV people that have been responding here are only doing so because our guild has such a Family feel to it.   I have NO knowledge of the validity of anyone's story here.  Nor am i here to defend/persecute any particular individual.  But mass labeling of all DV as PoMS is absolutely ABSURD.  I think you may crossed the line in anger. <br>
<br>
<br>
So add me to your list please.  Because i'll not be changing my guild tag.  But in doing so you will reduce your list to MEANINGLESS SLANDER. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=325470">Healzz</a>

Yes Rynnia I know the deal backfired for SI.  Everyone present in both guilds wanted the same item.  My personal belief is that you originaly offered the lopsided deal to me because the choker was the only item SI cared about and you mistakenly believed we wouldn't take it as first pick.  Regardless of the final deal, it's not the deal you offered and I accepted.  You haven't denied that, and you cant deny it because you know it's true.  The final deal may well be fair, but it doesn't change the fact that you made a deal and then broke it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umulberry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mulberry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 12:39:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ok... so was there a deal or wasn't there a deal you bi-polar turd? <br>

Yes, I certainly did think there was a deal. Why?<br>
<br>
1) Chutoi became extremely upset when I told him I was going to post about the Poladara incident. Why would he be upset unless a deal was made not to post such a thing? <br>
<br>
2) Podaman himself requested the FT3 boots back because we had 'broken the arrangement'. This was during the meeting in chat with Chutoi, myself, Poda and Poladara.<br>
<br>
If there was never a deal to begin with, what was all the freaking fuss about posting her in the first place? Certainly ninjalooters are POMS. If there was never a deal to disclose this fact, why get all shitty when it comes to light?<br>

Ladida didnt say the PoMS list should be the list of DV`s roaster, he said:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Maybe I should just change the title of the POMS list to DV's Recruitment List.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Can you grasp it?<br>
This means : not all DV members are PoMS material (i dont believe anyone said such thing), but since DV members protect, support and keep PoMS material people (ninjalooters) in their guild roaster, then the PoMS list could be their recruitment list since you guys have no problem to raid and group with the scum of this server and actually not only protect them, but will attack and try to push to silence whoever will be scammed/stolen by them.<br>

<br>
Easy answer... both he and I thought there was a deal.  Apparently you did too since you claim to have broken the deal.  So did Aric since he immediately agreed to give back the boots.  So did Chutoi since he was furious that you posted this and immediately agreed the boots should be returned.  <br>
<br>
Face it, there was a deal, you knew it, you chose to break it, and all the wiggling in the world won't change that.<br>
<br>
That's 2 deals between DV and SI that SI has broken.  I don't care how &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;good&quot; you think the deals were in retrospect.  If you break a deal, the fact that the deal was a bad one is no defense.  Either think things out more carefully before making the deal or learn to live with the consequences of the deal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulejinabloodbath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lejina Bloodbath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>JKENDKAL:DILLAAAIZMAS</span><br>  Posts: 501<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 1:14:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.infinit.net/kerosene/Lejina120.JPG height=200 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> So let me put this straight Podaman.<br>

All else is fact.<br>
<br>
1) Poladara loots (ninjas) two red dragon scales off of an SI killed Ragefire<br>
<br>
2)  She gives the scales to Panolas (since gms usually don't bother tracking items past one owner)<br>
<br>
3)  Panolas sells the scales (since once an item is sold, gms usually tell you you're SOL)<br>
<br>
4)  During this time period, Pola gets in touch with Chutoi.<br>
<br>
5)  Pola goes on vacation<br>
<br>
6)  Chutoi and Podaman get in touch with each other.<br>
<br>
7)  Poladara is either removed or is flagged to be removed from DV  (for ninjaing)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Someone coughs up FT3 boots to SI.  Poladara is either reinvited to the guild or is removed from &quot;Deguild her next time you see her on&quot;<br>
<br>
9)  Mulberry posts about Poladara ninjaing scales.<br>
<br>
10)  Podaman is pissed that this incident became public and demands the boots back with two scales that he somehow came into the possession of.  He also tries to make Mulberry look bad for bringing this incident to the attention of the flameboard.<br>
<br>
Poda, you were going to remove her for, if not ninjalooting, shall we say 'protracted possession and distribution of an item not acquired through approved means.'  You don't remove people from the guild for accidents that are taken care of in a proper manner.<br>
<br>
Something similar happened in the past.  If I remember right, Alexandr did something that one of the guilds he was in provided compensation for, to keep the guild's good name.  Except... they booted Alexandr.  By providing the compensation, you kept Dark Virtue's name clean on the ninjalooting account.<br>
<br>
Poladara's personal reputation is another matter entirely.  She *did* acquire the scales, which she had no right to have in the first place.  She did *not* return them to the guild to which they 'belonged'.  She provided compensation for the scales, not the scales themselves - Panolas sold those.  Isn't Panolas in Dark Virtue?  Why aren't you blaming him for selling the scales?  Hell, you're blaming anyone except Poladara.  Mulberry is a bitch for telling people she took the scales.  Rynnia is a bitch for working for the best deal for his guild.  Ladida is a bitch for still saying she's a ninjalooter. But not Poladara.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, boys and girls.  Here's a bedtime story for you.<br>
<br>
Meet little Poladara.  Poladara is an angel who is being wronged because she was accidentally forced to loot two (not one, two, GM confirmed) scales off a dragon by the evil lag demon, said dragon having been slain by King Rynnia and his loyal band of SI-ians.  She didst then giveth them to an evil troll..er, halfelf, named Panolas who with a gleeful cackle sold them off and used the money for...er....what happened to that money anyway?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, she came back, and her great uncle Podaman didst cometh uppeth to her and didst sayeth, &quot;The people of the land have decided that you were an evil person, and we no longer want you as part of our family.&quot;  Upon hearing this, she pointed to the evil troll Panolas, whereupon Podaman didst take his sword and um....er....what happened to Panolas?<br>
<br>
Anyway, he didst telleth her this, and she didst weepeth mightily, and went and sold her virtue on the street corners at night, and washed dishes during the day, to make enough money to pay for magical slippers, that she might appease her mighty uncle Podaman, and the evil King Rynnia.  Upon seeing this mighty gift, uncle Podaman didst relent, and allowethed her to remain among his most loyal nobles.  &quot;Ho, Loyal Sir Chutoi, I do bringeth a gift!  Nay, not some scruffy dragon scales, but magical slippers of the highest quality!  No, no garters and stockings come with them.  Canst we husheth this up?  My neice is mightily begreived by the fact that she didst um...er...getteth caughtethed, yea, and verily!'  And they didst agree that the slippers were indeed fitting and sexy, and wouldst be fair replacement for the dragon scales that the lag demon didst maketh poor Poladara loot, and give to the evil tro-er, half elf, who didst betray her and selleth the scales.<br>
<br>
But during all this time, a knight of the SI-ians had been spreading word of a foul theft of dragon scales by poor Poladara, which, while it was the truth, was not the truth, at least, not the truth which uncle Podaman wanted to see postethed.  And he didst wax wroth, and spew many invectives and language for which there doth not exist pidgin Olde Englishe equivalents, and he didst bite his thumb at any who didst point at his neice and sayeth, &quot;There she goes.  She is the one who took the scales from the dragon Brave King Rynnia didst slayeth with his SI-ians,&quot; even though it was the truth, for it was not the truth as uncle Podaman saw it, since indeed he had given a bribe...er, a fitting recompense to King Rynnia.  And he didst demandeth the return of the hush money...er, gift, since he didst magically go out and slayed two dragons and skin them with his teeth.  For had she not returned the scales?  Ergo, she therefore didst not looteth the dragon scales, and all of this saga didst therefore not exist.  And he didst wax wroth upon Mulberry, the knight who wast spreadingeth word of the foul deed; and upon the court chronicler Ladida the Short, for not listening to his bellows, and upon evil King Rynnia himself, for wrongs long in the past, that people didst know that Poladara hadst been made to loot the evil scales of the dragon, and he didst take his niece Poladara under his wing and return to his manor, while whipping any peasant who didst point at Poladara and sayeth, &quot;She is the one who looted the scales.'  And whilst whipping his peasants, he would shouteth at the toppe of his voice, &quot;SHE DID NOT!  She gave the scales back!&quot; To which the peasant who wert being whippeth would reply, &quot;But she did still taketh the scales.'  And uncle Podaman wouldst whippeth the peasant all the harder, until the peasant didst agree with him.  And he didst go on like this, until the King's tax collectors caught him using royal moneys for female escorts in the wee hours of the morning, and didst throw him in a dungeon for the rest of his life.<br>
