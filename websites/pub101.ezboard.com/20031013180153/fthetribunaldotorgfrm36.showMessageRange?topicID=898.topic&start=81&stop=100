Resolution 1441 and several previous resolutions placed the burden of proof on Iraq.  The UN felt that their burden of proof had already been met.  You are getting confused with the UN proving that Iraq has weapons NOW, to that of Iraq having had weapons in the PAST that weren't accounted for and destroyed.  They proved the later, and were demanding Iraq to show the proof, hence the burden was on Iraq.  Where does it state in any of the resolutions that the UN is required to show proof?<br>
<br>
It has been said, and is true, that the UN inspectors weren't thrown out.  They were pulled out, but only because the inspections were proving useless.  Iraq's non-compliance was just showing the inspections to be pointless.  So while they weren't thrown out, Iraq did have a hand in them being pulled out.<br>
<br>
As for my comments about the chemicals becoming inert, was based on the fact that the UN didn't care if the weapons that were made 15 years ago are now inert.  They wanted proof of their destruction.  So the fact that they are inert, doesn't make the burden on Iraq to prove them to be destroyed any less.  So it was your comments that had no bearing on the UN resolution.<br>
<br>
You guys do know that there is a link to the resolution in this thread, perhaps you should read through it a time or two. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Actually that's not even close to correct Makino.  Resolution 1441 was passed specifically because Iraq had failed repeatedly to comply with previous resolutions.  There was and is still no doubt that they were far from complying with the UN resolutions, 1441 was just one of the last ones that was put together as a notice to Iraq saying, &quot;You've gone against the UN's wishes again and again, this is your last warning.

We went from being, (or at least trying to be), a benevolent giant to being a thug.  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  This has never been so glaringly true and you guys are fighting this notion because you can't accept that you are on the wrong side.<br>

And yet, people die.  From executions, to disease, to starvation, to tribal wars, to rebellion against Saddam, people were dying anyways.  It's an unalterable truth of human existence.  Don't be so naive to think that the only correct solutions in life are the ones where everyone lives and there are warm fuzzy feelings towards all humankind.

After re-reading I do sound like a hippie, but don't you guys think we would have evolved enough by now?  One would think that world peace would be a good thing for everyone and we'd all be at least trying to go there.  Who here thinks that going to war with Iraq was a step towards world peace?<br>
<br>
Who here disagrees that Bush caused more tension than he relieved?  That he made the world a more dangerous place than it was?  We have more enemies than we did before period.<br>
<br>
We're the bad guys now.  We've replaced the communists in that role.

<br>
That argument doesn't work, The fact of the matter was that The US was not alone in going to war.  Did they have the support of most of the world?  No they didn't but they DID have genuine support form more than a handful of nations.  <br>
<br>
The US 9and its supporters) went to war because of national interest.  The opposition was based on the same things.  Neither the US and its supporter OR France/Germany and THIER supporter were being altrustic in thier positions.  Both side took thier postion because it was best for THIER countries.<br>
<br>
When did it become verboten for a country to persue its national interest?  This goes for BOTH the US and France/Germany.  Why did both side find it necessary to ever admidt that they were simply persueing thier own national interests?   That is one of the major jobs OF a national government.<br>
<br>
Unlike a lot of people, I don't demonize the French or others for thier position on Iraq, no one should be required to back a US policy against thier own national interest.   By the same turn the US has to give priority to ITS national interest.  it use to be that Nations respected that.  THIS is the major flaw in the UN.  It is a platform for nations to persue thier national interest.  There is no one in the UN who is going to take action that is AGAINST thier own interest.

Does 1441 demand that Iraq directly prove it did not have weapons of mass destruction? Can you quote a US/UK leader that made such a demand of Iraq?<br>
<br>
UNMOVIC and IAEA were supposed to verify that Iraq did not have wmd. All Iraq had to do was comply with the terms of 1441 allowing the inspectors access to do their job to the satisfaction of the UN.<br>
<br>
So the answer to the question is that Iraq could have verified it's lack of WMD by allowing unrestricted access to sights and personel under the terms of 1441. <br>
<br>
Here is something else to consider. At one point Iraq did have wmd. If they are not hidden in Iraq, they must have either been moved or destroyed. I have a hard time believing that Saddam, with his history of agression and oppression, would voluntary destroy his most potent weapons. I also find it a bit naive to assume that all his wmd broke down naturally or dissapated into thin air. If they were moved to another country, then that does not put Iraq in the clear, and I would think it justifies the war rather than discredits it. <br>

Yes, and maybe if you read the section regarding the circles part all these little theories you  re bringing up and already been proven to be unsubstatiated.  Do you really think half year old crackpot theories are going to work in this forum?  Especially when, tadah, there are no WMD.  Unless you are still trying to argue there are any.

There is proof that WMD existed, if there wasn't Resolution 1441 would never had been made.  You're getting the past and the present confused.  There is proof that WMD did exist and haven't been proven to have been destroyed.  There isn't proof that WMD currently exist.  So Resolution 1441 placed the burden on Iraq.  READ it.<br>
<br>
Like Madine was saying, Resolution 1441 isn't demanding that Iraq show they don't have WMD.  It is demanding that Iraq prove that they destroyed the WMD that they were known to have possessed, and to provide all their documentation on WMD programs that were known to have existed.  You do realize that Iraq had WMD, right? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The underlining probably wasn't the best choice since it looks pretty ugly now that I look back at that post though heh.<br>
<br>
Regardless, that quote is directly from Resolution 1441.  No selective cutting and pasting, that's pretty much the entire intro to the resolution cut and pasted as a whole.  I would think that makes it pretty clear that:<br>
-The UN put the burden of proof on Iraq. <br>
-The UN acknowledged that Iraq had never given a full and complete accounting for it's weapons programs.  <br>
-The UN acknowledged that Iraq had failed to comply with previous resolutions by &quot;repeatedly&quot; obstructing the inspections. <br>
-The UN acknowledged that Iraq had failed to comply with previous resolutions regarding Terrorism, repressing its citizens, and properly allowing humanitarian aid to reach its people.  <br>
-The UN acknowledged that the ceasefire after the first Gulf Conflict was BASED ON IRAQ fully complying with said resolutions.<br>
-The UN SAID that it was &quot;Determined to ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq without conditions or restrictions with its obligations under resolution 687 (1991) and other relevant resolutions&quot;<br>
-The UN &quot;authorized Member States to use all necessary means to uphold and implement its resolution 660 (1990) of 2 August 1990 and all relevant resolutions subsequent to Resolution 660 (1990) and to restore international peace and security in the area&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I'll grant that the last quote is loosely interpretted by me and apparently the US coalition to include military force.  Rightfully, the US should have gotten UN backing before military action occurred.  However, the UN desparately needs to show some backbone lest it become a complete and utter joke in the world arena.  When the UN puts out dozens of resolutions regarding a country and it's leaders, then puts out even more resolutions condemming the country for not complying, but still takes no action to enforce said resolutions... it's all bark with no bite.  The world leaders that need policing by the UN aren't going to listen to bark, there has to be the threat of a bite behind that bark.  <br>
<br>
It's sad that the coalition took action without the UN backing, and perhaps in time the UN would have acknowledged that it couldn't just sit around barking all day and expect anyone to take it seriously.  Further, it's deplorable that Bush would have used bad intel or simply lied to the public to rally support for this action.  The point I'm trying to make is that the UN SHOULD have taken action long ago.  Nobody is clean in this.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=361026&amp;amp;resize=true">Sciek</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&lt;Sol Invictus&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1656<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/28/03 8:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=898.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Baby George Bush Abdul Kader Faris Abed El-Hussein</span><hr size=1> Getting off the UN/1441 topic for a moment, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101031006-490596,00.html">excellent Time article here.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Goes over a lot of stuff, including  the belief of many in Iraq that Saddam himself was lied to about his various capabilities, for the purpose of personal profit.

In any event, here is a prediction - sometime during the Bush re-election campaign you will hear that the American people should not let Saddam win by voting out GW. They will make the case that voting GW out will send the message to terrorists that the American public doesn't have the stomach for this type of war or that Saddam's trick worked. Bush may not embrace this line publicly, but it will be slipped out there none-the-less.<br>
