<br>
Fuel cell technology is really, really neat stuff - and GM thinks they can bring it to mass-market within 5-7 years.  The issue isn't so much the technology anymore (they have cars on fuel cells which can go 80 MPH/130ish KPH and a range of over 120 mi/200ish km).  Its the cost of production, and the refuelling issues.<br>
<br>
For Fuel cell cars in america to really take off, there will have to be a fairly robust network of hyrdogen pumps at gas/petrol stations across our VERY vast country.  What holds back the electrics now is that they're a virtual tether to a small radius around your home.<br>
<br>
With increased investment by the government in development/production, the cost of the vehicles will eventually drop into the competitive range (nobody but a very wealthy person with a deep concern for the environment would pay $80k for a fuel-cell car the size of a Honda Civic).  Combine that with a gradual national rollout of refuelling pumps (anyone have any idea how long it took to roll Unleaded fuel out nationally?  Bit before my time, though I remember Regular fuel as a kid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and I think its one of the most exciting technologies of the early 21st century. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maxamaji>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 722<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/03 8:26:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hydrogen-powered cars</span><hr size=1> I agree totally from what I've seen of it, but I honestly haven't read up on it as much as I'd like to.

<br>
On the other hand, like you said, Mr. Fusion would be the best case scenario because then instead of having to actually wash that ever-growing pile of dirty laundry threatening to evict me from my house, I'd just stuff it in the car and drive to the beach on it lol.<br>

Since a lot of areas already have natural gas distribution networks up, setting up cracking stations would be all that is required (there is even a few companies working on home versions of this) <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

So basically, if the energy production method that extracts and compresses the H2 is still fossil fuel (or nuclear) based, this is a not a real win situation, you just moved the pollution problem out of the cities to the energy plants. <br>
<br>
That $1.2bn is also chump change for the scope of such a project... And one problem that very much remains to be solved with those cells is the corrosion problems of the containment unit. That and the fact that you basically put the driver sitting on top of a hyperpressure can that could rupture rather violently in the case of a crash... unlike cars which contrary to Hollywood's beliefs only explode very rarely.<br>
<br>
Iirc, the core of the argument was that rather than investing massively into something that doesn't really solve the pollution problem, the cash should be invested into vegetal fuels (hemp based). Technically, the idea is that the biomass harvested to produce the fuel has already scrubbed the CO2 from the atmosphere in order to store it into the &quot;vegetal fuel&quot; mollecules. A sort of closed cycle instead of an open ended one using fossil fuels. The only hitch with that is that as far as my limited chemistry goes, no vegetal product can come close to the energy combustion ratios even of crude. The other problem is the heavy metal catalysts required for that kind of combustion.<br>

<br>
Not exactly : <br>
<br>
Anode side: 2H2 =&gt; 4H+ + 4e-<br>
Cathode side: O2 + 4H+ + 4e- =&gt; 2H2O<br>
Net reaction: 2H2 + O2 =&gt; 2H2O <br>
<br>
Problem is : how do you get the H2 ? Mostly from water separation using electrical energy. So literally - you are converting energy into an elctrolytic form that can be stored and then back into work from the reverse reaction. So at the start of the process, you still have to produce that initial electrical energy somehow. That somehow is most likely going to require fossil or nuclear fuel. You just introduced a way of storing the energy in the production chain. Technically in and of itself, it's not a bad idea. In practice though it has a few significant engineering problems to overcome and it doesn't solve the pollution problem, just moves geographically. I certainly won't be complaining if the air i am breathing finally clears up a bit in the cities... but we will still need an alternative to fossil fuels. <br>

It combines rapidly (not quite explosively, but close) with just about anything providing there is a moderate heat source. The maintenance required on these cars will be beyond most people's abilities. I'm not talking about doing it yourself stuff, I mean just getting the car to a qualified mechanic to service it regularly and having the money to do it. It's hard enough for the average person to go to Jiffy Lube every 3000 miles for an oil change. Maintenance costs on these cars will be charged at a premium, so some people will skip it in an effort to save some money. So as the cars deteriorate, system will fail, people will die, and the lawsuits will be flying... perhaps enough to keep the manufactuering incentive low no matter how much money the government throws at the car companies.<br>
<br>
But even if they do thrive and replace internal combusion cars, as I hope they eventualy do, they are not zero emmision vehicles as most environuts would like you to believe, they are only alternate emmision. The emmisions will go up the stack of your local power station as energy is used to create the hydrogen (at a huge efficency loss, but there are as many losses in oil refining also, pure electric isn't as bad, but then the batteries are inefficient). Its more economical than gas only because the power suppliers have efficient generators. <br>
<br>
But since legislation lifting holds for new power plants is slower than molassas, and restrictions are extremely high, especially EPA type restrictions, and consumers exibit NIBY attitudes across the entire US, many power companies are not excited about building new plants. Instead they upgrade the old plants as best they can. These plants are old and inefficient with large emmisions not monitored as close by the EPA because they are grandfathered into enviromental legislation. It's cheaper to keep them going then to put up with EPA restrictions on new constructions even if the power made at an old style plant is not as good as what could be done by a modern plant. Eventually the power building boom of the seventies will not be able to support the demand as new loads like these cars become the standard and the plants are forced to shut down due to higher maintenance costs and mounting EPA fines. Then we will be looking at huge power crunches and skyrocketing electric bills that will have us begging for cheap gas cars again.<br>
<br>
Of course, I hope I'm wrong. But I'm not betting on it. All my extra money goes to power supplier stocks like Edison and Exelon. The future of electricy looks bleak for American consumers and great for the suppliers as costs increase (just yesterday our plant had a $65 per MW hour day. Three times what it was last year), and legislators are doing their best to hide it from you. (There's a conspiracy theory for you, Grozzer, run with it!)<br>
<br>
I don't see how hydrogen cars will help anything except lower air particulate levels in urban areas. But the lawyers will love them and so will the power suppliers. In my opinion, we need more cars like that Toyota hybrid. Hybrid internal electrics are a very good idea for these 100 mile per day commuters, that's only 2 gallons used per day, in theory anyway. Or people could be smart and live closer to work. Of course, most people live so far from work because they found a high paying job that gives them more money so they can buy that new hybrid car that gets them to work. It's a vicious cycle.<br>
<br>
Last note, one of my enviro friends had that GM electric car (forget the name) while I was in LA. It was pretty neat, nice ride and all, but a big PITA from what I hear, always in the shop. I called her a month ago and she said she traded it on an SUV. She needed the convience of a bigger car and couldn't afford owning two. Haha. It's a crazy world, someone ought to sell tickets. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 485<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/03 9:11:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hydrogen-powered cars</span><hr size=1> I was talking about natural gas, a substantial potential source of hydrogen(and easier to crack than water from what i read).

Anyway, my original post was responding to an Associated Press report that came up during the state of the union address -- I presumed it had been part of the speech (which I haven't had time to read/listen to yet). I'll investigate tomorrow when I have time, will post the story I saw.<br>

<br>
We have abundant supply of power from Hydroelectric stations. As a result we actualyl have a lot of Aluminium plants to make use of all the excess power at cheap prices.<br>
<br>
Either option would work for us well and be far better than importing oil and burning it.<br>
<br>
But if you have to pump out pollution to provide the hydrogen for fuel cell cars, then I agree, all your doing is shifting the problem from cities, out to some other place. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http:// homepages.ihug.co.nz/~carpetwax/blacksig.jpg " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 2:37:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hydrogen-powered cars</span><hr size=1> Mechanical work is *always* done by converting one form of energy(fuel) into another, and leveraging the energy released as the entropy increases for doing work.<br>
<br>
Yes, making the H2 requires energy input.  Just like it took millions of years of solar energy to make the swamps that eventually made our petroleum reserves - and if we knew how to make more Oil in a factory or plant, and could do it from entirely clean sources (say, solar power) then that's probably what we would do, and we'd have nearly limitless energy (albeit not very clean energy).<br>
<br>
Since we know how to do this, but so far it takes a few million years and millions of generations of plant and animal matter, it's hardly practical.  The next question becomes &quot;ok, what ELSE can we use to make nice, mechanical energy?&quot;  Electricity provides a wonderful method - an electric motor is highly efficient compared to an internal combustion motor (which loses phenomenal amounts of energy as heat).  But electricity is not abundant in nature.  You have to convert other forms of energy (fuel) into electricity.<br>
<br>
Today, this is commonly done with coal (blech), Natural Gas (reasonably clean but not abundant enough to fuel our planet for the next 10+ generations until science comes up with something better), and nuclear power (in which a very small amount of fuel can release vast amounts of electrical power, but with its own very serious downsides).  <br>
<br>
All a fuel cell does is basically convert some other form of energy into H2 fuel, and then inside the cell, the H2 is converted into electricity to power an electric motor in the car.  If the complaint is that the process of making the H2 ends up producing more waste than the process of refining gasoline, PLUS the byproducts of gasoline combustion, then I would agree that fuel cells are not the right answer.  HOwever, as far as I know, far less pollution is expended making an equivalent amount of &quot;mechanical work&quot; in H2 as would be expended with the same amount of work done by gasoline.  As such, a fuel cell is cleaner than an internal combustion engine.<br>
<br>
It doesn't take a WHOLE lot of energy INPUT to refine oil into gasoline - so you have to SPEND more energy up front to make H2 than you do to make Gas - but far less is WASTED on the back end (burning the fuel), so the net to the environment is still that H2 is more efficient.  If we could harness hydroelectric and solar power to make the H2 fuel in sufficient quantity, it would truly be almost free fuel.<br>
<br>
So it's more efficient, and its cleaner - that's why it's a win.  Cost of production, and many of the very valid points Arleanna made about the cost of production and maintenance of the cars, are very valid - and are the real obstacles to fuel cell cars.  The GE all-electric car he referred to was a big pile of batteries and an electric motor - a great concept but a seriously flawed execution, and not the same at all as a fuel-cell vehicle design. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grozzer>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 664<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 4:36:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hydrogen-powered cars</span><hr size=1> Found it, in the State of the Union address as I said:<br>

With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.

In your humble opinion - where is this cash prize going to go ? Which industry is most likely to have both the resources and the drive invest most heavily in alternative fuels if not the current oil / automotive industry ?<br>
<br>
Technically i would support this unexpected announcement, however, being my skeptical self, i find it hard to trust a genuine environmental concern and not look for some ulterior agenda of a far less altruistic kind. I was hoping to see mention of Nasa's plans for a manned Mars mission to pop up though, guess it's either been shelved or was a just rumor.<br>

Sounds like the concern more is passing Detroit $$$ without holding them accountable for actually PRODUCING anything; they say that instead doing immediate-term changes like funding hybrid cars, which could reduce emmissions TODAY rather than maybe reducing emissions TOMORROW.  They do touch upon the current challenges of making the H2, but the DoE link above gets into that in more detail, and THAT's what the US Gov't is really funding research into more than funding the car development. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=375.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=375.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=375.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=375.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=375.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
