I got to admit, I get the same feelings from time to time. <br>
<br>
During the few days this forum actually had more posts than the general forum, I was a little worried about the state of mind of all of us. Hell, I was one of the ring leaders too.<br>
<br>
But, I think this forum is, to many, used as Roleplaying. Seriously. In real life, I am a pretty nice &amp; considerate person. I say things like I do in the flame forum to my good RL friends in jest, and that is how I treat the flame forum. It is in jest.<br>
<br>
The people who post regularly in the forum are fun. I like them all. During the original flame forum, it was Aatlaar, Boab &amp; I flaming each other regularly. Aatlaar was one of my best friends in the game. The guy let me have his Donals BP because he felt I deserved it, even though he was ahead of me in senority. The guy was a badass &amp; a very good friend. Yet, I had no problem talking about his hot mother on a regular basis on the flame forum. It was fun.<br>
<br>
Occationally, there comes threads that are truly flames. They are full of hate. People like Hopkins &amp; Sapphonn hold grudges like no other. They hammer hard &amp; with true anger. People take it personally.<br>
<br>
I know Bowynn felt the same way about the flame forum. He saw it as a bunch of angry people saying extremely hurtful things behind the cover of anon.<br>
<br>
The truth is though, most of us are just having fun.<br>
<br>
I think this board also helps to keep the shit out of the general section. You dump it here, and people don't get upset, they just come here to respond &amp; all the crap is swept into my little home.<br>
<br>
I think that was the failing of Tala's forum. He had to do something about the posts that were angry evil flames &amp; censoring them made people upset with him &amp; he had to put up with the negative &quot;Bias Bias Bias&quot; crap.<br>
<br>
We are always gunna have flames. Best to have a place to put them. <p><B><FONT color="gold">Ladida Hohum<BR>

You can say things here with no repercussion except for possibly to your character in the game if someone who thinks any of this actually means anything wants to hold a grudge. You can say what you really think, you can burn someone you don't even know to get a rise out of them, or you can fuck with your friends. Some people enjoy that, myself included. Like was said before, even if someone really is pissed off, better to have a place for them to be really pissed off than amongst the people who's idea of good times is a little more mellow. It's like an institution. <br>
<br>
And as far as anon posting goes, I think it's lame too, but c'mon. Like it or not we're all anon here. There's only 5 people on this server that know me IRL. If I wanted I could log on and hit delete on Max or Giull and PL another char up to 50something in a pretty short amount of time noone would ever be the wiser that it was me. Not that I or most ppl would waste the effort it would take to do that, but its always an option. This game and this board has a transience all it's own.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Ahem*<br>
<br>
What I'm really trying to say is if some whiny little ass doesn't like it here, then STFU and go sleep in your mommy and daddy's bed tonight. Maybe you'll fell better about it then.<br>

We had a flame board and I personally enjoyed getting schooled or dishing it out - then it was erased, who I still believe to this day by that man slut Talamay somehow<br>
That old board was biased, where here its shown that anyone who has an opinion with an IQ from a low 14 to a godly 65 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  can post free...<br>

<br>
I have always read the flame board because it's great amusement for me and I try to stay out of it other than to look but I had always thought &quot;holy shit, are these people really like this in game.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was apprehensive when I first met some of the people from this board but I learned something: ranting and flaming here helps to keep it out of the game. Doesn't keep it all out of the game but it certainly helps. Most of these people are comepletely different than this in game, and if it helps to get your anger and frustration off your chest or to yell and scream and flame someone then let it be here. <br>

anyone that takes the flame forum seriously needs to take two steps back, lower their head and run into a wall.  maybe that'll knock some sense into them.<br>
sometimes things get out of hand, but by doing it here, we keep it OUT of the game so that none of that stupid ass /petition and /report shit happens.<br>
I know I don't plan on ever getting a warning or banned cuz I swore at someone over losing an epic mob. <p><br><center>
