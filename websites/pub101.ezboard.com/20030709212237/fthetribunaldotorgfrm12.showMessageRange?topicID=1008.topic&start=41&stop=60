The Knights of the Tribunal seem very stable, probably due to mostly older players? Your perspective might be guided by your own fortunes in belonging to such a guild.  Guild burnouts happen more often than you would think.  A lot of guilds come to mind, Power of War is a prime example.<br>
<br>
I am surprised by all of the comments supporting someone who decides to leave their own guild, when it is my opinion that more often than not it is a case of their own guild dissolving from beneath them that guides them to other places.  A few members joined Knights of the Tribunal from Power of War as it went through its death-throes, and I assure you they didn't leave using bronze armor and orc picks!<br>

They put in the time, helped their guild and now reaped some benefits. They are no more less deserving of that item if they leave. The only thing i do that might come up is like an item that can help the guild as a whole. For example the cleric epic, smaller guild gets a cleric their epic. Like Zergendary raids... where 50 peepz die each fire beetle pull. It benefits the guild as well as the person with the epic. Now if that cleric leaves it does hurt the guild a bit since they just lost that epic. But, did the person deserve the item in the first place? Most likely, or they wouldnt have gone out of their way to help that person to complete it. I see both sides here but in the end believe almost everyone deserves the lewtz awarded to them. Those that dont, aka Sorrowsong, get flamed here for being fucktard cuntslops. <br>

Most uber guilds are, first are foremost, about &quot;beating&quot; the game. Some people are interseted in this, some are not. VI has made it that in order to do this you need a large number of people all willing and able to spend many, many hours, often in a row, often dying alot, to learn and finally kill the end game mobs. Having players with good connections is as much an important part of being successful as an uber guild as any other thing. You cannot win against these things if your tanks, clerics, debuffers etc are going LD in the middle of every fight.<br>
<br>
Bards are a particularly good example, because lag directly affects their ability to twist songs (or so I gather - im the possibly the least knowledgable person about bards there is =).<br>
<br>
If you *really* have a bone to pick about it, blame Verant, not the uber guilds. The uber guilds are simply doing what is necessary to succeed in the environment VI has created.<br>

        I made bold what I would like to discuss. Are you a moron or just a product of your mother fucking her brother? Of course we dont want anyone who cannot help us kill ubermob_00. Why would we want you in the guild then? Hey lets get that guy, he wont help us kill anything, but we really need him in the guild. <br>
<br>
         It equates to not contributing.  You get out of the guild what you put in. The more you put in, the more you get out of it. The more people in the guild help us kill ubermob_00, the more and more they will get ubermob loot. OMG what a concept.<br>
<br>
         I am so sorry you are stuck in the mentality that you believe that uber guilds are for friends to get together and chat about issues of the day. Uber guilds or end game guilds are focused on killing shit, and if you cannot help us kill shit, why would we want you with us? That only shows that you arent of the same mindset we are. We dont log on to all emote hugs to each other, we log on to take down mobs and if you arent helping we dont need ya around.<br>
<br>
        At level 60 people get really bored doing the same exp camps over and over, so they want to kill mobs. That is what end game guilds are all about. We kill mobs and do quests, to get further ahead, so we can kill more mobs to do more quests, to get further ahead and kill more mobs and do even more quests.....<br>
<br>
      Also dont kid yourself, you arent in an uber guild not of your own choosing, you arent good enough to commit the time and energy needed to it, you are lazy and weak and probably one of the first people to bitch how hard loot is to get. You most likely blame the uber guilds for yer lack of items, when in fact its your own fault, your own laziness that made you suck so bad and you are just mad. Dont be a player hater just because you are too lazy to be a player. If you actually put in the time some members of uber guilds do you might find that the rewards come your way. <br>
<br>
     Yes EQ is a job when ya get to the end game, when ya get to it, ya might see what I am talking about. People log in at a certain time, usually coined raid time, like work, we gather, we do our job, and if we do it well, we get paid in forms of loot and the thrill of the kill. You have to put in time to get rewards and from your pathetic loser response, its pretty obivious you arent ever gonna be part of the end game or see it, so please go back to camping Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes if you are even the level to do that. <p><center><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/RFthunderkickfinal2.gif><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92681>

he was not saying that not playing is bad     we all now RL comes first<br>
<br>
<br>
he was saying in essence<br>
<br>
that ppl in uber guilds do play alot and get rewarded<br>
<br>
if you cant play as much as they do  or chose to not play as much as they do, then of course you will not end up with the same rewards or fat loot<br>

Being in an Uber guild isn't about hanging with your friends, it's about killing shit, and you can't kill shit if you're LD.  Worse than that, you are taking up a spot from someone who has a good connection and can contribute. <br>
  For big fun, group up with a cleric with a bad connection, nothing like seeing your groups only healer go LD on every boss mob pull, leaving the ranger (me) scrambling to keep people alive with his lame ass spam heal.  <br>
  When you join an Uber guild, it is under the assumption that you can do your job, that means knowing how to play your class, being able to follow instructions, going to raids, and not going LD.  If you can't do these things, don't join.  <br>

man arleanna wtf??? you havent updated your requirements yet...<br>
<br>
&quot;Please bring us at least two of the following items from your previous guild: <br>
<br>
Manarobe, Lodizal crap, Trak BP  or 4 of the top members from your prior guild. ESPECIALLY if they are ROG, WIZ, CLR.  All of the above can be foregone by bringing us l33t strats for super sekrit missions.&quot;<br>

Woot maybe I can have such a life that I can troll on flameboards all day long like you one day Ladmo<br>
<br>
We all have lives you moronic troll, but you missed what I was saying which was, if you dont commit the time you aint gonna reap the rewards, so dont bitch about it if you are too lazy to commit the time neccesary to get the payoffs. The more you put into something the more you get out of it. It might be a forgein concept for you Ladmo, but most people understand this simple notion. Yes its a video game, but like most other things, the more time spend working on something, the better it will become. <br>
<br>
Apparently you are good enough to commit yer time to the message boards, perhaps you need a life you fat fuck, or maybe a job that doesnt involve you sitting on yer knees in front of businessmen in urinals getting them off, and stop calling your calloused hand your &quot;girlfriend&quot;, and your other hand &quot;her very open minded sister.&quot; Please dont talk to me about having no life when yourself have such a shitty one trolling the boards in hopes someone will notice you because apparently no one notices you in real life anymore.<br>
