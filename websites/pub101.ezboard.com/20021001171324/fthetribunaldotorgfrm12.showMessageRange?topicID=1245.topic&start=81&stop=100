<br>
30 DV = 15 Bog Bridgade<br>
15 Bog Brigade = 5 Anklebiter's United<br>
5 Anklebiter's United = 2 SI<br>
<br>
So, that's exactly 30 DV for every 2 SI. If my calculations are correct, despite DV having 30 characters (approximately 120 truncated limbs excluding toes, fingers etc...) in the wee hours of the chinese new year during the year of the yak, they did not indeed come close to the amount of power SI had present in fear at the time. Assuming that SI had the 30 people they claimed and using some simple math calculations, DV had only 1/15 total of SI's net power present. If all of the above is true, Podaman and his merry band of followers would truly not have been able to control and slay a powerful god like cazic-thule. In case you didn't know, the little drakes in WTOV don't count as dragon encounters, they won't give you much practice for the real world Podaman. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157701>Sensei Morannon McJohnson</a></center><br>

wait wrong defense, errr<br>
<br>
I am not the one to point the finger to! I did nothing wrong besides be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>
<br>
I am tired of Podaman trying to place blame on me and saying that &quot;if you want to nail someone to the wall, you should nail panolas.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here is what the GMs told me....<br>
(note- dont have logs so i will just summarize)<br>
<br>
first night a gm sends me a tell at around 4am<br>
&quot;yo dawg, wassup. mind if i ask you a question?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uhh...sure.&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you have two red dragon scales, fewl?&quot; GM asks<br>
&quot;I only have one, the other one was passed to a twink.&quot; I say.<br>
&quot;Oh, I'm just warning you that they might be stolen. Later dude!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, so i heard that and went to sleep that night. The next day I log on and try to sell the scale (i was still trying to sell because the gm never confirmed that it was stolen.)  I look in my inventory a little later and realize the scale is gone? How did it go missing? I'm not quite sure. Then a GM sends me a tell.......<br>
&quot;Wasssssssssssssssssssssu!&quot;<br>
&quot;hey&quot; I reply.<br>
&quot;why were you trying to sell the scales?&quot;<br>
&quot;cause someone asked me to.&quot; i say<br>
&quot;ok thanks, stay cool freak.&quot; the gm says.<br>
<br>
Ok, getting to the point of my post......<br>
Podaman should shut his fuckin mouth before someone sticks a dick in it.<br>

Panolas, how did you get the 2 scales? Did she sell them to you or did she give them to you and ask you to sell them for you.<br>
<br>
You do realize that she is saying that she gave &quot;a&quot; scale to you to give back to SI and then you went all dishonest and sold it off instead of doing her the favor. Of course, she has proven to everyone but her guild that she is a lying sack of dog shit, so she lacks credibility.<br>
<br>
So I am wondering, what all happened with her man? What all did she say? I am pretty fucking curious considering others have said how you were somewhat evasive about the scales. <p><BR>

Nobody has yet made the claim that the above wouldn't have happened.  Chances are we would have lost.  It was our first time fighting CT and a number of us were having connection issues.  We have neither the gear nor the experience that SI has.  Didn't then, don't now, and still won't next week.<br>
<br>
SI &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DV.  Duh.<br>
<br>
What Rynnia told me at the time was that she was worried that if DV tried on our own, by the time we were done SI would no longer have enough manpower on to kill CT.  There was never any question as to whether or not SI could have done it solo at the time, only if they would still be able to should we try on our own and fail.  It was late at night and I guess several of the people there were anxious to get to bed.<br>
<br>
So she offered a deal.  The deal she offered was generous to DV.  We would get 2 loots from CT, and first choice.  SI would get 1 or 2 loots depending on how many total dropped.  While being a bit on the generous side it also struck me as reasonable since DV had just finished clearing Fear and there was always the chance we would win.  Nevertheless I thought it was a generous deal and accepted it because if we tried on our own and failed we also would have had significantly fewer people willing to stick around for another try and the deal was more than good enough to accept.<br>
<br>
So you see, nobody is claiming that DV is as good as SI here... <br>
<br>
After the kill, Rynnia changed the terms of the deal to something that was far more favorable to SI than the original deal had been.  Yup, I was pretty angry about it when I found out about it but other than grumbling to Rynnia and a few other SI friends about it, I had pretty much shrugged it off.  It came up again in my conversation with Aric the other day.  However until Rynnia posted here, it was a private matter between two guilds.  DV didn't flame SI for it then, but since you brought it up... /shrug.  Yes, you made a deal and yes you broke the deal.  Any more questions? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 7:18:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> It seems pretty simple.<br>
<br>
Podaman has invested a lot of time and pride into defending Poladara and trying to make a case that she did nothing wrong, or if she did it was an innocent mistake.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the facts that have been presented tell otherwise.  So now, instead of admitting that he may be wrong, he's going on the attack, and attempting to create diversions from the topic at hand, while still maintaining that he is right and Poladara is the victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time (and clicking on the wrong corpse, and looting the wrong items, and wrongly handing them off to be sold, and then wrongly trying to keep it all hush hush).<br>

personally, i think pola is an idiot. erm.. if i see a guild raiding, and a mob die, i am NOWHERE near the damn corpse, and i certainly wouldnt check the body. its her mistake totally. and.. im infuriated as a person that she doesnt place guild reputation over the comfyness of staying in DV. in her position i would force myself to leave, no matter the pain it would cause me. but of course.. i wouldnt be stupid enough to get myself into this particular position. its her responsibility. if she had looted and not tried to fix it at all, i guarentee she would have been guildremoved instantly. but she did not. she tried to fix it. and that is where the ole second chance thing comes in.<br>
<br>
guild = all. you guys can scream bloody murder all you want.. i dont really care what you say, i care about how this effects people in my guild. and the fact they get upset. if there was a way to make everything perfect again id do it in a second, but its human nature to bitch and complain... and theres no way to fix this. not since it was brought to the flameboard *poke mulberry*<br>

<br>
No deal was actually completed.  Yes, the above was offered, but was never set in stone.  You never agreed to anything.  You said you had to think about it, you said it sounded fair, and then shortly thereafter, after going LD, you said you could not hold connection and greyman was going to take over speaking with me.<br>
<br>
When you went ld and left, and several of your raid force left, the chance you had to take down Cazic was reduced from a small percentage to a flat 0.<br>
<br>
As far as my people went, we had approximately 32 people there, and a good spread of classes similar to the spread of classes we had when we killed CT the other night with 34.<br>
<br>
Therefore when I spoke with greyman I certainly did alter the original &quot;propsed&quot; deal, and I asked him if such an agreement were acceptable.<br>
<br>
SI / DV roll.   Highest gets 2 items and lowest gets 1 item but gets first pick.<br>
<br>
He said that would be more than fair as far as DV was concerned, because without SI present DV wouldnt be getting any items.<br>
<br>
<br>
CT had not even been engaged yet.<br>
<br>

After CT died and the roll happened the trade for the SBOZ was made.   This was not forced.

<br>
It was offered and I accepted.  That constitutes a deal in my book.  The fact that you changed it after I told Grey to accept the deal settles it in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Glad to hear you finaly admit that that was the deal in place when my connection crapped out.<br>
<br>
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Poladara fucked up, and fucked up bad.  She's sad as much.  She said it to me, she said it to Mublerry and Chutoi.  She apologized and attempted to make ammends.  I respect that and in my eyes she's learned her lesson and paid the price (incidentaly, I'm holding on to the boots until she repays the guild for the red scales I gave SI out of the guild bank).  On the other hand, Mulberry and Rynnia both admit to renegging on deals and are totaly unremorseful about it. <br>
<br>
I'll take Poladara in my guild over either of those two any day of the week and twice on sunday.  <br>
<br>
DV and SI made a deal.  SI renegged on the deal.  DV and SI made another deal.  SI renegged again.<br>
<br>
Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  There won't be a third time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 2302<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/24/02 8:44:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1245.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ladida5000.homestead.com/files/ladidadwarf3.jpg height=147 width=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> So what do you guys boot members out for?

<br>
I understand all about family and unity and loyalty. I was in a guild at one time. I have also stepped to the defense of friends and guildmates. Even at times when I was not in total agreement with them.<br>
<br>
But I have never defended scamming or stealing or ninjalooting. In fact, I remember blasting a fucker in our guild named Jama who fucking scammed this one guy &amp; lied his ass off to. Our wizard captain rode his ass as well and the dude who got scammed got his crap back. Nobody backed Jama. Nobody.<br>
<br>
But you guys are not just defending this ninjalooting whore. You are fucking blasting the people she stole from. To me that is just brilliant. What a wonderful guild. <p><BR>

Looting two things off someone elses dragon kill is NOT an &quot;accident&quot; in the same way that crapping your pants in public would likely be an &quot;accident&quot; (unless you had some real problems... )<br>
<br>
You can't accidently loot two things in passing, especially while linkdead.<br>
<br>
Thnx thread, I'm finally learning how people get the huge amounts of cash they have to afford things I never could. I just need to have some &quot;accidents!&quot; and use excuses like, <br>
<br>
&quot;someone was cyber me and I got 'cited and slipped off chair, while my fingers did a series of mouse clicks reaching for something to stop myself.. then I went LD and thought that my brother playing me later in the week went on a raid for several uber lewts as a present to me whereupon I sold them, sorry LA~~ ~@@!!&quot;<br>
