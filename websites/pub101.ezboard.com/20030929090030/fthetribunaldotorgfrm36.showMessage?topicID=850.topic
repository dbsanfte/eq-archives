<br>
George Monbiot <br>
Tuesday August 26, 2003<br>
The Guardian <br>
<br>
The US government's problem is that it has built its foreign policy on two great myths. The first is that it is irresistible; the second is that as time advances, life improves. In Iraq it is trapped between the two. To believe that it can be thwarted, and that its occupation will become harder rather than easier to sustain as time goes by, requires that it disbelieves all that it holds to be most true. <br>
But those who oppose its foreign policy appear to have responded with a myth of equal standing: that what unilateralism cannot solve, multilateralism can. The United Nations, almost all good liberals now argue, is a more legitimate force than the US and therefore more likely to succeed in overseeing Iraq's reconstruction and transition. If the US surrendered to the UN, this would, moreover, represent the dawning of a fairer, kinder world. These propositions are scarcely more credible than those coming out of the Pentagon. <br>
<br>
The immediate and evident danger of a transition from US occupation to UN occupation is that the UN becomes the dustbin into which the US dumps its failed adventures. The American and British troops in Iraq do not deserve to die any more than the Indian or Turkish soldiers with whom they might be replaced. But the governments that sent them, rather than those that opposed the invasion, should be the ones that have to answer to their people for the consequences. <br>
<br>
The vicious bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad last week suggests that the jihadis who now seem to be entering Iraq from every corner of the Muslim world will make little distinction between khaki helmets and blue ones. Troops sent by India, the great liberal hope, are unlikely to be received with any greater kindness than western forces. The Indian government is reviled for its refusal to punish the Hindus who massacred Muslims in Gujurat. <br>
<br>
The UN will swiftly discover that occupation-lite is no more viable than occupation-heavy. Moreover, by replacing its troops, the despised UN could, in one of the supreme ironies of our time, provide the US government with the escape route it may require if George Bush is to win the next election. We can expect him, as soon as the soldiers have come home, to wash his hands not only of moral responsibility for the mess he has created, but also of the duty to help pay for the country's reconstruction. Most importantly, if the UN shows that it is prepared to mop up after him, it will enhance his incentive to take his perpetual war to other nations. <br>
<br>
It should also be pretty obvious that, tough as it is for both the American troops and the Iraqis, pinned down in Iraq may be the safest place for the US army to be. The Pentagon remains reluctant to fight more than one war at a time. One of the reasons that it has tackled Iran and North Korea with diplomacy rather than missiles is that it has neither the soldiers nor the resources to launch an attack until it can disentangle itself from Iraq. <br>
<br>
It is clear, too, that the UN, honest and brave as many of its staff are, possesses scarcely more legitimacy as an occupying force than the US. The US is now the only nation on the security council whose opinion really counts: its government can ignore other governments' vetoes; the other governments cannot ignore a veto by the US. In other words, a handover to the UN cannot take place unless George Bush says so, and Bush will not say so until it is in his interests to do so. The UN, already tainted in Iraq by its administration of sanctions and the fact that its first weapons inspection mission (Unscom) was infiltrated by the CIA, is then reduced to little more than an instrument of US foreign policy. <br>
<br>
Until the UN, controlled by the five permanent members of the security council, has itself been democratised, it is hard to see how it can claim the moral authority to oversee a transition to democracy anywhere else. This problem is compounded by the fact that Britain, which is hardly likely to be perceived as an honest broker, is about to assume the council's presidency. A UN mandate may be regarded by Iraqis as bluewash, an attempt to grant retrospective legitimacy to an illegal occupation. <br>
<br>
None of this, of course, is yet on offer anyway. The US government has made it perfectly clear that the UN may operate in Iraq only as a subcontractor. Foreign troops will take their orders from Washington, rather than New York. America's occupation of Iraq affords it regional domination, control of the second biggest oilfields on earth and, as deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz has hinted, the opportunity to withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia and install them in its new dependency instead. Republican funders have begun feasting on the lucrative reconstruction contracts, and the Russians and the French, shut out of the banquet, are being punished for their impudence. <br>
<br>
Now that the US controls the shipping lanes of the Middle East and the oilfields of central Asia and West Africa, it is in a position, if it so chooses, to turn off the taps to China, its great economic rival, which is entirely dependent on external sources of oil. The US appears to be seeking to ensure that when the Iraqis are eventually permitted to vote, they will be allowed to choose any party they like, as long as it is pro-American. It will give up its new prize only when forced to do so by its own voters. <br>
<br>
So, given that nothing we say will make any difference to Bush and his people, we may as well call for a just settlement, rather than the diluted form of injustice represented by a UN occupation. This means the swiftest possible transition to real democracy. <br>
<br>
Troy Davis of the World Citizen Foundation has suggested a programme for handing power to the Iraqis which could begin immediately, with the establishment of a constitutional convention. This would permit the people both to start deciding what form their own government should take, and to engage in the national negotiation and reconciliation without which democracy there will be impossible. From the beginning of the process, in other words, the Iraqi people, not the Americans, would oversee the transition to democracy. <br>
<br>
This is the logical and just path for the US government to take. As a result, it is unlikely to be taken. So, one day, when the costs of occupation become unsustainable, it will be forced to retreat in a manner and at a time not of its choosing. Iraq may swallow George Bush and his imperial project, just as the Afghan morass digested the Soviet empire. It is time his opponents stopped seeking to rescue him from his self-destruction. <br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Attacks on Bush side, this does raise an important question - would the UN been seen as more legitimate than the US? I was under the impression they would be received far more warmly than the US, but maybe not.<br>
<br>
That aside, I still believe we need the troops to augment our own. While I agree that it is not the UNs responsibility to clean up our mess, we definitely need help.  We don't have enough soldiers to rotate the ones in Iraq back home after 12 months. Our troops don't want to be spending 2 or 3 years in Iraq and if we can't rotate them out, we may be facing problems from within on top of what we are facing in Iraq.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that in the end we really do need the UN. The question is, what benefit will the UN receive from participation in this mess?<br>

<br>
There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than Bush's ego and the Old Europe power struggle, even though so many people choose to reduce it to just that. It nearly angers me that the entire UN isn't begging the US for the opportunity to set up shop in Iraq. They would be willing to calmly stand aside as Iraq and the mid east slip into an inescapable black hole because they don't want to experience the 'horror' of being seen as a 'dustbin' for the US. I guess ignoring genocide wasn't enough for the UN. They have to step it up a notch when it comes to Iraq. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2273<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 5:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> It's not really a question of desire or need, but one of control.

I'm sure that the UN will want control if they are going to invest forces.  Therein lies the conflict.

Sorry bro. I do respect your opinion, but all I can do is shake my head on that one.

I dunno. I thought it was well written and brought up a legitimate question on whether the UN could do what the US has failed (thus far - not saying we will fail in the end) to do and also if they would be seen as having more legitimacy.<br>

There are thousands and thousands of troops there now. The terrorists and extremists have enemies in the country. We're not losing. We could lose. If we do and we leave, Iraq will morph into a country that makes pre-9/11 Afghanistan look like Disney World. Maureen Dowd can call the current Iraq a terrorist state all she wants but it is absolutely nothing compared to what an abandoned Iraq would be.<br>

Because of the UN's oil for food program bullshit. Because of the UN's 12 year indifference and inaction to Saddam getting richer while the rest of Iraq suffered. Because of Kosovo. Because of their refusal to allow US troops and armored vehicles to guard their headquarters in Iraq, leading to the death of their one man that actually seemed to give a damn about the country. Because weeks before the bombing at the UN, the only people competent enough to realize the danger at the hotel were <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/39299.htm">US troops</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. The UN does not deserve a major say in what happens in Iraq, nor could it handle it as the evidence so very convincingly suggests, and it's despicable for them to wish for it. They are only capable of supporting, not leading.<br>
<br>
It does not anger me that Bush doesn't 'eat crow', because he is right in not giving major say to the UN and the UN is wrong in wanting more control in a country that they've mishandled for 12 years. It's as simple as that for me. I 100% believe that Bush wouldn't give a damn about 'eating crow' if he thought that was what was best. Fortunately, he doesn't believe that that is what is best for Iraq and the mid east. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 8/26/03 7:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3845<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 8:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Maureen Dowd can call the current Iraq a terrorist state all she wants but it is absolutely nothing compared to what an abandoned Iraq would be.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

I dunno - let me see an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>honest</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> appraisal and we'll see. I saw an honest appraisal of what the war would cost and the man was fired. I saw appraisials of drone planes, nuclear programs, al-Qaeda ties and WMD, none of which appear to have been honest.<br>
<br>
Personally I think it would be great to see a reasoned calculation for a change, the type of which Wesley Clark, among others gave, but were ignored.<br>

Well, I think the results speak for themselves. Show me the bright spot in this presidency. The economy? Foreign policy? Civil liberties? The environment? How about that Roadmap to Peace that required Saddam to be overthrown to work? I see Iraq is a huge influence on that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only one group of people have benefited from this presidency and I am sure I don't need to tell you who they are.<br>

I do agree that the US should bail on the UN, I've said that for well over a year now.  I doubt that the UN will be better off without us, but who knows and who cares.  In it's current format, it's pretty much useless for anything but humanitarian type egagements.<br>

The UN needs to be restructured completely to have some kind of per capita electoral-type voting system (using brackets so China doesn't run the damn thing, heh) with no special members and membership open to all.  It also needs to grow some balls. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1580<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/03 12:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Maybe.<br>
