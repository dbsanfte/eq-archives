To deprive people the right to get even attempt NToV cause you feel you own the place, or at least have it on a time-share plan is crap, yall know that.  SI was there in force, FCFS, if we got wiped so be it, but to CoH past is bogus.  I have respect for you guys in EV and Comps for what you guys have accomplished but don't come here and talk shit cause SI wanted a shot at even attempting NToV.

                                           gimp.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have the full logs if you would like to see them.  There was conversation between Mojak and myself<br>
in tells and then again in say with the GM present.<br>
<br>
The suggestion of a duel was mine.  I made a similar suggestion when the count of EV in the zone was sub 18.  The GM did not force that decision at all.  The GM was happy to sit there until myself and Mojak worked it out.  The GM &quot;had all day&quot;  and also mentioned that were it to come down to it, the GM did not want to remove both guilds from the zone.  I coulda sat there all day, and I am sure Mojak could have as well.  I felt that unfair to the rest of my guild to make them sit there, when the untimate decision by the GM would result in nobody getting NTOV for however long the GM determined both guilds would be required to stay out of it.  Both sides lose in that instance.<br>
<br>
Made it fun, we dueled, I lost.  Most people said &quot;wtf you crazy?&quot;  Mebbe  : )<br>
<br>
From my end, this was planned last night, by me, if there was nothing else to do and only if there was nothing else to do.  When I planned it, I was told by many people that the rotation on NTOV was no longer going on between Comps and EV, which made sense to me since NTOV has been spawned now for around 72 hours.  I felt contacting EV or Companions about it was unnecessary, and foolish because of the assumed nonexistance of the rotation system, it would merely push them to get there before us.  Contact would have been foolish, from my perspective.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our original plans had been Ssra Temple, but due to the lack of spawn and people getting a bit agitated, the decision was made to head to TOV.  I asked for the first member of the guild to zone into TOV to let me know how many guilds were present, and what they were doing if there were any raids there.  I was told KOT doing halls of testing, and that there were three E/V in zone at the zone in.  Within about 5 more minutes we had 55 in zone.   EV numbered 6, and I was about halfway thru Western Wastes.   When I got to the TOV entrance I received a tell from Mojak along the lines of, &quot;it's gonna get hot on the flameboard,&quot; and then he let me know that EV had a raid planned for there in approximately 1 hour.   I mentioned that we had a raid planned for there now.   No talk of any rotation went on at this point.<br>
<br>
I zoned in, approximately 12 EV in the zone.  We buffed up at the zone in area as I did a little poking around to see how we might get into NTOV.  This is new to us.<br>
<br>
Approximately 15 minutes had passed and we moved up to the Hub area.  22 EV in zone.  Then someone mentioned that you can just invis past all the stuff in front since someone had killed Eashen a few days ago.  So that is what we did.  When we arrived up top, EV was present before Aaryonar.<br>
<br>
Mojak contacted me again at this time.  My suggestion was a roll and I did feel that more than fair at this point.  He asked me to wait.  I waited.  They COH more in.  He suggested a duel, I agreed, then he wanted to duel toe to toe... I said no.  Then he suggested to duel SI's main tank.  I said no.  I again suggested a roll.  He asked me to wait.  I waited.  30 minutes or so has passed.  I sent Mojak a tell saying I'd like to roll, and if that was not acceptable then SI would stay.  Mojak said that was fine, and when we died they would walk over our corpses and clear NTOV anyways.<br>
<br>
Couple minutes passed.  I asked my guild to be patient and wait.  EV mentions they are pulling Aaryonar.  SI moves down into the baby drake pit.  Aaryonar dies, GM shows up.<br>
<br>
Gm removes Mojak and myself from the area and takes us to the GM room to resolve it.  Considering that Aaryonar is dead, and we WANTED to do it all legit, I offer a 20% skewed roll in Mojak's favor.  I would roll 1 to 80 he would do 1 to 100.  He refused and said he rolls low.  GM locks people from attacking monsters and people get wiped out (yay).<br>
<br>
After sitting there for quite some time, we went down the dueling road again.  It was worked out that we would duel over the rights to be in NTOV today.  I felt this was pretty acceptable, if a little crazy, and that's how it was resolved.  Mojak beat me fair and square in a duel in the arena.  SI promptly left.<br>
<br>
I do feel we were stalled by EV in order for them to COH more in.<br>
I do feel we got a bit screwed here by my willingness to talk (stating this not whining.)<br>
<br>
Because of how today was handled in future circumstances I will not talk about things and have them take so long.  I'm always willing to talk but I honestly feel that today's &quot;talk&quot; was one sided.<br>
<br>
As far as the rotation goes, since there is in fact one in place, I have contacted a member of Companions, Leriana (sp?), and Mojak of Elitists and Vagrants about entering the rotation either on the next spawn or the one after (considering next is Companions and I'd understand completely if they'd like to finish this cycle of EV and then comps before SI enters).  I've received no tells back from Mojak and I completely understand that, as I know he is busy at the moment  ; )  Companions have thus fair said they will talk to Mojak about it.<br>
<br>
The incident with Tuffead will be resolved with a GM.  Popular personal opinion on both sides, EV and SI, at least as far as the leaders were concerned, is that Tuffead is a pretty good guy and this doesn't seem like him.  I've heard it was an &quot;accident&quot; so we'll let the GM sort that out.<br>
<br>
Bothers me a bit especially, since when SI had a Ssra temple raid going on on Wednesday post crash, and EV showed up, Valero sent me a tell asking what we were doing.  I told him we had planned on Rhags and then basement, but I didn't wanna be greedy and for EV to feel free to head on down to the basement and try out the Glyphed sequence.  I have logs of that as well, if needs be.<br>
<br>
I did bring that up, but was told that NTOV is different than Ssra so that had no bearing here.<br>
<br>
There's my end of it.  About as collected on the subject as I am gonna get.  : )   Make sure you have the facts straight before you post them.  (yeah I'm directing that towards my own guild as well)  IE: Don't do what Kreese is doing  : P<br>
<br>
And a side note... something that just pisses me off to no end.... if yer there with EV, and ya wanna send me a tell that you think that EV is wrong in what they did today, shove it up yer ass, m'kay? : )  I don't understand how ya can think it is so &quot;wrong&quot; yet support it at the same time.  Either yer lying to me, or yer a sad piece of shit who can't stand up for what they truely believe in, or you don't give a fuck because you might lose out on some loot, and I have no time for the likes of you.  (there's the flameboard stuff!  rarr : P ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukreese.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreese</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The OC<br>Original Cracka</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/9/02 3:49:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> yer there with EV, and ya wanna send me a tell that you think that EV is wrong in what they did ...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nice try Rynnia.<br>
<br>
But the tells I got from some prominent SI were shocking, to say the least.  I had no idea that so many didn't really want to fight with EV.  It's amazing to me how your guild can be so divided about it's direction and still manage to stay together. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=712.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=712.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=712.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=712.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=712.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=712.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
