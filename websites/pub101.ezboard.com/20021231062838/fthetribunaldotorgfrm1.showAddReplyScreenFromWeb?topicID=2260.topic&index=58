I heard something to this effect when I was grouped in Valor a few days ago...kinda funny. Now that you have your spells, you want to go ffa roll.<br>
<br>
Now, back to the subject:<br>
<br>
First, let's talk about spectrals and etherals.  I hate to break this to ya, but the majority of the server is gonna end up getting spectrals the same way they got KEI - from the top guilds.  If I had a spectral parchment, and someone offered me 4 etherals for it, I'd tell them to buzz off.  Spectrals are from mobs up two or three tiers.  As it is right now, most guilds will never see most of tier two.  So get ready for paying out the colon for your 63+ spells.<br>
<br>
Now, on the topic of duplicate spells, you would need someone to run and do the turn in, and then be honest about what they got.  That means leaving the group.  Um, yeah, I want my shaman gone for 20 mins or so to do the turn in.  I want my cleric to run off and leave us sitting there while he does his turn in.  I'd rather we kept killing.<br>
<br>
As far as a melee demanding to roll on parchments in a group where even one caster is lacking his 61-62 spells...I think you'd be looking for a new group, or having an inordinate amount of deaths.  Especially if it's the cleric or slower who need the spell.  Asking to roll on parchments is like casters asking to roll on plate bps that drop in Kael.  If you're wearing better, fine.  But if you're standing there in a treeweave...  Because that's what you'd be doing in a group where any caster in it needs even one of thier level 61/62 spells.<br>
<br>
The best way to avoid bad feelings is to find out what the loot rules are when you are invited to the group.  If you have a problem with them, don't join.  It's not that hard, honestly.   It's funny, but the only case I've had where loot has been a problem in PoP was from a shaman bitching because the mob we were planning on killing dropped parchments and items, and all the casters except him agreed to roll on parchments only and let the melee split the droppable loot among themselves if both dropped;  he wanted to be able to roll on the droppable items if they were shaman usable as well.  Well, we got ganked, and only had one item drop, which everyone rolled on, per agreement.. but goddamn, if you're gonna ask melee to sit out on something, your ass has to sit out on stuff too.  <br>
<br>
Jerry's Final Thoughts:  FFS, stop looking at your bank account when a piece of loot drops.  Be glad that something dropped that might give someone their last spell so they can stop worrying about the damn parchments.  Believe it or not, casters hate the parchments as much as melee do.  They'd much rather get their damn spells, than a duplicate that they can sell for 30k. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lonagan>lonagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/02 11:52:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2260.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Proposal: Ethereal Parchments to go Open Roll from 18th?</span><hr size=1>   /agree, this is much better here than on the FB, seeing as how we have actually discussed something ina clear rational manner.<br>
<br>
  The only distinction I would draw with the Kael armor drops situation is that plate/ chain/ leather/ silk pieces drop relatively evenly, so its a lot easier to just roll on what you can wear.  But to take it a step further, lets say you are in an arena group and plate legs drop.  All plate classes already have them.  What do you do then?  Do the plate classes still just roll on them?  No, everyone does to get them to MQ.  I would say the chief difference is that there is balanced loot in Kael.  If  say &quot;ethereal armor pieces&quot; or &quot;ethereal stat upgrades&quot; dropped that we could turn in for a random piece of armor or stat boost, in addition to parchments, then i would be perfectly happy letting casters have all the parchments, because that would not be the only loot.  Unfortuneately, SOE in their infinite wisdom figured that having ONLY caster loot drop in the PoP zones that 90% of people hunt in would be fine.  <br>
<br>
  Whether you like it or not, if you say that all parchments should go to spell weilding classes, then you are saying pure melees should get no loot.  Biased though I may be playing a warrior who XPs primarily in PoP, I see something patently unjust in the statement that any class should not get loot.  And what of the compromise?  What of parchments going to casters first and then melees in a group?  People havn't commented on that very much.  Is even a compromise (that STILL gives favoritism to spell classes) too much to suggest? <p>  Kazak- 57 Troll Warrior.<br>

  Few things are more enraging to people than to have their identity or their sense of home stripped away.  They will fight for it, kill for it, sing for it, write poetry for it and novelize about it.   Because without a sense of home and belonging, life becomes barren and rootless.  And life as a tumbleweed is no life at all.<br>

If everyone has their 61-62 spells, then everyone should get to roll on the parchments, since all it is at that point is a cash item.  There is no 'need' at that point by any member of the group for the parchment, except as a cash/trade item, and it should go to a free roll.  You're avoiding the fact that if you didn't have plate legs, and a caster asked to roll on them, you'd hit the roof.<br>
<br>
Yes, people can lie about this.  Just like people put on crap gear when they go to groups so they can claim nbg on stuff.   I have personally seen a warrior claim nbg on a lore sword that he was not wielding and could not loot - BUSTED TO THE MAX. There are liars and swindlers all over.<br>
<br>
But, like it or not, ethereal parchments are caster loot.  You said that you can see rolling on plate legs when everyone in the group has Kael/Tov/better legs.  As long as one caster in the group does not have all his level 61-62 spells, if you demand to roll on the parchments that he would use, you have shown yourself to be a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
Am I saying that pure melee should get no loot?  No.  I'm saying melee should not get caster loot, if a caster can use it.  Just like melee shouldn't get caster loot.  If that means you don't get phat platz, buy a tissue.  Because you're saying melee should get to roll on the equivalent of velious silk armor, at a time when not everyone is geared up.  You're saying warriors should get to roll against wizards on the gnarled staff from Venril.  You see the spells selling for 20k, and think &quot;I could get me some of that.&quot;  You don't see the casters taking that 20k and buying spells from each other.  You don't see people grouping and grinding for hours on end hoping to get that last parchment, that last spell.  <br>
<br>
Let me ask you this, Kazak.   You're in a shroom king group.  You decide not to wait on the king to pop, and to break up.  Just then, the puller brings a jugg or two to your camp.  The shaman slows them;  you kill it.  It drops Malo.  That's the only loot that has dropped all night.  You know the shaman doesn't have Malo.  You know you're going to break up.  Do you want to roll on Malo?<br>
<br>
Now you're going to post how that isn't the same, how you can get loot for melee in the shroom king camp, and how it's not guaranteed that you'd get Malo from a parchment turn in.  Don't bother.  Just answer the question.<br>
<br>
Me, I'm betting you would want to.  Because if you wouldn't, then you're being inconsistent.  Why would you not roll on one spell, and then roll on another?  Because that's all a parchment is.  <br>
<br>
Here's another scenario for you.  Imagine if all your disciplines came from 'ethereal training manual' drops, and you're missing defensive.  An ethereal training manual drops.  Then a 65 enchanter with a full spell book wants to roll on it, saying he could trade that for a new ring that would give him 10 more mana.  How would you feel?<br>
<br>
That's the same thing you're doing.  Warrior abilities are given to them.  Hell, you got shield as a freebie, rather than an AA.  Think on that, while you moan about how you're not getting rich off of parchments.  And yeah, you're gonna talk about how weapons to a warrior are like spells to a caster.  Hogwash.  Weapons to a warrior are like flowing thought/mana items to casters, not like spells.  They increase your performance; they don't give you new abilities that make you or break you as a tank.  A warrior without a Blade of Carnage and an SoD is still a warrior with defensive and shield.  A chanter or bard without a decent level mez is a hurting puppy, when adds hit for 400, 500, 600, or 750.  <br>
<br>
If you have a severe need to see large amounts of platinum in your bank, demand a larger share of the sellibles.  Lots of the random stuff that drops from mobs sells for 80pp or higher.  Give the casters some for dots, and split the cash among the rest of the melee.  But keep your greedy 'I want phat lewtz' hands off the parchments that you want to fatten your bank when there is a caster in the group sitting there cursing each mob that doesn't drop a parchment.  Yup, you're not getting spell loot.  If you  really don't like it, don't go to the planes of power.  Nothing drops there for you.  I'm sure the xp in umbral is just fine at 57, and melee loot drops there as well.  I'm sure your guild would have people around your level hunting there.  By the way, what guild are you in?  I'm sure they'd be interested in your stance on this issue.  The casters especially. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/02 3:41:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2260.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.aus-1.au.nu/images/photo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Proposal: Ethereal Parchments to go Open Roll from 18th?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hey, Hogfather, aren't you the one who was bragging about selling four parchments you claimed nbg on?

I doubt any 60+, or maybe even 55+ tank would agree with that statement.  A 60+ Warrior fighting in the Planes would be laughed out of any group if s/he came trotting along with a Lamentation and a Centi Short Sword.  I'd like to see a level 60 Warrior dual wielding Lamentations tank C4 in CT.  Hello dead casters.  Weapons for melees are just as important as spells for casters.  How many Rogues do you see running around Tier 2 PoP zones with a Crystalline Spider Fang?  Be serious.<br>
<br>
The fairest way to distribute loot in pick up groups is to let everyone roll for everything.  I'm not talking about what is desired or best for all, simply what is fair.  Is it not the fairest to let every person have an equal chance to win somehting?  NBG is a good idea in practice and makes some feel all warm and fuzzy but objectively there's no argument that can justify it being the &quot;fairest way&quot;.  Between friends it's a whole different can of worms obviously.<br>

Moot point from my perspective since I never do pickup groups for this very reason.  Stick to those you know and trust and there's never an issue.<br>

Since you are curious, I am currently a trial member of Requiem.  And if any members of my guild wish to know my position on parchments in pick- up groups, they need only read this thread, which I am pretty sure a fair number of them have.  I doubt that, as you insinuate, they would take a negative look at my views on parchment distribution in pick- up groups, because the method of loot distribution individual members employ in pick- up groups has no impact on the guild (I would probably get kicked out if I made a habit of claiming parchments in guild groups, but for further explanation of that topic, see the next paragraph.)  In fact, I would imagine the casters in my guild would actually be kinda happy with my stance, because any and every parchment that I receive in a pick- up group (which to date is zero) will go directly to a caster in my guild.  And no, sure though you may be, there are unfortuneatly not that many people form my guild hunting in UP, which is kinda bad, because as you point out, the experience there is not bad at all, and there are some very nice items that drop there.<br>
<br>
  Furthermore, unnone, since you so adamantly brought the topic of guilds into this, i feel i should re- iterate: the opions i have posted in this thread, as I have said numerous times, apply solely to pure pick- up groups.  Not groups of friends that hunt regularly (see also, permagroups) or groups of guildmates (see also, guild groups).  You see, in a perma- group or guildgroup, I have a vested interest in the well- being of my group-mates.  The stronger my guild is, the better off I am (and the same for a perma group.)  But you see, and let me state this as politely as I can, if i am in a pickup group with you and do not know you, I honestly DO NOT CARE about the quality of your equipment or the completeness of your spellbook.  It is of no concern to me, because I have no vested interest in your character's progression.  Now that sounds very cold and heartless, to be sure.  But all that means is that I have no obligation to take interest in your well- being, beyond discharging my class' duties in the interest of a smoothly funtioning group.  Many times throughout the course of my time playing, I have on an inpulse or otherwise happily agreed to summarily award  someone in a pick- up group something they really needed, despite the fact I could have rolled on it and potentially sold it.  All I am saying is do not act like I owe you anything, because quite frankly, I do not- and that includes the obligation of helping you fill your spellbook when I could just as well benefit myself.<br>
<br>
  Further, you seem to think that melees equipment really isn't necessary.  I would urge you to re- consider that stance.  Since it really makes no difference what equipment a tank has, i would assume you would be happy to go fight in PoJ with a warrior wearing crafted armor weilding a ssoy and a goranga club.  I mean, sure the warrior would never be able to maintain aggro, and when the mob eventaully ping- ponged onto him he would be eaten alive, but that's obviously beside the point, I mean, come on, all melee gear is really for is decoration.  Rusty short sword/ blade of carnage, wtf?!  Why do people even care so much, they're all the same.  Well, that's not exactly the conclusion I have drawn through my experience tanking, but hey, what would I really know?<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> They increase your performance; they don't give you new abilities that make you or break you as a tank. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
  Better equipment dosn't give you new abilities?  Let's see, I would define being able to get hit for a while and not die (which is the tank's job in a nutshell) as an &quot;ability&quot; and one that is given purely by equipment.  Um, yep, taunting would fall pretty much under the same category.  Actually, come to think of it, a naked warrior can do absolutely nothing, so it would seem to be that the equipment *might* play some role in what gives a melee their abilities.<br>
<br>
  And just because i am in the mood, let's look at a few other things you said.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> You're saying warriors should get to roll against wizards on the gnarled staff from Venril. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
  No, actually, i am not saying that at all, seeing as how Venril Sathir is not ordinarily a pick- up group encounter, and thus this discussion becomes totally irrelevent (see again, &quot;differences between guild and pick- up groups.&quot;)  If, however, a bunch of enterpirsing adventurers band together out of random chance and decide to kill venril, then  a melee would be perfectly justified in rolling for that item.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> If you have a severe need to see large amounts of platinum in your bank, demand a larger share of the sellibles. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
  Well, no, I do not have some platinum fetish, i do however have a desire to get better equipment, and a good way to do tha is to pay for it (which incidentily does require large sums of plat in your bank at some point or another.)  And actually, if i want to see that plat get there, rolling on a parchment (which to date i have yet to do, ever) would sure as hell be a lot better way to get there than by grabbing an innovatove bolt or two.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> As long as one caster in the group does not have all his level 61-62 spells, if you demand to roll on the parchments that he would use, you have shown yourself to be a hypocrite.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
  Actually, under my proposal (see also, &quot;compromise&quot;), all casters needing a spell for their level would get a parchment before melees would, so in actuality, all i am is not a hypocrite, but an advocate of fair loot rules.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> You're avoiding the fact that if you didn't have plate legs, and a caster asked to roll on them, you'd hit the roof.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
  If melee armor was the only drop there, and thus a caster's only chance at getting anything was by rolling on a melee item, no, actually i would not hit the roof, because that's a pretty reasonable stance to take.  The analogy does bear validity in that if there was any sort of comparable melee loot in PoP exp zones, melees would be happy to take their loot while casters could take theirs.  That, however, is not the case at all.<br>
<br>
  Again, could you please explain to me why I should care about the spellbooks of people I do not even know and not pursue my fair share of loot in a pick- up group?  That's about as reasonable as sending a stranger's kid to Harvard and making your own work at McDonald's. <p>  Kazak- 57 Troll Warrior.<br>

  Few things are more enraging to people than to have their identity or their sense of home stripped away.  They will fight for it, kill for it, sing for it, write poetry for it and novelize about it.   Because without a sense of home and belonging, life becomes barren and rootless.  And life as a tumbleweed is no life at all.<br>

You can either play the game and go from a &quot;me me me&quot; perspective, or think about other people from time to time. It's a choice you are going to have to make, no one else can force you to choose. Whichever choice you make, you'll have to live with the consequences, be it good or bad. On one hand, melees can deal with not rolling on parchments, while on the other hand, the same melees may have to deal with not finding a group if such a group is primarily camping for parchments.<br>
<br>
What do you join a group for? Loot or exp? or both? Throughout the history of EQ, great exp spots may drop only caster items, or only melee items, very rarely both. Both melees and casters (casters being the overwhelming majority) have had to deal with this. Now that caster spells which are traditionally store bought and in most cases quite common become semi rare drops off exp group mobs, melees finaly have to deal with what casters have put up with for the past 3 years--having no useable loot on many good exp spots.<br>
<br>
Lets look at history a bit further. Traditionally, the groups who arrive at a new camp area mostly operate on a NBG system. The first FBSS went to melees, as did the first Lam, RBG, SBC etc etc. These first ones knew the value of these items, yet they used NBG in pickup groups because it made sense. Usually NBG continues until the rabble moves in, and then every wants to roll on everything to sell for pp.<br>
<br>
It's a pretty sad cycle, really.<br>

<br>
The answer is simple. <br>
If you actually go get into a Pick up ANYWHERE, establish loot before you fight. <br>
<br>
If you don't like it, leave. If your too much of a retard to speak up and say you don't like the current loot idea, then screw you you cryin bish. <br>
<br>
<br>
IMO, Parchments go to Casters as Haste items go to Melee's. <br>

That is not a fair comparison because standard PoP parchments are relatively common drops that require only an XP group. CoF/equivalent or better are relatively rare and require a raid. Most melee outside the top tiers of raiding guilds will never get one.<br>
<br>
If CoFs dropped in pickup groups, casters would be rolling on them like they already do with FBSS and SCHW. If parchments were raid-level items, pickup raids would not allow melees to roll on them.<br>
<br>
Parchment drops in pickup groups are plain old tradeable loot of significant value. If you've agreed to roll on other tradeable stuff you should obviously expect to roll against pure melees on parchments.<br>

  First of all, is there something wrong with being a trial member to that, or any other guild?  The vast majority of guilds mandate a trial period, so to ever get in a worthwhile guild you must at some point be a trial member.  Are you suggesting then that there is somehting wrong with taking the steps necessary to be in a guild?<br>
<br>
  And as for my &quot;raid attendence,&quot; that, Unnone, is absolutely none of your business and you have no grounds, whatsoever, upon which to question my dedication, or lack therof, to whatever guild I choose to seek membership in.  Just because you are curious, I have missed all of one raid in the entire period of my trial membership status with Requiem that I have been online for any part of.  If you are insinuating that I am some parasite that clings to whatever entity I come into contact with sucking their energy out for my personal reward without contributing my fair share, then you are flat out wrong, and again, have no basis by which to make such a statement.  <br>
<br>
  I have done my best to take an active role in this debate because it is on the GENERAL forum, and seems to be of great interest to a lot of people on this server, myself included.  However, Unnone, all you seem to be ableto do is release a volley of personal attacks and mean- spirited statements as opposed to making any genuine contibutions to this discussion.  There is a place for people who wish to act as you have, and it is on the flameboard.  Please do not act in this manner on a forum not intended for such actions.  And finally, if you have some problem with me as I relate to the guild i have chosen to seek membership in, Requiem, then please feel free to take your concerns up with an officer of that guild, a list of whom can be found at www.thehouseofrequiem.com.  Otherwise, as far as my status with any guild is concerned, I will ask you to politely mind your own business as such matters are wholly immaterial to this discussion.   <p>  Kazak- 57 Troll Warrior.<br>

How would you like it if that same mage won it? Its the principal of the matter. Regardless of how rare the item it.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=73322">Mavrrik Magus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

  Few things are more enraging to people than to have their identity or their sense of home stripped away.  They will fight for it, kill for it, sing for it, write poetry for it and novelize about it.   Because without a sense of home and belonging, life becomes barren and rootless.  And life as a tumbleweed is no life at all.<br>

Well ok &quot;one&quot;.. where I was 2 boxing with my druid and the other guild monk I was grouped with was 2 boxing a cleric, but that doesn't count in my book (besides I lost <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). I won't roll on Parchments until someone tells me to in a group. I don't even &quot;ask&quot; as I join a group or one forms as it's been pretty clear it's not even up for discussion in most pick-up groups. I'm not blind.<br>
<br>
Things are going to change as spell books fill up? I doubt it will be when they fill up.. It'll probably be after it can no longer be hidden that books are full. The whole &quot;I need to trade this spell for my other spell&quot; argument is laughable. I hope everyone can see that. Yeah I'm skeptical, I tend to prefer guild groups after 3 plus years of seeing how people behave in EQ.<br>
<br>
It isn't a great feeling seeing parchment spells being sold in the very zone you've been fighting in for 50K as you pass on &quot;everything&quot; that drops... I'm a pretty typical Monk, I &quot;never&quot; ask for a loot split, I never &quot;roll&quot; on anything unless it's clearly not an upgrade for someone in the group (if others choose to roll in spite of that I'll roll to try to &quot;win that item for the member in need). I don't get a &quot;cash&quot; out after pulling all day for a pick-up group, I get exp, nothing more, nothing less (beyond the possibility of meeting new people eh). Man I wish I could still solo efficiently <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Walkabout has some very good points, read them and they're hard to refute. Hard to be &quot;Monkly&quot; day after day... I don't see how the Rogues are still alive in PoP (J/K).<br>
<br>
Hogfather, you're on the right track... It'll be awhile though, I think, before they go FFS.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if duplicate spells got randomed in a group rather than strengthening &quot;YOUR&quot; guild. I'd like the chance to better my own guild for &quot;MY&quot; time spent grouping with all you random players. Is that beyond reason?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's fairly simple really. You can either play the game and go from a &quot;me me me&quot; perspective, or think about other people from time to time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So it's okay for casters to think &quot;me me me&quot; and not melee - I see how it is. I've met enough casters in my days rolling on FBSS, Yaks, Mith 2hs up to SoDB, RBG, melee Velks loot, CT loot, Seb loot, Karnor loot and up to not have the slightest respect for greedy fucks.<br>
<br>
However, I'll restate my question and hope it will get answered this time around: &quot;Do you roll on duplicate spells, or let the casters keep those for trading?&quot;<br>
<br>
Anything other than rolling would be hypocritical for any caster that ever looted an item that was usable by a melee, even if just to trade for another piece of melee gear (Grozzer makes excellent points above). <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

not ALL casters think this way, I think most ppl would agree that scum thinks this way.<br>
<br>
does that mean you want to adopt the same practices and become scum ?<br>

just because someone fucks you over or tries to does not mean you should act the same way they do.<br>
