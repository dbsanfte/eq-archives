They have a set of fairly strict rules they have to follow. Taking your frustrations out on them does not achieve anything other than to discourage them from giving up their time FOC to helping us the gamer<br><br>These days with our GM you will be lucky if he even reads your request. He is an absolute and total idiot who thinks customer service is all down to how many names or petty issues you can deal with in a day and has absolutly nothing to do with actually helping us the paying customer.<br><br>I can also add with certainty not all the servers are the same. Take E'ci for example. The GM there Grog gets praise from players on a regular basis (sure some people do hate him still but that goes with the job). The guides there seem to work hard and generally doing a /who all GM actually returns a list of guides on line. How often can the same be said about Tribunal ?<br><br>No our GM sucks big time and doesnt give a shit about us the players. The server has too few guides and that can only be expected when they have to report to the asshole who is our GM. Would you give up your time to work for him ?

The reason for this is that it generates a ticket number and attaches your email to it. These tickets will generate stats and performance will be measured by said stats. Once a ticket has been assigned to a CSR they must deal with any email you send, regardless of the subject.<br><br>Given the number of emails a GM will have to deal with in a days work you will probably find that because they dont HAVE to deal with direct emails, they wont, that is unless it's directly related to a ticketed issue. You can't expect them to take on more work than they have to, which is probably more than they can handle. To be honest, noone should be emailing a GM directly unless requested by a GM. It's simply unfair of you to expect them to deal with more than is their job... esp for the $10 an hour they get. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/unuttinbutrouble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuttin Butrouble</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.iconbazaar.com/dots/animated/3anidot4c.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/8/02 2:16:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1555.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.animation-station.com/anigifs/anim1676.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: quick question about CS</span><hr size=1> Emails DO work, they just take some time.
