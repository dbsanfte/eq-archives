Really, Bailana, the subtle way you flame me back in the exact format by which I flame you is ALMOST good enough to make you sound legitimate! I know it's frustrating, but let me assure you, you ARE getting better!<br>

When you can't think of anything good to say... just say what you've already said over again, folks! (Oh, by the way, let's remember who admitted to being fucked up the ass, mmkay?)<br>
<br>
In conclusion, Bailana, I have decided that the person who has slipped pills in your drinks to put you to sleep so they can assfuck you (which, once again, you did imply) must also be the talented son-of-a-bitch who's writing your flames!

<br>
Since you seem to beg for it...<br>
<br>
I said:<br>
<br>
&quot;I never know if it works as I'm always unconcious&quot;<br>
<br>
To which everyone, but YOU, because you have a room temperature IQ, understood after reading the joke was meant to be a flame towards myself. However, you being the banjo plucking yokel that you are decided to post:<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course I didn't read the post! That's how I got the fucking quote, was by NOT knowing what you had said! While we're on the subject of stupid people... USE YOUR FUCKING HEAD before you ask a question!<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Yes, the joke was intended that I was the one unconcious, I was being sick. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, you call me an idiot... and then you admit that I'm right. mmmmmkay.&quot;<br>
<br>
Note the part that says 'admit that I'm right', where you demonstrate that it obviously flew right over your fucking head, like I said, and assume that you were the 00ber kewl flaming d00d you are and take credit for a flame that you had to borrow from my own goddamn post. Then you proceed to throw in the 'mmmmkay', the Flameboard standard for what to put when you don't have anything left to say, but need to spout something from your cock washer anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, no, I didn't have to make anything into a flame - you did it all by yourself. Your half-ass cover is doing a great job of convincing everyone that *I'm* the stupid one, though.&quot;<br>
<br>
And here we have your weak attempt at trying to make yourself NOT look stupid, in which you fail, miserably....<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep it coming! Not only did you manage to come up with something to call me, but you put a modifier in front of it! Your talent at the art of flaming is astouding!&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, it's not called a modifier you shit throwing chimp. And thank god my 'art of flaming' isn't as 'astouding' as yours. Good job, trying to sound intelligent and then not bothering to correct your fuck-ups, assuming you even know how to spell it in the first place.<br>
<br>
So the AGAIN I point out the fact that you have not the slightest clue what you're talking about, since, if you actually read the above, you'd see like the rest of the planet that:<br>
<br>
&quot;I never know if it works as I'm always unconcious&quot;<br>
<br>
Is STILL not your flame. Never has been, never will be, no matter how you modify it to make it sound like something you actually sparked in that roaring match-sized fire blazing in your head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not only is she a flaring wit, but she's persistent! Is someone giving her cookies or something for continuing this pathetic defense?&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh you are SO good *slaps her knee*....it's such a pathetic defense that YOU always feel the need to write page long responses. Way to go fuckstick.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really, Bailana, the subtle way you flame me back in the exact format by which I flame you is ALMOST good enough to make you sound legitimate! I know it's frustrating, but let me assure you, you ARE getting better!&quot;<br>
<br>
Note that YOU are flaming ME in the exact same 'format'. I've been around here a fuck of a lot longer than you have, and have been posting the same way from the start. So please, try to not use MY material and then claim it for your own.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sound so... confident! No one has ever used the &quot;I can't think of a good comeback so I'll say they're an idiot and pretend like my superior intellect won't stoop so low as to actually back up my statement with some sort of reason&quot; approach before! Where do you get such staggering material? Do you employ writers?&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you sit around all day trying to come up with the wittiest way to flame how someone flames? Because that's all you do, and it's rather pathetic. My statement really didn't need backing up, but I would also hate to leave you in the dark the rest of your life, you sound like you're trying SO hard to work your way out of your simian lifestyle to join the rest of us triple-digit plus IQ people. 'Do you employ writers?' Why, wanna know where I get mine since your parents aren't flaming me back worth a shit?<br>
<br>
&quot;When you can't think of anything good to say... just say what you've already said over again, folks!&quot;<br>
<br>
Have you read your own posts? Obviously not, you don't actually read anyone elses, you have to go by your parents interpretation of them as they read them off to you...<br>
<br>
&quot;(Oh, by the way, let's remember who admitted to being fucked up the ass, mmkay?)&quot;<br>
<br>
See the above section of my post, where yet again I had to point out that *I* was flaming *myself*, and show your pitiful attempt to claim it as your own. Then you use mmmkay again...refer to the above 'When you can't think of anything good to say...'.<br>
<br>
&quot;In conclusion, Bailana, I have decided that the person who has slipped pills in your drinks to put you to sleep so they can assfuck you (which, once again, you did imply)&quot;<br>
<br>
I've never met someone so persistent with trying to claim someone elses flame for themselves. At least this time you got it semi-right however, *I* implied it. However, not in the way you think...I implied it when I originally said it, NOT when I had to reiterate it to your dumbass with the hopes that your last 2 brain cells (a tragic result of being the moron who sucks the gas out of whip cream bottles) would create enough of a spark to put forth your first intelligent thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've got to be getting help from someone to pull all of this shit out of your ass!&quot;<br>
<br>
It should probably be noted that all any of your posts have consisted of is reiterating what I already said, and then making a disconcerted effort to use my own flames as a format with which to flame me back.<br>
<br>
In closing, you really are spineless. You use my own flames to try to flame me and look cool, you take my posts that are just SOO unoriginal and re-word them and throw them back at me (specifically the 'Well she's calling me unintelligent, so I gotta call her unintelligent back, but somehow I have to find a way to turn it around so it seems like my own original idea!'). All you've managed to prove with any of your posts is just how much of a retarded shit sucker you really are.<br>
<br>
If you decide to post back (assuming y'alls trailer is still getting that fancy big city phone business), at least come up with something of your own, quit leeching my posts and trying to claim them as your 'format'. Make Ma and Pa proud of ya and type your own response this time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uestevaneldiabolo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Estevan Eldiabolo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pootywang</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/12/02 2:16:46 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/ssswomac/tee_cont.gif width=110 height=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aatlaar, What are your hobbies?</span><hr size=1> See now shit like that last post I don't even bother reading.

In my original post on this thread, Bailana, I was well aware of the purpose of the line I pointed out. I KNEW you were joking at your own expense, and I laughed at you. The actual purpose of the post was to poke a little fun at Tarjman, who I know in real life. However, since you decided to get all up in arms, I decided I'd fuck around with your ass for a little while.<br>
<br>
It's a lot more fun while you're awake.<br>

<br>
Still not cutting the mustard, Bailana.  Aside from &quot;flaming yourself&quot; (who the hell flames themself?) with the whole unconscious ass fuck thing, and calling other people wanna-bes, you're a fucking joke.  You butcher logic like it's going out of style (e.g. Gosh pointed out that you, in fact, did prove him right in a couple instances, and you responded by calling him stupid.  You would've probably gotten better results by flaming yourself again here.)<br>
<br>
In closing, I know this thread will probably spill over four pages, because you are so full of yourself that you just can't bear NOT to post any half-assed thought that comes into your head.  Not many people read what you write anyhow, but it doesn't matter... good dreams Bailana; I hear that the Sandman is bringing his favorite lub tonite. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoctraculapinkerton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Octracula Pinkerton</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 526<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/13/02 1:25:04 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.game-revolution.com/games/xbox/action/azurik_james.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aatlaar, What are your hobbies?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> your all worthless and weak .. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
