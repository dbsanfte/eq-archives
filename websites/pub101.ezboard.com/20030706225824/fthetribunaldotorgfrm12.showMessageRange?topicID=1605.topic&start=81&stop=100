Cause Canada, Italy and Japan don't hate the US, don't support various terrorist organizations, don't gas thousands of people in their own country that they're not happy with, have not tried to assassinate our president and do not have reason to hand off anthrax to someone so they can murder American civillians. Funny you mention Japan as well given that they know the possible consequences of messing with the US more than any other nation in this world.<br>
<br>
It's simple really, and your question demonstrates perfectly the ignorance of the majority of those &quot;90%&quot; around the world who do not support this war.

<br>
1980-1988 Iraq invades Iran, a country 3 times Iraq's size and engages in an 8 year long war.  During this period, Iraq launches extensive chemical weapons attacks using Mustard gas and VX Nerve Gas.<br>
<br>
1991 - Iraq launches an invasion of Kuwait.  This action is universally condemned.  A resolution is passed by the UN Security Council ordering the full withdrawal of Iraqi forces.  This resolution is opposed by France, but does not veto the resolution.  Saddam Hussein refuses.  The gulf war begins.<br>
<br>
1991 - Iraq, after being defeated by a coalition of UN forces, agrees to UN inspections and economic sanctions with the stated goal of removing the weapons of mass destruction.  ANSCOM is created.  France voices opposition, but does not exercise it's Veto power.<br>
<br>
1991 - Iraq claims that they do not have a Nuclear Weapons program, and no longer have any biological or chemical stores<br>
<br>
1991 - Iraq embarks on a program of extermination in the northern provinces of Iraq.  They gas over 5000 people with mustard gas.  Over 30,000 people are killed.  Faced with a possible mass genocide, the United States and Britain intervene.  This extermination is only halted when the United States and Britain establish and enforce the no-fly zones, an area where any military aircraft would be shot down on sight.<br>
<br>
1992 - France, China and Russia, claiming that Iraq no longer poses a threat asks for UN Sanctions to be lifted<br>
<br>
1992 - UN inspectors do a surprise inspection at a military base and are stalled for several hours by Iraqi military officers... however one of the inspectors spots a series of trucks leaving the rear entrance.  A high speed pursuit entails, where they find several truckloads of Cyclone(?) magnets.  These multiple ton magnets have no possible industrial purpose other than the enrichment of Uranium for nuclear weapons<br>
<br>
1993 - In a suprise raid on a government ministry, UN inspectors discover hundreds of files detailing Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.  At gunpoint, the inspectors are told to leave without the documents.  The inspectors refuse and a 4 day standoff ensue.  Iraq allows the inspectors to leave with the documents after the United States threatens to launch military strikes.  The documents show that Iraq had been actively pursuing a nuclear, chemical and biological weapons program since the early 1980's, and had spent close to 10 billion dollars on the Nuclear program alone.  It becomes apparent that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological programmes were far more extensive than anyone had believed.  It also reveals that Iraq had been working feverishly to complete a crude nuclear weapon in time for the 1991 gulf war, but had been unable to extract sufficient fissionable material.<br>
<br>
1994 - Iraq claims that all weapons of mass destruction and related information have been recovered by UN Inspectors and destroyed.  Some UN Inspectors also believe this.<br>
<br>
1994 - France, Russia and China push for the lifting of UN sanctions, claiming that Iraq had no more weapons of mass destruction.  The United States and Britain oppose any lifting of sanctions.<br>
<br>
1995 - Saddam Hussein's son-in-law defects.  He proceeds to outline in detail that in fact the UN Inspectors had found less than 20 percent of Iraq's chemical, nuclear and biological material.  He then describes in detail how Iraq had actively worked to conceal, hide, and disperse the materials, destroyed countless records, and was still actively pursuing those programs through a series of underground bunkers, camoflouged industrial plants, and mobile manufacturing plants.<br>
<br>
1995 - UN Inspectors locate and raid a biological weapons plant.  There they find culturing chambers for biological weapons.  Further lab testing shows evidence of large scale anthrax manufacture.  They find several tons of culturing medium (food for growing biological weapons), as well as extensive facilities for thousands of litres of biological weapons material.  They destroy the labratory.  However, UN Inspectors admit they have not located the vast majority of the chemical, biological or nuclear material that they know existed through records siezed.  Many UN Inspectors voice increasing frustration, believing it would be impossible to disarm Iraq without active government co-operation.<br>
<br>
1998 - Saddam Hussein announces he will no longer co-operate with UN weapons inspections, and orders all UN Inspectors out of Iraq.  Inspectors say they have additional evidence that thousands of litres of Anthrax, VX Nerve gas, and tons of equipment related to Uranium Enrichment exists but has not been specifically located.  The United States threatens miltary strikes against Iraq.  A last minute intervention by Koffi Annan, ends with Saddam Hussein agreeing to fully comply with UN Weapons Inspectors.  Within a matter of days of the agreement, Saddam Hussein begins to once again threaten, intimidate and block UN Weapon Inspectors.<br>
<br>
1998 - The United States and Britain launch joint military strikes on Iraq over a four day period.  The UN, faced with what the Inspectors considered an impossible task, orders that all UN Inspectors are withdrawn from Iraq.<br>
<br>
2000 - The World Trade Center in New York city is destroyed in series of terrorist attacks by the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda.  Within a matter of weeks, the President Bush declares a new foreign policy of pre-emptive engagement.  This begins an active policy of not only pursuing terrorist organizations, but those regimes which support, harbor, and foster terrorism.  Iraq is placed high on the priority list.<br>
<br>
2002 - Resolution 1441 is passed, calling for the disarmament of Iraq warning of &quot;serious consequences&quot;.  Once again Iraq claims it has no weapons of mass destruction, or any program to manufacture or process these weapons.<br>
<br>
2003 - The United States, Britan and Spain push for the passing of a security council resolution giving an ultimatum to Iraq to co-operate fully with UN Weapons inspectors or face military force.  France, Russia and China voice opposition.  France threatens to veto the resolution.<br>
<br>
2003 - The United States and Britain begin their war against Iraq in spite of strong public opposition by some countries.  France, China and Russia voice strong condemnation.<br>
<br>
2003 - The United States claims it has uncovered evidence that Russia has violated UN Sanctions imposed upon Iraq by selling the regimes weapons and sophisticated military equipment including GPS jamming devices.  The Russian government says it will launch an investigation.<br>
<br>
Other things that might keep things in perspective...<br>
<br>
Russia signed a deal worth close to 10 billion dollars to develop the Kirkuk oil fields in northern Iraq in the late 1990's with the Iraqi Government.  It is believe that the Kirkuk oil fields may be the richest oil reserves in the world.<br>
<br>
The largest partnership for the development of Oil in southern Iraq is France.<br>
<br>
China is one of Iraq's largest trading partners.  It is also believed that China has supplied large numbers of weapons and banned materials to Iraq through the use of 3rd party intermediaries in Pakistan and India.  China denies any violations of UN Sanctions.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
All this is knowledge in the public domain, both at the ANSCOM and United Nations web sites, as well as extensively reported in the international press.<br>
<br>
That being all said, whether you want to argue whether the time was right for invading Iraq, or whether there should have been more time given for inspections, I believe that regardless of how much time you would had given Iraq Saddam Hussein will never have disarm voluntarily.<br>
<br>
I also believe that Saddam Hussein will not respond to anything other than the threat of military force.  This has been his pattern of behaviour since day one.<br>
<br>
Finally, I believe that anyone who thinks Saddam Hussein could be disarmed peacefully has never really seen a truly evil human being at work.  I don't use the word &quot;evil&quot; lightly.<br>
<br>
Read up on Pol Pot.  Read about ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia.  Read up on Rwanda.  Then read about Saddam Hussein and what his contributions to humanity have been.  Then look at Saddam Hussein and what his stated ambitions are.  He believes that it is his destiny to lead a pan-arab state, to re-establish and lead a new arab nation.<br>
<br>
After you've done all that, imagine what he would do if he succeeded in building a nuclear weapon or was allowed to continue building his chemical and biological weapons programs.<br>
<br>
You may be opposed to the war in principle.  You may feel like there should have been more time given for inspections.  Maybe you believe the President Bush and Prime Minister Blair are a couple of morons.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone can honestly say that getting rid of Saddam Hussein and his regime will not be a good thing.<br>
<br>
As for people arguing about the collateral consequences of this war, it's mostly just theoretical isn't it?  We don't really know what's going to happen in terms of world affairs once it's over... but I can't imagine Iraq being much worse off than it is now.<br>

<br>
That depends Laotzu. If you listen to Bush and his tales of a happy ending, then no.<br>
<br>
If you look at the real possibilities of the Arab Street getting involved or the Turks clashing with the Kurds or the possibility of destabilizing the who region or the possibility of Iraq ending up in more turmoil under new and weaker leadership or....<br>
<br>
I think you get the picture. We went in with no UN support so our ass is hanging out there with no cover... and there is alot of shit that could go wrong.<br>
<br>
I am one of those who will go out on a limb and say this is recipe for disaster and that I think this war under these circumstances is totally elective and not worth the risk.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, most of the democrats have cowered under the fear of being called unpatriotic or being found on the wrong side of this when it's over. Too bad they don't realize that sometimes when you stand up for what you believe in, you might just end up on the wrong side of an argument, but it's better than selling out.<br>
<br>
That being said, if I am wrong and nothing negative comes of this, I will be very happy to have been wrong. This is a huge gamble and it might work... but I am not one for gambling in high stakes games unless the circumstances demand it, and I don't see the situation in Iraq as an immediate (or even distant) threat that requires gambling with our troops lives, our standing in the world, the threat of increasing terrorism and destabilizing the Middle East region.<br>
<br>
Those stakes are too high to gamble on an elective war imo.<br>

Raargh for god sakes man...where do you get your figures from??  Did YOU go out and poll 100% of the world?<br>
<br>
There are 46 Countries involved in this and the Coalition is growing.<br>
<br>
I think Laotzu outlined the main reasons why the Governments of France, China, and Russia have been helping this guy escape punishment and weasel his way out of any agreement he's made.<br>
<br>
So why do the Poeple disagree with this action?<br>
<br>
You think that it may cause him to light off a few chemical weapons?  You are probably right.  And Kudos for the Americans and the British for having the balls to do what's right even knowing that they will be the targets.<br>
<br>
People in this and other threads come waving thier papers showing things the US did over the past fucking 75 years that at worst makes the US look like it showed poor judgement.  <br>
<br>
Yet they all ignore the downright shameful actions of the Governments of France, China, and Russia when it comes to the amount of Political, and Military support they have given to Saddam Hussien all in the name of Oil.<br>
<br>
Anyone who doesn't see his attempts to proliferate Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical weapons, as well as his attempts to hide it, as a precursor to another invasion of another Arab country in another attempt by him to make the Middle East his own little perfect pscho Arab state...is a total dipshit.<br>
<br>
They lack the Vision to see that we really aren't going over there for Oil.<br>
<br>
They lack the vision to see that we don't go there to stop him from attacking JUST the Americans...he has plenty of possible test subjects once he gets that nuke warmed up.<br>
<br>
They all have a vision that is distorted by Anti-American propoganda...they see America as the Tyrant...they are clouded with biased journalism that to date still hasn't showed me anything that would either equate the US with Saddam Hussien, deserve the spite of other countries, or make me feel like America is doing anything wrong.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi information Minister has the balls to say that America violated the Geneva convention and abused Afgani prisoners on Gitmo...what is he joking?? Those guys ate better than I do!  They were given the ability even to practice thier religions...when it was thier religious beliefs that got them there in the first place.<br>
<br>
They showed a video on a loop all day of executed and tortured americans...then said they never violated the Geneva convention...what do they think WE are stupid too?? <br>
<br>
Who the fuck defends these guys&gt;??<br>
<br>
How come this regime has been in power so long?<br>
<br>
Because certain governments abused thier power within the UN.  They VETO ANY resolution that calls for war, reguardless of the timeline...and before they even saw it...thus ENDING any peace talks...WHAT THE FUCK did they think we were gonna do???  Walk away and say &quot;OK you are right...he can stay&quot;...<br>
<br>
The game is up and they know it and theya re frantically trying to stop us from catching them with thier hands in the cookie jar.  All the while accusing us of heading over there for less than honorable reasons...what a fucking hypocracy.<br>
<br>
NO the US did NOT put Saddam Hussien into power.  I had 2 different people calling ME ignorant on another thread because THEY were wrong.  <br>

I only count two nations that are actually fighting war in Iraq, England and the United States.  (BTW, Tony Blair is a VERY strong ally for risking political suicide over this endeavor).  I am not sure, however, of how many troops Australia has or has not sent over.  There are none to my knowledge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2757<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/03 10:35 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>new and weaker leadership Loegan???<br>
<br>
jeez</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That's what I said. Take a look at all the regime changes the US has made using both the military and the CIA.<br>
<br>
Now add up the ones that turned out right and compare it to the number of those that went wrong... some of them bigtime.<br>
<br>
Now throw in all the complicating factors that are present in Iraq, like tribal rivalries, territorial conflicts with it's neighbors and generations of people who have never known freedom and are having it thrust upon them all at once by an invasion force who will occupy their country for God knows how long, but 2 years at minimum. Now let's throw in the fact that the Arabs don't want us there. That includes our allies - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan. Even Kuwaitis aren't crazy about an American government in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Now are you ready to give us more than a 50-50 chance of pulling this off and having Iraq be another Turkey or Israel? If you are then I would call you either a diehard optimist or someone who is buying the rosy picture painted without questioning the reality of the situation.<br>
<br>
Now if this does go wrong, what would you say the odds are that it will go <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wrong, as in the results will have a major impact, rather than just a little wrong having a minor impact? I realize you can't put a hard factual number on this unless you are a statistical analyst with access to all the intelligence on the situation (and even then it's far from taking every possible scenario into account) , but I am talking about just rough reasoning with the info at hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, it could be 1 in 10,000 odds and it still could happen, but I don't like the stakes we are gambling with on anything less than a 75% chance of success and I doubt there are many realists who would put it that high.<br>
<br>
Yes, Saddam is a bad man. Yes, a regime change could be good if everything went right and a strong leader took charge.<br>
<br>
But the situations that could result if this goes wrong can turn out to be alot worse than the situation we have in the Middle East today with Saddam in place. <p><br><br><br>

Washington officials have said the number is over 40 now. On the 18th the State Department listed 30 nations, and the list has changed since then with one name taken off and a few more added. Many nations have forces fighting in Iraq but are not acknowledging it. For example, Denmark had been denying for a long time that they had special forces operating along with the US until some media pictures popped up showing a few of Denmark's soldiers tearing down a poster of Saddam Hussein and posing with Americans troops holding an American flag. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1126<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/03 11:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War</span><hr size=1> Actually that was Poland, not Denmark, that originally denied having forces in Iraq, though Denmark does have troops there as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slyintruder>SlyIntruder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/03 11:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War</span><hr size=1> There are good arguments for both sides of the debate.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, there is no real point to protest the war now, because even if we did pull out, we would have dead Americans for nothing, and have Iraq in ruins. We would have the same Iraqi leadership, who would believe they had &quot;won&quot; a war with the worlds super power. It is now our job to do everything we can to follow through with our intentions. I just hope that our love for freedom will be embraced on the other side of the world.<br>
<br>
There are a few things that I fear about war. The major one is that giant target a free Iraq would become. Imagine a pro-American nation, surrounded by anti-American sentiment. A nation surrounded by those willing to kill themselves for religious causes, hoping to inflict damage on the country, and the friends of the country they have been taught to hate. This war is going to be long, costly, and dangerous.<br>
Another fear I have is the reason. I am not convinced of a threat. While I do admit that Saddam has done atrocious things to his own people, I ask myself, why must my brother, my friend, my father, my neighbor, die for these Iraqi people? Why is it America's duty to act as a police officer? And why Iraq? Saddam Hussien is not even the worst tyrant in the world--there are plenty more. Are we to go after Syria? or maybe the racial cleansing tribes in Africa? Or perhaps Saudi Arabia...?<br>
The fact is that the world has many tyrants. And by going after Saddam, and not the rest, there is a double standard that is being created. And if we did go against the rest.. I think that's also a horrible situation. So its our choice now to either create a double standard, or police the entire world. Talk about a horrible Catch-22.<br>
<br>
So by now your probably wondering why I said there are good arguments for both sides, yet only presenting one. So here are the arguments I agree with:<br>
<br>
1) When people are lied to, and raised to hate America they pose a terrorist threat that is very dangerous.<br>
<br>
2) Saddam is an evil fucker.<br>
<br>
3) Someone has to enforce UN Charter, or the UN is worthless.<br>
<br>
4) Maybe, just maybe, a free Iraq will change the Arab world, give them a picture--a taste of what it is to be free, this COULD be the beginning of something great, or something dreadful, its a gamble.<br>
<br>
So sit back, support your troops, pray to your god, and hope for the  best, cause theres no stopping this now.<br>

<br>
I'm not saying I'm glad this is all happening...it's fucking horrible.  But it is happening, and nothing will stop it.  <br>
<br>
I think alot of the arguements over this are fed from people's fears of how bad this could get screwed up.<br>
<br>
I don't like the prospect of US troops hanging around there for 2 years anymore than anyone else.  It's a VERY tense and dangerous state of affairs that will arise.<br>
<br>
However, I do remain convinced that it's something that HAD to happen eventually...I think the reason why it's happening now is because the US and Britain wanted to make the move before thier WMD programs got too fully developed and then the price for people turning the other cheek for so long would be much worse.<br>

The protests now serve not to get us to pull out before regime change is done, because it is far too late for that. It is more to put pressure on the administration so they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be careful of what they do in this war and not take unnecessary risks and so that they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to not pull any shady shit afterwards and set up permanent camp in Iraq. <br>
<br>
There is also the major reason of showing this is not acceptable to many people, because all these senators/governors who will run for president someday are watching this infold. If they don't see any resistance then they may get the bright idea to play cowboy with Iran or Libya when they get in office.<br>
