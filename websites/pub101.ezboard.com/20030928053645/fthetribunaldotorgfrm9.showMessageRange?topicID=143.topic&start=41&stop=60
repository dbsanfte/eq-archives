It all depends on what you consider a goal.  Your idea of a goal is winning the game.  Mine is enjoying it.  Right now my goal is building house and getting master in 1 hand, next week who knows?  Furniture probably.  The fun is had when travelling to these multiple goals, not when they're reached.  I fookin hated EQ in the endgame, you probably were miserable until you reached it.  See what I mean?<br>
<br>
The game is not shit.  Aside from a few minor issues, it's extremely polished and has 5x more content than every game out there except EQ.  I too was upset when vehicles didn't make launch, but damn, when I got a taste of what is in the game, I'm suprised they even tried.  The content is overwhelming.<br>
<br>
I mean they had 50 developers working on it under the SOE/Lucas whip for the past few years, what did you think they were doing?  My guess is you didn't take the time to find out.  You were too busy powering your way to the 'end game'.<br>

hell that feeling didnt get dispelled until you spent too long in the world and you got jaded. So yeah that tided me over until i got to the end game<br>
<br>
theres absolutely no sense of wonder in SWG. Its absolutely faceless. I understand what SWG is about obviously you dont.<br>
<br>
SWG is about making quick money. Like every other project that lucasarts has been involved with lately. To cash in on an already well used franchise.<br>
<br>
And enzo i know the devs were trying to create something new and unique. Point is this product has been rushed out long before it was ready and has suffered under the constraints that were placed on it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarelorn>Sarelorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/7/03 5:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: grozzer</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You just don't get it, simple as that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

SWG's has a lot of very unheard of content at the moment. I obviously don't want to spoil to many secret, but i recently had a need for a very rare type of metal (I am a gunsmith by trade). I therefore decided to hire a scout and paid him very very well to find me the ore. Lo and behold, he calls me 2 days later that he has found the needle in the haystack (and I kid you not...) and that i should come and check out the place. The trip cost me 5 grands and all i am willing to tell you is that it was very well worth every cent of it...<br>

<br>
Your complete lack of understanding of SWG is obvious from your description of the dancing/music screenshots as glorified IRC.<br>
<br>
Musicians and dancers are healing professions. Every character builds up battle fatigue and mind wounds, which only entertainers can heal. By playing music or dancing for wounded people, you gain experience points to spend on improving your healing abilities and gain new dance routines, instruments and songs which have greater healing power. Most entertainers also have combat and/or crafting skills, because it's not a class, it's a skill set.<br>
<br>
There are XP bonuses to grouping (as a &quot;band&quot;). And as you get higher level, the MP3-quality music becomes quite good, e.g. Ballad ... the newbie songs are just repetitive. The higher-level dances are stunning pieces of animation, e.g. Exotic. When you co-ordinate them all in a band, the healing power is not only greater and more beneficial in XP terms, it also sounds and looks unbelievable. Players have massive control over the flow of the music and the dances, through individual or group flourishes, and different combinations of instruments. Newbies just have horn-type instruments that all sound crap, high-level musicians have guitars, synthesizers, drum machines, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>So what you're looking at is a group of characters levelling.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It's no different from an XP group in Velketors. It just happens to be a hell of a lot more fun.<br>
<br>
The joke is on the l33t d00dz who come into the cantina and say &quot;this is gay&quot; etc. They're like trained monkeys from EQ, all they understand is single-variety damage and single-variety heals. They come into the cantina and think they are looking at a bunch of roleplayers emoting dances and music. Most of them don't even know to /listen or /watch to heal their wounds, then wonder why their characters are so weak. When they finally understand it, they tend to end up training in Novice Entertainer because it's so useful.<br>
<br>
And then there's the housing screenshots, which I'm sure you also think are glorified IRC. What you don't realise as a n00b is that my house was the centre of a manufacturing empire. I had a private crafting station inside to make high-level healing items and a factory outside to mass-produce them. I made money by selling them on the bazaar. I kept the best ones for myself to use in battle.<br>
<br>
Trained monkeys make bad SWG players. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doctortale>Doctor Tale</A> at: 7/7/03 5:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1082<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/7/03 5:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> Oh you built your own empire too ? But yeah like Groz says, there's a huge part of player interaction in SWG that's left out of every review i have seen so far, mostly because the reviewer totally missed it. I think the main reason is because it's not as formatted as EQ where the only real interaction is through the combat mode and centered around combat efficiency. SWG has a far broader scope with a much larger range of professions, some of them not combat oriented at all.<br>
<br>
SWG has a whole economy and sooner or later, you discover that rather than go and do everything yourslelf, it's easier to hire someone. So yes the terminal missions are crap and deliveries, survey or destroy missions will only entertain you so far. However, if you can wait until the population reaches a certain reasonable level of crafting, you'll see that there's a lot of &quot;missions&quot; to be found that are actually jobs offered and paid for by players. As a crafter, you not only have to worry about your production, but you will be running into all the related marketing issues, including very very tough competition from other players. <br>
<br>
And very few people have even touched on the galactic civil war aspect of the game, much less the Jedi quest. Again : the game is not yet true to advertisement, but for those who have tested it extensively, there is a lot of potential... and a lot of content that has yet to be discovered.<br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;the game will attempt to reproduce some of the best aspects of EverQuest, including its addictive hack-and-slash battles and its social aspects&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually the professed goal of the developpers since day 1 was to specifically move away from the level treadmill and the hack / slash / loot model.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's much faster and more efficient for an expert blade crafter and a veteran hilt crafter to work together to produce high-quality daggers than it is for a lone character to attempt to slowly improve in the skills of crafting each.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's just plain wrong : the sword core schematic is part of the same skill tree as the whole sword. There is next to no interdependance between the different crarfting skills. If you can make the rifles, you are just as good at making the barrels and the power sources than the whole object. One of my bigger pet peeves with the game at the moment because there's little incentive to work with other players.<br>
<br>
&quot;You gain experience not when you successfully create an item, but only when another player uses your products regularly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong : you do gain experience from crafting the item, you only gain up to half of the same amount when other people use it (when the feature is not broken)<br>
<br>
&quot;The game will also let you choose to play as a miner or surveyor character&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong : the miner profession was taken out of the game during beta (to my greatest regret - because now i have to hire scouts to do the mining, and they dont like it). Surveyor is not a profession, it's just a branch of the generic artisan tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some creature handlers may simply want to raise and sell their pets to players who are looking for a little extra muscle (or just a traveling companion).&quot;<br>
<br>
As far as I know (I may be wrong), creature handlers are the only ones to be able to order pets around. There's therefore no market for creatures that I know of.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 2 bugs in the game that are on their way to completely break the economy within a month. It is currently possible to achieve the highest level of a crafting profession within 3 weeks with a minimum amount of sweat, instead of the 3 months of utmost power gaming initially envisioned by the devs.<br>

There are currently 3 gunsmiths already in my city (master firearms crafters). If you actually play and do the grind, you can shorten this by at least a week (but you'll have some serious RSI problems). By the end of the month, every crafter will be master and the competition will simply nullify the price of items. <br>
<br>
Right now you can find EE3 or laser carbines for under 5k on the markets. when they cost probably already 3k to make a piece. With competition between weaponsmiths outputting items of very similar quality, they will sell them at loss on the hyper saturated markets just to cover their factory costs. Considering how much money people make from missions, the price of such a high powered item (it's one level below the top level of certification) should fetch in the 20k at the very least. In turn, people having ready access to top level weapons will probably mean they will level 4 or 5 times faster in the combat disciplines than they should. <br>
<br>
2 minor bugs. The only way out of this nightmare in the making will be a player wipe : welcome to beta 5.<br>
<br>
Oh and i just realised that you can master the merchant profession within a day...<br>

Everyone said they didn't want it to be like EQ where it was a super-slow grind to make progress, but the problem is, when everyone &quot;beats&quot; the curve in the first month or so, the only thing *left* to do in the game is challenge the high-end content and the player-driven content (PvP, etc).<br>
<br>
Games like this *need* strata of players, from the poor newbies to the moderately wealthy mid&quot;level&quot; players to the few people who have really powered up to the elite levels.  The difficulty of reaching each level will naturally limit how many players can get there, preventing compression (say, like  in EQ, when everyone hit 60 and stopped) which leads to inevitable mudflation.<br>
<br>
All games eventually suffer from this, but by continuously adding content you keep everyone aiming a bit higher (and no, I am most CERTAINLY not talking about a level treadmill, which I dispised in EQ, but rather the later things like buying/running cities, vehicles, etc).  The problem with SWG appears to be that it was *too* easy, and the 'average' players are already starting to peak into that top strata... people like you, Shehb, rushed your way up and had a lot of fun for a few weeks - but is there something in place to prevent EVERY weaponsmith from hitting roughly your ability and ruining the fun nature of what you're doing (in a short period of time?)<br>
<br>
A bit of a ramble, as I re-read that, but it hits on one of my big concerns with SWG - I think that all MMORPGs need some sort of goals to be striving for to stay interesting.  In SWG, I saw that as the continuous improvement of your skills (becoming eventually a MASTER gunmaker, and/or MASTER dancer, or ...)  If you can master something in a few weeks, however, the game just won't have legs.  I know that a lot of people fundamentally disagree with me that MMORPGs have to have something to &quot;treadmill&quot; for, but I for one believe strongly that the reason people play these games for years on end is because there's always something more just around the corner, if they just put a bit more time in...  and I know this sounds like advocating timesinks, which I'm not - I just think that making it so that EVERYONE could master EVERYTHING in a short amount of time, and making earning money fairly trivial, removes almost ALL challenge from the game.  You end up with a big game world full of master players, who quickly will lose attachment with their character since it won't feel unique or like something you really 'worked' for.<br>

The original intent is for the absolute top power gamers to hit the top of a branch in 3 months.  It should take those hardcore players about 3 months to just reach gunsmith. It has taken me 3 days (ok on a week end). to just reach that goal due to the coincidence of 2 disastrous bugs.<br>
<br>
With the current xp calculation, it takes about 900k of raw materials to go from novice weaponsmith to master (i am talking full tree - all branches).<br>
<br>
One bug means you can harvest this among 5 people (enlist your scouts / marksmen guild buddies to lend you slots and put you on the harvester management list) with a fleet of 50 or more harvesters in about a week if you aren't picky about the quality. If you have architect friends, you can even start using the big boy drills to shorten that. Haven't got access to one, so i dont know.<br>
<br>
The second bug means all you have to do is manage cleverly your 10 building slots and all you have to do push a couple of buttons every 3 or 4 hours while watching the xp count rolling in. So as you can see, anyone can do this and it's horribly broken.<br>
<br>
Now there's another problem, probably common to other trades. The higher you get in the tree, the more specific the material requirements are. Here's the problem though : all those rare metals are SHITTY, in turn making crafted items of really shoddy quality. Practically, i can make a souped up scout blaster (advanced firearms) with far better stats (and far better dps) that a power 5 (master firearms) just because i cannot use high grade materials in the power 5. So why would you work up the tree to crank out inferior weapons which are far more of a pain in the ass to manufacture than the cheap stuff ?<br>
<br>
That's the kind of problems i am having with this game not being ready for release. It's stuff that should have been worked out in beta, as they are rather glaring gameplay issues. I told you on IM that the tuning wasn't ready and there were major problems. Well there you have it. The only way to fix this is to remove those 2 bugs and do a player wipe (beta 5 ?). Because at this rate, the economy -will- tank by the end of the week. I have already seen a few laser rifles on the bazaar for 3k today when they -should- be selling for 15k to 20k.<br>
<br>
Lastly : it would probably work out far better in the long run to have more gradations in the skill trees. So instead of one expert firearms level with 5 new schematics, you get 5 expert firearms levels with 1 schematic each and spread out the xp more evenly. Would take out some of the tedious &quot;grinding&quot; aspect.<br>
<br>
Btw : i would certainly not have powered my way through it like this if i had not noticed everyone and their dog trying to steal my customers by providing the new and better weapons. Competition in economy is ok when you have a somewhat even field. Right now... it's completely broken.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The original intent is for the absolute top power gamers to hit the top of a branch in 3 months.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's not correct. Raph Koster's statement was that the **average** player at 20 hours per week was their target for the 3 months to master an elite profession.<br>
<br>
The 250 skill points is enough to master more than two elite professions (e.g. doctor, carbineer) or about 1.5 hybrid professions (e.g. bounty hunter). In skill point spending terms, a master weaponsmith with no other skills is the equivalent of a level 50 character in EverQuest because you're not even close to maxing your character.<br>
<br>
And mastering an elite crafting profession doesn't automatically mean you can craft the best weapons in the game. To make the weapons people will want, you're going to need the best resources in the galaxy in bulk, with new shipments each time the resources turn over. Then you're going to need amazing successes on your combines and experiments for each weapon or schematic. Meanwhile, the weapons in use are decaying.<br>
<br>
At near-master doctor I was taken on a trip to Yavin 4 with two master combat medics and another master doctor. We all had good weapons, good combat skills, and one guy had three senior specforce commando pets. We found two dungeons that we could NOT break into ... we wanted to come back in retail with a group of 20 maxed-out characters. The pathing in/around the dungeons was really bad so I'm not saying this is the be-all and end-all of SWG high levels, but we smelled an endgame. I wouldn't like to lose my corpse in one of those places, or I'd need ... a new gun from you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I think rapid advancement is intentional in SWG. Battlefields and other things are designed for &quot;finished&quot; characters with all skill points spent. PvP is crappy until it's between forces of strong characters with full buffs (medical, food, spice, etc) and serious weaponry. And if there are too many weaponsmiths ... well, that's life. You go out of business, you surrender your skill points and retrain as a chef. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doctortale>Doctor Tale</A> at: 7/8/03 11:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moontaylesilverleaf>Moontayle Silverleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/03 3:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=57>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> Doc hit the nail on the head. I believe the final tally was 240 hours total to use up all your skill points if you did nothing but get experience in the areas you needed. Of course, that is an extremely boring way to do things in my mind.<br>
<br>
Been playing on Test Center for almost a week now. Got about 10 hours under my belt. I'm halfway through to Pistol Specialist (still under Marksman tree) and have Exploration and Hunting II. I probably spend about an hour a day running missions since I need the cash to keep up with my harvesters (a bunch of us are trying to help our resident Architect along by pulling up Ore for him). Well, actually I don't even need to do it for an hour, but I do anyways since I double that time as my 'grind' session. Just shoot, kill, and harvest. The rest of my time I spend doing various other things. I do try and get at least 20 rebel faction points a day while I'm in town (I'd do destroy missions, which are worth more FPs but they are hosed at the moment).<br>
<br>
I think it just boils down to how a person is willing to spend their time in the game. If they grind and then claim the game to be boring, then I have to agree with them, as they have taken a very boring route to playing the game. Simply put, it's not boring unless you play that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1092<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/03 9:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Star Wars Galaxies Review</span><hr size=1> Hey Groz : 3 months != 3 days. The situation was completely broken and thankfully they moved in yesterday afternoon (i /bugged this 3 times during the week end). As of now, there is no more &quot;free power&quot; and currently factories are stopped. So that end of the bargain is more or less gone. They have also seriously nerfed &quot;macro harvesting&quot;. The only problem is with the few people who have managed to master an elite craft already and enjoy a very unfair advantage. <br>
<br>
Again : you would be right on the quality of materials being what makes all the difference, except that those materials, rare as they are, are of extremely shoddy quality most of the time. Meaning lower end weapons that can use a broader variety of materials end up being much much better than higher end weapons because of that. I have made a few heavy particle beam weapons, launchers and such : they dont sell because the price / quality ratio is just not worth it And i cannot make them better because i cannot find high quality sources of the rare metals. not for lack of looking : i am currently paying 5 scouts to explore the galaxy and sell me those - thos e costs on top of all the maintenance of my own fleet of harvesters and shop expenses add up to nearly 30k / day. So with this nerf now, i am not even breaking even anymore. Conversely, a friend of mine creature handler, tells me he can clear up to 5k+ / hour of play. I think there's a price hike coming...<br>
