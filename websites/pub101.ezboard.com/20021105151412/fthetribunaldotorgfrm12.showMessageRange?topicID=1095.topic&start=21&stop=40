<br>
But you and your guild are trying to blame our guild for being trained on and defending ourselves as we waited patiently far away from the aggro radius. It is not our fault a small team of faction hunters were there and caused AOW to come barreling towards us.<br>
<br>
Seriously, you guys are all upset, I can understand that, but you really need to examine the facts and stop letting anger cloud your judgement.<br>
<br>
You wiped on idol a few times, you barely beat him when you did finally down him, you took a very long time rebuffing and getting reset for AOW. All the time we waited on our hands and tried to refrain ooc, some more eager members decided to taunt you as they find that enjoyable. We also werent happy we got the SI auto petition for zoning into the same zone as you which is very childish.<br>
<br>
You had your shot, the pull got fucked up, and a guild who was waiting outside the arena to give you your shot had to defend themselves when the faction hunters didnt realize they were that close to AOW. When it comes to die because you think you deserve a shot, or defend ourselves, we defend ourselves, talk to the faction hunters, and next time make sure you get a clean pull.<br>
<br>
Good luck on him next time, with some work you can do it, personally I think you fucked yourselves over by taking so long ( perhaps to make sure you got one attempt and if ya died he depopped ) and by not having a clean pull.<br>
<br>
Stop trying to make more out of this then there is, you look like spoiled children who screwed up and want to be rewarded for it.<br>

<br>
SI you failed the Idol 3-4 times? How many times did legs get a chance to fail roy? once? twice? AOW is on a rotation just like NTOV.By  ryns &quot;standards&quot; a guild who wipes one time has no buisness in NToV or the rotation. So wouldent by the same standards a guild who wiped on the Idol have no buisness in the AOW rotation? Of course u guys did win after your 3rd or fourth shot...hmmm mabye you guys should give legs 3 or 4 shots in the same day?<br>
<br>
No I am not in legend...No I have no beef with SI either most of you guys are cool. But the hypocricy of this situation is absolutly fucking stunning. <br>

<br>
Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance<br>
<br>
We make no hidden facts that we were gonna kill AOW if and when he killed the SI force there. We prepared and grew bored waiting for it happen and like I said some of us, most of us were afk, or talking in tells. Hell we were also doing COHs, for a few people, and anyone who really knows the game you dont do COHs in the middle of pull. So we didnt pull it, it came to us, we slayed it, end of story. <br>
<br>
Also just because we have killed it before doesnt mean we shouldnt try to kill it again, he drops loot which is helpful, that arguement is so fucking stupid and shows how moronic you are. Guess SI wont be doing TOVN anymore as they killed the mobs once. Your logic is flawed.<br>
<br>
Keep spinning it all you want, the truth is on our side, as is verant regarding this matter, though I dont doubt that you have sent emails to verant whining about this. Perhaps Gold you can use the same tone you used in your first post to try to make them believe you are wise and wouldnt lie. I will take bets on the numbers of emails you sent to verant, maybe 20, maybe even 30. Keep whining, it only goes to highlight your maturity when the guides watched and ruled against you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uchaple.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chaple</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/16/02 11:10:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EV's Immaturity</span><hr size=1> maybe it's just me, but i find it hard to beleave that the AoW was &quot;trained&quot; into a fully ready raid force, expecialy after the EV guildleader said you have so and so time to pull. guys don't go afk or nothing SI is about to pull ... ya right ... but then again i can't see over the fence.<br>

<br>
1/2 of an EV raid force &gt; 2 * your raid force<br>
<br>
got it? We're at least FOUR TIMES BETTER THAN YOU. That's why we can get trained when half our people are afk and still win.<br>
<br>
Personally, I find it hard to believe that EV could steal a pull on a mob like aow with 1 GM and 2 Guides watching and not get in any trouble. I guess the reason we didn't get in trouble is because that's not what happened. <p><FONT FACE="helvetica, arial" SIZE="-1">

<br>
Ntov is a rather obvious one as it is rather a large place with many mobs.. aow is a 2 mob kill.. eiher done in sucession or its done .. idol is killed its over in an hour either way.<br>
<br>
So if yer claiming theres a rotation for the aow ya might want to let someone know ahead of time before ya try to say someone is horning in on it.<br>
<br>
calling other guilds hipocrites for requiring legos to ask and then kill arry as EV and comps required of each of us( SI, RNG, AN, and Trans) doesnt say much about you reallly.. cept the pot calling the kettle black/shrug.<br>
<br>
You may also wish to post any other mobs ou might have some agreement with comps on to alleviate future disagreements.. although I dont see any that are of the obvious scope and defining difficulty of killin arry to git into ntov to start with.. most you just clear to and attempt.. no real big deal there same crap different mob. learn to kill it and farm the sh*t outta it whenever possible till noone needs that mobs drops and move on.<br>
<br>
anyway justify it however ya like it was cheeseeeeeeyyyyy<br>

Let's jazz this post up a little:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Goldbeard, you should really get all the facts next time.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
<br>
Goldpubes, get you head of your Playgirl magazine while playing EQ. That way you know what the fuck is going on at your raid and don't come here and make a total ass of yourself (ok, more of an ass than you already are).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> EV decided to do AoW tonight, so we headed to Kael where we found out that SI was attmepting Idol. We waited at zone for SI to fail </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
EV decided to do AoW tonight, even though he is a pretty lame mob for my guild and killing him is about as challanging as camping Dvin, but hey - he drops phat lewt, so what the fuck.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we head to Kael where we found that SI was attempting the idol. After changing my boxers (what can I say - when I heard SI was attempting the Idol I pissed myself laughing), I joined my guild at the zoneline waiting for SI to fail cause:<br>
<br>
1. We were told to wait at the zoneline so not to make the little girlie guild more nervous<br>
<br>
2. We were told that you fuckin pus nuts had already wiped 3 or 4 times.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> As we were waiting at zone, several GMs showed up. We didn't call them, so my only guess is that SI called them. (dunno) Shortly thereafter, our Guildleader told us that SI would be given another shot at Idol, and if they failed we would get a shot. In preperation for a failure that we expected, we gathered our forces and moved towards the arena and made groups.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
While we were chillin at the zone (discussing where the fuck giants come from when they got no females and wondering if there were female giants, if their pussy would be as big as Coacoas) several GMs showed up and started hanging around smelling up the place (I guess they had no teenage females to cyber tonight so decided to get off listening to us talk about Giants genetalia). Shortly thereafter, Mojak gave the word that we were gonna off the idol if SI failed once more. Course we figured you pussy mofos would wipe (again), so we got our game faces on and started popping nodoze (hey, it's the only way we can get a rush after killin this mofo so many times) as we move to the arena.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> SI was setup inside the arena on the right hand side, so we gathered outside the arena on the left hand side. As far as possible from the SI raid so that we would not cause additional lag or interfere, but at the same time we would be in a position to move quickly once they failed and it was our turn.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
SI was cowering over on the right side of the arena, so we gathered on the outside so we could avoid the odor where you shit yourselves after the last encounter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Lo and Behold, SI killed the idol. (kudos to you guys) For those that don't know, killing the idol spawns the aow and sets a 30 minute (approximately) timer. If aow isn't engaged in that time frame, he depops. Since SI killed the idol they were supposed to have first shot at the aow and if they failed, EV would get a shot.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Lo and fuckin behold, SI killed the Idol. For a second I thought I had taken a couple too many Nodoze and my brain was playin tricks on me, but fuck if SI didn't kill him on their 10th attempt!<br>
<br>
Now any EQ player in a guild that does more than Trak raids, knows that killing the Idol spawns the AoW, but if you don't kick his ass within 30 minutes he gets bored and depops to go find some weed and tag some pussy.<br>
<br>
Seeing as we had 30 minutes, we figured we'd let SI make an attempt at AoW... after all, it should be good for a few laughs and and it gave me a couple minutes to type up my 15 page homework paper (the Nodoze was kickin in good at this point).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 11:18 pm est, Idol is killed and AoW is spawned.<br>
11:26 pm est, EV Guildleader shouts, &quot;AOW INC&quot; - the aow was not inc, he was just messing around, also the aow was not pulled.<br>
11:28 pm est, EV Guildleader tells Rynnia to stop stalling and move it along in shout.<br>
11:29 pm est, EV Guildleader shouts that EV would be pulling aow in 5 minutes. (more than half the time to depop would have passed before we pulled if EV had carried out that threat.)<br>
11:38 pm est, aow materializes out of nowhere on top of the EV raid. A full 20 minutes after spawn with a mere 10 minutes left before depop. Since aow was attacking us, we killed it.<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> After the fact, we were told that SI messed up the pull and &quot;trained&quot; aow onto us. I know that if they did indeed train us, it certainly wasn't deliberate, but when you have a mob like that beating on you, you don't stop to ask too many questions. I do know for a fact that EV DID NOT pull the aow and that in discussions with the GMS after the incident, the GM said that the aow was trained onto us and that what we did was perfectly legal.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
After we got through reaming the AoW a new asshole, we were told that SI messed up the pull and &quot;trained&quot; AoW onto us. I told Mojak to chill cause those SI fags would never be talented enough to pull him that far without getting owned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to try the aow. That's how it goes sometimes. To be perfectly honest, if it took hours to kill the idol, including seveal failed attempts, then it is likely that aow would have wiped the floor with you because he is several orders of magnitude tougher than the idol. Congrats on the idol, it's a step in the right direction and I have no doubt that you will be able to kill the aow in the next few months.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to try the AoW <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ...

<br>
Sleeper's Tomb, rotation: <br>
EV and Comps<br>
Months later, everyone else.<br>
<br>
NTOV, rotation:<br>
EV and Comps<br>
Months later, everyone else.<br>
<br>
AOW, rotation:<br>
EV and Comps<br>
<br>
See a pattern?<br>
<br>
Here's a good rule of thumb...<br>
<br>
If you can't kill it and EV and Comps can kill it, then EV and Comps prolly have a rotation.<br>
<br>
Generally, if EV and Comps can kill the same thing, a rotation is formed out of convenience so that we don't constantly race against each other. If you want a list of the rotations, speak to Mojak or Sscaley, maybe they'll talk to you. We don't post our rotations because usually, it's a long time before anyone else is likely to have a chance at killing our mobs and when a rotation only has 2 members, it doesn't require a fucking message board to keep track of. <p><FONT FACE="helvetica, arial" SIZE="-1">
