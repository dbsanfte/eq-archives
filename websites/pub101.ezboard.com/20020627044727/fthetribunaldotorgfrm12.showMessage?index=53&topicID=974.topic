Maybe I'll try asking this another way and I hope I don't too greatly offend your superior intellect this time.<br>
<br>
You're stating that people who believe in unfounded beliefs (like those who believe in quantum physics right?) do so under the authority of 'that's the way nature intended.'  So, like in the case of quantum physics, because particles appear to operate in a dual-nature way we state that they do...but under the caveat that our only proof is we think 'that's the way nature intended'. <br>
<br>
Therefore people too dumb to explain why this happens form a working theory from the empirical data at hand and then resolvedly claim 'We are right!' and 'We have no idea why we're right!'  <br>
<br>
In essence you're embodying your own arguement but from the other side of the coin; your rationalizations are unfounded in categorizing nature as a 'non-entity'. You are the one claiming this, yet that you 'don't have a fucking clue' about how it could be right. Ah, but alas you're not looking at the empirical data at hand.  You're a med student you said...then you can probably name the characteristics of a living system.  Apply these to the earth as a whole.  Better yet read that Gaia theory, cause it's already been done.<br>
<br>
After you do that, I ask again, why is it that you're too fucking stubborn and self-righteous to admit that you could be wrong about the earth being a self-contained living consciousness?  Why is it that your statement that nature is not an entity is a fact and not an unfounded belief as I suggest?  Because this really invalidates everything you said about nature not having an intent or control over the species that populate its world.  You view it only as a system where 'this must happen, or these must be do this unalterably' such as your 'all birds would fly' statement - and since this isn't present then we're not in this type of system.  So what if instead it's more like a checks and balances thing, such as 'hmm, penguins lost the ability of flight, we'll adapt them to sub-zero temperatures so they don't have to fly to avoid the weather' kind of thing.  And with these attributes penguins were naturally suited towards the polar region of the earth, so in the event of the continents breaking up that's where they remained, suited to their ecostructure and having no need to migrate.  Not that events like this have to occur on some conscious level, just that nature's machinations even alterations and evolutions out.  A system that is aware and adapts to its envrionment, but not necessarily sentient.<br>
<br>
But no, that can't be right can it.  Nature's not an entity, it didn't 'intend' to adapt to changes.  It was some inexplicable reason that did it. Yeah.<br>
<br>
The rest of your arguement is just as inane.  'Do we create computers that are capable of doing other than we want them to'?  No...because we can't yet.  It's called artificial intelligence and they've been trying to develop it for over 25 years.  'Why is it you care about the coverage of the story...rather than caring about the kid' ?  Uh, isn't trying to call light to the story caring about what happened to the kid?  This received almost no national media coverage, and had it it would've been shrugged off by NAMBLA or similar organizations.  Probably something to the tune of &quot;well, if man-boy relations were legal to begin with they wouldn't have had to drug and gag him, would they&quot;.  You'd rather ignore it huh.  As for your whole genetics essay, who said homosexuality was genetic?  I've yet to see that in this thread.<br>

Did you not *read* the argument? I was pointing out how &quot;nature&quot; is NOT sentient! The closest that we can come to categorizing &quot;nature&quot; is a series of patterns, both evolutionary and metaphysical, that have &quot;steered&quot; the development and evolution of living organisms. What I was SAYING is that they series of patterns doesn't have a fucking mind of its own!<br>

<br>
How is it unfounded? We are aware of the systems, the laws of physics. They never change. They aren't subject to any mood swings or reversals of decisions by this supposed consciousness. And with the theories of how things came to their present state, the Gaia theory is not needed to fill any gaps in logic. It's simply a less-accepted idea. The goal of science is to logically explain this world, not to come up with how a &quot;more powerful force&quot; or &quot;higher consciousness&quot; or &quot;sentient planet&quot; simply said &quot;Let there be penguins.&quot;<br>
<br>
The point I was making is that people who lack a decent argument state that &quot;nature intended&quot; for their idea to be right simply BECAUSE they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  cannot think of another, decent argument! </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

sentient (adj.) conscious, capable of sensation, responsive to stimuli.<br>
<br>
So it's aware and adapts... but it's not aware and doesn't adapt.<br>

I guess you're right. Trying to save peoples' lives is such a menial and dishonorable profession. Remember earlier when I said that I was hoping you wouldn't still sound so stupid?

I said this to him:<br>
I hope your mom labels your sneakers so you get them on the right feet.<br>
He interpreted this as a slam on his mom. Amusing.<br>
The slam was on YOU not grasping simple ideas like left and right. Looks like it was very appropriate too.<br>
Krickett when I sqaid similar atrocities were commited by straight men (note the word straight) I meant on young girls.<br>
Or would you presume to state that no crimes of this nature are commited by straight males?<br>
Dumai, once again the reason the Shepard case got more media attention is because of the motive of the murderers.<br>
These were not guys running around in general commiting crimes against other individuals. They saw a gay man, perhaps he did or did not approach them.<br>
If he did I suspect if they'd showed no interest in his advances he would have probably gone on to greener pastures, just as Straight men of average intelligence will do when a woman expresses no interest in them.<br>
As to degenrate Dvin, I'm supplying you with a definition since you don't know what the word means.<br>
Degenerate<br>
having declined (as in nature, character, structure, or function) from an ancestral or former state b : having sunk to a condition below that which is normal to a type; especially : having sunk to a lower and usually corrupt and vicious state<br>
Let's look at each of the three and see if we can help you with this word.<br>
First, if your nature is to be gay, which many believe it is, being gay does not fit this definition.<br>
For those who believe being gay is an acquired taste I challenge you to give me the day you woke up and said to yourself..Hmm..guys or girls? They both sure do look good and make me sexually excited. Which should I choose? Talk about your tough questions. i can tell you no such issue ever arose with me, perhaps some of you are different and went through that. When did you choose to ignore the sexual stirrings looking at a man gave you Dvin?<br>
The second definition doesn't fit too well either, if your type is a gay male, you've declined from nothing.<br>
Now the third one does fit the guys that killed Jesse, but not simply because they're gay.<br>
It fits any vicious murderer.<br>
And Dvin, you can claim to be calm, but go back and look at your earlier posts, looks kinda venom-filled to me.<br>
I'd love to know how someone can work up anger like that and claim they were calm. <p><center><i>

That original life form then evolved into more complex life forms through a natural process of random mutations and natural selection. In a nutshell, the basic premise is that matter acting on matter for a sufficient period of time can create anything, whether organic or non-organic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution is still widely accepted by the general public as scientific fact, especially in the popular media and the public schools. On its face, the “survival of the fittest” model is simple and self-evident. In fact, no legitimate scholars doubt that Darwin’s theory of natural selection accounts for most of the changes within a species (a testable process known as “micro-evolution”). <br>
<br>
However, beyond “micro-evolutionary” changes within a species, Darwin’s theory of evolution absolutely breaks down. With our recent findings in biochemistry, genetics and paleontology, not even staunch neo-Darwinists are adhering to a traditional Darwinian model that shows all living organisms on earth today coming from a single life form which itself came from inanimate matter. The “irreducibly complex” world of biochemistry, the digital code inherent in the organic genome, and the fossil record itself have knocked Darwin’s basic theory on its heals. <br>
<br>
Look at the dramatic evidence (or lack thereof) in the fossil record. Of course, if Darwin’s theory of “macro-evolution” were true, we would see a vast number of fossils at intermediate stages of biological development. In fact, based on standard mathematical models, we would see far more transitional forms in the fossil record than complete specimens. We see none! <br>
<br>
Our museums now contain over 250,000,000 fossil specimens (40 million alone are contained in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum). If Darwin’s theory were true, we should see at least tens of thousands of unquestionable transitional forms. We see none. Even Stephen Jay Gould, a leading spokesman for evolutionary theory today, confesses “the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology.” (Natural History 86 (1977), pg. 14.) Even the popular press is catching on, “The missing link between man and apes, whose absence has comforted religious fundamentalists since the days of Darwin, is merely the most glamorous of a whole hierarchy of phantom creatures … The more scientists have searched for the transitional forms that lie between species, the more they have been frustrated.” (“Is Man a Subtle Accident,” Newsweek (November 3, 1980.) <br>
<br>
Even Darwin himself knew that the fossil record did not yet support his theory. However, he believed that future years of paleontology would help support his claims. Well, they haven’t. In fact, the fossil record has been an embarrassment to Darwinian evolutionists. It’s just that the adherents to the theory have yet to share this reality with the general public, especially our school kids.<br>

Killing a man for his shoes has gotten somewhat similar coverage. I do remember stories in the past about kids killed for their Nikes. If Matthew Shepard remains in people's memories it will more likely be because of the vehement disapproval of his death's coverage by anti-gay folks like you.<br>

<br>
This makes no sense. It might be an acceptable explanation if in fact I believed in evolution. However, evolution has no basis or support, so, I don't. Therefore punctuated equilibrium, like Darwin's Theory, are useless to me.<br>

<br>
and your nutshell is not correct.<br>
<br>
Punctuated equilibrium is a Paleontological term to describe the uneven progression of evolution. Instead of being a continuous, gradual process, evolution is characterized by very short periods of extreme diversification and growth interspersed between long periods of slow change. This idea is based on evidence in the fossil record where strata for many ages contain the same organisms. Abruptly, within a short geological period of time, a whole new set of organisms are found. The theory is based on the idea that periods of intense growth are initiated by a novel adaptation which gives a particular species an amazing advantage over its environment. All interacting species are quickly selected for those that can adapt to this new change. Other causes of puctuated equilibrium can be quick environmental changes such as a meteor or ice-age.<br>
An example would be the Cambrian explosion, if I remember correctly, where the evolution of tissues that can form hard structures (i.e. teeth and body armor) resulted in an astounding amount of growth in a short period of time as predator and prey counter-evolved to outdo each other with these new weapons and defense systems. The trilobites are a prime example of this with their hard chitinous bodies. The large soft bodied organisms of the Precambrian Era all but disappeared during this prolific diversification.<br>
