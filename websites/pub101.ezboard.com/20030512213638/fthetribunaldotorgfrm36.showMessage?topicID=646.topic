Oh, he died of a slip, although I believe last year he suffered a heart attack which in my mind is attributed due to his quack diet. <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

Go figure; I'm not overweight, nor could I go without candy and pasta, but I've known a *LOT* of people who have had success with it.

I'd love to read some. I always figured that the Atkins diet was quite unhealthy<br>
<br>
It's hard to argue with its efficacy, as lots of people do lose weight on it. The trick is to keep it off after you go off the diet. Unless someone gets a lot more active and burns calories through exercise, I don't see how they can hope to keep the weight off, as the introduction of even moderate amounts of carbs reverses everything(?) that Atkins taught.<br>
<br>
Back in the 1990's when &quot;low fat&quot; was the rage, I gained about 20 pounds with the attitude that if it had no fat I could eat it.  All of those carbs packed the fat onto me.<br>
<br>
A few years ago I did really well with the Zone (nothing more than 40/30/30), but I was exercising a lot.  I did feel good, but part of that was the exercise and part probably was the placebo effect.  The Zone, and any of the lower carb diets, do help you lose water weight, but I recall reading recently that a controlled clinical study of the Zone failed to prove it effective and even showed it detrimental to athletic performance.  Dr. Sears has claimed that it's excellent for athletic performance.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I still try to avoid carb-laiden meals, as I do feel very sleepy after them.  The insulin affect that Dr. Sears talks about is real for many people (eat a carb-heavy meal and your insulin spikes up to help with glucose metabolism) and can leave them feeling sleepy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 636<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/20/03 10:26:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> A truly no-carb (or very, very low) diet like Atkins simply forces the body to get its energy from other sources besides glucose.  The body has a 'backup system' in case no glucose is available, which essentially involves burning fat for energy.  The problem with this is that its far less efficient - just in &quot;made up&quot; numbers:<br>
<br>
1g of glucose = enough energy to run 1 km <br>
10g of fat = enough energy to run 1 km<br>
<br>
obviously neither of these are remotely true, but for example purposes, you could claim that the body has to burn 10x as much fat for the same amount of work as it would if it had a carbohydrate source available.  So if you have no glucose available for energy, the body burns its own fat; not only is this the &quot;goal&quot; for the diet, but it does so at a very accelerated rate because the process is far less efficient.<br>
<br>
The body always has both pathways available to it, but our bodies are always in the mode of assuming starvation is just around the corner; as such, they will try to always take the more efficient road, and store anything extra as fat for a &quot;rainy day&quot;.  You can't store more than a few days' worth of glucose, but fat can be stored... forever, I think.<br>
<br>
So - if you can FORCE the body to switch to its backup energy system, you'll burn fat directly, and burn it relatively quickly.  Sounds great, right?  IN theory - yes - and it does seem to work.  It also has the nice side benefit of LOWERING cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which is very counterintuitive for a diet of bacon and cheeseburgers.<br>
<br>
The downside to this is that there's a byproduct of the second metabolic pathway (ketosis) which is moderately toxic to kidneys and your liver.  If you were to stay on a VERY low-carb state for an extended period of time, you're chancing serious kidney and liver damage.  This is why even Atkins' book says to only do the &quot;extremely&quot; low carb portion of his diet for 14 days, and then he starts increasing the amount of carbs you can eat.  <br>
<br>
I tend to believe that IF you have the self-control to actually wean yourself back onto carbs the way Atkins says to, you won't regain much of the weight (by slowly increasing the amount you eat until you reach a point of &quot;low&quot; carb intake but not so low as to actually be metabolizing your own fat).  Everyone I know who has done this, however, has basically just gone &quot;off&quot; the diet (no carbs today, ice cream sundae tomorrow!) which causes the body to switch into &quot;replenish all lost fat!!&quot; mode, and stores everything it can (regaining the weight).<br>
<br>
Most of the research now shows that the REAL reason the Atkins diet works is because people *gasp* eat less and eat better.  No sugary/candy crap, and its a lot of salads and chicken/fish.  Overall, its been show that the average atkins dieter takes in a reduced calorie intake, and when you eat something &quot;fatty&quot; like meat you tend to feel full a LOT faster than eating rice or pasta.  So its a super-sneaky way to get fat people to cut out sweets and eat less.. and AMAZINGLY ENOUGH they lose weight!  Who woulda thunk...<br>
<br>
My friend who was very successful on the diet at salads every day and overall far fewer calories, and also started moderate exercise, which he kept up after going off the diet (as well as not reintroducing sweets).  That is how he kept off the weight.<br>
<br>
I think something like an Atkins diet is a great way for overweight people to kick off a lifestyle change, because it WILL have short-term results (20+ pounds lost in a month), and if that's enough to get them eating less (and even better, exercising), great.  Those who think its like a miracle pill (&quot;I'll do it for 3 weeks, lose the weight, and then go back to eating footlong subs for a snack&quot;) are not going to get good results. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>If post accidentally read<BR>

Apparently Dr. Atkins thought turning people into dogs was the way to lose weight. But then again, dogs in the wild don't live for more than a few years while domestic dogs fed high rice diets will routinely live to 15 or 20 years. And dogs have a liver more suited to protien and fat diets than a human's. Of course, I've never felt the need to lose weight so I'm not well read on the science of dieting. But I've read the back of a Eukenuba bag enough times to know how dogs work! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 872<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/20/03 1:10:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> &gt;1g of glucose = enough energy to run 1 km<br>

i would have to counter check on that but iirc &quot;fat&quot; are higher level polyholoseids than glucose and store more energy. the downside is that being more complex, they take longer to break into usable CHO cycles.<br>

<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, glucose undergoes the following:<br>
<br>
Glucose + 2 ADP + 2 NAD+ + 2 Pi -&gt; 2 Pyruvate + <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">2 ATP</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> + <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">2 NADH</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> + 2 H+<br>
<br>
<br>
And each pyruvate undergoes:<br>
<br>
Pyruvate + CoA-SH + NAD+ -&gt; CO2 + <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Acetyl-CoA</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> + NADH<br>
<br>
<br>
So.. the net for glucose to Acetyl-CoA is:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Glucose</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> + 4NAD+ + 2ADP + 2CoA-SH + 2Pi -&gt; 2CO2 + <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2Acetyl-CoA</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> + <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">4NADH</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> + 2H+ + 2H2O +<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">2ATP</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
And of course, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">each of those 2 Acetyl-CoA will undergo the Krebs Cycle as above</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  So if nothing else, each glucose goes through 2 Krebs cycles for every one turn a fatty acid goes through; that alone would produce 2x as much energy.  (4 ATPs per glucose, as opposed to 2 ATPs per fatty acid in glycolysis).<br>
<br>
BUT it gets even better.   NADH and FADH2 are energy rich molecules; their oxidation is highly exergonic and is coupled with the production of ATP from ADP <br>
<br>
* Oxidation of 1 mole NADH produces 3 moles ATP <br>
* Oxidation of 1 mole FADH2 produces 2 moles ATP <br>
<br>
Thus total ATP yield = (10 x 3) + (2 x 2) + 4 = 38 moles ATP per mole Glucose <br>
<br>
So - <br>
<br>
1 ketone yeilds 13 ATP (via 1 turn of the Krebs cycle plus byproduct).  1 glucose yields 38 ATP.  It doesn't take a biochemist to figure out which pathway is more efficient; not to mention that it takes energy to break fat molecules down into ketone bodies and fatty acids.  The net overall is that glucose breakdown produces roughly 3x as much energy as glycolysis/ketosis.<br>
<br>
Shehb, fats are more dense; per gram they hold more energy than glucose (which is why its an idea long-term-storage solution).  But on a molecule-by-molecule basis, glucose produces 3x the energy that a ketone body does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lbarsoum>lbarsoum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/20/03 11:49:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> Taken from my nutritional biochemistry text-book: <br>

&quot;Being on a high-protein, low carbohydrate diet is similar to sever starvation, since it contains very little to no carbohydrates; our bodies are then forced to break down protein and fat to attempt to sustain the life process.  Burning of fatty acids and certain proteins take place, resulting in a condition known as ketosis.  Weight loss is fast and dramatic, but unfortunately, these losses are due to water loss and not fat.&quot; <br>

Total number of ATP from 1 molecule of glucose = 2 + 6 + 6 + 18 + 4 + 2 = 38<br>

<br>
Fatty acids yield 8 ATP per carbon while glucose yields 6.3 ATP per carbon. Carbons in fatty acids are more reduced than in glucose -&gt; fat == better energy store than glucose. Ketone is not used as a long term storage, it is used to transport it to the tissues and is synthetised by the liver (during starvation periods). <br>

you just summed up why i do exactly nothing with a biochemistry degree :P<br>
<br>
And you can't look at energy per carbon; that works in a mechanical universe (potential energy to do work), but you have to take into account how much energy it takes to create the fatty chains, as well as how much it takes to break them down.  Sufficed to say, on a weight basis, fats hold more energy per gram, which is why the body stores energy in that form; however, since cells can only run on ATP as a fuel, getting fat into a usable form (ATP) takes a lot more energy than getting glucose into ATP.  THis is why the body will always burn carbs you eat and store fat, unless there are no carbs to burn.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that some of the ketones formed (namely, acetone) will build up faster than the TCA cycle can break them down, and they're fantastically toxic to internal organs.   Anyone thinking about doing Atkins' diet long-term should do a google search on &quot;diabetic ketoacidosis&quot; ... diabetics often end up in this situation unintentionally, because even though they eat carbs, their body refuses to process them (insulin is key to what makes the body break down carbs into glucose). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadaetidalstorm>Jadae Tidalstorm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~jadae/pain.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 430<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/21/03 10:17:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> I bet the worms are gonna be pissed when they get to his burial lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 875<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/21/03 11:37:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> &gt;you just summed up why i do exactly nothing with a biochemistry degree :P<br>

I do have some good input though.<br>
<br>
From what I have seen, the reason the atkin diet works is that although it is true that the diet forces you to obtain energy elsewhere than from carbs, it actually just means that it gets it from the protein that you eat.  It is also true that your body will tend to use up its fatty tissue before attempting to burn protein that you digest, which *sounds* like you would lose weight.  However, if you still eat more calories in protein than you burn in fat off your body...your body will turn that leftover protein from digestion into fat as well...thus negating the effect.  This is a very complicated thing so hang tight if yas can.  Let me start with my situation:<br>
<br>
To start off, im athletic, very athletic.  I dread &quot;wimpy&quot; sports (as I like to call them) such as basketball and want not because they lack physical content for my own personal interests.  I'm a runner, wrestler, and even at times a boxer.  I eat anything and everything that I want, with no regards except for pop when I have races upcoming (a 32 miler in september in the run through Hell, MI....a very sweet race).  I weighlift 4 times a week.  Needful to say, I keep tabs on sports medicine and health quite a bit.  Currently I take creatine to improve my physical importance (dont you all jump down my back now, I understand the *drug* fully, its just a protein found in red meat for those of you who haven't studied it) and I weigh about 195lbs, 6ft tall with almost no fat on me.  Thats my background information.<br>
<br>
Anyone who truly desires to lose weight and is willing to put effort into learning the necessary knowledge to do so (i.e. don't just go listening to some video tape crap) understands that first of all &quot;metabolism&quot; is a word that represents how much energy your body uses in a day.  Now, every person has slight variations in their personal metabolisms from other people, but the MAJOR contributor to metabolism is what you do throughout your day.  The more you work, the higher your metabolism.  Therefore, the more you exercise, the more energy you burn in a day, and thus the higher your metabolism is.  On a general scale, fat people do not have &quot;low&quot; metabolism because of the way their body uses energy, but instead because of the lack of &quot;work&quot; they do in a day.  Now, thats not entirely true, but remember I said the &quot;MAJOR&quot; contributor to this is your work.  There are 3 ways that I know of in which you can increase your daily metabolism, one of which I believe the Atkin's diet effects:<br>
<br>
1:  You exercise more, thus burning more energy per day.  This can include running, walking, jogging, riding a bike, being more active in some sort.<br>
<br>
2:  You increase muscle mass.  It is a well-known fact that the more muscle tissue your body has, the more upkeep it requires, thus your body burns more energy throughout the day to maintain that muscle tissue even if you are not exercising.  This is a great side-effect of doing &quot;harder&quot; workouts and exercises because its sort of a &quot;double bonus&quot;.  The one of the exact reasons for this higher maintenance is that your muscle cells are larger than before.  Its important to point out that once you are born and developed, you never grow another muscle cell for the rest of your life, they only get larger.  By larger, chemically this means two things: more water retention (about 98% of the reason they get larger), and by numerically more mitochondria (the powerplant part of the cell that produces energy for the cell to function).  Whenever a system has more &quot;powerplants&quot; it requires energy to feed each and every one of those &quot;powerplants&quot; and thus muscle tissue requiring more energy to exist.<br>
<br>
3: This last way that I know of is affected by Atkins diet (I believe).  In highschool football camps, often coaches tell their teams to &quot;eat lots of red meat&quot;.  The reason they do this is because there is a belief (one that I think is pretty true based on what I have seen in results, but I don't know if there is &quot;scientific proof&quot; or not) that the more red meat you eat, the more muscular you will become.  When you stuff your body with protein, it reacts by trying to put that protein to its natural use...creating more tissue...particularly muscle tissue.  By strictly eating more protein alone one can increase their body strength and muscle mass, although I think this is limited to a certain extent.  Any further desire for development would require some sort of workout and exercise.  With the Atkin's diet you are feeding your body a ton of protein and no other sources of energy.  What your body will try to do first is create more muscle tissue to put the protein to good use.  This will cause a higher metabolism and *some* loss of weight.  Now, since there is a lack of carbs, your body will then feed off of either body fat or the extra protein that is left over from digestion.  Protein gives just as many calories per gram as does carbohydrates...so there is no actual loss of weight due to lack of energy (i.e. body feeding on itself) but instead most of the loss of weight will come from the increase in muscle tissue.  This, of course, is highly subject to how much intake you have and I don't know the specifics on what intake should be for the Atkin's diet.  It is also worthy to note that fat produces 9 calories of energy per gram, so it should also be restricted intake as well.  However, if your diet strictly becomes protein and fat, and you dont eat carbs and dont have those carbs replaced by some other energy source, then such a diet is easily seen to work due to 1/3 to 1/2 of net calorie intake loss.<br>
<br>
The key to ANY diet is to realize that EVERY person's metabolism 100% is affected by your intake and your output.  No matter what ANYONE says, your body fat is directly proportional to the net of calories you consume minus the net calories you burn.  If you consume more than you burn, you gain weight.  Scientifically and physically there is no other possible solution.<br>

<br>
A very common myth that it &quot;raises your metabolism&quot;.  If by metabolism you mean in a short period of time then yes you do it more frequently through the day, but for shorter intervals.  Technically speaking in losing weight, its better to eat larger meals less frequently throughout the day.  Why?  Because a larger meal takes much more energy to break down than a smaller meal, and its not proportional.  To make my point I will use some bogus numerals:  If you ate 5 lbs of food it would take 500 calories of energy to fully break it down, but if you ate 2.5 lbs of food it would take you 100 calories.  Now, of course I just made those numbers up, but the *point* is accurate.  The reasoning is along the same lines of why it takes a car so much more energy to go 50 miles an hour compared to 40...because of added wind resistance.  In the case of our stomach, its the extra energy required to &quot;churn&quot; our food and also the disproportionate difference in surface area to volume of the food in the stomach.<br>
<br>
There is no actual evidence that eating lighter/more frequent meals is better for losing weight, and infact only evidence against it.  Its really just a common myth.  Overall your net metabolism remains the same (higher when you eat, lower when you don't...but stays high for much less time when you eat smaller portions since it has to convert less food at each interval). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makino>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 247<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 5:11:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://roforums.dhs.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/Avatars/mage-female.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> I don't argue with the results of the Atkins diet which is to lose weight, but cmon, it can't be healthy for you, as health is more than just how much you weigh.<br>
<br>
Anyways, when i first arrived overseas, I had to regain my former figure, so I had to cut down the amount I would eat in one sitting (no more gorging myself ala american style), and more exercise.  I love carbs so I eat tons of those (gotta have that white rice) and I love eating fatty meaty food...  My key was I would cut my meal size to about half of what it was.  Although I wasn't full when I was done eating, I was still satisfied (not hungry)  End result after a year, I can run on the treadmill for an hour and I fit into a size 2.  Plus I eat all the same food I did before, just not as much ^_^<br>

<br>
I guarantee your parents are not both 100lbs of pure fat overweight.<br>
<br>
Now - genetically 'skinny' people can do no exercise and eat like crap and get 'fat' (usually not like Rosanne Barr fat, but that pudgy lumpy look).  I called it &quot;EQ Ass&quot; and suffered from it myself when I played this game every waking moment I could (and ordered pizza 4x a week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Genetically 'fat' people can eat REALLY well and exercise hard and be slim - but if they EVER stop a fairly rigorous eating/exercise program, they'll plump right up again.<br>
<br>
Then most people are in the middle - they can eat fairly crappy and exercise a bit and maintain a &quot;not fat&quot; look, but not be super-slim.  <br>
<br>
As for the biology of the atkins diet, I think I summed it up best - your body burns fatty acids for fuel instead of carbs, which is roughly 66% less efficient, so to keep your body at 98.6F and moving all day requires more fat be burned than the equivalent carbs.<br>
<br>
The rest of what countic said is true, but not entirely relevant.<br>
