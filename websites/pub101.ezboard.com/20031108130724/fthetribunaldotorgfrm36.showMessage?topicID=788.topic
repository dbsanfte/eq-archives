Democrats attack the Republican president over a continuing conflict, insisting it cannot be won, as they position themselves for upcoming elections. <br>
<br>
The president acts vigorously in response to a threat to our national survival - exacerbated by the fecklessness and timidity of his predecessor in office. His critics are outraged and unforgiving. <br>
<br>
A retired general is one of the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, although the Army realizes it's winning and continues to support the president. <br>
<br>
Continental European powers, especially France, tacitly back Washington's enemies, jockeying for financial advantage - even approaching open support for the enemy's leader. <br>
<br>
Domestically, subversives and traitors are arrested. Some are handed over to military tribunals. Civil libertarians argue that the U.S. Constitution is being destroyed. <br>
<br>
The nation's intellectual elite cannot bear the president's Western simplicity, rustic mannerisms and lack of polish. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The media attack the president savagely, making fun of his lack of sophistication and even his appearance. Cartoonists lampoon the man even more fiercely than his policies. Leading newspapers and journals insist that his policies are disastrous and that he is unfit to lead the nation. <br>
<br>
Even the British media portray the president as a dangerous lunatic, out of control. <br>
<br>
On Capitol Hill, self-interested members of Congress establish a committee to investigate the president's handling of the war, as well as alleged distortions and corruption in his administration. <br>
<br>
The president's secretary of state is accused of failure and ineptitude, while the cabinet member responsible for the Army has a knack for angering everybody. <br>
<br>
The verdict of the intelligentsia is unanimous: This president is leading the nation into disaster. <br>
<br>
Yet, the people continue to support the man, admiring the very qualities the intellectual elite despises. The president continues to do what he believes is necessary for the nation's security and survival, ignoring his exasperated critics. <br>
<br>
President Bush? No. <br>
<br>
Abraham Lincoln. <br>
<br>
And the approaching elections were those of 1864, not 2004. <br>
<br>
While history will decide whether our current president truly is another Lincoln or merely a revved-up Ford, many of the political parallels are striking - right down to the disputed, three-faction campaign that put him in office (one of the consistent failures of the post-modern left is its inattention to history - perhaps because history rarely supports its views). <br>
<br>
The current attacks on President Bush over who knew what and when, over who supposedly lied and the merit of crucial decisions, are based in politics, not in a sincere concern for our national interests. Lincoln endured nearly identical attacks in an earlier age of mortal threat to our nation. <br>
<br>
The repellent personal attacks on the president, the cartoons portraying him as a mentally deficient cowboy stumbling over his own words, call to mind the vicious cartoons of Lincoln as an ape and a hick. Those whom the scribbling classes cannot destroy through the force of argument they mock and caricature. The personal nature of the attacks upon President Bush are indicative of the failure of attacks based upon issues. <br>
<br>
And why have the policy-oriented attacks upon the president failed? Primarily because they've attacked the wrong policies. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the greatest failing of the intellectual elite and those elements of the media that pander to it is that they consistently underestimate the American people, imagining that the &quot;common&quot; man or woman might be led by the piques and whims of those who never had to sweat for a living and never will. <br>
<br>
College professors, journalists or party operatives who assume that the American people are not smart enough to see into the heart of great matters without the guidance of their betters will always be frustrated by the ultimate common sense, moral force and courage of their fellow Americans. <br>
<br>
The elite regard the masses as politically incompetent, yet the people consistently have been right when the intellectuals were wrong. <br>
<br>
Americans grasp, intuitively and viscerally, that the War Against Terror, of which our campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq were vital phases, is as justified as it is essential. It is the elite, imprisoned still in their Clintonian fairy-tale worldview, who refuse to see that the United States remains in mortal danger from enemies who cannot be appeased, persuaded or deflected. <br>
<br>
No congressional committee ever won a war, and no columnist ever stopped a terrorist from killing. <br>
<br>
This column does not mean to idolize the president. Indeed, many of his domestic policies give cause for serious concern, from his slight of hand on environmental issues, through his questionable respect for women's rights, to his ideologically driven, ill-timed tax cuts. But his foreign policy is courageous, effective and vital. <br>
<br>
The current flock of interchangeable Democratic presidential aspirants attack the president's strengths, while failing to appreciate his weaknesses. The military equivalent would be a frontal attack across an open field against dug-in machine guns and artillery. <br>
<br>
Instead of reciting their litany of imaginary failures overseas, can't a single Democratic presidential hopeful admit that the potential danger to the U.S. from hate-intoxicated terrorists could one day cause an even greater loss of American lives than did our Civil War? <br>
<br>
In 1864, the people voted overwhelmingly for Lincoln's re-election. Unless a Democratic champion emerges who is willing to abandon petty sniping in favor of genuine leadership, at home and abroad, the American people doubtless will favor President Bush in 2004 - as they did his greatest predecessor. <br>

Name one democratic opponent that is any worse for the economy than this guy. I know it's a popular conception that republicans don't spend like democrats do, but why is it then that our deficit has gone out of the park with every republican in recent history?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - if this were a race between Lieberman and Bush Sr., I would have to go with Bush Sr. for his foreign affairs expertise and his track record of giving the military what it needs. In fact I think a Bush Sr is just what we need at this point in time with all the chaos in foreign affairs (or a Colin Powell, but that isn't going to happen). <br>
<br>
I am not anti-republican,  I am just anti-Bush Jr and with the deficit at 600 billion (455 billion with SS surplus used to offset) and Bush thinking the answer to every fiscal problem is a tax cut, I just don't see how you can think any of the democrats could do much worse. Hell, I don't even think Jimmy Carter could do worse than this guy on the economy (foreign affairs is another story).<br>
<br>
I am not thrilled with our choices at this point either, but with the exception of Kucinich, I don't think any of them could do much worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
I really hope Colin Powell will run for President at some point though.<br>

I tend to vote the issues and the platform.  I actually said back in 96 that Dole would have won if he hadn't caved to the religious right (changing his official stance on fundamental items like Abortion, etc).  i'd possibly even have voted for him - Clinton's first term was a disappointment for me in many ways (nothing at all to do with any of the &quot;scandals&quot; attached to him - he just had a slow start, with messes like national healthcare).  Interesting that in today's political climate, that platform would have easily won the election for Dole.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I agree most of the dems wouldn't be worse for this country economically or in international politics.  My real fear is ending up with someone unelectable (read: someone even *I* wouldn't vote for).  I have issues with far left social programs as much as I do with the far right... if at the end of the day its voting between some warmonger and some ultra-socialist, I'd have a very hard time deciding.  Since none of the democratic candidates right now (serious ones, anyway) are anything like that, I only have to hope they come up with one who has a shot at actually winning an election.  Hillary isn't ready yet - too many out there who hate her.<br>
<br>
I can't agree enough, however, that I'd vote for Powell.  Hell, I'd consider campaigning for the guy if his platform was moderate enough.   All the way through the run-up to Operation Revenge Daddy, he was the only one who seemed genuinely interested in working with our allies, having evidence that compelled action, etc.  Sadly, he seemed to GENUINELY believe that there was justification for the war - in fact, his strong support was one of the reasons I kept hoping the government had evidence/proof they weren't sharing which would become clear after the war.  <br>
<br>
Seeing as how their &quot;bullet proof&quot; evidence appears to have been a lot of supposition, I wonder how much of that Powell was really aware of.  There was serious tension between Wolfowitz/Rummy and Powell leading up to the war, with splits in Bush's cabinet...  I have to admit i've been secretly hoping Powell would quit over this mess, change parties, and run against Bush ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3622<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/03 9:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The prez</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I can't agree enough, however, that I'd vote for Powell.

Well, being the only moderate (that I am aware of anyway) in this administration, it puts him in a tough spot. Can you imagine being the lone voice against Wolfowitz, Cheney, Perle and Libby?<br>

All and all though, I think Colin Powell is the most &quot;common sense&quot; man I have seen in a position that high up in a long time. He's not a dove, he's not hawk, he just deals with shit based on common sense and looking a few moves ahead. He also has the patience it takes to deal with some of these ass clowns running other countries that like to yank the US's chain.<br>
<br>
I really wish it were possible for Bush Sr to run again though. Despite his faults, the one thing he was a master at was statesmanship and I think that is hugely important at this juncture. He was strong without being over bearing and he was good for the military. I don't like his economic policies, but I think homeland defense and dealing with our massive reputation problem is the top priority at this point and that would be right up Bush Sr's alley imo.<br>
<br>
Another Clinton would be good for our issues at home, but Clinton was too worried about poll numbers for me to be comfortable with him sticking it out in Iraq. I know Iraq is going to be a thorn in the side of the US for years to come and there will probably be some cries to pull out, but I honestly believe that would be a huge mistake now that we have done what we've done.<br>
<br>
It's sad when the people you feel would be best equipped for this point in history have no chance of running. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 875<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/03 10:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The prez</span><hr size=1> I agree - one of the real faults of how &quot;political&quot; the US political system has become.  It's no longer a representative government in anything except structure, and certainly the best man/woman for the &quot;people&quot; isn't ever the one elected.  The one with the best name recognition, best PR people, and most money wins.  The founding fathers are rolling in their graves.<br>
<br>
That said, however, Bush Sr. was a moderate who could sure run this country better than his son is.  He lost to Clinton on 3 words:  &quot;read my lips&quot;.  Even though the Clinton era turned out to be fairly utopic for the US (even Arleanna can't claim that Clinton made a worse mess of the US economy than Bush Jr. has, though I agree he wasn't a BOON on the US economy...), I have to wonder how the last 3 years would have gone under Clinton.<br>
<br>
Would 9/11 still have happened?  I would think so, yes.  Bush didn't do anything to directly provoke the terrorists; that attack was probably being planned for YEARS.  However, I think Clinton would have responded in Afghanistan just as Bush did.  The big difference is that he would have gone in as an international coalition.  Say what you want about the US not needing anyone else, or the euros being too &quot;wimpy&quot; to fight, or whatnot, but I'm willing to bet that if Clinton was calling the shot, most of the European countries would have backed us militarily.  WA, you agree?  Pretty hard to say, of course.<br>
<br>
As for Powell's position and actions - I only hope that he doesn't get made to take the fall for any of this political mess growing right now.  Someone's going to (Tenet, but he's too low on the chain), and I don't think Bush has the balls to take out Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, or Cheney.  They're calling the shots and holding his strings... that leaves only Powell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=generalmadine>General Madine</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/03 6:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The prez</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>why is it then that our deficit has gone out of the park with every republican in recent history?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
That's exactly what makes it almost certain it came from high up. Who else would have access to that kind of info? Why would Wilson get on national television and make such a claim without it being true? It is far harder to believe he would lie about this, because if she wasn't outed already, she would be after the claim! Is he going to out his own wife just to give the president a black eye? If he did, how long would it be before the FBI would be knocking on his door with a warrant? I am sure ambassadors have to have security clearance, which means they are bound by the rules of secrecy and can be held accountable for disclosing material or identifying agents. Not to mention I doubt his marriage would last if he were playing stupid games that ruined his wife's career.<br>
<br>
Now you can speculate that she wasn't outed by the White House, but why did it happen at this particular time and what did they stand to gain? Who else would have done this and who else would have had access to the knowledge she was an agent?<br>
<br>
Anybody who is even vaguely familiar with this presidents reputation knows you don't cross this administration and get away unscathed, but they went far to far this time imo.<br>

EDIT<br>
<br>
BTW, the reporter who told him it was two high ranking officials at the White House was Robert Novak, so you have to believe he is lying on the record as well as a former US ambassador. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A> at: 7/22/03 7:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1508<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/03 8:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Did Robert Novak say that these administration officials told him that his wife was a spy, as the AFP article suggests?<br>

MATTHEWS: Let’s talk about the threat that Joe Wilson is raising tonight. He is going to be on the “Today” show tomorrow morning, by the way. And he’s saying that his wife and he were both smeared. In fact, her cover was blown on purpose by the White House to endanger her and pressure him and to send a message to other CIA agents to keep quiet. <br>
       BAER: If that’s true, and it’s yet to be seen, it’s very unfortunate, because she’s finished as a CIA officer. She can’t go overseas. She’ll never be promoted. She will never get a senior management job. Her career is over. I mean, I’ve seen this happen over and over again, and I think it is unfortunate she got... <br>

Now, Wilson files his report about the Niger letter nearly a year prior to the state of the union being delivered.  All of the articles I can find mention that as a fact.  Including in the transcript of that show that loegan just posted:<br>
<br>
&quot;Joe Wilson, tried to warn the administration of just that nearly a year before the speech&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, what gets me is, it seems to be that none of the media outlets are saying that he even bothered to try to contact anyone about it AFTER the information was used in the State of the Union?  <br>

I just don't get it I guess, you would think that being the kind of guy that goes to the media, would have done so like, before/during/after the war at some point before he did?<br>

“Saudi Arabia is more and more an irrational state—a place that spawns global terrorism even as it succumbs to an ancient and deeply seated isolationism, a kingdom led by a royal family that can’t get out of the way of its own greed.

I guess my real problem is that they are laying it at the wrong president's feet, seeing as it was Clinton that was the one that didn't feel like they deserved the funding, and that they had to play nice in the field.

The real reason I am supporting Bush somewhat I guess, is because the media is so intent on attacking him.  And I can honestly say that I fucking DESPISE the media.  Not just Fox or CNN or BBC, but all of the mother fuckers.  I am sick of opinions of guests being presented as facts, of anonymous quotes, of the massive media bias(don't kid yourself, they are all on just about the same degree slant, just going different directions), Of reporters so desperate to scoop the other shows that they report things well before any facts are established, not mentioning that to the viewers of course.  <br>
<br>
To be honest, I am pretty sure when I was in the gulf, maybe like, 2% of the news stories were right.  And 1% of that was geraldo rivera being a fucking dumbass and writing in the sand.  I guess I just wish that they would wait until there were actually some FACTS before they reported the facts to us.<br>
<br>
As opposed to the allegations of anonymous sources that say that unnamed white house officials may have leaked information to the press.  And Bush knew about it, and there are further rumors going around the hill that sources inside the white house are saying he might have even ordered it!<br>
