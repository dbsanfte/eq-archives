<br>
<br>
Nexus- where you zone in there are 4 hallways 3 really 1 is blocked by rocks.. 2 men standing there mumbling something about his brother trapped inside or something..  other 3 Netherbian caves (north) Bazaar(south i believe) and Shadow haven.. (east or west dont remember)<br>
<br>
Bazaar- buy horses here.. cheapest waas 9500pp most expensive i saw was 100k pp also bank buy coffins (woot) and all trade skills here set up al la Thurgadin... nice to have everything u need in 1 zone....<br>
<br>
Shadow Haven- another city type zone... no mobs.. mostly spells for all classes new and old to Luclin... i found a TON of quests havent managed to finish any but i am working on 2 atm 1 i think will give  a sword out as a prize... zones i found off this are echo caves.. paludal caverns... and bazaar...<br>
<br>
echo caves- i didnt get here until late in my day... seemed to have many of those underbulks... some green some light blue ( i am 56) i found an elevator but i didnt go down that way was heading to the next zone... zones off of this... The Deep ( i was told fungus grove i did not see it)<br>
<br>
the deep- fought as a group in the front....all was blue to a lvl 56.. was mostly shriekers.. (mushrooms turn you into mushrooms too) some undead lookin guys and more underbulks... exp seemed phenomenal i didnt go farther than entrance.. ( i do not know what zones adjoin this 1)<br>
<br>
paladul caverns- this zone is really dark and hard as hell to see where you are going... its all noob monsters from what i could tell the bandit types aggroed me at the front of the zone.. but once i swam across the enourmous lake i didnt get any aggro... was more lower lvl underbulks and fungus men some scorpion looking guys too i saw... zone i found off this was Hollowshade Moor<br>
<br>
Hollowshade Moor- seems to be the hunting ground of the new Vahl Shir race.. seemed to be lower level mobs.. ( all aggroed though) saw a new race of mobs the Gremlings ( looks like halflings on dope) these owlbear type monsters... ( i got summoned by a green to me lvl 20 mob bug or new feature i dont know) at pos 1216, pos 3183 is Kitty Citty  and at 3297 neg 2490 is the gremling forest.. i believe.. could be more zones i didnt look that hard <br>
<br>
City of Vahl Shir- Kitty Citty ... new cat people.. its a huge open ended zone.. i got lost a few times in the castle though.. they cond me indefferent although i dont know that anyone starts out KoS to them...<br>
<br>
Grimling forest-  Its full of TONS of Grimling camps... some cast highest con i got was light blue...  they seem to have a large aggro range.. as do the sonic bats i saw there... (whole zone reminded me of the Super Mario levels with the treetops.. 1-3 i think .. lol) heard theres a zone called Acryllic caves off of this zone... i did not find it...  i did find tenebrous mountains at 1500,-844<br>
<br>
Tenebrous mountains-  I spent very little time in this zone zoning in and heading down the left zone wall.. i started aggroeing wildlife like ive never seen.... i had about 5 mobs on me and just started running... al la emerald jungle... heard a caster complaining it took them 10 snares to snare a green mob dunno... at -64,1790 i found Katta Castleum<br>
<br>
Katta Castlum-  HUGE CASTLE was dark when i entered this was the neatest zone for me when i got there... just had that Castlevania type feeling for me i dunno ....lol.... its a city... i did however step on a grave and spawn some zombie like creatures... seemed maybe lvl 30-35 ish... neat zone to explore all NPCs had cool stories to tell also.... at the bottom through some caverns is the zoneline to Twilight Sea<br>
<br>
Twilight Sea- i waited for a boat for 30 minutes said the hell with it and headed back to the Nexus....<br>
<br>
Netheraban caves- noob zone... with lots of fungus.. all green but drop like 4 pp a piece woot!! can zone to Dawnshade peaks and Merus Seru from this zone.... <br>
<br>
Merus Seru- neat looking zone of moon dust type features.. nothing cond me over green was stone type men walking... also all cond me indifferent...<br>
<br>
Santus Seru- its a city.. i just ran through this zone i really didnt get a chance to check it out... zoned right into dawnshade peaks...<br>
<br>
Dawnshade Peaks-  I dont know what to make of this zone.... i see everything conning me green but most aggros and is hard as hell to kill.. even wolfs beat the shit outta you... not sure what lvls would benefit from this zone at all...at 1780 -880 is Greigs End dungeon and at -780,-1761 is Maidens Eye zone..<br>
<br>
Greigs End- ok i have 2 accounts.. a 56 war on 1 and a 51 drood on the other... i check track mostly red and yellow far in.... i med to full buff my war...My warrior goes grabs a single mob some plant cons him green.. im like easy... HELL NO.. this little bastard green mobs.. resists every dot and snare... dispells the shit outta my tank... heals himself all the time and rampages.... i couldnt kill it.... burned a whole mana bar just healing Kez trying to kil it.. it had endless mana... bring a group for this dungeon kiddies...<br>
<br>
Maidens Eye- I am most excited about the possibilities of this zone... outdoor zone for 50 + oooooo i watched  a group killing at entrance seemed to pull mostly singles... i didnt see what they hit for... some mob named Xi Veru or something though is a bad ass mob.. made a lotta ppl run for the hills....<br>
<br>
well thats my last 11 hours of my life in a nutshell.. if i got any names or locs wrong i aplogize im not gettin paid for this was just trying to map out some things to help people =) 2 zones i heard of but didnt find The Grey- i heard it has no atmosphere maybe someone can tell about it.... and Fungus grove... indoor dungeon lots of blue to 60.....<br>
<br>
have fun i hope this summary helps someone out there <br>

Some mobs that are anywhere from 30-50 can summon due to a bug. <br>
<br>
Also, if you're exploring The Grey, be very wary. There are sand worms there that pop up and start attacking you when you move around certain spots of the zone. They range anywhere from light blue to dark blue for me at level 60. <p><html>

<br>
Akveva ruins and Maidens eye zone out- This is the most fun zone that ihave found in a Loooooong time... sits off the wall in Maidens eye  you need to be invis to get in here.. Xi Xaui do not aggro they con indifferent ... but the cent and the turm (alien lookin guys) con scowls and the Xi Xaui will help them once any of these aggro you.... set up a camp at the zone to akheva in Maidens... it is a really nice camp spot.. You get to play old school EQ .. yeah thats right Harmony pulling!!! we hunted there yesterday for 8 or so hours... got lvl 58 palladin shadow knight spells... a 54 shaman spell some really AWESOME loot dropped off these guys too i will do my best to remember all the stats..<br>

<br>
this stuff dropped quite frequently im sure this will be nerfed... at least the drop rates..<br>
<br>
Inside Akveva we fought a bit semed to be a lot of sinle pulls... but things sprouted up from the ground... so hard to tell... still they were mezzable... and areound lvl 51.. I saw Companions talking in ooc about wurms that mana drain your casters.... so be wary of those also...<br>
<br>
Greigs end updated- we tried with a group of 5 to hunt the zone in... all 51+ too you cant see most mobs... when you run and finally get aggro the cond us green or light blue... the must be lvl 40 but they fight like 55's... i see so way any group of 40's could actually hunt here and kill these things... think they will fix this zone...  1 note theres a plant type mob dark sender... omg... i almost fell off the chair... it casts a spell on you looks like boon in the buff box it turns you into mobs and other things.. by the end of the fight i was a vampire... a zombie... a female half elf... a centepede guy... a rockhopper... and wierd thing is i was playing 2 acounts and i was totally different looking on both screens.... its a riot got some good screenshots i will have to upload them to here... If you get a chance to check this out with a group it is worth it just for that alone...<br>
<br>
Ok wife scowling me thats all for now...<br>
