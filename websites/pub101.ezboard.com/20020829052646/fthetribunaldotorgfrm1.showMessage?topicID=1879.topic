<br>
&quot;In twenty words or less, Daisy is a 10 month old dog who was a'ramblin around her neighborhood and happened to wander into a neighbor's yard. Said neighbor didn't much appreciate Daisy's presence, so after a few unsuccessful attempts to shoo her off his property, he got another bright idea. And so, he doused Daisy with gasoline and set her on fire.<br>
<br>
You know, because *that* seems a totally fucking rational thing to do.<br>
<br>
Fort Worth Police responded to the scene, and called the Humane Society of North Texas, who took ownership of the dog. She was then transferred to a 24-hour veterinary hospital, where she remains, in very guarded health.<br>
<br>
Her feet and lower legs must stay bandaged, except for swirling hot tub sessions. Dead and dying tissue has to be massaged and scrubbed from her body after it's softened by the sessions in swirling hot tub. Ointment that should stimulate the tissue to regrow and help fiight infection is applied, followed by yet another bandage. She's in such bad shape that even the lifesaving medicines she needs so desperately can cause her harm in the long run -- the antibiotics she is being treated with to fend off a lethal infection are so powerful she has to be constantly monitored for damage to her kidneys (renal failure). The fire burned all the tissue around her ears and eyes, including her cornea. The vets are still concerned that she may never completely regain her eyesight.<br>
<br>
All because some ASSHOLE decided to set her on fire because he didn't want her in his yard. Like we don't have enough fucked up things in this world to deal with already.<br>
<br>
As a testament to this dog's unbreakable spirit and willingness to please, less than two weeks after this encounter with unspeakable cruelty, Daisy is up and walking (on burned paws) under her own power, managing to eat and drink for herself, and even managed a tail wag from time to time.<br>
<br>
I've been in contact with Jamey Cantrell, the operations manager for the Humane Society of North Texas since last week, and was able to speak with him regarding Daisy's progress, and her ever increasing bill for her care.<br>
<br>

Thank you for wanting to help Daisy, Ernie.<br>
<br>
Daisy is still in critical condition at a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital. She is eating and drinking on her own, however there is still the possibility of renal failure and/or a lethal infection. We are praying that she will make a full recovery, but that is not certain at this time.<br>
<br>
There is no way for us to accurately estimate her veterinary bills at this time. She will be in the hospital for a long time, but she could also need numerous skin grafts before she is fully healed. We had a similar case in 1997 and that dog's vet bills added up to well over $8,000. I wouldn't be surprised if Daisy's bills were that much or even more. Any amount you can help us raise will be greatly appreciated.<br>

What else can I say?<br>
<br>
There are many of you out there who don't agree with me on many key issues of the recent months -- our reactions to terrorism, hippies displaying flags incorrectly, the Pledge of Allegiance, just to name a few. In fact, plenty of you consider me an asshole, and that's okay with me. But I think we all can agree that you don't set a fucking dog on fire.<br>
<br>
Those of you who are longtime members of EHOWA know that you can usually count on both ears the number of times that I ask you to reach into your own pocket for money. Those of you who are new, will learn this soon enough.<br>
<br>
I am hereby adding Daisy to that list of things worthy of our focused attention.<br>
<br>
I am personally asking each and every one of you, to please, reach into your pocket and donate a few dollars to the Humane Society of North Texas to help pay for the cost of Daisy's care. While it is too late to prevent Daisy from being attacked, it is not too late to help control the amount of lasting damage that was done. You can donate money to them via two ways...<br>
<br>
1. The easiest of course is via Paypal using this link...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=hsnt@hsnt.net">/www.paypal.com/xclick/bu...t@hsnt.net</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2. Send a check via US Mail to...<br>
<br>
Humane Society of North Texas<br>
ATTENTION: DAISY c/o HSNT<br>
1840 E. Lancaster Avenue<br>
Ft. Worth, Texas 76103<br>
<br>
If you do make a donation to Daisy, and I sincerely hope that you all do, please drop me a note to daisy@ehowa.com I'd like to keep a running tally of the amount of donations from EHOWA subscribers. I'll be dedicating a page on EHOWA to keep everyone informed of Daisy's most current status and post any updates I receive from other sources.<br>
<br>
My thanks to Brad for bringing this to my attention, and to veterinarian Dr K. Head (longtime EHOWA subscriber) for getting the inside scoop and breaking it down into &quot;dumb speak&quot;.<br>
<br>
I thank you all in advance for your generosity.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
Why?  Why is it worth it?  The dog is half burned.  Thousands of dogs are put to sleep in the pound each year because people don't want them.  They are perfectly healthy.  Why waste all the money to care for a dog that will probably never be able to see very well, and will be scarred forever, when you could save a perfectly healthy, younger dog.  Probably more than 1, on $8000+... heh.  <br>
<br>
I guess Americans don't feel it necessary to be kind until something unusually cruel happens.  You can't give money to a bum, because he will blow it on booze, but if someone beats up that same bum, watch the fucking checks &amp; donations roll in.  <br>
<br>
Now, I'm still not saying that it would be bad to try and save the dog, I'm just saying... you could save more (and stop the suffering) if you just put Daisy to sleep and helped some different dogs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uh0gfather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>H0gfather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/10/02 5:36:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1879.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If you own a lead pipe...</span><hr size=1> [quote]It will never be right again and in human years its over 60.

Oh ffs, stop acting self-righteous.

Arguing that they should put that same amount of money into some other countrie's pockets is useless. Yer paying 13 dollars a month for a video game, getting snacks from the Dairy Queen, and buying clothes from The Gap, too ain't ya? One could argue that that money could be going to the &quot;right&quot; cause too. It'd be no less extreme.<br>

Anyways, I had a guy get mad at my dog for the exact same reasons a long time ago. He shot him in the head with an arrow. He was blinded in one eye for the rest of his short life. My dad got mad at the guy, and didn't use a lead pipe, but did use his fists heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukelaanwoodelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KelaanWoodElf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/10/02 9:00:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1879.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/ebeechey/kelaanavatar1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If you own a lead pipe...</span><hr size=1> How charming of you to swear at me, Snibbs.
