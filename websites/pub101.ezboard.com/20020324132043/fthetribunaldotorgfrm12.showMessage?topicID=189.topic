             It means that the larger guilds can get a hair up there ass and decide to mobilize immediately and pull a Planar Raid. It means that the smaller guilds who must have allies and time to plan the planar raids are dicked. We schedule a raid 2 weeks in advance. Get the date and time set and get coordinated with the allies. On the set date and time we mobilize and zone into an empty plane or a plane with a larger guild already raiding............ First Come First Serve really sucks royal dick.<br>
        I pay the same amount per month as a member of a large guild. Does this mean I deserve the same equipment as a E/V or a VV or RNG? No! But it should mean I deserve the same opportunity to get said equipment. FCFS basically take my opportunity out the game.<br>
         So lets see...... I think I have good enough skills to join and be an asset to any guild on the server. I am an adept 47 Iksar shaman with weak equipment but still a 197 wisdom. Through my experiences in game I will be so bold as to state that I am one of the better healers on Tribunal. And at my current level its hard to play a shaman healer so thuswise I now have a 24th level cleric i am leveling up because I hate getting stuck healing with a shaman with greater heal. Yes I will be so bold to say that I have skills good enough to be an asset in any guild. So I should then apply to one of these larger guilds like KoT or RNG or VV or hell even the Comps, Eletists or Vagrants................<br>
        Alas tho i cannot. Even tho I may play 4-8 or more hours a day i am still just a casual gamer. I love heart racing raids, getting through a seemingly impossible battle, and even the occaisional hard fought but still wiped out battles. But I also like to sit around and make sow potions etc, group with a few friends, work on trade skills , or just run around buffing newbies and fucking off.<br>
          FCFS sucks royal dick. It takes the democracy out of the game and hurts players like me. It makes the Big guilds bigger and it destroys the small guilds. Bring back the Planar schedule and get rid of FCFS. The schedule is not unfair to the big guilds. It just makes them plan raids like the rest of us and gives everyone an EQUAL opportunity for the good stuff.<br>
            I am not so presumptious as to think that I deserve the same equipment that the E/V's wear because I pay the same per month as them. I will however ASSERT the idea that i deserve the same OPPORTUNITY as them and FCFS destroys my opportunity.<br>

hmmm seems to me that when a plane pops , you have exactly the same opportunity as any other tom, dick, or harry who wanna go...you just have to do it fast (just like they do). <br>
<br>
you DONT need a friggin big guild to clear a plane, you need a few well balanced grps is all to clear standard armor mobs (ie. not epic mini-bosses). <br>
<br>
Just keep tabs on when a plane was last cleared and have a few grps of friends *ready* to break in by time repop occurs, it aint hard to do.<br>

Wah Wah, I dont have enough time to do this, Larger guilds are quicker, and do the things they want to, Wah Wah, they ruin it for me.<br>
<br>
This is a game moron, and more over this is a large scale game involving massive amounts of people. Your goals might not be the same as 99% of the server, but you feel it is your right to make the rest of the server bend to your whims.<br>
<br>
You said it yourself, you enjoy raids, but you also enjoy making sow potions and buffing newbies, so why ya bitching? You choose to do the things you do. When you zone into Guk and you see there is a list for the Lord, do you bitch? Its the same fucking thing with planes, they just repop on a longer time period. You zone in, the plane is empty, too fucking bad, someone else playing this game, paying their money also, had the skill and time to go clear it. <br>
<br>
Why should people wait on you? Do you play Monopoly and ask people not to pass GO while you are in jail because it just aint fair, they are gaining while you are stuck. Stop everyone, this 47 shaman needs her gear, lets all stop playing the game we want to, so she can be coddled.<br>
<br>
You speak about Democracy, but do you even understand what the fuck you are talking about? Its a fair system, but the Majority Rules, and a majority of the players are smarter then you, and more dedicated then you and have a whole lot more time on their hands.<br>
<br>
Are you the same person who wants a welfare check the same size as a CEO of Nike because it is only fair, he has a better education, took advantage of oppurtunities, and made the best use of his time, you however sit on your fat ass and whine how life is so unfair and how you cannot compete, so lets make the winners slow down.<br>
<br>
You are the type of person who during a race would be losing and cry out, HEY GUYS UP FRONT, STOP, LET ME CATCH UP, LETS MAKE IT FAIR, or even better, HEY GUYS, STOP, LETS PLAN HOW WE ARE GONNA COMPETE....<br>
<br>
In your world you feel jilted and wronged by the larger guilds, the quicker guilds, but in fact you should get better yourself. Only the strong survive. Listen, there was a guy named Merton who used to comment on shit like this when he was a fucking nobody, ya know what, he stopped posting on some subjects and then fucking played the game, leveled up, learned what it took, and earned alot of people's respect. He stopped bitching and did. He worked for his dinner, and if I see Merton I am happy because I know he aint bitching how unfair all this shit is. He leveled the playing ground for himself, he made himself smarter, stronger, and sleeker.<br>
<br>
Keep moaning about your 197 wisdom and you killer healing skills and wonderful shamanistic talents, and how if only you had the chance to get stuff you would dominate....please...give me a break. You have your chance, everytime you enter the game you have a chance at something, its up to you to grab that chance, you have to go to it, stop waiting for the shit to come to you.<br>

Darkmask, in all your attempts to gain credibility I would ASSERT the idea that you are not the vast well of intelligence you so desperately want everyone to believe. <br>
<br>
You said in your post, &quot;and a majority of the players are smarter THEN you.&quot; Well, Darkmask, Krickett has well thought out ideas and solid arguments.<br>
<br>
Without giving you my thoughts on what qualifies intelligence, Darkmask, you have no right to ASSERT that someone is of lesser intellect to you when you cannot even grasp simple grammatical concepts. Written correctly, the quote I made from your post should read, &quot;and a majority of the players are smarter THAN you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Your art rocks, Darkmask. The INTELLECT to create such works must be great. You are way out of your depth, however, to be critical of someone for their well thought out ideas when the credibility of your words fall short of what someone who is trying to TEACH should maintain as a basic standard.<br>
<br>
But I guess opinions are like assholes Darkmask. We've all got 'em. (ack should I not have started a sentence, let alone a paragraph with but?)<br>

<br>
Otherwise, we're in the same boat as you are.<br>
<br>
We plan raids just like everyone else, and we plan them up to several weeks in advance including some Planar raids.<br>
<br>
Yes, larger guilds do sometimes have pickup raids that *LOOK* like Guild raids, but they're really just people asking in /gu &quot;Hey, you guys want to go to X&quot;.  That's a communication advantage, nothing more.<br>
<br>
Lots of people have Pickup raids.  In fact, we've lost planes several times because a pickup raid is already there.<br>
<br>
There is *nothing* to stop you from organizing a planes raid.  Just whip out your friends list, send a crapload of tells, and get everyone to portal/gfay/whatever.<br>
<br>
I've personally organized DOZENS of pickup raids with members from multiple guilds, including Fear, Hate, PoG, Air, Dragon necropolis, Juggs, Shrooms (when I was too low to do single groups), Epic raids...<br>
<br>
If you want to restrict your raid to guildmembers only or Alliance members only, that's a restriction you impose on Yourselves.  There are drawbacks to being in a small guild, and one of those is the smaller resources.<br>
<br>
As for planning 2 or 3 weeks in advance, do what most Larger guilds do... Plan an event for a day, have a *BACKUP* plan, and have a THIRD option in the back of your minds.<br>
<br>
I'm sure EVERY guild has had More than their fair share of days where Mob X/Plane X was already taken even when we planned it as an event.<br>
<br>
For us, a typical day might go like this...<br>
<br>
Me:  Sorry, Fear cancelled, RNG/Comps/EV/etc already in plane.<br>
Guildmember:  Dam.  What's the plan now.<br>
Me:  According to the schedule, if Fear's full we do Hate.<br>
Guildmember2:  I heard SI/SP/Revo is planning on going up.<br>
Me:  Are they at Gfay already?<br>
Guildmember2:  18 in Gfay.<br>
Me:  Okay, Hate cancelled.  Has anyone checked to see if X, Y or Z are up?<br>
Guildmember2:  Nothing on Track, X not up.<br>
Guildmember1:  Mob Y was killed by AN/SL last night.<br>
Guildmember2:  Dam, another week till respawn.<br>
Guildmember3:  Z Mob is UP!  Nobody there yet.<br>
Me:  Alright, everyone haul your asses to zone X.<br>
<br>
Yah, us larger guilds are just running over everyone.  8P<br>

<br>
You're just not getting it.<br>
<br>
Large guilds are succesful in raid endevors due to the fact that they have the numbers of willing and dedicated members to mobilize when a call goes out.<br>
<br>
Does that make them better then you?  Not really, hell, it doesnt even mean they are better players then you, that's really beside the point.<br>
<br>
In EQ, as with alot of things in life, you're rewarded for the time and effort you invest.  If player A logs 80 hours a week on EQ, and Player B logs 10 hours on EQ a week, who has more opportunities to lvl and gather equipment?  Player A, of course.  It's the same way with guilds.  If you're in a guild with 80 members, and you need 16 to complete and Encounter, you've a much better chance of getting 16 people on the ball to go then if you're in a guild with 20 people.<br>
<br>
The advantages to being in a smaller guild are numerous, if it's the style of play you're looking for, and contrary to popular belief, the planes ARENT perma-camped, so even a small guild or alliance can go up and get there feet wet... However, you can not honestly look me in the face and tell me you DESERVE anything when you're not willing to make the sacrifices to achieve it.  If you want to constantly raid, then suck it up and change guilds.  If you're happy with the familiarity of a close knit smaller guild, then deal with the fact that, you ARE NOT going to have the same opportunities that a guild of double, or triple your size and lvl can accomplish.<br>
<br>
You can't ask others to slow down so you can play at your pace.  There's very agressive people in this game that take their hobby quiet seriously, and they arent going to wait until you're ready.  If you need to schedual events, plan multipuls, if fear is camped try hate, if its camped move somewhere else.  As much as I enjoyed schedualing while it lasted, I think it crippled alot of guilds motivation and made them soft. <p>~Craeven Eveningshadow<br>

<br>
The answer is gettign access to numbers yourself without haveing to leave your guild for it<br>
<br>
gain the same advantage they have and level the playing field<br>
<br>
There are friends lists sure...but perhaps you should consider alliances...with more then one guild lets say<br>
<br>
or perhaps a guild of guilds...with many guilds being members...sharing the same message board designed specifically for communication between guilds<br>
<br>
govern this multi guild alliance with a couple of members from each guild that sits on a panel that makes calls via a vote when needed<br>
<br>
think about it...5 tells and you have 5 guilds at your beck and call for support for that epic mob you thought you never had a shot at<br>
<br>
if a guild gets greedy and fucks someone over...kick them out...bam..they are helpless...quite a deterent<br>
<br>
since there is no &quot;punishment&quot; (official allainces had to share booking dates and could not claim days for thier guild alone) for alliances anymore now that booking is out, then it is just a numbers game now....stop looking at the limitations and look at the possibilities<br>
<br>
it also solves the problem of faction conflicts within guilds...anyone can choose what faction they want and still find support for it without having to find a new guild <br>
<br>
and you might just keep those 55+ members in your small guild...because they wont HAVE to find a bigger guild because they are tired of kicking frogs in sebs every night...new frontiers will open up to all the members of this multi guild alliance<br>
<br>
stop complaining and start making things happen for yourself<br>
<br>
dont expect things to change just because things arent fair...life doesnt work that way...EQ certainly wont<br>

If you restrict yourself to encounters with only your guild (from a small guild perspective, exceptions possible), you restrict your chances for encounters. If you include friends outside the guild, and have alternate plans, your success and fun goes up.<br>
<br>
For example, yesterday, my guild had planned with friends, to go to CoM and try to get a jade reaver for one of our druids. When we first showed up, Southern Legion was already there, so our plans seemed like they would change. Plan B was hate. We had the classes, we had the levels, and the time. Plan C, in case Hate was already camped, was to go to Kael, and work on some drops. Before either plan b or c could be started, SL left CoM, and we moved in for our morning of fun and CR.<br>

<br>
While a small guild doesn't have the flexibility of a large one because of the limited numbers of things they can do. However, if spending time with your fiends is what you are after, then you can turn many areas into a guild event. If you are capable of Fear and Hate, it wouldn't take too much effort to send a raid deep into chardok, HS, WW dragons, or even Seb, now that everyone's flocking to Velk. Sure, these areas can be done with 1 high level group, but very rarely are they attempted.<br>
<br>
Like many pointed out before, always have alternatives if the first choice does not work out. I understand that as a member of a small guild, there are only a limited number of places and mobs you can handle. We were all part of small guilds at one point. However, if your intent is to spend time with friends and enjoy the small guild atomasphere, then organize a raid into less populated areas and have fun.<br>
<br>
One final note. The guilds directly in competition with you for areas like Fear, Hate, and PoG are most likely mid sized guilds, or other small guilds. I can't remember the last planned raid RNG had for them, we normally just do pickup raids. Therefore, it is not a large guild vs small guild issue, but a competition between peers.<br>

You say that you've never been to these places before?  Or very rarely and maybe not very deep?  Well, that's part of the thrill.

                 Your post proves you to be a pompous, pretentious, pontificating, assupmtive, anal expulsive, dimwitted dumb fuck. If you are going to insist on posting such utter bullshit laced with the blatant mis-representation of the facts as you have done then I have no choice but to take carte blanche and prove you to be nothing more than I stated above.<br>
<br>
***snip*** When you zone into Guk and you see there is a list for the Lord, do you bitch? Its the same fucking thing with planes...*****<br>
           Wrong Asshole, If I zoned into GUK and there is a list for the Lord I request my name be put on the list then wait my turn to come around. Same thing I used to do for the planes but pud thumpers like you did not respect the planar list so it was abandoned. Thank you for re-inforcing my argument about scheduling and list being the right way.<br>
***snip*** Are you the same person who wants a welfare check the same size as a CEO of Nike because it is only fair, he has a better education, took advantage of oppurtunities, and made the best use of his time, you however sit on your fat ass and whine how life is so unfair and how you cannot compete, so lets make the winners slow down.*****<br>
            No fuzz nuts. I want a welfare check the same size as the CEO of microsoft. How fucking stupid can you be. Did I not get the education he got because a bunch of uber fuckwads like yourself rushed to the colleges and filled them up and took all the courses and left nothing for me??? I had the OPPORTUNITY for the same education as he. Whether or not I seized the OPPORTUNITY is another matter. Once again, if you are going to make comparisons try to make them so they reinforce your argument and not mine.<br>
***Snip***You are the type of person who during a race would be losing and cry out, HEY GUYS UP FRONT, STOP, LET ME CATCH UP, LETS MAKE IT FAIR, or even better, HEY GUYS, STOP, LETS PLAN HOW WE ARE GONNA COMPETE..***<br>
       Once again you prove your ignorance with some stupid comparison that makes absolutly no fucking sense when you consider you are susposedly replying to my post. If I am loosing a race I WOULD NOT cry out stupid shit to the guys up front. Why? Because we started at the same time. I had the OPPORTUNITY to win. My being not good enough to win is a totally differant matter. <br>
***Snip***Keep moaning about your 197 wisdom and you killer healing skills and wonderful shamanistic talents, and how if only you had the chance to get stuff you would dominate....please...give me a break. You have your chance, everytime you enter the game you have a chance at something, its up to you to grab that chance, you have to go to it, stop waiting for the shit to come to you.****<br>
         Did you even read my post? When did I whine about a 197 wisdom? When did I say if I only had the stuff I would dominate? Let me tell you about my stuff oh Darkmask the Dis-Illusioned. Every piece of equipment I own I got it entirely on my own with the exception of 1 piece. I had guild help getting my Jarsath leggings. My 197 wisdom is something I am proud of not something I would whine about.Further more, I stated I was an adept shaman and one of the better healers in the game. No where did I say I would dominate if I had the chance to get stuff. <br>
            You attempt to derogate and subvert my post with your in-ablilty to comprehend what is written. Your attempt to re-invent my post has failed and you have proved yourself to be nothing more than a simpleton. Personally I find you to be nothing more than an un-educated, illiterate, uncomprehensible, offensive PREPUCE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utalamaycrystalspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talamay Crystalspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/5/01 11:26:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=189.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FCFS Sucks Royal Dick</span><hr size=1> oh no you're in a small guild and can't beat the larger guilds to the planes.  whaa whaaa cry me a fucking river.  get off your asses and organize faster then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umandoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/5/01 12:22:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=189.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FCFS Sucks Royal Dick</span><hr size=1> First Come First Serve OWNS YOU!<br>
