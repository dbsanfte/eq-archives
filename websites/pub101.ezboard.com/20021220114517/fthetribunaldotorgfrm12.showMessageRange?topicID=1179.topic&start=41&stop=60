dont get me wrong, i have no bias to anyone based on anything to do with sex or race, but why the hell should a company hire someone to keep the % of male to female, or black to white in line with a governement set quota? especially when someone else can do the job better?<br>
<br>
<br>
city i live in has an example of this, friend of mine wants to be a cop (mainly for the free pot).  he is a white male in his mid twentys.  he has about a zero chance in hell of gettin into the academy.  where as a white female, black male or black female of the same age has a damn good chance of getting into the academy just because the city government wants to keep the minority % in line.  doesnt matter what kind of cop the ppl would make.<br>

I'm not a militant feminist, I'm not out to change the world in a day.  All I can do is manage the things that happen in MY life and hope that my words and actions might change some thoughts in others' minds.  <br>
<br>
There are enough men out there that respect women as peers and not subordinates.  No need to punish the masses for the idiots among them.  I just ignore the idiots.  <br>

Until that happens, they aren't worth worrying about. As a society we are getting more open-minded and equal as the years pass, although there are still lots of changes that need to happen, I think it's pretty fair to say that we are at least on the right track.<br>
<br>
Since people brought up militant feminists, I've had a rather amusing encounter with some. It was a strategic planning meeting for a women's non-for-profit organization run by self labled feminists. They were so &quot;anti-establishment&quot;, as they called it, that they wanted to re-write a proposal for a grant AFTER they've already GOT the grant. Somewhat frustrated and to be honestly quite shocked, I reminded them that they would have to reapply for the grant if they rewrite their proposal. Their reason was &quot;we are feminists, we are not supposed to be main stream.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was quite speechless after that. When the need to identify oneself with one's supposed rebellion overshadows logic and reason, then it's time to take a step back and start thinking. <p><BR>

 I'm not a militant feminist my beliefs are pretty simple.  If I'm the best person for the job hire me even if I can't pee standing up.  If I can do what you can do; pay me the same fucking pay.  Give me the same chances at promotion.  Not more of a chance not less of a chance the SAME.  If I can't do the job find someone that can.<br>
<br>
 So far the examples of reverse sexism given are in shit jobs..  With teenage boys vs... grown women.  Please find me a nice high paying job where where this happens and don't forget to provide me with directions and maybe an application form... Thank you.  <br>

i agree with ya on the second paragraph Chantci, and although i cant list any other examples other than the cop one with my friend, i do believe it happens just like affirmative action backfired.  an employer is scared about having a lawsuit come down based on descrimination so he/she hires the female over the male.   I say screw that, hire the best for the job. <p><CENTER>

<br>
Every gender and race is equal in it's ability to persecute others. The only difference is that it's OK to make fun of white american men and canadians, but any other race or women will get you sued or boycotted. On the sitcom on TV, the black guy walks in and says 'outta my chair cracker' while dumping the guy on the floor, everyone goes 'roofle lolzxorv hahahahehehh.' If a white guy did the equivilent, that'd be the last episode of the show.<br>
<br>
Most of the modern cultures of the world have been male dominated. It's not biased or sexism, it's the truth. So as it stands, most positions of power are still held by men. Bosses, CEOs, politicians, etc. Saying that women do the same things, but they only have the ability to do it in small-time jobs doesn't change anything. Both are sad and pathetic for different reasons and are traits of bad PEOPLE, not bad genders.<br>
<br>
I want people's positions to be determined by their skill and knowledge, not their presense of a cock/skin pigmentation/lack there of. Unfortunately, it's going to be a long time before that happens. In Dallas Texas school systems, whites are a minority. But if you walked around with a 'white pride' T-shirt, all that means is that you'd get killed by more people.<br>
<br>
I don't like the way a lot of men feel about women. I also think that any educated person would prefer to get a job based on their own merit, not just because they're needed to fill a quota. I doubt an employer seriously pays as much attention to someone hired due to quota as they do to a normal employee, even if the quota-baby does more work and a better job of it.<br>

<br>
I live in a predominately white town (something like 97%), and today I was coming home from work, and there was a big pack of black dudes on bikes (they were like 16) in the middle of the street.  I honked and they didn't get out of the way.  This is right in front of my fucking house.  I honked some more, then told them to move before I ran over their Huffies. <br>
<br>
Now, I'm dead.  I'm laying in a pool of blood on the sidewalk outside of my house.<br>
<br>
Life's funny, huh?!<br>
