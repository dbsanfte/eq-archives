Aside from trying to stir up some discussion given the current ethically based threads going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We have no obligation to the world's needy.  Why?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lifeboat metaphor</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are more desperately needy people on the planet than there are comparatively rich.  For the sake of developing the example assume this is in the realm of ~2/3 poor and ~1/3 rich (not exact, but close).<br>
<br>
&quot;Metaphorically, each rich nation amounts to a lifeboat full of comparatively rich people.  The poor of the world are in other, much more crowded lifeboats.  Continuously, so to speak, the poor fall out of their lifeboats and swim for a while in the water outside, hoping to be admitted to a rich lifeboat, or in some other way benefit from the &quot;goodies&quot; on board.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, each lifeboat has a finite amount of people it can hold.  One boat can seat 50 people safely, and 60 people if the safety factor is disregarded.<br>
<br>
Let's imagine we are in one of these lifeboats.  We are safe, along with the other 49 people in the boat, and we are watching 100 other people swimming around outside of our boat.  These people are asking to be allowed to get on our boat and for handouts.  What should we in the lifeboat do?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>One</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, we could take on all 100 of the people.  We now have 150 people on our boat, well past the limit of the boat's carrying capacity.  The boat sinks, everybody drowns.  &quot;Complete justice, complete catastrophe&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Two</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, since there are only 50 people on our boat we could admit 10 more to it.  The downside of this is that we've now crossed the safety threshold, and sooner or later we're going to pay for it.  Not only are we faced with this problem, but we're faced with the additional problem of deciding <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>which</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 10 of the 100 we let on.  How do you decide, and what do you tell the other 90 people treading water?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Three</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, we don't let anymore people onto our boat.  We preserve our safety factor, and ensure the survival of the 50 people already in the boat.  Many people would argue that this option is abhorrent and unjust.  Let's assume that is.<br>
<br>
Some say, &quot;I feel guilty about my good luck.&quot;  &quot;The reply to this is simple: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Get out and yield your place to others.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Such a selfless action might satisfy the conscience of those who are addicted to guilt but it would not change the ethics of the lifeboat.  The needy person person to whom a guilt-addict yields his place will not himself feel guilty about his sudden good luck&quot;, because if he did he wouldn't climb aboard.<br>
<br>
The net result of the guilty people letting go of their unjustly held positions is the elimination of their kind on the lifeboat; the lifeboat &quot;purifies&quot; itself of guilt.  The ethics of the lifeboat persists, unchanged by such momentary aberrations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Reproduction</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The harsh properties of ethics in the lifeboat is increased by reproduction, specifically by reproductive differences.  The people inside the wealthy lifeboats are doubling in population every ~87 years, while the people inside the poor lifeboats are doubling in population every ~35 years, causing the difference in prosperity to become even greater.<br>
<br>
Suppose that all of these countries, and the United States, agreed to live by the Marxian/Christian ideal, &quot;to each according to his needs.&quot;  Needs, of course, are determined by population size, which is affected by reproduction.  Every nation regards its rate of reproduction as a sovereign right.  If our lifeboat were big enough in the beginning it might be possible to life <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>for a while</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by Christian-Marxian ideals. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Might. . . .</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ruin in the Commons</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The intrinsic problem with this &quot;sharing&quot; ethic is that it leads to the tragedy of the commons.  Under a system of private property the man (or group) who own the property recognizes their responsibility to care for it, because if they don't they'll eventually suffer.  For instance a cattle farmer will not allow more cattle in a pasture than what the pasture can take, because if he overloads the pasture weeds take over, erosion sets in, and the farmer loses out in the log run.<br>
<br>
But if a pasture is run as a commons open to all, the right of each to use it is not matched by an operation responsibility to take care of it.  It is no use asking independent farmers in a commons to act responsibly, for they dare not.  The considerate farmer who refrains from overloading the commons suffers more than a selfish one who says his needs are greater; i.e. the nice guy finishes last.<br>
<br>
A social system is stable only if it is insensitive to errors.  To the Christian-Marxian idealist a selfish person is an &quot;error&quot;.  Prosperity in the system of commons cannot survive errors.  If <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  would only restrain himself, all would be well; but it takes <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only one less than everyone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to ruin a system of voluntary restraint.  IN a crowded world of less than perfect human beings mutual ruin is inevitable in the commons.<br>
<br>
Thus, this ideal is counterproductive.  It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sounds</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> nice, but good intentions are no substitute for good performance.  This is the tragedy of the commons. . . .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>World Food Banks</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In the international arena we have recently heard a proposal to create a new commons, namely an international depository of food reserves to which nations will contribute according to their abilities, and from which nations may draw according to their needs. . . . The search for a rational justification can be short-circuited by interjecting the word &quot;emergency. . . .&quot;  What is an &quot;emergency?&quot;  It is surely something like an accident, which is correctly defined as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>an event that is certain to happen, though with a low frequency</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  A well-run organization prepares for everything that is certain, including accidents and emergencies.  It budgets for them.  It saves for them.  It expects them--and mature decision-makers do not waste time complaining about accidents when they occur.<br>
<br>
What happens if some organizations budget for emergencies and others do not?  If each organization is solely responsible for its own well-being, poorly managed ones will suffer.  But they should be able to learn from experience.  They have a chance to mend their ways and learn to budge for infrequent but certain emergencies.  THe weather, for instance, always varies and periodic crop failures are certain.  A wise and competent government saves out of the production of the good years in anticipation of the bad years that are sure to come.  This is not a new idea.  The Bible tells us that Joseph taught this policy to the Pharaoh in Egypt more than 2000 years ago.  Yet it is literally true that the vast majority of governments of the world today have no such policy.  They lack either the wisdom or the competence, or both.  Far more difficult than the transfer of wealth from one country to another is the transfer of wisdom between sovereign powers or between generations.<br>
<br>
&quot;But it isn't their fault!  How can we blame the poor people who are caught in an emergency?  Why must we punish them?&quot;  THe concepts of blame and punishment are irrelevant.  The question is, what are the operations consequences of establishing a world food bank?  If it is open to every country every time a need develops, slovenly rulers will not be motivated to take Joseph's advice.  Why should they?  Others will bail them out whenever they are in trouble.<br>
<br>
Some countries will make deposits in the world food bank and others will withdraw from it: there will be almost no overlap.  Calling such a depository-transfer unit a &quot;bank&quot; is stretching the metaphor of &quot;bank&quot; beyond its elastic limits.  The proposers, of course, never call attention to the metaphorical nature of the word they use.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Ratchet Effect</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The &quot;international food bank&quot; is really, then, not a true bank but a disguised one-way transfer divice for moving wealth from rich countries to poor countries. . . .<br>
<br>
Only under a strong and farsighted sovereign--which theoretically could be the people themselves, democratically organized--can a population equilibrate at some set point below the carrying capacity, thus avoiding the pains normally caused by periodic and unavoidable disasters.  For this happy state to be achieved it is necessary that those in power be able to contemplate with equanimity the &quot;waste&quot; of surplus food in times of bountiful harvests.  It is essential that those in power resists the temptation to convert extra food into extra babies.  On the public relations level it is necessary that the phrase &quot;surplus food&quot; be replaced with &quot;safety factor&quot;.<br>
<br>
But wise sovereigns seem not to exist in the poor world today.  The most anguishing problems are created by poor countries that are governed by rulers insufficiently wise and powerful.  If such countries can draw on a world food bank in time of &quot;emergency,&quot; the population <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cycle</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will be replaced by a population <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>escalator</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The input of food from a food bank acts as the pawl of a ratchet, preventing the population from retracting its steps to a lower level.  Reproduction pushes the population upward, inputs from the world bank prevent its moving downward.  Population size escalates, as does the absolute magnitude of &quot;accidents&quot; and &quot;emergencies.&quot;  The process is brought to an end only by the total collapse of the whole system, producing a catastrophe of scarcely imaginable proportions.<br>
<br>
Such are the implications of the well meant sharing of food and wealth in a world of irresponsible reproduction.<br>

Poor, starving people are desperate people. Desperate people do desperate things like start wars and commit crimes. Desperate people are easily influenced two-bit dictators and religious fanatics. Influenced to do things like strap bombs to their chests and fly planes into buildings. <br>
An end to foreign aid and closing our borders to further immigration are the two obvious points this guy is trying to make, but I think his underlying point is isolationism. But how do we stay isolated in a world where all economies are tied together? We might be the richest country in the world, but we're by no means self-sufficient. Oil's a prime example of this. We have huge amounts of fossil fuels in this country, but we still use more than we have, so we need to import it. And what about resources that don't even exist within our borders? With those resources, we're dependent on the countries that do have them, and if those countries are in the middle of a war, a famine, or a drought, then we're going to have a big problem acquiring the materials we need to keep this country running. It's much easier to trade with a stable country with a healthy populace, than one where we're not even certain who's in charge, and the most likely candidate tells us &quot;Ok, you give me guns and tanks and maybe a couple of jets, and I'll provide protection for the companies and workers you bring in to run the mines.&quot; <br>
As far as immigration is concerned, I agree that it needs to be controlled, but currently, the United States population is leveling off. There are actually forecasts that as the average age of our population increases, there are concerns that we might not have enough workers to replace people who are retiring. So we might actually have to ease immigration restrictions to supplement the workforce. <br>
Of course, these are all current issues to consider. In 25-50 years, we might be dealing with a different situation entirely. Some economists have said that if they play their cards right, the European Union and an Asian bloc consisting of China, Korea, and Japan could each eclipse the United States as economic powers. When and if this happens we'll lose a great deal of the leverage we currently have to shape world events in our favor. They'll be the ones deciding global policies, not us. So ask yourself this question: Would you still agree with this guy if you're one of the people treading water, and not one of the people in the lifeboat?<br>

Yes, if we were became a nation where our biggest contribution to the world was producing babies and starving ourselves I would say that enabling that behavior is not the right thing to do.

Imagine instead of lifeboats, you have 2 species of wild animal.  Species one possesses a selfish will to survive, and will kill and eat their young when food supplies are short.  Species two will starve to death in order to allow their young to survive when food supplies are low.  Which species will emerge as the dominant one?<br>

The analogy isn't about what I would personally do, nor is it about what anyone would personally do.  It doesn't really matter what anyone would personally do.  You're twisting the analogy around in ways it won't and wasn't meant to go.  The problem is a large scale one and it is addressed in such a scope.  It doesn't beg a personal answer because it isn't a personal problem.<br>

AFAIK Alaska is about the last place where there are any reserves to speak of. <br>
<br>
Quoting some numbers : the USA uses 7 bn barrels yearly (20 million barrels daily !) and produces 2 bn. Production has been declining since the 50s and reserves are estimated 4-10 years &quot;if feasible to use every known drop&quot;. You call this &quot;plenty&quot; ?<br>

<br>
you also often pose questions for people to answer when they have given you a question, rather than actualy answering the question.<br>
<br>
you demand that people back up positions held or claims made and never take a position yourself or answer questions given to you.<br>

you do not provide any material to actualy discuss. you seem to want people to talk to themselves while you watch.<br>
