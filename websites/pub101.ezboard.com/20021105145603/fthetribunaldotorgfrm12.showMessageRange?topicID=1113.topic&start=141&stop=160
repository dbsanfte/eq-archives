Doctors then decide he doesn't have to be on his high blood pressure medicine which he'd been on for 28 years. One week later he was dead. In fact where I live Jefferson Hospital is so notoriously bad that there was a multi-car pileup right down the street from it...they life flighted everyone to another hospital 28 miles away rather than take them to jefferson.

This is very true, the biggest example I can think of is that our Normal Saline flush tubes used to be in a package nearly identical to our Albuterol tubes.

This is notorious in the health field.  High hours and low pay for the majority of the low end health care positions.

I agree with this, I've seen placebos function better than the drug it's supposed to be.  But in some cases the placebo does nothing.  It's not a rule of medicine, but an exception that the placebo works, but if you look at a legal aspect, you will get in more legal problems for giving a placebo presented as a treatment for a disease that ends up resulting in a patient's demise than you will prescribing a medication that ends up not working on the patient.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No one has really said anything about the possibility of it being hereditary. Holdan and Dvin, could you give some insight into that theory? Couple of options, as I see it. One is that it is genetic. Period. Not the best answer, in my opinion. Another one, the one I believe is best, is that heredity gives some people a more genetic disposition to cancer, and not taking appropriate measures to avoid it (Excercise, vitamins, etc.) are the real cause. Another option is that it is not hereditary at all, plain and simple. That covers the whole spectrum. In simpler terms, It is hereditary, or it is partially hereditary, combined with a poor lifestyle, or it is not hereditary at all. Again, I don't pretend to have the answer, just my own ideas on the subject.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There is sufficient evidence to support the theory that cancer is as hereditary as heart disease, where it's not necessarily directly hereditary but instead that family medical history is a huge factor in determining risk factors.

Your study and figures as documented in the footnoting refer to a study done over 10 years ago.  Read the footnoting and reasearch the data, the author is quoting an estimate done by a legal firm specializing in medical malpractice lawsuits on data gathered circa 1990.  Footnotes 8-10 all reference the same study, do some research on it and see what legal firm did it and what major lawsuits they have filed in the following 2-3 years.  It's old info.  It's not to date, and the author is rehashing stuff that's already been brought foreward.  In fact, that article is nearly a reprint of the 1993 article in which the information was gathered.  What I'm presenting is that if you had an organization without motivation to skew figures doing the research, it would be more believable.  I do not think using a legal firm who sues people over medical malpractice suits is a good entity to conduct an unbiased poll on how the medical field behaves.<br>
<br>

<br>
The only part of this argument I'm going to concede to you is that it's overdiagnosed.  It's like being Bipolar was in the 70's and 80's, everyone who can't behave in school was Bipolar.  I think that Ritalin is over perscribed, and I don't think that everyone with ADD has ADD, but I do think that some people who have it, have a disorder that is sometimes cured by Ritalin.<br>
<br>
Here is the problem I have with what you have said, Dvin -<br>
Approximately 80 percent of lethal heart attacks can be prevented with prompt treatment (within 12 hours of onset of symptoms) available at most hospitals.<br>
<br>
Approximately 90 percent of fatal Strokes and TIAs can be prevented with prompt treatment (within 4 hours of onset of symptoms) available at most hospitals.<br>
<br>
These treatments cannot be administered after the window of opportunity has been passed.  What you are advocating is that doctors are going to kill you and not let you know what is going on because they haven't learned anything in school.  I fully admit that a healthy diet can't do you much wrong in the health department, but it is my belief that healthy diet and a good working relationship with your doctor go hand in hand for the best medical treatment around.<br>
<br>
If you advocated a good diet alone, I would back you.  But here you have presented that if you have enough oxygen and monitor your pH levels, you are not going to get cancer.  That is simply an unproven hypothesis with no concrete evidence to support it.<br>
<br>
I fully agree when you say ask your doctor to explain everything to you.  Understand that as a patient you have that RIGHT, (as well as the right for treatment without ability to pay) and your other rights are usually posted clearly in large writing near where you enter the hospital.  I strongly advocate that everyone sit and read these next time they are seeing a doctor.  I am constantly frustrated by the number of people who have a medical problem they are taking medication for, but do not know what the problem is or what the medication they are using does.  These are all things that should be done normally.<br>
<br>
If you want to know what I think needs to be done with the medical profession, you should have asked already but I'll tell ya now.  The problem with the medical profession is that I spend approximately 33 percent of my time treating patients and 66 percent of my time writing lengthy paperwork to prevent myself from suffering a lawsuit.  The reality is that the medical profession is nearly paralyzed by the mounting costs of fighting lawsuits and the fear of the possibility of losing your job for doing something correct, but doing the paperwork incorrectly.  Am I advocating that Medical staff be above the law?  No.  But if you look at the way, say, California law works, someone WITHOUT ANY MEDICAL TRAINING can do more harm to you than someone with medical training and be protected from lawsuits via the Good Samaritan law.  Basically, you are only liable if you do something that someone with your training would know better than to do.  If you are walking down the street and your sole medical knowledge is that you have watched ER 3 times and you do something that directly leads to a patient's death, you have little to worry about via liability.  But Medical Professionals have to constantly worry about every step they make from a liability issue instead of a medical issue.  If we could look at patients and go &quot;He needs this, let's do that&quot; instead of &quot;He needs this, let's see how we can give him that and do it legally, then do a bunch of paperwork in case he reacts poorly to the medication and sues&quot; perhaps the medical care in this country would be better.  Examine the figures for lawsuits regarding medical practices, and you will see that the United States has the most medical lawsuits filed in the world... maybe that's the reason sometimes health care here can suck.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I have to go to work now, and work to keep our #3 leading cause of death rates up.  I'll check this thread later.<br>

My son has it.  I was opposed to medication.  His doctor talked me into trying it for him at a low dose just for school in the morning.  I tried it for a week then called his teacher (she didn't know he was on it).  He finished tests, schoolwork, and just the day I called had not only finished his spelling test but got them all right.  It also helped his self esteem to be able to keep up.   Results and weighing risk against reward are what matter to me.  At home he bounces off the walls at times at that is fine with me, but at school he needs to be able to sit and pay attention.  He could not do that without medication at his age.  He will likely be able to do that as he gets older.<br>

It is cureable with diet changes and mental training.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, you can train your mind quite a bit.  Doctors are too quick to &quot;fix&quot; it with drugs.  ADHD and ADD are not &quot;fictious&quot; per-se, but it is way over-prescribed for.  Little boys that are hyper... way too many of them drink tons of Soda and eat lots of things high in sugar, carbohydrates that create excess energy.    Not to mention, boys in general are much more hyper than girls.   Plus, the idea of sitting a 8/9 year old down in school for 8+ hours, where only about 3 hours is useful learning isn't helpful either.  A lot of these kids are just plain BORED because they could learn MUCH faster than it is being taught.<br>
<br>
As for adults... look at your diet, and also look at why your mind wanders.  What did it wander to?  Drugging yourself so you don't care about crap isn't really a good solution, it's just covering the real problem and could be reducing some true abilities of your mind.<br>
<br>
Why put a leash on a highly functional mind?  Part of the problem might be that your mind wants to deal with two tracks of thought at once... for most people this creates a big problem... others can handle the two tracks.  If you can't handle it then learn to recognize it happening and suppressing it quickly.  Due concentration excersises, a very popular one is the Tower of Hanoi.  Do it in your head.  Your mind will commonly try to stray to other things.  Keep working on it until you can complete it quickly in your head without being distracted.<br>
<br>
There are tons of others, but trust me... I had one of the worst cases of concentration issues (now it's called ADD, back then it didn't have a name).  It's self-correctable if you are willing to try.<br>

Everyone around me always knew I was oppressively sad, but noone bothered to take me to a doctor about it until I was 16.  A fluid analysis showed that I had an extremely small amount of seratonin in my central nervous system, and seratonin is the neurotransmitter believed to pass along pleasure and happiness impulses.  So no, I wasn't 'saddled' with depression when I was given responsibilities, the timing just fits because that happened to be the time I decided that, hey, no matter how hard I try to make life better, it doesn't work.

That applies to federally funded hospitals, but private hospitals can and do turn people away based on their ability to pay. Of course, the laws vary from state to state and maybe no hospitals can turn away patients in your state, but they can in some (New York comes immediatly to mind).<br>

<br>
Stimulants make you more aware, they do not cover anything (except fatigue). Before I was put on Ritalin I used to drink almost a 12 pack day of soda... I was self medicating. Caffeine is a poor drug for AD because it causes alot of nervousness.<br>
<br>
True abilities don't really apply to having 3 or 4 things running through your mind at once without the control to focus on just one. Ritalin allows me to do just that with no significant side effects. Like I said, it was like going from listening to 4 stations at once to tuning in on just one. Maybe I could learn to do that without Ritalin, but I am sure it would take a great deal of effort. Why expend all of that energy to control something, when I have the option to take a pill and get on with my life normally?<br>
<br>
Look at it like having chronic headaches. You can learn to function normally under those conditions, but it would take a great deal of effort to get through your day. Why not just take an aspirin that has few side effects and go about your day like every other normal person? <p><br>

Actually, doesn't apply to federally funded hospitals, it only applies to hospitals with an Emergency Room.  For instance, the Veteran's Administration here gets around accepting patients by calling their Emergency Room an Examination Room.  But here, if it has an ER, it has to take you.

I certainly hope you are using Psychologist and Psychiatrist interchangably, as a Psychologist can't give you a perscription.  A Psychiatrist is a Physician with a specialization in Neuralogical problems, so if you haven't seen one yet I'd suggest seeing one now.  Anyhow, have you tried Paxil, Zoloft or Tegretol?  I have heard that those are typically the most effective.  If you haven't tried some of them, I'd suggest seeing if they make any difference...<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> -Yes, that said doctors -- iatrogenic health problems kill approximately 225,000 a year, with prescription medicine side-effects bringing in 100,000 of those deaths -- car crashes kill 40,000 a year and schedule II drug overdoses 20,000<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Okay, here we go.<br>
<br>
First, the sample is small. Although the study started with 4198 deaths, only 111 of them were included in the analysis. The conclusions are based on multiple reviews, but these were conducted for only 62 patients; 59 patients had only 1 review. Second, the problems were not representative. Patients with a small number of fluid, electrolyte, and drug toxicities were oversampled. In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals tend to care for sicker patients, but there was no standardization of disease severity. Third, the magnitude of the adverse event problem appears even worse if the quality of care that led to death is taken into account. The authors reported that 10.2% of deaths rated &quot;borderline in care&quot;; 22.7%, &quot;possibly preventable by optimal care&quot;; 6.0%, &quot;definitely preventable&quot;; and 6.0%, &quot;substandard&quot;together leading to an unacceptable 44.9% of care deemed suboptimal or worse.<br>
<br>
An earlier, Harvard report had concluded that approximately 3.7 percent of hospitalizations have adverse events occur in them.  I accept the second figure.<br>
<br>
Where am I getting this information?  The JAMA letters to the editor from a month after the article with these statistics was published, and you might want to read the reply, wherein the JAMA says clearly that they agree that medical error is a problem, but they don't think that the study's misleading figures help anything.<br>

Following that way of thinking let's do away with antibiotics. After all, if you can't handle the world around you maybe you shouldn't be here.<br>
<br>
Let's not perform any more operations. Having a blockage of an artery is natures way of natural selection.<br>
<br>
If people get in a car accident, let's not render care. After all, if they can't handle it, fuck em.<br>
<br>
Oh, and let's get rid of immunizations. After all, if we weren't meant to  have polio, nature would have immunized us already.<br>
<br>
<br>
You truly are a piece of fuckin work. It's not bad enough that we have to put up with racists and homophobes around here, now we have people who think anyone witha mental problem/illness should just be put to sleep.<br>
