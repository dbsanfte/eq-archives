--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Also yes I am a US citizen, and yes I have heard of people getting shot over stupid shit like a pair of sneakers or the clothing they were wearing.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When where? Mostly when people get shot its over drugs here, Alot of what you here are urban legends about the cities, or they are found in movies? Have you ever actually lived in a city?<br>
<br>
<br>
yes I've lived in Chicago and Las Vegas and yes I've seen on the news and heard of people getting killed for posessions and yes over drugs as well.  Hell I had a neighbor down the street get shot because someone was breaking into their home to steal his belongings.<br>
<br>
What branch did you serve? <br>
<br>
US Navy  Did you ever serve?<br>
<br>
If you actually managed to read the thread, Wich I doubt you did, You would see most of the canadians and Americans were very civil in thier arguments.<br>
<br>
Where did I ever say that people weren't civil?  and yes I did read the entire thread.  <br>
<br>
However? When did it become cliche to be Pro American, When did people deem it stupid to be proud of your country. America has faults, like all nations do, god for bid if somone actually strives to show the good things we do. After all what fun is that everyone only loves misery, have you watched the news latley?<br>
Also where did I say it was stupid to be proud of our country?  I said that I'm still proud to be an American.<br>
Yes we have done some good things, but Canada also makes up quite a bit of the UN's Peace keeping forces and do far more than we do in my opinion to contribute to the over all well being of the world, yes we do some good things but unfortuanetly those things do not show up on the news or in news print as they won't sell papers or increase ratings now will they?<br>
<br>
The population of the U.S. is around what? 10 times that of Canada, Also what percentage of Canadians are not white? <br>
<br>
<br>
here is the racial make up of Canada, not sure how current the information is but its what i found:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.imdiversity.com/Article_Detail.asp?Article_ID=149#POPULATION">www.imdiversity.com/Artic...POPULATION</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
also the end of the underground rail road was finally Canada as they had abolished slavery long before we had to kill each other over it.<br>
<br>
All I was/am trying to say is yes the US is still a great nation, but like any other we have problems, we have homeless, we have 20 million+ people without health care, we have children born with aids and addicted to drugs, we have as many if not more problems than most of the western world.  But why attack people that are trying to support us?  We are all human beings, black, white, aisan, etc. etc. and we are all entitled to a little respect, god forbid that actually happen.  You question my patriotisim, but if called I will still stand up and willingly give my life to defend America with all of its problems, but you know what, someone attacks Canada I will do the same, but yet it seems fun to make fun of them for being different, same thing that people do because of race, religion, mental retardation etc.  So I guess I'm a minority, which is also fun to make fun of, as I don't see the harm of someone expressing their right to free speech or to have an opinion that isn't pro US, and Yes I realize I'm rambling.  I'm not looking for a utopia as I know that can't exist, I'm just looking for some where that a person would not be condemed for expressing an opinion that isn't popular or be persecuted for being different.  Oh wait that is Utopia.<br>

&quot;WAR against Schools&quot;<br>
<br>
For the past 3 months the school districts here have been under fire/ Litterally the Air time on the news is 80% about the school, And whats being done to improve it. School are handled by local goverment, You would never see that because frankly It would never get brodcasted to Canada, Because your media would not find it important enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;WAR against Heath&quot; <br>
<br>
lol, Health care reform is in the news more then almost any other subgect, Trust me, There is a war on health and its hotly debated and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> many </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> politicians run on health care reform.<br>
<br>
&quot;WAR against Cancer&quot;<br>
<br>
Who spends more on cancer research? America or Canada, no no let me rephrase that....Who Spends more on cancer research America or the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> World </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. If you actually looked it up it would shock the crap out of you how much money we dump into medical research.<br>
<br>
<br>
American goverment Lesson!! <br>
<br>
The American president has very very little domestic power, in fact he is just a figure head, All your posts refered to bush, Wich in and of himself has almost nothing to do in terms of the Issues you have implied.<br>
<br>
Most social programs are handled by the states and funded by the fed goverment, Thats how the U.S. runs, The president mainly handles foreign policy <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> not </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Domestic, The country was set up that way to split the power up.<br>
<br>
Your shooting off Issues but you know nothing of how the goverment is set up or even how it works?<br>
<br>
If you want to know more I am sure I can dig up my old text book on Goverment structure and write down the exact job description of the president.<br>
<br>
Your critiquing a man for not using Issues that are not his job, Would you go to a doctor that tells you hes going to fix your car while your bleeding on his table? Hell no that is somone elses job not his.<br>

Nope, Tried too after highschool (to help pay for college) However I was denied aover medical Condition.

<br>
Your other comment about the good things not selling news papers, Exactly. How many people do you think villfie the U.S. simply because all they read are bad things, It does not sell papers when you actually write good news in them, Wich means it does not sell papers in other countries when you write good things about america.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> But why attack people that are trying to support us?

<br>
On the same token, god forbid if somone actually showed some respect to people who argue for America. <br>
<br>
Like is said there are two sides to everything, I am merly representing the other, The same free speech that allows them to throw out thier critiques of the U.S. is the same free speech that allows me to critique their nation.<br>
<br>
In my posts I did not make fun of Canada, To me Canada has a great set up, Many Americans would love to be able to spend less on defense and more on Medicare and other social programs.<br>
<br>
What was being discussed however was why the U.S. could not do that. <br>
<br>
Dennli certainly did not seem to like loegans Opninon and was willing to bash him to hell for it, Why did you not jump on him, Call him ignorant for not allowing loegs opinion.<br>
 <br>
Canada is a great country, However they have a great neighbor. There is a reason niether of us keep troops along our borders.<br>

<br>
Look, you have around 30 million citizens, yet you only have around 70k troops, 20k of which is army. You have a tiny, outdated navy and a small air froce as well. You have 15k reserve troops and an inadequate draft plan.<br>
<br>
Yes, you work well in a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>support role</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> where few troops and equipment are required because other countries like the US supply what you lack. But that doesn't cut it for national defense.<br>
<br>
You can believe what you want, but the only reason... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the only reason</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you can get away with having such piss poor defenses and only spending 3% on national defense is because you are an ally and a neighbour of the US... the worlds <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> super power. If you think for one minute that if we weren't around you could simply defend your country with a smile and a Canadian Ale, than you sir are the moron and would soon be subjected to an imposed government by a foreign power.<br>
<br>
Peace is only possible through strength and like it or not Canada uses the US strength to ensure it's own peace. There is no way your current forces are adaquete for self defense, much less to launch a counter offensive if needed.<br>
<br>
If you want to be angry and slam the US, be my guest, but until you get a respectable defense force of your own, there is no question that you rely on the US. <p><br>

Well, first of all the U.S. has a bigger pool of money to draw from than Canada due to taxes alone because of a huge population difference. Even if the U.S. was only spending 3% on theur military, it would be a much larger chunk of money than what Canada's 3% would be. 300 million people to 30 million people is quite the difference.<br>

The canadians sent some of there teens over to, and they were the joke of the bootcamp!!!!!!!!!! Everyone made fun of them, they were scrony little short blond hair bitches and accourse they didn't take showers with big boys since day 1, rumor was it there penis's was 1 inch.... again, they were a fucking joke. There military dress uniforms looked like they were gonna go to a ballet, I meen, canada is stuck back in this 18 century shit they think fighting a war should be like gentlemen, like the english thought.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Don't let the Hastings Street area of Vancouver give you a bad impression about the rest of Canada. That part of Vancouver has the highest concentration of heroin in Canada. No matter where you go in the big cities &lt;US and Canada&gt;, you are going to find drug dealers. Get one off the street and another will step up to take his place. As for dirty ass cities, I have been in American cities that smell worse than our landfills. I have been in American bars underage and the kicker is that the bouncer id'ed me and let me in despite not being 21 years of age. I guess you haven't been to Jasper and Banff lately. Hotel rooms are skyhigh &lt;I mean the price not the elevation&gt; there. <br>

Finaly!  Someone else understands the medias' propaganda!  They'll say anything for more ratings.<br>

Now, back to the military and police.  Some people forget how both Canadian and American agencies work closely together.  The CIA, CSIS, CSE, FBI, RCMP, Customs, etc, all share information with their counterparts from accross the boarder.  We catch your criminals coming over to Canada, and you catch ours going to the States.  We do ground recon while you drop bombs on enemy locations.  You provide the ground troops while we cover you with snipers (which are classed as some of the best in the world), etc.<br>
