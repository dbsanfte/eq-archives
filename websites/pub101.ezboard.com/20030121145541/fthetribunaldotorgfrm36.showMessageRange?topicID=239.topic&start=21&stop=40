<br>
So make the possible donor the mother or the father if you wish... the principle still applies. No person can be forced to use their body to keep another person alive, even when that person is responsible for the creation of that life. And when you get right down to it, it is a very personal right that nobody in their right mind would want to give up, even though it is a right that is abused by some.<br>
<br>
Look, don't think for a minute that I like abortion - I don't. Too many fucktards use abortion as a form of birth control. But the sad fact is that many of these children are lucky they got aborted, because the fucktards who conceived them would give them a terrible shot at life, even if they were to survive past puberty.<br>
<br>
I don't grieve too much though, because in actuality, the fetus is not what most consider a person - a human yes, but a person. A fetus is not self aware, does not have any dreams, desires or goals. They will never miss life anymore than a person who is braindead would. That's not to say they don't have the potential to have all these things, but potential is like good intentions... until it solidifies, it's just vapor with no substance.<br>
<br>
The people I feel bad for are the ones who lived long enough to become self aware, to develope dreams and goals and to have families. Those are the people who really lose something at death. A fetus never was self aware, so their death is not a tragedy... at least not from their standpoint.<br>
<br>
IMO, life is not simply respiration... that is only the vehicle that carries life. Life is in the mind, not the body. You can lose an arm, leg, kidney or whatever and still be you. If the mind is gone (or never devoloped as in the case of a fetus) than there is no you - just a complex biological machine.<br>

Everyone once in a while you come across a news story in which a mother or father dashes an infants head against the wall or some other brutal death.  That infant was most likely not self aware -- no different mentally than when in the womb.  Are you telling me those deaths are not tragedies?<br>

Until you are self aware, yes, you are just a complex biological machine. However you are able to sustain yourself outside of the womb, so no, it is not alright to kill you. If it somehow came to be a choice between letting a self aware adult die or an infant who has no self awareness, I think the person with self awareness has more of a claim to life.<br>

Dogs and cats dream, which means they are indeed self aware. Maybe not in the same way that we are, but only animals with high level brain function dream. Even if they were not, this is not about killing. I am not saying it's alright to kill anything outside of the womb. I am only saying that nobody, including a mother, can be forced to use their body to keep another person alive and that if it does came down to a choice, I would go with the self aware being.<br>
<br>
Self aware or not, nobody has the right kill anything, unless it's for survival or self defense (morally speaking of course - in reality there are no rules except those that we create for ourselves). <p><br>

Yes you are quite right the baby doesn't magically become human when it leaves the womb. HOWEVER, at some stage during the pregnency it does become a human being, no one can deny this. (unless you want us to believe that when a sperm meets and egg it magically becomes human 2 seconds into cell division). Scientifically it has been decided that the fetus becomes a baby human at around the 4th month into pregnency. You cannot have an abortion once the second trimester starts except in exceptional circumstances. Therefore, when a woman aborts the fetus it IS a fetus, not a baby human.<br>
<br>
On a similar topic, recently in australia there was a case in court where a woman was mugged and stabbed in the stomach. The woman was 7 and a half months pregnent and the baby was killed by the stab. It was proven in court by experts that had the baby been born at 7.5 months it would have survived. However the mugger was not able to be charged with murder because legally the baby was not classified as human at this stage. BTW this has no relation to the above arguements, I think the mugger *SHOULD* have been charged with murder and burn in hell, just thought it might be of interest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kellianne>Kellianne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/11/02 6:17:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bestanimations.com/Fantasy/Dragons/Dragon-03.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>HOWEVER, at some stage during the pregnency it does become a human being, no one can deny this.

Do you know how ridiculous this sounds? By logic, when a sperm and an egg combine, a new life if formed. It is neither sperm, nor egg, but something new. By your logic, at some magical moment during the pregnancy the fetus becomes human. How absurd! Is this a case by case basis, or is this an exact time in all pregnancies? I guess in order to make our argument seem valid, you need to make something like this up. But, thats what it is, made up. Totally illogical. Oh, if its not made up, provide links of proof that at 4 months a fetus becomes human. I want to see this. And, by 4 months, do you mean 4 30 day months, or are there some 31 day months in there? Is it 4 lunar cycles? Again, you avoided the question: If before this magical moment it is not human, what is it?<br>
<br>
Loegan, your argument is a weak one by far. You basically agree that the fetus is a baby, which is good, but then go on to say the human is not self aware. I want to know how you could possibly know this. Seems to me that would fall into one of those impossible things to prove/disprove. The fact is, we have no clue at all. I, personally, would rather err on the side of not condoning the slaughtering of millions of babies every year. I do find it quite humorus though that you fight for animal rights, yet when it comes to unborn babies, they can just all die. <br>

No, I agree it is human and has the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>potential</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to become a baby. I seriously doubt if a 2 week old fetus was removed and placed on a table if anyone could identify what it was by sight alone.<br>
<br>
The point is moot though. No matter whether you think life begins at conception or at 4 months or at birth, it makes no difference. Nobody can be forced to use their body to keep another human alive, so until a fetus is able to survive outside the womb, their right to life infringes on the mothers right to control her body.<br>
<br>
Why does it bother you so much anyway? Do you honestly believe that these fetuses know they were aborted? Do you think they are self aware inside the womb?<br>
<br>
Maybe you should save your pity for those children who are allowed to be born, are self aware and are suffering abuse and neglect. I find it disgusting that most Right to Life'rs are the same ones who will gladly cut welfare benefits and childrens programs. They want the kids to be born, but then they want to leave them to rot in poverty and abuse while claiming the have no reponsibility to pay for them.<br>
<br>
If you have no responsibility to the born, stay the fuck out of matters concerning the unborn. <p><br>

No one forced anyone to get pregneant. No one forces people to have sex (except in the case of rape) and no one forces people to have children. Once you make those choices to have sex, you have must be responsible for those outcomes, which can include the creation of a human life. Our laws should protect all innocent human life, especially those that cannot protect themselves. We, as a society, need to protect those rights of the unborn. <br>

The question should really be, why DOESN'T it bother you? Especially you imparticulair, who seems so concenred about the rights of animals and such. But, I digress. I answered those other questions in my other post, but I guess you skipped over it. I said, and I will say it again. I have no idea if they know, or if they are self aware. Neither do you. There is no real way to prove this, on any level. I just would rather be safe then sorry when it comes to salughtering human beings inside the womb.<br>

<br>
That's simple - because when you are mourning for something that is unware and not suffering, the only thing you are serving is yourself. They felt no loss or pain. You are the only one feeling it.<br>
<br>
When I fight for animals (as you constantly bring up), I am fighting for a being who is experiencing pain, suffering and trauma at our hands. Is anyone toturing a fetus? Highly doubtful since the nervous system isn't even developed. Even if it was, the pain would be so brief before death, as to be insignificant.<br>
<br>
I don't argue on hunting, because the deaths are quick. I do argue animal testing and abuse because it is torture... the difference is like night and day.<br>
<br>
If you want to spend your time grieving for a bunch of cells, for a being that may or may not have made it to birth, but none-the-less was not self aware or suffered pain... be my guest. But your arguments don't serve them, they only serve some personal need of your own. It's like mourning a finger that got cut off by a saw. You may feel the loss, but the finger sure as hell doesn't - your grief is only for your own suffering, not for the finger. It may be human, but it was not a life. <p><br>

  EEG, EKG, ultrasound, etc have shown that a fetus will respond to stimuli, including pain.<br>
<br>
In a letter written in 1984 to President Regan,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mr. President:<br>
<br>
As physicians, we, the undersigned, are pleased to associate ourselves with you in drawing the attention of people across the nation to the humanity and sensitivity of the human unborn. <br>
That the unborn, the prematurely born, and the newborn of the human species is a highly complex, sentient, functioning, individual organism is established scientific fact. That the human unborn and newly born do respond to stimuli is also established beyond any reasonable doubt. <br>
<br>
The ability to feel pain and respond to it is clearly not a phenomenon that develops de novo at birth. Indeed, much of enlightened modern obstetrical practice and procedure seeks to minimize sensory deprivation of, and sensory insult to, the fetus during, at, and after birth. Over the last 18 years, real time ultrasonography, fetoscopy, study of the fetal EKG (electrocardiogram) and fetal EEG (electroencephalogram) have demonstrated the remarkable responsiveness of the human fetus to pain, touch, and sound. That the fetus responds to changes in light intensity within the womb, to heat, to cold, and to taste (by altering the chemical nature of the fluid swallowed by the fetus) has been exquisitely documented in the pioneering work of the late Sir William Liley -- the father of fetology. Observations of the fetal electrocardiogram and the increase in fetal movements in saline abortions indicate that the fetus experiences discomfort as it dies. Indeed, one doctor who, the New York Times wrote, &quot;conscientiously performs&quot; saline abortions stated, &quot;When you inject the saline, you often see an increase in fetal movements, it's horrible.&quot; <br>
<br>
We state categorically that no finding of modern fetology invalidates the remarkable conclusion drawn after a lifetime of research by the late Professor Arnold Gesell of Yale University. In &quot;The Embryology of Behavior: The Beginnings of the Human Mind&quot; (1945, Harper Bros.), Dr. Gesell wrote, &quot;and so by the close of the first trimester the fetus is a sentient, moving being. We need not speculate as to the nature of his psychic attributes, but we may assert that the organization of his psychosomatic self is well under way.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mr. President, in drawing attention to the capability of the human fetus to feel pain, you stand on firmly established ground. <br>

Take note of this especially:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> o these discoveries mean that the newborn infant's spinal cord transmittts a different pain signal to the cortex to that of the adult? We think so. <br>
<br>
Much of the immaturity that we have found suggests newborns have a spinal sensory system that is more sensitive than the adult system. This may have a developmental advantage, encouraging weak nerves cells junctions to strengthen through plenty of activity. But it may also mean newborns have increased false alarms. <br>
<br>
They are also more likely to be more unpredicatable in their sensory responses, since their spread-out central terminals and large spinal cord cell receptive fields are likely to lead to poorer placing of stimuli and less selective responses. <br>
<br>
How this affects the brain and an infant's awareness of pain is unclear, since very little is known about the processing of pain in the brain. It is important to remember that these findings relate only to spinal cord pain mechanisms which are one step in the pain pathway, and that the actual experience or awareness of pain requires brain activity<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> which we believe develops some time after birth along with memory, anxiety and other cognitive brain functions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Cut it any way you want, throw in all the side issues of pain and procedure you want, but in the end it boils down to human rights. Nobody can, nor should they be able to, force you to use your body to sustain another life. You're right to life does not include the right to use another's body to sustain your life. If they give you that sevice willingly, great, but it is their choice. <p><br>
