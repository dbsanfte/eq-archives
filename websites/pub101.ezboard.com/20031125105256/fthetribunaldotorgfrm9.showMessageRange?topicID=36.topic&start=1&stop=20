A lot.<br>
<br>
A lot more than I expected to. There's a lot of customization to it with the different race/class/specialization and then skill training system. People look different than each other because you can dye everything-- not just trade skilled items, but even quest items. Hell, I even have a light red dyed shield, and light red dyed quest gauntlets.<br>
<br>
Weapon styles are nice. Openings take a little bit to get used to but very interesting system... reserving full judgement until I get more forms.<br>
<br>
Spells are VERY nice. I can cast while moving, and cast spell after spell after spell-- the thing is I can't recast a spell until a certain time. So imagine the EQ system where you can cast say Daring and Valor at the same time but then have to wait to recast either one dependant on their recast time. Very nice for nukers because they can unload all their different nukes and then only have to wait for recast time... course, this is only good if the mob is almost dead. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Regen is AWESOME. During a fight there isn't much regen, but in between fights its wonderful. Simply sit down and rest and 30-60seconds later you're at full health and full mana. It's not unbalancing to the game, since you have to sit and rest, but it's very good at eliminating between-fight downtime. Leaves the lull between fights mostly due to pulling.<br>
<br>
Combat is a little hectic compared to EQ, if you want to really excel... I mean, you can sit there, hit 'a', and walk off, but you'll be missing all the damage from spells/styles. Managing your spells/styles is a little hard because they don't have the concept of EQ's &quot;grayed out&quot; buttons... that's one thing I'd really like to see that change. You have to sit and spam the hotkey to see how much time is left until you can recast it or reuse a style.<br>
<br>
Lag. Outside, lag is very unnoticable. Inside Tir na Nog and nearby Mag Mell, it's very jumpy, very much like EQ raiding conditions. I'm not sure the exact reason, but I'm wondering if its simply due to the number of people, since other places like Ardee, Connia, Howth, and Tir na mBeo are all fine. I tend to think that it's a bit more than it should be, and it's somewhat aggravating. Like when you turn slightly and then suddenly you did a 180... that kind of thing. This is my #1 pet peeve I wish they'd change.<br>
<br>
Guilds. These guys learned from old school text MUDs... there are guild ranks, guild titles, and it's all customizable by the guild leader. S/he can set what ranks can invite, what ranks get the officer channel, etc. I'm very impressed by this, it seems like a solid guild system. Guilds can also have custom emblems designed, too, though I'm not sure on the details of this yet. Cead Mile Failte will let ya know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well, those are some of my initial impressions of the game... let ya know more as time goes on. (I'm not quitting EQ by any means, I still have a lot I want to do. It'll be a while before I can define and get into the right alternation cycle though.)<br>

Okay, at first i thought it was their fault.... *But* i changed the sensitivity of my mouse and that helped somewhat. (because that setting also effects your keyboard settings)<br>
The other contributing factor for me seems to be that my comp is just too old for the game.  Heh, but i get by <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Question for ya:  Are you using a Voodoo card by any chance?   (i am, Voodoo3... i think it's time to upgrade)<br>
DAoC won't be accommodating Voodoo users it seems.  No biggie in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the final fix that i found for the choppiness in cities, falling off my horse and any other sort of side effect of having a slow computer... Is to face the ground, hit F11 and use that view.   It makes a HUGE difference.   <br>
<br>
<br>
This  game is a blast.  By level 3, i could afford a ticket to ride a horse anywhere (a Whopping 5 Silver??? /drool!), Dye my robe and other clothing cool colors, start in on quests, have ALL my spells available (since you don't BUY them!!  *YAY* )<br>
Ooooh!! another cool thing.  Last night i died... and thought &quot;Crap, i'm going to lose my level!&quot;  ~Nope.~  Although i did have to pay for 2 points of constitution.... <br>
hehe, I'll pay 50 some copper over losing a level anyday!!<br>
<br>
Aye, the Guild system is wonderful!  They put a lot of thought into communication.  After raiding in EQ with Alliances, i can see how useful this will be.  You can talk with your guild, talk with your officers ~and~ have your allied guild reps in a chat channel.  *sigh*  Do you know how many headaches could have been solved and how much time could have been saved in EQ if that feature were added?  Goodness.<br>
<br>
The only change i wish they'd make with the chat features, in general, would be to allow us to read all channels (like when you're in Main)  And have something like the group chat tabbed so you don't have to be careful which channel you're talking in.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.... These guys seem to have *PLAYED* MMORPGs thoroughly.  Not &quot;log on a Necro and solo&quot; like some people we know.  *wink wink*  <br>
<br>
Goodness, i could go on and on about what i like about this game..... but that's just cutting into my playtime!!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In Conclusion....<br>
Will i be quitting EQ?  I don't think so.  But right now, there's no decision to make about which icon i'm going to click on when it's time to play a game.<br>

It's more challenging then EQ in my opinion. With the skills and styles you can use. Each character tho the same will be slightly different. Some may be the same, but this is wear the dyes for armor, choosing your height, hair, etc comes into play. Guild system is great. Money does become a little tight at times. So you have to solo every so often as you can out level your armor and not get as much money to reoutfit it. As I do a trade skill I like the idea behind this. It does get a little annoying as you get higher in level. All in all I'm also keeping EQ to see what Luclin is like. After that it might be DAoC only.<br>

<br>
More realistic... tells me this all the time. the girls curtsy, you have different faces and you have special hits. (I saw that you can emote a kiss, how fun..) <br>
<br>
My nine year old sister can play it... granted she has a problem typeing... but it isn't TOO hard..<br>
<br>
Scenery is awesome....<br>

The Curtsey and Blowing a kiss is very cute, too.  I've wanted EQ to let the girls curtsey from day 1, so i'm happy about that!  Dancing is adorble!!!!!  You don't just dance like in EQ.... you have a kind of fancy feet, flamboyant dance.  Heck, even jumping is cute!<br>
<br>
This game is *certainly* ideal for the casual gamer.  No corpse retrieval (if you don't care about losing exp) and the ability to solo exp mobs, no matter what class, sets the stage for someone who wants to just log on for an hour and hunt.<br>

<br>
Trade skills. I love how they've done the tasks thing. I love how you make stuff better than the same store bought items. I love the huge list of things to make. The /salvage option and /repair are sweet.<br>
<br>
As far as combat goes I'll talk about it at 20+. But right now having the same person having mez and heal with no way to cast while being hit is kinda weak. Have to see how that plays out.<br>
<br>
Things I don't like<br>
Spell icons at lest song icons are all the same.<br>
<br>
The progression of mobs in power in an area needs a bit of work. At 10 it jumps from grey or green to red and purple alot in midgard. I do need to explore more I've only been to like 8 towns.<br>
<br>
<br>

Mana song doesnt work on people until they have been out of combat 40 seconds(by then you have your mana back), songs cant be restarted right away after being interupted, you cant turn on speed song if youve been hit cause that counts as combat. So far it seems that they want combat to be a do or die situation.<br>

I am now down to two weekly standing groups, as my third moved to DaoC.  I was drug, kicking and screaming all the way, into playing Camelot, and much to my surprise I love it!  My Wednesday group is playing in Midgard on Guenevaire, and we're having so much fun we started a second weekly group for Hibernia on Merlin.  As long as my two standing groups are around I'm playing EQ, and I'm excited about Luclin, but I can already see the rest of my available play time going into DaoC.<br>
<br>
The quest system is wonderful, especially for people like me.  I always sought out and did as many quests as I could, but keeping track of the info was a pain, and the camps are killers.  Both are gone in DaoC.  I find the limitation to one tradeskill irksome (I enjoy doing tradeskills) but for roleplay reasons I tended to choose one skill per avatar to focus on anyway.  The way it works is pretty good, except for the limitation of where you can work on them.  I loathe the cities.  On the plus side, getting consignments easily funds your tradeskills if you can stand the additional time cost of running around in search of your buyer.<br>
<br>
There's a bit of boredom in how few spell choices there are, you basically end up with 5 or 6 'lines' of which you use the most current (I noticed some lines autoreplace themselves on your hotkeys), but even in EQ you tend to find yourself with a 'set' spell lineup so it will probably even out in the high end game.<br>
<br>
The interface is wonderful, especially chats and the friends list and pet window.  All in all, with the possible caveat of how RvR will impact, this is proving a great game for the casual gamer.  <br>

<br>
You're not limited to only doing one, just how well you can be at the others.<br>
<br>
Ie., I took Armorcrafting as my primary. I can still make weapons-- just that my weaponcrafting can only max at 40% of my Armorcrafting skill. As my Armorcrafting goes up, so does the cap on my Weaponcrafting.<br>
<br>
Certain classes can't take certain tradeskills, though... like an eldritch/mentalist can't make scale armor, though they can tailor things... etc.<br>

So many things are done *very* well when it comes to trade skills in general... but the cap/limitation on what you can do, according to class, is not pleasing.<br>

<br>
PvP or RvR (realm v realm) as it is. Is not something you have to take part in. It is limited to the frontiers which are set up just for this and maybe some xp hunting if you like the thrill of being hunted while you hunt. As for buying back con points, it's not really that bad when you consider that around lvl 20 healers get a rez that gives con back as well. DAoC is geared mostly towards the casual player. Tradeskills are very user friendly and not anywhere near as bad as EQ's. You can get realm points later for making consignments of armor and weapons to take to the guards in the Frontiers. Quests have no bottlenecks as a whole group (up to 8 players) may do the quest at the same time. Kill the mob and you all get the item. When grouping for xp and a rare item drops all players in group get one.(this is not implemented yet but is coming in soon) All classes can solo viably just don't expect to solo mobs higher then you on a regular risk free basis. Grouping is much better as it eliminates most downtime. But, there really is no downtime, you can heal to full in less then a minute. Regain full power (mana) in the same amount of time. There is so much more to the game that it would take me all night to type this. My advise is to just buy it. It is well worth the price and if you don't like it after the free month just don't give them your credit card info.<br>

55k copies sold first week. Highest amount sold week of release of any computer game. Next game in line did 22k.<br>
