<br>
A deal was discussed between Podaman and I on how the loot would be handled.  Before anything was agreed upon Podaman kept going LD and said to resume negotiations with Greyman.<br>
<br>
<br>
Greyman and I decided upon the following:<br>
<br>
Both guilds roll.  Highest gets 2 loots, lowest gets 1 loot but first pick (there were three items).<br>
<br>
Greyman got highest, I got lowest.  At this time it was brought to my attention the guild still had a swiftblade of zek to trade / sell.  I asked Greyman if it would be acceptable to provide them with a swiftblade of zek in turn for reversing the order.   IE:  SI gets 2 loots,  DV gets 1 loot first pick and SI gives them a SOZ.<br>
<br>
Greyman agreed this would be acceptable, as they wanted the choker.  The trade was made.<br>
<br>
Greyman chose the choker, and logged in Podaman (not present at the time) to loot it. <br>
<br>
SI received the robe and brain.<br>
<br>
The swiftblade was passed to greyman or greyman on as podaman.<br>
<br>
<br>
A later discussion revealed a pissed of Podaman, and annoyance that DV did not get 2 items off CT and first pick.<br>
<br>
When asked if Podaman got the SoZ I was told that yes, he got it, and nobody in his guild could use something like that, so it was sold.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've seen several Dark Virtue warriors that could benefit from a swiftblade of zek.   According to another thread, Podaman uses one himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why in the world wouldn't any of the DV warriors present receive this item?   I tend not to get into other guild's looting policies, but the self righteous attitude expressed by Podaman in the POMS thread has me wondering.   Could any of the DV warriors benefit from a swiftblade of zek?  (basic stats 11 / 18 +10 AC +100 HP 1hs... some str or sta in there too)<br>
<br>
What the hell is going on inside of this guild that the guildleader is so adamant about defending an OBVIOUS ninja looter?  What is going on that items are being sold that guild members, and numerous at that, could benefit from and use?   Why is the ninjalooter also claiming NBG on 70k plat value items and then selling them off?<br>
<br>
The world is crazy I tell you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukezmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kezmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 437<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/23/02 4:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~mkelly300/_uimages/Kezman1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> its all cause of ebay...  just remember that when your run by ebay this shit happens<br>

DV would loot the first item.  SI would loot the second item.  DV would loot the third item.  SI would loot the fourth item if there was one.<br>

After I made it back online I discovered that Rynnia changed the terms of the deal offered to Greyman while I was gone.  The last thing I told Greyman before giving up trying to stay online was that SI had offered us a fair deal and to go ahead and accept it.  Rynnia simply changed the terms of the deal at this point and Grey didn't know that it wasn't the deal I had agreed to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/upodamandv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PodamanDV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/23/02 5:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When asked if Podaman got the SoZ I was told that yes, he got it, and nobody in his guild could use something like that, so it was sold.<br>

<br>
The reason the SoZ was sold is because the casters in the guild were so angry about losing the brain/robe that by unanimous decision we sold the sword and purchased some FT3 boots to award instead.<br>
<br>
To clarify, the casters were angry that after we cleared Fear SI joined us to kill CT and then made what we all perceived to be a one sided deal wherby you got 2 CT loots.  And yes I was furious about it because that is not the deal I had agreed to with you nor would I have agreed to that deal.<br>
<br>
What's going on inside SI where officers are allowed to make and break deals on a whim?<br>

<br>
So this means that DV condones ninjalooters in their guild. I hope this clears up things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The majority of guilds on the server would toss ninjalooters to the curb like  a used napkin, simply because ninjalooting is a crime against the server community.<br>
<br>
As for me breaking deals, I would break this one over again if it happened. I have no regrets at all about breaking this deal. The only thing it benefitted was Poladara's reputation, which doesn't deserve to be protected.<br>
<br>
What about the deal of us returning your FT3 boots in exchange for the red scales since you threw a tantrum that Poladara's little secret came to light? I certainly kept that deal--even though you kept sending me tells that I was a scammer because I hadn't returned your precious boots yet.<br>

<br>
You said that your guild had no use for a SoZ and it was sold.<br>
<br>
<br>
You told me yourself that I was to speak with Greyman and &quot;work it out with him&quot; as you could not keep a connection.<br>
<br>
Greyman expressed to me both before and after the kill that what we agreed upon was amicable, especially considering that DV would not have killed CT that night and no loot would have been given at all.   The only point of concern that I was able to understand surrounded the Bile Etched Obsidian Choker, which Podaman was logged in to loot, as it was made quite clear that that was the important thing on the corpse.<br>
<br>
I broke no deals.  I was told to negotiate with Greyman, and I did.<br>
