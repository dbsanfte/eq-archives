<br>
You say most college professors are liberal, so if you are educated you are more likely to be liberal.<br>
<br>
So you are looking at one variable and drawing a conclusion from it.  And then expanding upon that conclusion to make a very broad statement (if you are educated you are more likely to be liberal).  <br>
<br>
The problem is you are ignoring every other variable.  Personally, I would say it would be better to take a look at their liberal/conservativeness as a function of their income, not their education.  Since it is unlikely you would find numbers to support the fact that a great percentage of those with PhD's (all dr's, not just teachers) are liberal.  And if you are going to make your education point, that is the group you must look at, not just teachers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I checked the link for the numbers of metro area's, but I think you posted the wrong link that map doesn't tell me much of anything and either the links aren't working or I am missing them.   The one thing I did notice however is you are listing numbers for entire states correct?  Now you are stereotyping people in entire states as metro because of one major city.  What percentage of people in New York (since it is the largest I would assume) state live in a true metro City, and what percentage live in upstate New York for example?  What are the incomes for the various states you have listed?  How about for the different area's within the states that you could label as metro or suburban/rural? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uadolenandmurray.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adolen and Murray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/02 10:15:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Billy</span><hr size=1> &quot;The more educated you are, the more likely you are to be liberal.&quot;<br>

No, the more educated you are, the more likely you are to be filled with liberal propaganda and lies. Students are inherently liberal because teachers are inherently liberal, and they are thus surrounded by it and agree with it. It's not until people get out into the real world that they realize how much big government wrongs them, and they become conservative. Some people just seem to never get out into the real world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Conservatives want religion in schools because they are Christian, they don't care about Muslims, Hindus, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is a lie. Conservatives want religion in schools because of the right of &quot;Freedom of Religion.&quot; Too many liberals perceive that right as &quot;Freedom from Religion.&quot; If someone doesn't like the views of another Religion, well, that's there problem.

Well imagine you're a Jewish kid going to public school and they promote religion there.  The religion they promote is Christianity, obviously your reiligion doesn't jive with what is officially being taught.  What exactly do you think that would do to your since of faith.<br>
<br>
Let's take a reverse approach.  How would you feel, being Christian, that the predominently Muslim (yeah what are the chances I know but, I'm just saying that as an example) decided the Islam was going to be the religion taught in your schools?  <br>
<br>
I'm sure you would love your children learning Islam in school. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 664<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/02 10:57:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Billy</span><hr size=1> Sorry, was late last night (atually early this morning) when I posted and should have noticed I hit the map image instead of the page itself.

There was a comic strip I'm sure you've probably all read, and there is also just a text version where someone is saying &quot;Why doesn't God stop all these terrible killings in schools?&quot; and someone replies &quot;Oh, didn't you hear?

I was going on the premis that you were for school structured religion (ie - requiring prayer or teaching creationism) and that's where the problem was. As far as anyones freedom to practice their religion it doesn't apply. If you teach that religion/require prayer, then it does. <p><br>

<br>
If you mena practiced by the students without infringing upon other students rights, then I agree 100%. If a child wants to pray or read the bible during study hall, they should (and do as far as I understand the constitution) have that right.<br>
<br>
If you mean teachers practicing their religion, then I would also agree -if- it was done in the teachers lounge or someplace private. The reason being, is that a teacher in a public school should not influence students on religious matters. That is the parents right/responsibilty and the state should have nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Now, when it comes to manger scenes and such on the city hall lawn, I have to do a 180. The reason is, if you put a manger scene up, then you would also need to allow a Buddah or a prayer wheels placed there also. Pretty soon you would have it looking like a multi-denominational shrine instead of a government building.<br>
<br>
Besides, the great thing about America is no one has to feel threatened by the government for religious reasons. As long as the government stays neutral on religion, we all benefit. Grant it, this can be taken to extremes, but better to be safe than sorry when protecting civil liberties imo. <p><br>
