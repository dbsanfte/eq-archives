I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;ubers&quot; but we tend to kill mobs like Velk, Klan and Zlan with about 36 people, so if you can kill things like that with about 18 people, I am truly impressed, although I doubt this is the case.<br>

I don't remember ever declaring ourselves an uber-guild Sapphon, but if from this thread you think that we do, I ask why, if its because you feel we were boasting about killing the Dain etc, let me refer you to the first quote from you I made in this post, that also seems like a boast on the same level. <p><b><i>Temurik Etsbaia</b></i><BR><b><i>Human Warlord</b></i><BR><b><i>The Companions</b></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utemurik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Temurik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/11/01 6:48:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oops..we poofed dain again</span><hr size=1> Heh, you are right though, this is a stupid thread.

You originally said your post was a joke, not a statement, which was it ?<br>
Either way, you tried to make people laugh at us, and tried to create yourself an escape by saying &quot;it was only a joke&quot;, as you have in the past.<br>
<br>
If you laugh at, and get other people to laugh at someone, it &quot;being a joke&quot; does't negate the effect. I mean, if I attacked a friend with a load of personal insults that really hurt him/her, then said it was all a joke - it would't make it ok, would it ? <p><b><i>Temurik Etsbaia</b></i><BR><b><i>Human Warlord</b></i><BR><b><i>The Companions</b></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utemurik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Temurik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/11/01 8:28:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=157.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oops..we poofed dain again</span><hr size=1> Another thing, i'm 100% certain that you are aware that a lot of Comps don't like you Talamay. <br>

<br>
That was Talamay's original post. It really doesn't seem hostile to me. I mean Tal went and said that a friend was having the same problems cept worse cause they poofed him every single time, you guys managed to get him a few. I mean Sscaley realized it wasn't ment to be mean, he posted right after it and his post didn't sound offended or upset. <br>
<br>
I think that so much crap gets started between guilds just like this happened. It just takes one person to take it wrong and to post a mean spirited post. Then the other person will defend themselves, people hop on the band wagon...things go down hill very fast. If everyone took a step back and realized that, this is a game, there are very few people who are going to go out of their way to insult you, and if they do, don't flame em just feel sorry for them. Because if they got so upset over something in a game that they felt the need to flame you over it well...I guess to bad for them. We've all gotten really mad in game from time to time but how many of us have really woken up the next morning still pissed? <br>
<br>
Tem there is nothing wrong being proud of what your guild has done and letting people know about it, within reason. To me many posters in this thread crossed the line when they began to label X mob as being a gimp and you suck because you killed him, etc, etc... Both sides are guilty here. Hopkins is always guilty. We kill him off at least once every raid to make him pay for it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And then usually a second time for the fun of it. I think we would have a lot fewer deaths if I stopped hearing, &quot;But he looks so cute curled up like that.&quot; from our clerics all the time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Trust me I am not a cute pile of bones after I've been stomped for 300dmg 5 times in a row by an angry dragon in ToV.

<br>
If the more vocal members of SI talked sense like that, i would never have had reason to have said a hostile word about your guild.<br>
<br>
However, Hopkins inparticular has attempted to belittle our achievements since.. well... since forever. A few months ago, all he could say was 'Look at the companions, all they fight is Trak and VS' they suck, now its 'Look at the companions, all they fight is the 'Dain, Zland and Kland' They suck.<br>
Hell we could beat the Tunare and the sleeper and im sure Hopkins would have some badmouthed littel excuse for why it isnt 'an achievement'<br>
<br>
Unfortunately jerks like him have tainted the reputation of your guild, and thats why a lot of the bad blood exists. I know he has even squabbled with members of his own guild, and that many of them dislike him too, hes just that kinda guy i guess.<br>
<br>
As for Dozekar, i have always been skeptical, for two reasons :-<br>
<br>
1) SI are known to have endorsed 'gimp' tactics before. With their entry to the Plane of Mischief being the most flagrant abuse , (going LD every 10 seconds to avoid being aggroed). This was most of their senior members / officers/ guildleaders at the time.<br>
<br>
2) They failed to do similar mobs shortly after. Wins on the scale of Dozekar (and yes, unlike you hopkins , i admit that if you DID beat him legitimately it was a great achievement) are rarely if ever flukes. Why did SI not kill the statue or Tormax? Surely easy tasks for a guild that could kill Dozekar when nearly no other guilds could.<br>
<br>
I stil think something irregular went on in ToV that day, but maybe im totally wrong , in which case well done to you SI.<br>
<br>
Let me make this clear, im not laughing at SI in general, just those vocal people who have disrespected my guild for so long. Its nice to see them get their come uppance. <br>

First off you have no proof. That alone should be enough, especially after the very long and drawn out crap threads that resulted after we killed him discussing the entire issue. If you want to talk bad blood the companions posting message after message saying we cheated is a good source. <br>
<br>
Second the only possible piece of quasi evidence you do have is that he ended up by the door. I think that has been addressed. <br>
<br>
Third Doz has been killed several times since on different servers, especially now that he has been changed, yet no one has found any kind of expliot to him. <br>
<br>
Hopkins is an ass but I've been Companions just as bad as he is. Also it's not like Hopkins sugar coats what he says or how he acts. Lets be honest here neither of us are saints, eh? <br>
<br>
And the PoM example is so damn lame...I didn't have anything to do with that but it was just used to get into PoM and see it. It's not like SI planned a huge exploit plan to over run the entire zone and farm it for months to get all the phat loot it may have. They did something that a lot of different people did to actually see the zone since verant hasn't really made that zone all that accessible? When are they planning on fixing the damn faction? Any how it was just a way to see the zone. Yes it was an exploit but lets be real here. Drop it on a scale to rate it. I'm not rating it all that high.<br>
<br>
No offence Slannesh but grow up...I know you tried to be civil in your post but frankly all you did was erk my with all your &quot;if you really did kill him.&quot; crap. Frankly it's childish. I was there. I was in the corner dropping mana to clerics as fast as I could while trying to avoid the AoE. I was there when he warped and I thought we were screwed. I was there when he died and we went down as the second guild to every kill him in EverQuest. It wasn't an easy fight and we didn't do it on the first attempt. If your blind hatred for my guild is so much that you just can not accept what we accomplished, to damn bad cause we did. I do feel sorry for you though, that you would hold on to so much hatred for a group of people that beyond this message board you almost never interact with. <p>Sapphon Asmodius the Evilly Annoying Necromancer

<br>
I just want to ask one question...how do you exploit a summoning mob in a doorway? No matter what you do to make it where it can't hit you(which isnt even possible with regards to Dozekar), it can still summon people 1 by 1 and kill them, especially since he quads for 700 and can't be slowed...not to mention an unresistable 400 AE that dispells one buff each time it hits.<br>
<br>
Also, EV had 50 people in the zone at the time we killed Dozekar...no one smart would cheat...no one smart surely wouldn't cheat with 50 other people in the zone.<br>
<br>
In regards to POM, shit it was fun goofing off in there. Many people took the 15 second thing as Verant's answer to POM since no one really knew how to get there or if it was an open/finished zone.

Please tell me where I said I was trying to be friendly.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You originally said your post was a joke, not a statement, which was it ?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Temurik, you obviously don't understand that a statement can also be interpreted as a joke. Some people read that and thought, &quot;ha ha&quot; (eg, Hopkins).  Others read it and said &quot;what and asshole&quot; (all of you dimwitted motherfuckers).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I mean, if I attacked a friend with a load of personal insults that really hurt him/her, then said it was all a joke - it would't make it ok, would it ?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
People who are hurt by personal insults are powerless, spineless people.  When you allow yourself to be 'hurt' by another person's words, you give them so much power over you.  And I have exactly that kind of power over every single Companion who has posted on this thread flaming me.  It's pretty fucking hilarious.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> i'm 100% certain that you are aware that a lot of Comps don't like you Talamay.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Fully aware.  Thanks.  I know specific people, I'm sure there's others.  That doesn't bother me, though.  I have plenty of friends in other guilds.  I hold nothing against the people that don't like me that are in your guild (Beltane, Slannesh, Zenra just to name a few).  That is just how they are and I wouldn't want them to change.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So again, why bother saying something like that? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Because I find your reaction(s) highly amusing.  And this entire thread is  a fine example of how powerless you cretins are.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind when I use &quot;you&quot; in a pluralized sense, I am talking to those Companions who have chosen to participate in flaming me.  I am not talking about those in the guild whom I do respect and like.  Its the Beltanes and Slanneshs and Temuriks that I am addressing here.<br>
<br>

<br>
I find it quite ridiculous that you say you have power over people to make them reply like that for ;<br>
<br>
A) You prove that you made the post to cause a reaction, that you earlier denied, and,<br>
B) You posting further replies yourself, proving youself a hypocrite, that they have power over you to make you react too.<br>
