Jaranna takes a deep breath and continues.  &quot;I have been in love for a long while now, but, due to things being the way they were, I could never say anything.  But things have changed, and I can now proudly say that I soon will take the surname of the love of my life.&quot;<br><br>Jaranna couldn't help but smile.  The Sisters and Brothers were seeming to talk amongst themselves, trying to figure out who it was that had stolen their Sister's heart.  Jaranna looked down at her still-shaking hand, and the smile faded.  She held up her hand for all to see.<br><br>&quot;My hand shivers.  I am so nervous I am on the verge of collapse, and that is because many of you will not like what I am about to say.&quot;  Jaranna swallows, then shakes her head.  &quot;I have said it before, and I will say it again.  I will not leave this Circle until the day I die or I am no longer wanted.  But I am deathly afraid that the latter may come to pass this day.<br><br>&quot;Many of you do not like this person, and, for some of you, that dislike is outright hatred.&quot;  Jaranna looks to Llylewen, then Arania, then back at Effie, who motions to her to go on.<br><br>&quot;We have not set a date yet, nor have we hammered out any specifics, but soon I will take a last name.<br><br>&quot;From that moment on, I will be Jaranna Lileath.&quot;<br><br>Jaranna pulled her arms up as if to hug herself, waiting to see what her family's reaction would be. <p><P>Jaranna<BR>Circle of Sisters</P><P><EM>Raven hair and ruby lips<BR>Sparks fly from her finger tips<BR>Echoed voices in the night<BR>She's a restless spirit on an endless flight</EM></P></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxstealmeapeachx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xstealmeapeachx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#660000>(8/28/02 12:30:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An announcement</span><hr size=1> Kelthalas sat, calmly listening to Jaranna's speech, taking a sip of fine elven brandy from time to time.

As I listen upon the sounds going on inside the guildhall, I cant help but wonder if some people are being more hypocritical then others about the Tier'dal. I have had a lovely conversation myself with a knight of Innoruk named Dalion. I dont find that the Tier'dal are evil , though others may find otherwise. They are just being true to themselves. Their actions are questionable, true. Alas I cant condemn my sister Jaranna's actions, as she is being true to herself. So I pull myself out of my chair and find my way to the noises in the guild hall. I then hug my sister Jaranna, and I say &quot;Congratulations dear sister. May your happiness be forever.

Whispering voices filter in, carried on the cold breeze. A dark, womanly shape stands in the threshold, silhouetted in the lamplight behind her.<br><br>When she steps forward, her bearing is dignified, elegant, with only enough sway in her hips to be attractive, but not overdone. She clothes herself in a dark silk gown that hugs her upper body, and flows down, away from her hips, and as she walks, her heeled boots click quietly on the floor. Her face is down-turned, eyes hidden behind her raven-hair. Spectral visions can be seen surrounding her, half-formed and transparent, images of elven children and women, all clinging to her as though she was their mother.<br><br>“My, my,” she whispers, her voice sounding more hollow, echoing, than it used to, her eyes still downcast, “all this fuss over Jaranna’s desire to be with little me. I am... flattered.”<br><br>Slowly, she lift hers face, and the change is startling. Gone are the crisp, clear blue eyes she once had, replaced by a deep, penetrating blood red. The fires of rage and hatred are clearly displayed behind Vivienne’s eyes. Less immediately visible is the arrogant sneer that now rests on her painted lips, replacing the playful smirk she also once had.<br><br>Vivienne steps up beside Jaranna, sliding her arm around her fiancee’s slim waist. She casts her strange eyes around the chamber, glancing in turn at the frowning faces of each sister and brother, but seeming not to care about their anger and disapproval. Only upon reaching Lady Llylewen does her travelling gaze stop for a moment, and a subtle sadistic gleam comes to her expression.<br><br>With a slight glaring nod of her head at the koada’dal paladin, her eyes turn to meet Jaranna’s. “Vendui, my dear, I trust all is well here? I was just passing by and I heard your voice,” she whispers in a casual tone, “judging by the storm Kelthalas left trailing behind him on his way out, I assumed you must have told these lovely dears about our engagement.”<br><br>Vivienne pauses momentarily, then, with a sadistic smirk and side-long glance at Wardenn sitting quietly, her tongue darts out to moisten her lips. “Perhaps to celebrate this happy news, we should have Wardenn over for dinner?”<br><br><br> <p>Blackest of the black, darker than night<BR>Come to me my bleeding light, see she comes<BR>She comes now, enter oblivion<BR><BR>Here she is, harder than life<BR>In my arms, see she here<BR>Entwined with love, unclean she is<BR><BR>And she comes down to me, and she offers me sleep<BR>Under her black wings<BR><BR><BR>Ilharess Vivienne Lileath<BR>High Mistress of the Sisters of Myth</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bcircleofsisters.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=viviennelileath>Vivienne Lileath</A> at: 8/28/02 4:47:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umirabor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirabor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#660000>(8/28/02 5:03:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.datazap.net/free/feylin/images/shamanfeather.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *smile*</span><hr size=1> Delicious smells come from the kitchen.
