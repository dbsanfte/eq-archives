Read it carefully.  The authors are supporting a book.  That means they are trying to SELL a book, enough for me to raise warning flags right there.  Through out the whole thing I see <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> facts</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mixed in with the authors <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> suppositions</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> conclusions</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with out any attempt to clearly distinguish the two.<br>
<br>
The biggest fault I see with the theory is the authors make a big deal about Bush's administration's large representation from the oil industry, however when MOST of the events that are described occured, Bush wasn't in office yet.  Clinton was and his relationship to the Oil industry was not NEARLY as cozy.<br>
<br>
All this shows me is that you really DO NOT think.  You are as blindly faithful to your beliefs as any religous fanatic may be to thiers.  The same with Krickett.  He does not let anything disturb his warped world view either.<br>
<br>
On this specific issue, if you want to find a serious incident where oil WAS the main motivator for US policy, take a look at the 1990-1991 Gulf War.  THAT was driven largely by our economic dependance on oil and there was more than a little bullshit thrown around by the powers that be.<br>

And the article never mentions oil in Afganistan, it simply mentions Afganistan as a path for a pipeline from central asia where there ARE large oil reserves.

Now you're talking about some posts on the Flameboard (something i suppose) and french posts on Flameboard are mainly...uh.. well...hmm..they found their places there.<br>
<br>
I wasn't offended, i'm rarely offended on a forum. I was just curious about the Radgen's statement (thanks for clarification by the way). I think this forum is a bit more &quot;serious&quot; than others and that's why i asked.<br>
