(And funny considering some of his other movies).<br>
<br>
Anyway... now that I read most of the thread...<br>
<br>
One thing that is being missed, with the whole idea of banning guns... is that a gun is not really all that hard to make these days.  I mean really, some of the best guns (best as in, most concealed) for doing damage were hand made.  Sure, right now it's a heck of a lot easier to buy a ready-made gun.  But when gunsmiths were just cranking up, it wasn't uncommon to have handmade guns (rifles mostly).  If you outlawed them, it wouldn't take long for someone to start making illegal ones.  With the possible exception of the rifling, there's nothing complex about a gun.<br>
<br>
Tubing, gunpowder, ball bearings, striker.<br>
<br>
Might not be a M-16, but as stated earlier... fully automatic weapons are almost never used in shootings.  The most common are still revolvers (very cheap compared to semi-automatic pistols).<br>
<br>
And we are focusing on homicides, which as stated above really isn't a significant danger to most people, unless you happen to live in Washington D.C. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Even in NYC, if you take some precautions your chances are pretty good you'll never get shot.  Now, if you happen to flip off a bunch of gang members and call them f*'ing spics... you probably won't live long.<br>
<br>
It has been shown over and over that criminals, for the most part, are chicken-shits.  If they think there is a good chance you have a gun, they will almost definately avoid you.<br>
<br>
It's a simple fact... freedom will mean we have to deal with some stuff.  As much as liberals don't want to hear it... those of us that like our freedom accept that there are some drawbacks.  .7% deathrate from gun deaths is &quot;acceptable losses&quot; compared to losing our freedom to own guns.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as been stated... odds are that only a very small percentage of those gundeaths wouldn't be converted to &quot;knife/bludgening&quot; deaths.<br>
<br>
As much as the movies like to portray inner-city gangs running around with M-16's, AK-47's and Submachine guns... it just isn't the case most of the time.<br>
<br>
Also, how many of those deaths are gang-related, especially in the big cities?  Having a bunch of kids shooting each other of which color they are wearing doesn't really affect you and I (unless you kid is in a gang... and if that's the case... MOVE)<br>
<br>
Anyway, people that don't know anything about guns are generally the ones the most opposed to them.  They just see them as a pointless item that causes harm.  Usually they are moved by sad stories, like that of Bradley, about how they got shot and how tragic it is.<br>
<br>
Guns are not the problem... we live in a pretty violent society, taking guns away won't do anything to change that.  Actually it creates more violence because people feel their freedoms being taken away.  Though Americans are more and more getting desensitised to having their freedoms taken away, there is still a lot of us that believe freedom is above all else.<br>
<br>
We don't want to live in the UK... if we did, we'd move.  We like living in the US, and that means freedom, and that means the Bill of Rights.  The goverment has been thrashing at the Bill of Rights a lot lately, and this one is just easier to see.<br>

The smoothbore version of this is quite easy to produce with minimal machining skills and if the right sized pipe is procured can chamber commercial 12 ga. ammo.<br>
<br>
Barrel length of a weapon does not determine accuracy, manufacture of the barrel does.  The reason rifles are much easier in general to shoot accurately is twofold, a much longer sighting plane (distance between front and rear sight), which allows more precise visual aiming, and the fact a rifle is supported not just by the hands, but also braced against the shoulder making it much more stable as the shot is touched off.  Some of the better handgun marksmen in the U.S. have been able to make consistent hits on a man sized target at 500+ yards using Colt MK IV Government model .45 caliber pistols with 5 1/4&quot; barrels. (Elmer Keith was capable of doing this).  Achieving this level of skill normally takes the expenditure of tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition per year however and considerable initial talent of the part of the marksman.<br>
<br>
Hand guns are *much* more difficult to learn to shoot effectively, especially on moving targets.  If someone is willing to spend the time on it however, hitting man sized moving targets out to 50 yards is well within reason.  Thankfully, the vast majority of criminals do not spend this time.<br>
<br>
A 12 guage full choke shotgun loaded with 1 1/4 ounces of high velocity (1300+ fps) #5 birdshot is easily capable of killing a large unarmored man at close ranges (point blank to 25 ft) with a hit in the head or torso.  This same loading however, will also easily penetrate the average apartment/home dividing wall (2 pieces of 1/2&quot; sheetrock and possibly insulation) and while the force will be reduced can seriously injure or kill a person on the other side.<br>
<br>
A .410 bore (guage is not used for this one scattergun) shotgun *might* stop a large unarmored man with a load of #5 or larger high velocity shot at close range (point blank to 25ft.) but I would not want to bet my life on it.  It is relatively useless on a moving target at any distance past 25 ft. unless loaded with buckshot, even then, it is an expert's tool, the shell simply does not hold enough shot compared to a 20 or 12 gauge.<br>
<br>
Good quality hollow point ammunition will normally be just as accurate as it's FMJ (round nose copper plated) counterparts in most firearms, each individual small arm usually has a configuration/bullet weight it shoots best however.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a few items I wanted to toss out there, I've seen some very good hard facts presented in this thread but wanted to clear up a few inconsistencies.  I personally own a hunting shotgun, several rifles and several handguns.  I never kept track, but have fired somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 rounds of ammunition so far in my life.  A lot of this was during a 12 year period when I was doing a lot of hunting and also shooting competitively at a gun club.<br>
<br>
I've had times when I was armed and confronted by beligerant strangers, I was able to talk my way out of the confrontations without having to draw my handgun.  If it had come down to saving my life or the lives of those I care for however, I would not have hesitated to draw and shoot to kill.<br>
I do not feel anyone has the right to offer me bodily harm and/or possible death.<br>

Have never had to shoot another human being and hope to never have to.<br>
<br>
Personal defense weapon, Colt model 1911A1 .45 caliber handgun and yes, I'm proficient with it.<br>
<br>
I think we should ban motor vehicles personally for my safety, I'm around a lot more people that don't know how to use them than I'm around people in direct possession of firearms that don't know how to use those.  Malice is not a big consideration with me, if someone shoots me, or goes across four lanes of a highway so they don't have to go five minutes down the road to catch a different exit and circle back, hey, won't I still be maimed or dead?<br>
<br>
A small arm is a tool, just as an automobile is, used properly, it can supplement your family's table fare with wild game, provide pleasant outdoor recreation and provide a means of self defense against threats to your well being, and yes, two 200 lb. men armed with tire irons bent on caving my head in is just as dangerous to me as one guy armed with a handgun.<br>
<br>
As with any tool, a small arm can be abused if in the wrong or untrained hands, unfortunately there is a large vocal minority that views them the same way as people with snake phobias do, with a terror that cannot be reasoned with.<br>
<br>
I don't completely agree with this quote, because some are more skilled than others, but it does have some validity.<br>
