We know.  Thank you.  But don't skew things.  We were funding pretty much anyone and everyone that opposed the USSR at the time.  Problem was that we pulled our support for ALL of the organizations when USSR pulled out of Afghanistan.  There was a power vacum, and this was filled by MANY of the organizations that we funded during the war.  Out of all the groups, the Taliban came into power.  We didn't put them, or support them coming to power.  Though I do admit that them being in power is partly our responsibility.<br>

Governments change, political views change, more information comes to light, and Saddam turned out to be a tyrannt.  Ooopps our bad!  We're to be completely blamed for all that Saddam has done.  WRONG!  Saddam is a looney, his own people know it, but they do LITTLE about it.  Why?  Because they all like the power they've been given by Saddam, and a few of them are looney as well.<br>

Well those arabs are morons.  The Palestian situation is just a red herring.  Osama has been using that situation to drum up support.  The fact is, most Arabs don't give two shits about Palestians.  They see them and use them as pawns.  There was a time when the Palestians wanted to enter and live in such countries as Jordan, and Egypt.  They were refused, and forced back.  Hrms... people tend to forget this.  Palestine is being used as a weapon, against Israel.  Time and time again, it's been shown that each war with its neighbors, Israel has been attacked first.  They counterattack and kick the crap out of their neighbors, even BEFORE the level of backing that Israel is receiving now from the US.<br>

It wouldn't stabilize anything.  It would throw the entire place into anarchy.  Saddam would USE them.  Israel would be attacked by Palestinian terrorists, and would respond by entering another area of Palestine to root them out and kill them.

No the Iraqi PEOPLE are not bad people.  It's their LEADERS.  Saddam is INSANE.  The leadership of Iraq has shown numerous times that they can not be trusted with weapons of mass destruction.  They have used them many times, and many of their enemies.  Why would you think that he wouldn't use them?  Because you wouldn't?  well you also wouldn't have ordered the gassing of your own people, but HE HAS.  You aren't like him, he doesn't think like you.

<br>
1) Planes, cars, computers, the internet, this game that you play....almost every piece of signifigant technology...came from us.<br>
<br>
2) If your contry is an ally of the US, you're military would be nothing without buying US weapons from the US.<br>
<br>
3) The fact that most countries in the world that currently enjoy basic freedoms and a capitalistic society in which they have control over thier own destiny....is because the US has made it so.<br>
<br>
4) The fact that the world is relatively stable.  Yeah, take the US out of this picture and you have a huge mess.  You know why Iran doesn't attack &lt;insert country&gt; and Iraq doesn't control Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and &lt;who knows who else&gt; is because they know the US won't allow it.  Borders are stable right now because the US exists and cares.<br>
<br>
5) WE contribute more to aid the helpless of other countries then anyone else.<br>
<br>
There is a reason most of Europe doesn't speak German and live under a restrictive dictatorship.  That reason is the US.<br>
<br>
Truth is, we are *the* superpower.  It is our responsibility to police the world, whether or not we want to.  Without us, countries like Iraq *could not* be stopped.  Personally, I think the US is too nice.  We'd be better off if we did nothing to help other countries out and let them stay in a constant state of fighting and chaos.<br>
<br>
Arrogant?  It isn't a nice trait, but if any country has the right to be so, it's the US.  We've made mistakes like anyone else, but no one that knows anything about history can deny that the world is a better place because the US exists.  The existence of *the* superpower, with great ideals, keeps all the rogues and Hitler-want-to-be's in check.<br>
<br>
And for all the people out there that think ignoring the threat that Iraq poses is the better route, don't worry, we'll be there to clean up your mess when you're wrong.  We always are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 487<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/13/02 10:45:48 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lala</span><hr size=1> I'd just like to add to the above post.<br>
<br>
There are many Americans that realize that we are in a symbionic relationship with the rest of the world.  That is why the US got involved in world politics to begin with.  A 100 years ago, the US only wanted to care about their little corner of the world.  But after two world wars, and how the world was left after the second war, we realized that we couldn't stand back and be isolationists any longer.<br>
<br>
Yes, many things that have contributed to the modern world's general standard of living have come from the US, but we also understand that many other things came from the rest of the world.  Not only that, but the brains that brought forth the new technologies weren't all born and bread in the US.  It isn't a rare thing to find that a new technology was developed by an imigrant from another country.  So while we have done great things in the world, we are nothing but the sum of our parts.   Those parts coming from the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
We will never sit back idly to watch dictators terrorize their people and their neighbors.  We will not allow the world to decend into anarchy.  We are on this planet together, what affects one, will eventually affect us all.  That is why we send so much aid over seas.  That is why we wish that people weren't starving.  No we realize that we can't fix all the world's problems all at once, but it just seems we realize this more than most of the world.<br>
<br>
We are blamed for poking our noses into other people's &quot;business&quot; to often, while we are also blamed for not poking our noses into other people's &quot;business&quot; soon enough.<br>
<br>
Our Arrogance only comes out strongly, when we are placed on the defensive.  I know that if many of you were to get to know us Americans on a more personal level, you'd find that we are not an ignorant arrogant people.  Most of the time we are wishing the best for others, while trying to make our own lives better.<br>

I hate to break it to you, but planes and cars aren’t American inventions - the A-bomb isn’t an American invention either - it was for the most part invented by a team of international scientist that had fled to the US.<br>

But of course with the level of ignorance in this thread it wasn’t surprising.<br>

&quot;If my theory is proven correct, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.&quot;<br>

Just because many things that you learn you are told does *not* mean that you learn (aka accept) everything that is told. <br>

Nobody believes everything they're told. It's not a two way relationship.<br>

Considering jhave that all americans save for a few natives come from other countries Yes americans DID invent the A-bomb...<br>
<br>
If you really want to back track imigrants then I gues africans invented european culture :P...Because ya know they fled to europe....Jhave you call americans Ignorant...Your Ignorances towards us Is amazing..<br>
<br>
lol Ignorance is on both sides....Hello kettle...Yah it the fucking pot again YOU ARE STILL BLACK WTF?<br>
<br>
Btw...The internet was developed by the military/schools for fast communication....So yes it was invented mostly in the U.S. however many other countries helped develop it.<br>
<br>
btw Where the fuck was the plane invented? And dont you dare say Divinchie (sp?) invented the first plane :P....The first car was steam powered and had a top running speed of 80 M.P.H...I Belive it was invented in germany altho I am not quite sure.<br>
<br>
I thank god two of my friends in school were british...So I was able to demonstrate not all americans wield two guns and have a shot gun in thier pick up :P...I was also able to learn not all europeans are egotistical ignorant fucks who belive they are the center of creation/culture.....Its kind of scary how alike europeans/Americans are when you come down to the nitty gritty of it...No one seems to want to take the time to learn that tho...Like people say ignorance is bliss. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uariarsagittar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ariar Sagittar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/13/02 1:46:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> I enjoy it also Ahxxy, but I really took offense to that email insinuating that I was anti-american.

hrmm... should I or shouldn't I???<br>
<br>
Fuck it.<br>
<br>
Why attack Iraq now, and does it have anything to do with the coming US elections?  I mean most of the americans I talk to says that Bush is not doing to well on internal US issues, but his ratings go through the roof when the US do military actions.<br>
<br>
Another thing Canada initial reaction to the US proposal was &quot;Do not attack Iraq&quot;; however, now our prime minister says he supports the US action.  So that answers my earlier question.  But the US are going to further look into the 2 pilots who blew away the canadian soldiers.<br>
<br>
I am thinking that at the meeting the 2 leaders exchanged information that we do not know, as to why americans want to attack Iraq.<br>
<br>
Anyway I support what the americans are doing.<br>
<br>
And don't you go saying that I am backing down here, I was just suspicious as to the US motives for attacking Iraq at this time.<br>
