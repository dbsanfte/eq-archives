Didn't see the movie itself for ages. But that book set me off, I read others of Thomas Harris' books, too, before I noticed books in the next section, &quot;Real Crime&quot;. The Zodiak Killer and Son of Sam -- which, all things considere, were like uh, the PG-13 &quot;Bang you are dead&quot; type serial killers. Then, I ended up with a book from an old case, I forget the guy's name, but he turned out to have been the inspiration for both Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This was a lot less &quot;clean&quot;. Not just snuffing people out, he was doing the Buffolo Bill thing. And the locals said he was a great hunter, cos he kept giving people &quot;venison&quot; which was good eating (that is just too damn funny. Sick, of course. But man, that's hillarious). <br>
<br>
This old geezer was from the Milwaukee area, just like Jeffrey Dahmer. I thought Dahmer was really odd, he looked so quiet, calm, harmless. I mean, you look at Manson, I think damn, yeah that's the way a good nutter should look like, and act like. Dahmer looked like one of Mr. Rogers' friends. <br>
<br>
But after a while, that book started creeping me out. Or rather, the picture of the nut on the cover. I normally leave books face down, spread open. But bit by bit, that face got to me. So I started turning it around, so I couldn't see his face. Man, freaky. Fucking sick sick sick nasty. One time, a 17 year old kid escaped from his appartment, and ran down the streets, naked and bleeding, and as luck would have it, he found two cops. Jeffrey told the cops the boy was his lover, they had a quarrel, was all. The kid was out of his mind on some drugs he'd been given, and apparently unable to explain himself properly, and the cops said &quot;Fucking fags, hahahah!&quot; and took off. Dahmer killed the kid, and went on to kill a bunch more after that. Jesus, creepy. <br>
<br>
At first, I didn't even notice that I'd started turning the book over... I just realized it after a while, that I really went to some length, to avoid looking at that picture...  <br>
<br>
I've just started noticing, that when I'm look at threads where Ladida has posted something... I'm scrolling the thread up or down, as soon as I've fininshed reading the first lines in his postings. <br>
<br>
That dwarf is starting to freak me out, man. <br>

How in the world did you link together grewsome murders &amp; innocent Dwarfs? I don't get what you are saying. Does the Dwarf remind you of Dahmer? He reminds me of a drunk about to get action. All that being a cleric is about. Yeah baby, yeah.<br>

Yeah, he looks like heh, I'm gonna git some, but you can be your ass he's got ulterior motives. He's got a photographic memory and has committed to memory the face of the guy who took that picture, he'll figure out where he lives, and come knocking on his door trying to sell bibles or something. <br>

Lookat this wee bastard, he's got all them hotties around him, and you can just fuggen SEE he's up to something, I mean, can't you see it? <br>

It's like Dahmer man, I looked at that picture, thought &quot;Hahah, he looks innocent, he looks he could be the host on a children's special on PBS!&quot; but bit by bit, he started freaking me out. <br>
<br>
I think the dwarf in your picture is after me. I've been getting some phonecalls lately, that just hang up when I answer them. Granted, I answer with an energetic <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Kaplah!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and in case they don't speak Klingon, I follow up with incessant yells of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Yalla yalla yalla!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which I have reason to believe means &quot;fast, fast, fast&quot; or &quot;hurry up&quot; in arabic. But I'm digressing. <br>
<br>
Man, I got a call from someone going on about the Special Olympics. I hate those calls. Cut her off with &quot;Not interested, please take me off your calling list&quot; and she sounded really, really offended, going &quot;Oooooooohh....&quot; and hung up. I know phone solicitors say that the worst thing you can do to them, is just drag them along, tease them, pretend you are interested, and just fucking waste their time. And that sounds great, but that means I have to waste my time too, you know... I know I could just go, &quot;Oh the Special Olympics, wonderful, I've been MEANING to try and do something, cos I saw a special on PBS, and I thought that was just such a wonderful thing -- when I grews up, this family next door to us had a kid with Dows syndrome, and he really was a great individual, but you know, you don't appreciate that when you are a kid -- well, ANYHOW, I'd really like to give something, hang on, can you wait a moment, I think my dinner is burning, OH NO!&quot; and then leave the phone for ten minutes, <br>
<br>
and that'd be good, but man, I'd be jumping up and down in exitement, too wired about it all, to actually spend my time doing something sensible while they waste their time -- so you see, it'd still be a 1:1 ratio of wasting my time, versus wasting their time. <br>
<br>
And to be frank, the odd thing about it is, they call you, and HIT YOU unexpected, and during the few initial moments of talking to someone on the phone, they totally have the upper hand. <br>
<br>
Seriously, the way human beings work, you will react to someone who talks to you, while at home, you will react towards them, as if they are members of your household. This is a REALLY NEAT THING! It's social mechanics, see? It's a primitive, hardwired thing, in our social behavior: We ACT towards strangers completely different, from what we do towards people we know. Those who approach people in the streets, panhandling (I spent some time watching a panhandler today, it's quite interesting seing who they ignore, and who they ask for money from -- it's like a national geographics thing) or whatnot. <br>
<br>
Well, some fuggar that can suddenly appear in your home, and talk to you like that, has an advantage during the first few seconds, and once a &quot;protocol&quot; of communication has been established, it's very hard to break it. Ie., the caller is REALLY friendly, and your knee-jerk reaction is to be really friendly back at them... But when you realize that this is NOT a friendly encounter (your knee-jerk reaction of friendliness is due to the home environment -- this telephone voice is basically greeted as a family member. A door visitor is completely different, because you will be able to visually tell that they are not a family member, or a friend, AND the physical presence of a body allows you to unconsciously read body language) -- when you realize how truly rude this invasion of your privacy is, the protocol; the tone, has already been set. And you feel that you would be wrong to suddenly switch the protocol. The caller themselves feel the same way -- althought they know a lot about the techniques of how to prod people along, they don't know that much about the social aspects of the interaction, and ironically enough, this very ignorance HELPS them, because they can sound GENUINELY indignant and selfrighteous that you should suddenly turn this pleasant interaction into a hostile one: ie., you are overreacting, and are being unreasonable. <br>
<br>
Some woman gets a call, from a female (this, I think, is somewhat typical of a female-female situation), she says, don't EVER call here again, and whaddaya know, the caller rings the number back up (I guess this was before caller ID) and screams at her, calling her a bitch. Now, road-rage, that is just plain stupid -- but man, unsolicited calls like that, you hang up on them, and THEY call you back and swear at you, damn!<br>
<br>
Now, this is very interesting! <br>
<br>
Hell, I should talk to the next caller, about this. But the thing is, no matter how with it we are, it's really hard to not be caught off balance, with a call like that. <br>
<br>
I am a quick thinker, but no way man. I couldn't do shit. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not interested, please take me off your calling list&quot; is all I could manage. The &quot;please&quot; is very important. That means, even though I sound angry, it still appears that I have still been polite, and they cannot feel selfrighteously offended. <br>
<br>
Once I hung up, I thought I shoulda said, &quot;I am sorry, will you please take me off your calling list, will you take me off your calling list, I didn't catch that?&quot; because she didn't really say anything. Most will confirm that they will do so -- as they are required by law to do so. <br>
<br>
Then, I thought, I shoulda said, &quot;hey yew know wut, mah neighbour has a tard kid, he's like a mongoloid or sumthen, ah fukin hate that little sumbitch, I sic'd mah dog on dat little sumbitch, caught 'im pissin in mah yard once! His daddy called the po-lice, but my uncle's on the force, he doggone take care o' that, told that tard-breading homo there aint nuthen he kewd do bout that, seing there's no proof them bitemarks were from old Howler, no sirre... Now, seeing that you hippies be calling me about this here shiet, I'm gonna go kick that tard kid tomorrow, an' I'm gon' go kick 'im geewd, ye'hear? That aint no real olympics anyhow. Aint got Nascar, what kinda ho-mo shit's that, what you hippies got them tards ice-skating too now? *poit* shiet.&quot; <br>
<br>
Damnnit, now I completely lost to train of thoughts. Jebus. <br>
<br>
What was I talking about again? <br>

My Dwarf may very well be out to get you Cogito. To me, he hardly looks innocent. He is the man. He is blasted &amp; charming the ladies. This guy is about to have Midget sex.<br>
<br>
I really feel odd about it, but I am sort of jealous. This guy is about to have Midget sex &amp; here I am doing comedy bits with Cogito on a message board. I wish I was this dude. I wish I was having midget sex.<br>
<br>
I think there are many advantages to midget sex. No lie. You think these guys worry about women worrying if they are big enough? Fuck no. They have had their entire life to worry about the &quot;small&quot; thing. They are after all midgets.<br>
<br>
They get to say things like, &quot;Hey baby. Ever done it in a drawer?&quot; I will never in my life be able to say that. For some reason, I really wish I could. I think it would be a fun line.<br>
<br>
This guy is a badass. On this night, he really could get lost under the sheets. He could get tired of trying to get on the bed &amp; say, &quot;Hey babe, lets do it on the floor.&quot; He is gunna have fun either way.<br>
<br>
By the way, the Special Olympics are rampid with steroid use. Fucking cheaters. <p><B><FONT color="gold">Ladida Hohum<BR>
