Your right. I'm sure the Media is getting a ton of facts wrong, they usually always do. THis does not stop the fact that she failed in numerous areas.<br>
<br>
1. The kid got out. Child proofing your home is a basic necesity.<br>
<br>
2. If she put the child to bed for a nap why was there no crib bar?<br>
<br>
3. If she is at her BF house, and it is not child proof, she should have been more careful/ attentive to where and what her child was doing.<br>
<br>
4. WTF was her car doing unlocked. This is not bad parenting, but it sure must have been a low crime area.<br>
<br>
5. How the hell does a 2 yr old open a car door anyway? Not a very easy task for a 2 yr old.<br>
<br>
So given it is VERY hard for a 2 yr old to open house doors, and then a car door, it is highly possible she left the child in the car.<br>
<br>
And about the publicity seeking Neighbor. She has no reason to lie. I see little vendetta.

This woman had been entrusted with a precious life and what she was doing is of little or no difference to me, her actions allowed that child to die.<br>
My children are 8 &amp; 10 and I worry when they go to a friends to play. I have 30 minute check ins when they are simply “outside&quot; playing (i.e. riding bikes, scooters etc...) and if they don't make the check in's I go check on them. Now don't think I am like a jail warden and they are on a clock, I made this policy when they became old enough to play outside with out constant supervision and they are used to it. Since they are getting older I don't freak as badly as I used to but the facts remain anything can happen and if you are going to take part in an activity that is going to keep you so occupied that you forget you have kids then you need to have a baby sitter hired to keep an eye on them or do it at night when the children are in bed asleep.<br>
I do not have the sympathy for this woman that others appear to have. I thankfully can not fathom all of the pain but I have seen it on parent’s eyes before when I have assisted in telling them that their child did not make it. This woman lost her child due to negligence and I truly believe she disserves every minute of suffering she endures, alas I do not know if there is a just punishment for her. Would putting her in an air conditioned jail with TV’s, cable, library, and out door activities be enough. Not in my opinion but we do not allow torture in this country..... Unless you are the victim... Unless you are that poor child who was trapped in that car. I wish they could find a recording of that child crying saying 'Mommy' and play it over and over for the woman to hear... more than likely that is what the suffering child was saying when she realized she was trapped and couldn’t get out.<br>
I read the mother's post and the only person I feel sorry for is the brother of the child. I fear of how he will blame himself for not guarding his sister... a job it appears he was left with all too often, a job his mother should have taken. That boy will learn a life lesson we all fear (losing someone we love) at an age that is so delicate with developing emotions as is.<br>
Maybe I am just hard and without sympathy but I feel we are too sympathetic as a country as a whole and that sympathy should be used where appropriate. Just because people are capable of creating life does not mean that they are capable of being a parent.<br>

There is none that could justify her negligence.  The only time you ever leave a child that young out of your sights, is when you physically put them to sleep. If they're awake you should be watching, all the time, 100% total supervision. <br>
<br>
This woman complained about her husband's addiction to Everquest. How he had obsessive compulsive disorder. How he engaged in online relationships with girls much younger than himself. How he physically abused her, even while she was pregnant. <br>
<br>
Firstly, I dont think she really even knows what obsessive compulsive disorder is because she throws the term around so losely. She claims everyone she's ever met in EQ has either been obsessive compulsive, or bi-polar. That's horseshit. She herself was just as addicted to EQ as her husband. Addicted enough to allow it to consume her time to the point where she lost track of her daughter's whereabouts. She accused her husband of having online relationships with young girls. Yet she herself has a boyfriend 15 years her junior, who happens to play EQ. What are the odds that she met him ON-line? She isn' cheating though, considering she had this relationship after she divorced her husband, but having a real realtionship with someone you met online who is 15 years younger than you is a bit excessive. Finally, she accused her husband of abusing her while she was pregnant. Yet after giving birth, she clearly was abusing her child. I don't, not for one second, consider negligence, a grounds for manslaughter. Not when it involves a person too young to take care of themselves. Failing to act is an action failed. <br>
<br>
This woman is a hypocrite and a murderer. If she didn't have another child to care for, I'd fry her. But frankly, she doesn't deserve kids at all. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162713&amp;resize=true" target="top"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lich Croneus Titanis</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>65th Arch Lich</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.evguild.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Elitists and Vagrants</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg" target="top"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Tribunal</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~egoss/Rynniasux.bmp" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heelyeheelye>Heelye Heelye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/1/03 7:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1798.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: some confusion</span><hr size=1> Did the kid even have a license? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.iinet.net.au/~lisselle/Heelye1.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I'll leave my personal sentiments out of it, but our guild as a whole, even though Ocean(something something something) was guilded - I think still trial, a very short time, we feel badly for her situation.  We feel badly that EQ was put before a child's safety and health.  We encourage our members strongly that under all circumstances that Real Life matters and responsibilities need to come before anything involving this game.  We are very sorry that she neglected her child, but, nothing anything remotely involving our guild, the management of the guild did or would do anything even remotely resembling pressuring someone to play EQ and support guild functions over taking care of Real Life responsibilities.  We are all free to make our own choices and act of our own accord.  She did not choose wisely.<br>

I believe the child was 3.<br>
<br>
I have a 2 year old daughter and she can easily open doors, walk around, get out of her crib - even with a crib bar.  She is capable of unlocking doors that are deadbolted.  Even with the childproof door handles (the plastic covers that go over the door knob) doors are able to be opened.  The only way to ensure a child's safety is to constantly know where they are.  I get nervous if i don't see / hear my kid for 1 minute.  Nothing good can come from silence.<br>
