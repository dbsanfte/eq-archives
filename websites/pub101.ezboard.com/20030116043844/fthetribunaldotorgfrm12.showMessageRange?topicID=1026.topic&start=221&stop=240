However in the case of Iraq that was the direct intent. The lead nuclear engineer for Iraq was leaking information the the U.S. He told us  that Iraq was pretty much stuck in their nuclear testing, this reactor however would give them a boost in their studies of nuclear reactions. And accelerate their final destination of an A-Bomb.<br>
<br>
I am not sure how it would have played out if Israel had not destroyed it before they could study it....Allot of the scientists in Iraq were very happy it was destroyed though because none of them wanted to make Suddam a bomb. Everyone knew exactly what he would do with it and everyone but him knew the repercussions of using an A-Bomb. France knew the high potential for disaster with this sale and they ignored it. <br>
<br>
North Korea is a different story....They already have nukes. They have no need for something to study. <br>
<br>
Merton.....Almost every country has sold arms to the middle east. The U.S. was targeted for the AID it gives to these countries such as medicine/food/water/money. For some reason we still think perhaps if we are very nice and keep giving them what they need they will somehow like us. But instead we got 9/11.<br>

The difference between laser guided weaponry on military installations...And slamming a plane into a huge building with no military applications whatsoever is clear as night and day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udarkalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkalen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/02 7:45:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All you French dick-wicks</span><hr size=1> Funny thread guys; very entertaining indeed.

- &quot;i dont really view a bunch of arabs with shotguns as a large powerful army. sure, maybe in afghanistan (sp?) and a few other struggling countries, but if they tried against any power, like France, or Germany, they'd get their asses handed to them and told to shut up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmmm...last I knew these fanatics hijack planes full of innocent people (and crash them into buildings full of more innocent people), bomb civilian targets like restaurants, wedding parties, bus stations, etc, arm 10-year-olds with AK-47s and send them out to fight on the front-lines, test nerve agents on their civilians...not too mention starve and oppress their own people (who they say they are fighting for) while the leaders themselves enjoy things like electricity, running water, indoor pumbing, books, an education, etc.  That's a far cry from a bunch of Arabs (as you call them) with shotguns.<br>
<br>
And we didn't go guns-blazing into Afganistan, killing innocents in responce.  We gave the Taliban a choice and 2+ weeks of time to think about it.  They refused and waited for their &quot;breathren&quot; to back them against us.  And again, what does the U.S. do?  We target (to the best of our abilities) military targets -- unless of course that target was in the basement of a hospital or school, must be our fault for that too, eh?  We drop food and medicine to Afgani refugees.  Relief workers from the U.S. (and other countries as well) risk their lives to help build make-shift tent cities to at least offer something to the people there suffering.  If our troops get captured they are dragged through the streets, beaten, stoned, kicked, shot.  And what do we do with the prisoners of war we capture?  We treat them as prisoners but we house them, clothe them, feed them, give them medical attention.<br>
<br>
And yes, other countries have suffered just as we have.  Have they done anything about it?  No.  What does the U.S. do?  We send those countries aid in the form of money, technology, medicine, etc. along with our sincere condolences.  What do we get in return (for the most part) when it happens to us?  &quot;The U.S. asked for it!  Bunch of hypocrits!&quot;<br>
<br>
It was great watching Arafat a few weeks ago on CNN when Powell was sent there.  We know they (the Palestinians) don't want our people there or our influence, but Arafat was quick to ask for our &quot;aid and support&quot; (aid and support = $$$$).  You want to talk about hypocrisy some more now?<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the U.S. doesn't have an agenda.  The fact is that EVERYBODY does.<br>
<br>
Oh, and to Nenya S.:  Yup, some of our priests here have done some horrible things to children, and they are going to pay for their crimes.  Let me ask you about the church in Europe during your great history you and others speak of.  Oppression.  Murder.  Torture.  Theft.  Complete abandonment of their beliefs over power, land, money, pleasures.  And I am sure, with a list like that, there was some molestation of children, women, men along the way.

At that point it was obvious that Germany was defeated as Soviet troops were already in Poland and it would have been only a matter of time before USSR would have liberated Western Europe.-<br>
<br>
Come on now, give the rest of the history regarding why the US didn't invade France until '44. Just giving that little blurb suggests the US didn't want to invade until '44 when the Germans were bled dry. Well, we did in a way, but nothing at all like the Russians waiting until late summer of '45 to declare war against Japan, but hey, mother Russia &gt; USA, right?<br>
<br>
As for whining nationalities, please, do NOT put Bulgarians in the same category as the nasty French. If you had to put up with 500 years fo the 'Turkish Yoke', you would be a bit bitter too.<br>
