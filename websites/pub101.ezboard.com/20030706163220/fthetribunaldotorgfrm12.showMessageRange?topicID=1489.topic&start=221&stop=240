USA:  Armed/guarded south Korea so they could grow into a reasonable economic and industrial force, a technological marvel (what is it, 75%+ of people have broadband internet?), and a lifestyle so dramatically different from their neighbors to the north (who have starved and suffered in abject 4th world poverty for 50 years).<br>
<br>
Are you really Korean?  I actually don't understand the S. Korean animosity toward the US.  Ask your grandparents what they think of the US.<br>
<br>
With regards to your other points, France and Russia (USSR) are also notorious for selling arms to the highest bidder.  Please add them to your rant.  I will admit that the US handling of Afghanistan in the 80s and early 90s was horrible, and led to the rise of the Taliban.  So focussed on fighting the USSR, they completely lost sight of what they were doing to the Afghanis.<br>

Of course it is so nice of you to leave out certain points of history which dont fit in with your &quot;big evil america&quot;<br>

Factual, and to the point.  If you don't read it, no big deal, but I think its a worthy read.<br>
<br>
First off, Afghanistan was being completely taken over by Russia.  We were in a time where Russia was attempting to become the worlds super power, and Afghanistan could make them a fortune.  But why you ask?  This is a landlocked area with no great natural resources, and the opium trade is where they get their money.  Well put simply, the person who creates and owns a pipeline through Afghanistan can charge you to funnel your oil directly to the ports south, shaving plenty of time and money from the current system of transporting it through the western countries.  It's a more direct route.  We funded a group of Afghanistan nationals to take their country back, led by Osama Bin Laden called the Mujahedeen, or freedom fighters.  The group Osama Bin Laden actually led, unknown till the Talibans rule began in Afghanistan was Maktab al-Khidamar, an Islamic group composed primarily of Pakistanis, who funneled money into the Osama Bin Laden led assault on the Russians to get their country back.  For this, Afghanistan was indebted to Osama Bin Laden, and he was made THE national hero.  We saw a mutual enemy in Russia, and figured we could help out this country, and perhaps even gain something from it.  (Unrestricted access to the pipeline that was meant to be built from the days of Mohammad Zahir Shah, the timeperiod in which Afghanistan was most stable, 1933 till 1973 when his brother-in-law stole the country from him and exiled him to Rome)  The brother-in-law changed the country, removing many of the religious stricts the country had in place, angering many Muslims.  This made the land and its people embrace the Taliban extreme ideals of a fully non-Westernized society.  The pipeline idea was totally scrapped, as they wanted nothing to do with the Western world, and once again, America was seen as the evil expanding empire, attempting to corrupt their way of life by making women equal, and children educated outside of the bible.  (Quran, Kuran, or however you feel it should be spelled)  Jump ahead to 1993, Osama Bin Laden along with other extreme groups bomb the WTC, and hit various American targets around the world, and he becomes the FBI's most wanted.  Unfortunately, we did almost nothing about it, (You can lay sources of blame anywhere you want.. most conservatives blame Clinton for not releasing the hounds when the WTC was bombed the first time, and not &quot;teaching them a lesson&quot; letting them think it was something they got away with, and subsequently ended up doing it again, while liberals blame us not taking our warning and pulling completely out of the middle east struggles.)  However you look at it, you can't blame America for attempting to help Afghanistan against a common enemy.<br>

<br>
the expansion of the Roman Empire was for booty. when the booty ran out, they spent all their time guarding it from the northern hordes, who wanted that booty, then they started letting those barbarians into their army. the barbarization of the roman legions was one of the main causes of their eventual demise. The other was their extensive use of lead pipes.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sliver123>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/22/03 10:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grats Legendary and Dark Virtue! =)</span><hr size=1> Why does an attack on a nation get taken so personally by people who live there? It's not your fault if your parents fucked there, or in Iraq, or in Indonesia. Each individual in America isn't responsible for what their government does, an attack on the government isn't an attack on you personally. <br>

Some of those ideas back then were really good ideas.  Sure, they may kick us some now, but then, they might not.  I'm sure one of you history fuckers can dig up all sorts of arms/training deals the US made that COULD come back and kick us in the ass.

I'm certain we could have wiped out our own poverty, educated millions, cured diseases and balanced our budgets (several times over) if we hadn't wasted billions watching out for YOU.  (at Your request mind you!)<br>

<br>
The US, like every other country in the world that can afford to do so, helps foreign nations in order to promote its own interests. That includes giving aid for natural disasters which would otherwise threaten to destabilise a region, selling corn at bargain prices to the former Soviet Union, and giving foreign aid to Europe in order to prop up post-war economies, thus preventing instability and further conflict.<br>
<br>
The complaint about not receiving similar treatment from those countries is clearly flawed. If youre earning millions and your brother, who earns $10k a year, has his roof blown off, you send him a cheque for a new roof. If your roof blows off dont expect your brother to be able to afford to buy you one.<br>

The retalation for 9/11 was just right. We found out Bin Laden was behind it, we knew he was hiding out in Afghanstan, we told those bastard Taliban to hand him over, and when they didn't we went in and supplanted that government as well as wiping out as many terrorist training camps as we could.<br>
