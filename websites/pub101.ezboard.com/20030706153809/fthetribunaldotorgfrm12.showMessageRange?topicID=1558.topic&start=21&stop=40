<br>
He was by far the best seller in the guild, making a fortune on sellables that nobody in-guild needed before the bazaar.  Probably had honed those skills with his personal business, but it was just that.. personal business.  I'm only saying that AFAIK no major Companions GUILD funds or loot were ever compromised, and so saying &quot;a guild got jacked&quot; is inaccurate.  What mando chose to do with his group-gotten goods was between him and the EULA, but at no point at least while I was &quot;in the loop&quot; was it a guild issue.<br>
<br>
That said, i've not been in the loop for a while, but there wasn't any massive flaming that I saw when he left which usually accompanied people ebaying guild stuff.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rynnia>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Custom title</span><br>  Posts: 1205<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 4:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Taking what is not rightfully yours is &quot;jacking&quot; something.

<br>
You cannot keep tight enough tabs on things being sold or whatnot, because you rely on the honesty of the individual selling the item to report what they sold it for.   Yeah, here's 20k from Blessing of Aegolism... (when they sold it for 30).<br>
<br>
Not a good idea to let a known ebayer manage the guild bank.... but that is just my personal opinion.  There are controls you can put on it, but it'd be far better not to entrust your guild bank to someone you KNOW is actively ebaying, or even one that has ebayed in the past. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 4:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Yes, that's true, and probably did happen on well more than one occasion - but he was still getting 20k for the spell that we were getting 15k for before he was involved (theoretical example), so call it a &quot;win-win&quot; if you will.<br>
<br>
It was a potential disaster, of course, where he could have logged in one day, taken a few million plat and some SoDs and gone to town, which is what seems to have happened in the thread originally posted.  It was a risk, but I guess like I said, unless something happened after I was no longer involve, it didn't pan out that way (and is certainly a nonissue now).<br>

<br>
Mandoman didnt run the guild bank - he was given items and spells to sell and then returned the plat to Nyrkl who was the banker.  While its possible he was skimming a commission off the top - the guild did benefit in that none of the other officers were interested in spending hours flogging the stuff in tribauction (this is before the bazaar patch remember).  In any event the amount of plat that he brought back into the bank corresponded roughly with the value of the items he was given to sell so if he was jacking up prices then I guess the only real victims were the people buying KEI.<br>

It would own to have a guild bank management system like the guild management tool. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rynnia>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Custom title</span><br>  Posts: 1208<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 9:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Well if he did skim off the top, but paid ya what you asked for the spell, then I guess you can look at it that you got the money you were selling for and he got a commission.<br>
<br>
Anyways, unless the guild agrees he can keep it or he should get a comission, that's guild money.  If it is agreed he &quot;can&quot; keep it without normal guild member consent and knowledge, then it borders on the TR problem, just differing in the fact that in this case, only one individual is profiting and only partially so, especially if it is known where the plat is going to end up.  If he had banked plat, it would have been better to sell him the spell or whatever first, and then let him sell it for profit if he liked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kinvarasceasar>Kinvaras Ceasar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 9:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Rynnia you're so full of shit.

<br>
That said, he gave no reason whatsoever to make us think he was (he generated a lot more guild cash than before he was involved, with the same sellables), and in the end it's really a matter of trust.  I think it's safe to say we trust that he wasn't cheating his guildmates, and moreover, its much safer to say that just because you know he was on playerauctions selling plat (we knew that too...), you can't possibly &quot;know&quot; where he was getting it from.  I believe he was getting it from some serious farming he was doing on his personal time, and very very skilled salesmanship.<br>

Hey... I didnt say his name to begin with.   I was told to say the name or shut the hell up ya pussy....<br>
<br>
I told ya this would happen. ; )<br>
<br>
<br>
And ok Kinvaras big tough guy... I still don't think you'd have the sack or the stupidity to actually lay a finger on my at some fanfaire.  If we're both at one together, though, I guess we'll see, eh?<br>
<br>
And Illist... I'll hold my tongue for now, but I could chew ya up and spit you out faster than you could blink an eye with what I know of ya! : )  I assume the beer bottle comment was in reference to the fanfaire eh?  Cuz I didn't run over and get into a fight there?   I'm curious who was saying that they did... because nobody, not one that night, even LOOKED like they were going to get into a drunken bar room brawl over a slapped camera.  But I suppose you would have tossed your 400 pounds into the mix and gone at it, right?  Didn't think so : ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1558.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1558.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1558.topic&start=61&stop=69>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1558.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1558.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1558.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1558.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1558.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1558.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
