<br>
  He was frustrated also, we all made mistakes (us for killing, you guys for spawning with insufficient force, qudos for not keeping the heart to multi)<br>
<br>

<br>
We have no choice in the matter.<br>
<br>
The GMs made it absolutely clear that the rule regarding Ragefire is that whoever *spawns* the mob, *owns* the mob until it depops.  This is apparently official VI policy.<br>
<br>
That is the reason why he asked Qudos to destroy the Heart, because the only person that is allowed to kill a spawned epic mob is the person who spawns it.  If Qudos had run up and spawned RF, it would be Qudos' heart.  I suspect this is news to most of you, it was news to us.<br>
<br>
So the moral of the story is this.  If I have a cleric, and you have one that's camped RF for 60 hours and have 45 people in the zone, I can just run right by you with DA up, hand the pearl in, spawn RF and guess what, YOU LOSE.  The spawn is mine, you can't touch him.  Even if I have only 3 people in my guild online, I have the full depop time to wait for them to log on, call up friends, watch RF depop for another 4 to 72 hours.  If you kill him, tough luck.  You still don't get the heart.  And I get my pearl back.<br>
<br>
No ifs, ands or buts.<br>
<br>
That's what I meant in my previous post.<br>
<br>
So unless we find some form of handling this spawn, basically every RF spawn is going to be a zergling cleric rush with every guild in town running to hand a pearl in first.<br>
<br>
And no, Nerple did NOT lose the pearl.  It was reimbursed by the GM.  The reasoning behind it being the GM did not consider the killing of RF to be killstealing (IE, we did not attack it while they were engaging or attempt to kill it while the battle was in progress) as opposed to premature termination of a quest in progress.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think VI is the cause of this whole mess for:<br>
<br>
a) creating such a stupid and absurdly timed spawn<br>
b) creating such an over-powered epic that makes it a necessity on many raids (don't say it's not, we all know it is)<br>
c) making the spawn contingent on the killing of a Dragon that we're unable to kill because it has a level limit.<br>
<br>
Maybe the server will come to a resolution.  But I doubt it's going to happen any time soon.  Not until every guild can get over Personal_epic_horror_story_001 and concentrate on a way to make this work.<br>
<br>
As for the way Legendary does things, the last several RFs that we have gone after, we kept forces of 12 to 18 people, in SolB during the entire camp, 24/7.  Several members remained online as long as 35 hours straight to support our clerics.  Our position of being there, and in sufficient force to kill the mob is something we have practiced as well as preached.  We would *NEVER* spawn Ragefire if we didn't feel we were capable to kill him regardless of when he popped.  If we don't have the force in place, we just walk away from the camp, we don't try to lock up the camp hoping that he spawns when people log on.  But then, maybe that's just us.<br>

<br>
1. Our server just sucks. Crashing 5 times in one day and the lag spikes and such, we are already at a loss to other servers. Verant claims that the reason cleric epics are at a bottleneck with ragefire is &quot;because friends want the clerics to get their epics.&quot; While this may be true, it is also evident that if our damn server would stay up for one whole week, we could get a few more epics cranked out, slowly clearing out the bottleneck. /rude Verant.<br>
<br>
2. People are being told different things by Verant reps. When we were camping in the Lair for my Epic, we were talking directly to a Guide about the policies, because we had wondered what the official stance was. We were told that whoever spawned Ragefire would &quot;own&quot; the spawn until they failed (as in complete wipeout of those at the raid) and it would then become the property of whoever would kill him. As mentioned above, the GM/Guide tells people something different. <br>
<br>
I already know one cleric that has quit this game recently because Zordak had popped in the Lair and as he was ready to turn in his pearl, the server crashed. They came back, of course, to Naggy. <br>
<br>
This is just an insane spawn that brings out the worst attitudes and situations for the server. Is there a way to work it out ahead of time? No, not with the state of our server and the crashes. Is there a way to work it out with others? Yes, but it takes everyone being adult about it. <br>
<br>
I do believe that there needs to be some guidelines set-up, either by Verant or as a mutual understanding between us. Why should we be fighting with one another, risking a cleric's entire Epic? Pissing contests don't mean shit! You lose more by participating in those than you win in the end. Maybe here is where we need to step back and say &quot;Okay, what happened in this case was wrong, so let's fix it before it happens again.&quot; God knows Verant won't help or fix the situation and if we don't figure something out, it will only get worse.<br>

No guild is immune from this.<br>
<br>
Actually it has been known for a bit that interfering with a triggered quest mob is not right and GM intervention will occur.  These rulings were brought about when they brought in those triggered quest mobs with velious that pop in another damn part of the zone.  I'm still on the road, so i can't look it up for you, but yes, this is NOTHING NEW.<br>
<br>
As for a cleric thowing up DA and turning in the Pearl, let them.  If they really did have only 3 people in their guild on and they ran in anyway to turn in the pearl, they not only threw away their pearl, but will be known as the complete assholes that they are.<br>
<br>
Really, if you are doing Ragefire, I think you should call in the GMs BEFORE you go about the quest as opposed to complaining to them after the fact.   I have found a lot of guides who are more than happy to watch over a quest to make sure it goes according to plan.  After a few years of them saying &quot;We have to witness an action in order to do anything about it&quot; you would think people would do something as simple as &quot;/petition Hi, I'm about to do the next part of my &lt;insert quest name&gt; quest in &lt;insert zone&gt; at the &lt;insert spawn location&gt; and I would love it if you could come and watch to make sure no glitches occur&quot;  Believe it or not this works for me. <p><hr>

Its ironic isnt it, the same people who screamed bloody murder are now doing what they said was wrong. See I told you, Greed gets you in the end.<br>

As far as cleric epics go, I believe all clerics should get one on turning 52, then I could die anywhere and be fucking happy.<br>

In case you missed some of the previous posts above (cuz there are so many):   EV &quot;talks&quot; about FCFS.  But in actuality when RF was up and EV came and saw SI was already there with Nerple (who camped RF for at least 3 days), EV said &quot;we don't care&quot; to Nerple and took RF from her anyway.  IMHO EV is no better then Legendary in what they did.<br>

<br>
If someone triggers it, the only test of whether or not it's a capable force is if they can take it down in the time period alloted.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that if Legendary had stayed out and SI had failed, that everyone would care a lot less about Nerple's problems and that would have been the end of it. The fact is that what Legendary did was wrong, they should have known it, and noone ended up profiting from it.<br>

Sucks to be Qunos and Nerple.<br>

                                           SI should've been more supportive of Nerple in her epic quest. Having 6 or less members online while one of your clerics is trying to survive off 2-3 2 hour naps per day means<br>
                                           you really don't care very much about that cleric... especially considering she'd already camped him 2 times previously. You punks should've made it a point to secure a<br>
                                           successful RF killing for her 3rd camp. That's pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
/boggle   I could understand it if you said we had 20 on and only 6 or so people show up, but having 6 or so online early in the morning shows nothing except that<br>
<br>
a.)  People have Jobs<br>
b.)  People have school<br>
c.)  People have children and families<br>
d.)  People have lives<br>
<br>
I have none of the above.  I wasn't online at the time.  I was sleeping.<br>
<br>
e.)  People sleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           EV should stop ganking the easy Velious dragons like Woushi and Kelorek'Dar, and especially that gimpy loot-dropping mofo named Lodizal. I mean, GOD DAMN! Does every EV<br>
                                           have a Lod Shield and an Eyepatch now? Sure as hell seems like it to me... You guys can take the ubers in SS, ST, ToV, Kael, and anywhere else you want.... leave the baby<br>
                                           epic encounters for the baby-uber guilds.&quot;<br>
<br>
EV has nothing to kill for the most part.  Klandicar and Zlandicar are rarely up because of server crashes.  Sure, they could go after Aryonar, or Yelinak, or any of the more interesting Temple of Veeshan encounters that other servers are doing, but they don't have enough people for those encounters.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           SI needs to stop bitching on the messageboards and generally stop acting like they have a pinecone up their asses. Wah, they said we exploited Dozekar, we have to put up<br>
                                           with a guide following us around for the next week to make sure we aren't exploiting for personal gain. SUCK IT UP! YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT! Go out and get that god damn<br>
                                           chip off your shoulder... whatever it takes. Believe it or not, most of us think you guys are actually pretty damn uber, so let the crap that 2-3 posters say about you just fall<br>
                                           off you like water on a duck's feathers. They're a bunch of newbies anyway, shouldn't affect your game at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, we need to not push the vindicator into respawn clerics that complete heal him every frigging time  : P  Ya know how frustrating that is?  !#@$!$<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm glad Nerple got her pearl back.<br>
<br>
The funniest thing about this whole thread you are forgetting is the first cleric to get his epic weapon on the ENTIRE SERVER, was Shortman, senior cleric of the Elitists, I mean White Wolf Clan, yeah, White Wolf Clan.  Just goes to show that you don't have to be so &quot;uber&quot; to get your epic weapon, or even own the first one on the server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/unerple.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NERPLE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Think Purple....

   A few people from EV did apolgive for what they did afterwards....Qudos apologized. Im not mad at them. But the rest of you that are trying to defend what your guilds for how they acted, you will not make yourself saints for kill stealing. <br>
  And yes we may have been short like 2 people and had more coming for ragefire, and yes you too would feel rushed if there were 15 people looking steal something from you over your shoulder. <br>
   <br>
  I didnt get to post this earlier... but I want to say i hold a lot of respect for the companions after all this, they would never try and steal ragefire from someone like ive seen it happen from other guilds. When i had ragefire pop for me the first time i was camping him with another cleric from the companions so both guilds imidiatly had more then enough people each to kill him there instantly. But like mature people we talked had an no intenions of stealing this from someone. <br>
  I want to thank Colette, Nyrkl and the others who came to help yesterday....im just sorry it ended this way. <p><center>
