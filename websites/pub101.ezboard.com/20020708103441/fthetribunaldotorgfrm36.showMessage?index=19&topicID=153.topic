Wenin can you honestly say that you think the government should be able to hold a US citizen, indefinately just by saying &quot;They are a enemy combatant&quot;?    Can you not see the abuse of power this is?  So far all we have is what the government has said, and they have not actually had to prove any of it.  <br>

Because of this, the north had the industrial power to fight a sustained war against the southern states.<br>
<br>
What about when FDR interned Japanese American citizens during World War 2? Since we know the outcome of these actions can we proudly say the ends justify the means, even if American citizens constitutionaly gauranteed freedoms are stake?<br>
<br>
The flip side is that Germany also suspended freedoms of it's citizens, even before WW2, in order to &quot;protect the state&quot;. Many of it's citizens were detained and even executed without a legal trial in the name of protection. And the vehicle that allowed these actions was complacency by most people and a desperate need to believe thier governement was there to protect thier interests and not serve itself. It's a slippery slope when you set precedents that give the government control over your actions. The only thing that saves the citizens is their ability to vote out administrations every 4 years. But good propraganda campains have a way of dealing with a normal citizen's ability to make informed voting decisions. <br>
<br>
I hate to sound like a conspiracist (because I don't think our goverment is evil, it's just self serving) but if you think you're still in control of your goverment then you are exactly where the government wants you. In front of your TV. Not much we can do about propaganada I guess, but if you ever see the word protection, just think loss of freedom instead. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

The detaining of Japanese American's during WW2 has been rulled illegal and the governement ended up paying damages.<br>

The only thing that worries me, is the same government that is calling this guy a &quot;enemy combatant&quot; is the same government that wrongfully hounded Richard Jewel after the '96 Olympic bombings.<br>

While I am reletively sure that this guy was doing exactly what the government said he was. they still should not be playing so fast and loose with the constitution, especially when you don't have to.

The Japanese American's were detained without any proof, that's why it was illegal.  This guy is a totally different situation.<br>

As far as a comparision to Richard Jewel, this situation is also completely different.  They had nothing on Jewel, besides that he acted &quot;funny&quot; and was seen in the area.

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  American terror suspect to be held indefinitely</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
By Christopher Newton<br>
WASHINGTON, June 13 AP - The United States will not bring American terrorist suspect Jose Padilla before a military tribunal, the Justice Department told congress today, according to congressional officials and officials with President George W Bush's administration.<br>
The Justice Department, making its case in a closed meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the United States can hold Padilla until President Bush decides the war against terrorism is over.<br>
&quot;They say it's not punitive, it's just purely prevention to stop him from attacking us,&quot; said one congressional official<br>
&quot;He's going to stay in the can until we're through with al-Qaeda.&quot;<br>
Government officials had said there were no plans to put Padilla before a tribunal, but officials told the Judiciary Committee that the decision was now final.<br>
During the briefing, which was confidential and included classified information, the Justice Department also sought to allay concerns about the legal implications of Padilla's citizenship.<br>
Padilla, a Muslim convert and former Chicago gang member, is being held by the military. He is suspected of being part of a plot to detonate a radiological weapon - or &quot;dirty bomb&quot; - in the United States, but he has not been charged.<br>
Padilla worked out of Lahore, Pakistan, and met senior al-Qaeda operatives in Karachi twice in March, government officials have said.<br>
During the meetings, Padilla and the others are alleged to have discussed the radiological weapon plot, and also proposals to bomb petrol stations and hotel rooms.<br>
In the committee briefing today, government officials said that previous court cases, including a 1942 Supreme Court case, show that US citizens can qualify as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; - the legal term the Justice Department argues allows a person to be held without trial.<br>
An American captured with German saboteurs in 1946 was executed under the ruling.<br>
The government also told committee members that Padilla fits all of the criteria of an enemy combatant because he allegedly met a senior al-Qaeda official, learned how to blow up a dirty bomb, got training and financing and then flew to the United States with the intent to do harm.<br>
The Justice Department told the committee that the executive branch alone had the power to decide when a person qualifies as a combatant, an administration official said.<br>
US officials say they decided against holding a criminal trial for Padilla because it might reveal intelligence sources.<br>
<br>
[story continues with details about Padilla's background and a Muslim charity that had its funds frozen] <p><br><br>

If all the governnment has to say is &quot;He is an enemy combatant&quot; then NO citizen is safe.<br>
<br>
The government has made accusations, but has not had to PROVE anything.    Hell even if every detail of what the government has said is true, they barely have cause for a consiracy charge.<br>
<br>
The cases of the german sabetuers WERE different in that they were caught in the actual act or on the way to conduct specific attacks.    Not to metion it is questionable whether a law related to a DECLARED state of war is even in force any more.<br>
<br>
There was actually quite a bit of evidence that there were SOME sabeteurs amoung the Japenese American population, however they were not sure how deep it ran, so they locked them ALL up, illegally.<br>

But it wouldn't be a tough thing to prove.  Meaning, the process wouldn't involve a defense attorney, and wouldn't take long to conduct.  The burden of proof would be there, but wouldn't be anything like &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt&quot;.  I suppose it would be something similiar to the hearing that people get, when charges are pressed against them (can't think of the term right now).  But charges don't have to be pressed, cause I believe once &quot;charges&quot; are pressed, then the person charged is warranted a speedy trial.  It is my opinion, that in the situation we are in now, that immediate trials for people would hamper intelligence gathering, as the person would have to be made available to a defense attorney.  I'd rather have that time spent being pumped for information.<br>

And you are refering to an arraignment.  They should still be allowed to consult a lawyer (we are talking about haveing your rights revoked here)  But if they ARE going to do this there needs to be some form of accountable due process. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
The lawyer will tell the person to keep quiet and give him all kinds of advice.  We don't need anyone helping these guys who are acting against this country.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the way he's been treated will affect his trial (as long as it isn't a jury trial).  As long as they treat him legally, and though you may think revoking his civil rights is illegal, it's legal under US law.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the safety of the lives of citizens, there are times that &quot;the ends do justify the means&quot;.  To me, the government has not crossed the line, so that the &quot;ends don't justify the means&quot;.<br>
<br>
So far, the way I live my life, my rights are still protected.  Our rights were given to us, to avoid unjust persecution from the government.  It wasn't meant to be a shield to be used against the government to allow it's citizens to place the country and his/her fellow citizens into harms way.<br>
<br>
Yeah arraignment is what I was describing.<br>

&quot;Hell, an FBI agent sent a memo with his opinion that Bin Laden was going to crash a commercial aircraft into an American structure and even named the WTC as a likely target. If an FBI agent called it that accurately, seems to me the people above him with even more intelligence resources should have been able to see it coming and at least attempted to head it off.&quot;  -- Loegan<br>

&quot;No not every arab flight trainee would have been a terrorists, which is exactly why arresting everyone is not an option at all. however, if they look at everyone from a middle eastern country and &quot;hostile&quot; african countries they would see, &quot;Hmm...he has a history of being associated with Islamic Extremist. Hmm..and this guy is suspected of being involved with a terrorist cell in france. Hmm...and today &lt;checks watch&gt; Sept 10th all these shady figures are meeting in Boston. And today (watch says Sept 11th) 5 arabs with flight training and a possible history of militant training are boarding the same flight. Oh and 5 more are on that flight. &lt;cell phone rings&gt; Oh, 5 more are boarding that flight. and 4 there. Maybe I need to get a hold of some people and have the flights held so i can detain these people.  That's a farfetched scenario, BUT that is how we stop stuff like this, and have in the past. You don't need to infringe on people rights by throwing them all in jail cells while you figure this out (other than delaying their flight, but under the circumstance, i doubt they would care in the long run). The FBI has its flaws tho. Maybe all that would have been necessary, if that memo was seen, is to tell that field agent to investigate further. he might have found some similar conclusions, maybe even pieced it together when some of them got together in Florida to brew some anthrax, and maybe his next fax would have had a much larger priority. Because you see, it goes from a vague report that got overlooked to a seriously specifc wake up the president type of memo. But it didn't happen that way. Point is, all it takes is a little investigating by people with the information. You don't need to lock up everyone. 9/11 fell through every crack. That is why it happened. It could have POSSIBLY been figurd out and prevented here, here, here, here , here, and here if someone would have just said &quot;Wait a minute...&quot; Not the case here. it's unfortunate. but i have less interest in why 9/11 happened and more interest in what is being done to stop this busy mall from blowing up or this chemical agent from being found in the air surrounding Chicagoland, or even what is being done in England or France or Australia or Germany to keep those people safe and sound.&quot;  -- deeho81<br>

&quot;This is the price we pay for freedom. People in the USA are generally innocent until proven guilty. <br>
Its just like trying to get a restraining order against someone. There has to have been a threat made and a law broken before one will be issued. It matters not that someone maybe capable of a crime. It only matters if they have committed a crime or made serious threats too.<br>
I am a conservative. So in a serious politically heated battle my words will have a conservative spin on them. A liberal will have liberal spins on their words. Its times like these we need to stop and ignore the political spins and rhetorics. We need only look at the laws and look at the USA as the free country it is to understand how these atrocities are allowed to happen.<br>
Its not that the Republican President failed us. Its not that the preceding Democrat President was a pussy for 8 years and allowed the al-queda to gain strength against us.<br>
It is simply the laws and ideas that we as americans have that all men are free and all men are innocent until proven guilty.&quot;  -- Krickett<br>
<br>
Stuff like this prevents catastrophies.  I lean towards conservative viewpoints, but I have many left-wing beliefs as well so I don't consider myself either or.  However, I will say that I have a criticism for left-wingers pertaining to the subject of this thread.  There IS no pleasing you.  If the country doesn't detain, you cry foul, and say &quot;You should have done more to prevent it.&quot;  If the country DOES detain, you cry foul, and say &quot;You shouldn't do this he hasn't done anything yet.&quot;  Bottom line is, make up your minds. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

It may be legal, but that does not make it constitutional.  The law you are refering to has never been challanged because it was never really used.  The german sabetours were shipped off to military tribunals not just &quot;held&quot;.   The Military Tribunal part was ok'd by the Supream Court, but then, Segregation was still constitutional back then too.  I am not entirely sure that Military Tribunals for US citizens, would pass a test in court now.<br>
<br>
And I am sorry, but if the government is going to try and take a citizens rights away, they NEED a lawyer.  A right to counsul is one of the rights we have.  And &quot;The end justifies the means&quot; is a very scary attitude to have.  THAT is what allows governments to get out of hand in the first place.<br>

Radgen, I and probably the government isn't all to worried about this single guy.  I highly doubt his IQ reaches triple digits.

Is a battle worth winning, if you KNOW that you will loose 10% of your force?  Death is bad, death of a human life, can not be replaced.  Winning that battle is what is important.  Commanding a company to climb atop a hill and hold it against all odds, knowing they will die, but also knowing that their deaths will allow the battle to be won.  The ENDS do sometimes justify the MEANS.  You can't not deny this.

This is exactly what the terrorist mindset was from 9/11.  The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> end justifies the means</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> attitudes typically spawn rogue reactionaries and renegade extremists. I do not think that the US, in practice, thinks this way. Nor do I think it bodes well, or can be inferred from, any of the moral, ethical, or judicial systems we have here.

I didn't say it was built on the principle of &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;.  What I was saying was that EVERYTHING done in this world is based off a calculation EVERYONE does, that is &quot;do the ends justify the means?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Doing good in school?  Late hours, cramming to the last minute, perhaps even cheating?  There are different degrees of &quot;means&quot; in order to do well in school.  Some people are willing to cheat, some people are willing to cause themselves physical harm, all in order to do well in school.  Do the ends justify the means?  Some say yes, some say no.  It's a personal decision that each person has to make.  That line is an individual line, that is drawn by each and every person. <br>
<br>
The phrase &quot;The ends DO justify the MEANS&quot; is not an EVIL phrase.  It's a FACT of life.  But the knee jerk reaction to such a phrase, is people buying into the propoganda that the &quot;Ends can never justify the MEANS!&quot;.  The reason why, is people place such a negative conotation on the phrase, and place themselves as the judge of everyone.<br>
<br>
So far, IMO (and the majority of the country) the means that the government is using to combat terrorism, is JUSTIFIED by the ends.  We are at war.  In order to win wars, things must be sacrificed.  Sacrifices, just by the word, can be painful.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to allow the government some lee way, in detaining people for questioning.  Though, like I said, I do agree that there should be some kind of arriagnment. That while won't be conducted in order to press charges, it would be in place to ensure that people aren't imprisoned without grounds.<br>
<br>
So I ask you.... at what point do you draw the line?  What level of &quot;means&quot; can the government use, that will justify the &quot;end&quot; of the threat of terrorism?<br>
<br>
Should the government have waited however long, til he broke a important enough law, in order to imprison him?  Just how much value would the information he has, be lost during that time?  That loss of valuable information, would it be acceptable?<br>
<br>
The people of this country are demanding that the government act, in order to protect our lives, but then there are some that wish to hold them back, so that they are unable to do their absolute best to protect those lives. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/02 12:48:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=153.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So Elche..</span><hr size=1> Alajan, YOU think that way.<br>

Was getting up this morning to go to work, sacrificing your day, worth getting your paycheck?  Did the means of you obtaining your paycheck this week, justify obtaining it?  Since I imagine you're able to go to sleep at night, I'll assume the answer to be yes.<br>

There are some people that do real shit jobs, in order to get that paycheck.
