Should I be worried about this blatent liars words being hurtful?  First off, I wasn't powerleveled.  I grouped all the way up, not with guild members, but with outsiders in Dreadlands from 40-50, and in KC from 50-56 or so.  After that, I started grouping primarily with guild members, and on Saturdays I'd do exp with guildmembers and yes, Crush, in the Hole.  Jealous you couldn't join for the exp eh?  And as for loot, since you know absolutely nothing, but you quit the game over loot, I'd shut up.  Yeah some loot whore.  I've looted 6 items in the past 6 months, which happens to be the least of all the rogues in the guild.  I'm about as far from a loot whore as one can be.  Ask anyone who's grouped with me in outside of guild groups.  I don't roll on anything I won't actually use.  Oh and thats with a hell of an attendance record.. 90+% last month alone.  So, how bout you get your facts straight, he who quit over the emperor 2h stick.<br>
<br>
Oh and in case you're wondering, from 1-6 I fought in GFay, 6-22 in Unrest, 22-28 in MM, 28-35 in Cazic Thule, and a bunch of places from 35-40.  None of which, did I receive powerleveling from Crush.<br>
<br>
Oh and I didn't ask Crush to powerlevel me, or even help me out on his server.  I quit Veeshan because I was done with the game when our guild was absorbed by FoH.  Brad had quit, and I had no interest in starting over.  Crush talked me into starting on his server, which he had tried to do when he started on this server the day it opened.<br>
<br>
And what the hell are you talking about with the druid thing?  I don't even have a druid.  If you're talking about Tanus, he's a r/l friend, level 60, and a member of the guild.. not that you'd know.. being that you quit so long ago over loot and all.<br>
<br>
So all these attacks come down to this.. you can't possibly find anything I backpeddled on, and can do nothing but disagree with my opinion that your class shouldn't be in god mode. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

He shared Darkmask with a r/l friend of his who often ignored tells so that people wouldn't know.  (Not that he needed to hide that.. not THAT big a deal.)  When he made RF, he basically took all of the stuff others earned for him and pretended to retire, so that he would be able to play a twink without helping out the guild when he was needed.  At one point, he applied to FoH for a cross server move, and claimed to be the most active puller on the server.  (And yes, I was shown the app by a r/l friend in FoH who knew he was in my guild on Tribunal) but was turned down because that wasn't a class they needed.  When the guild was doing emp key or shards, he would go to one of the camps, join, and leave as soon as he got what he needed, not helping others with theirs.  He would often log off if what we were doing wasn't beneficial to him.  Often times he would try to talk the rogues into making an &quot;exp group&quot; with him so that he can get it all.<br>
<br>
He tells off guildmembers in public channels, and on private boards, trying to cause disharmony enough to make people want to leave the raid for the night.  He martyrs support when he doesn't get items he wants, and tries to guilt trip you so that you see things his way.<br>

I started this char out at level 1 here.. I didn't do a server move or anything.  Yes, I came here because of Crush, but only in the sense that it gives me a game to play with a r/l friend I've known for years.<br>
<br>
I've been playing this game for three years+, minus a break I took when Kunark came out.<br>
<br>
As far as defending ebay people goes, I think ebaying is wrong, because you're selling everything that someone else earned for you.  I did also say that if someone BUYS a char, it doesn't necessarily mean they won't know anything about hte game.  If someone plays a level 60 bought on Ebay, they can learn just as much as someone that leveled up to 60 in the same amount of time.  Thats primarily because the high level game isn't something you can really learn leveling 1-60.  You have to admit that until you join a top end guild, as a cleric, you've never used or been part of a CH chain etc..  And there are also players that suck at high level that DID level all the way up.  I don't see how you can compare me with an EBay'r.  I've used the name Jaeron for 8 years since I was mudding on Sojourn, the game this game is based on. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
Jaeron has laid out a falsehoods too though. DM didn't get into the guild by his drawings and even if he had, he was a damn good enchanter and helped alot of guildmates (at least while I was there), so that kept him in.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what either Jaeron or DM was like after I left EV, but I do know this looks pretty ugly for both of ya when you start hitting below the belt like this.<br>

Brad McQuaid played a ranger there, we were guilded together for years.  This games combat system and balance system is identical to Sojourn.<br>
<br>
Those quotes you made of me.. I say<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
No class should solo except for a necromancer, because the games designers said so.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When I say this, I'm saying that in the games design, the necromancer was balanced to be able to solo.  If the game designers want this class to be able to solo, it should be the only class that can solo.  If they balance the class to solo, and everything else can solo, then balance is out of whack.<br>
<br>
I'm NOT saying _I_ think the necro should be able to solo.. I don't think any classes should.. I'm saying the designers want that class to solo.  Or at least did a while back.  If you think thats back peddling, then I won't try to convince you otherwise.  To me, you are misunderstanding. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

If you look above, I'm saying from 40-50, and 50-56 in this statement.  RF's statement was trying to say I was given a high level rogue account almost level 50, and I was pleveled to 60 from there.  I am ONLY referring to levels 40-56 in the statement made above.<br>

Must have me confused with somebody else. The times I was helping PL you was at the Rygor Orcs (or whatever they are) in EW. I never was at unrest with you. I honestly don't remember your level though.<br>
<br>

<br>
I remember you were out getting exp during raids because you weren't anywhere near high enough level to raid and then Crush and I would help you afterwards, so there is no way you got a pre-leveled rogue.<br>
<br>
I know you came to the server to play with Crush and that you had a high level character on your previous server and that's why I had no probs with helping speed the process. If you could have transferred characters back then like you can today, probably wouldn't have even been an issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Oh and btw.. I think Loegan would be the last person to defend me, but I think he can vouch for that. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I don't know why you'd say that. I have a ton of respect for Crush and he said you were good people, which makes it so in my book. You and I have never had any probs that I know of and I always thought you were cool.<br>
<br>
If I have had friction with anyone involved in this, it would be DM, though I don't know if it was just FB banter or not - it can be hard to tell with him sometimes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, friction or not, I am not going to make shit up one way or the other. Like I said, you did not have a pre-leveled rogue waiting for you and you were always playing Jaeron when I was helping to PL you. <p><br>

You had a high level character on your previous server so what's wrong with speeding your levels on Tribunal? It's not like you hadn't already payed your dues.<br>
<br>
I could see why people would think less of you if you hadn't already leveled up a character before and this was your first character, but it wasn't.<br>
<br>
If I had to start from scratch on a new server, I would get PLed if I could. Why would it be better to go through all those levels the hard way again? <p><br>
