<br>
Um no, try again, that was Bowynn. Seriously do you know anything or do you keep pretending to know? If you want my involvement with the whole Razzine incident, feel free to search this board, but once again I will shorten it for ya for all the mental midgets who have a hard time grasping this.<br>
<br>
1)Met Razzine in 6th grade * we develop a crush on each other secretly as children *<br>
<br>
2)Razzine moves away in 7th grade<br>
<br>
3)Time Passes<br>
<br>
4)Playing EQ, I discover an ezboard Tribunal Board ( the original )<br>
<br>
5)People post pics, and I post mine<br>
<br>
6)She notices my pic and recognizes me, sending me an email asking if I was the same person she remembers<br>
<br>
7)We begin to talk and reminiss about old times<br>
<br>
8)She tells me horror stories about her life ( Heart Replaced, Lung Replaced, Cancer, Miscarriage, Had to give up her child, was abused, lost fist husband....etc.), I feel sorry for her<br>
<br>
9)She pushes for a relationship, sending me very racy pics<br>
<br>
10)She keeps bringing up our childhood * ie my boyhood crush of her and her crush of me *, which makes me feels mushy combined with the sympathy for her, I feel I should protect her<br>
<br>
11)We raid together a few times in game and chatting on AIM<br>
<br>
12)I dont believe all her stories of her now current horrible life * often questioning things to which she has a ready lie to cover herself or she begins to go into a flurry of denying *and notice she is asking about moving in together alot<br>
<br>
13)I contact friends in SI who know her and they tell me what they know about her and warn me to stay away as she is trouble<br>
<br>
14)I start avoiding her in game and out<br>
<br>
15)She gets upset and seeks comfort with Bowynn telling him horrible stories about me and how cruel I was to reject her affection<br>
<br>
16)She gets flamed on the the flameboard, Bowynn is the only person defending her, while various guys ( including me ), she has fucked over, and women too post their stories of their twisted past/encounters with her<br>
<br>
17)Changing her name she works her way into VV and mind fucking Bowynn and other guys at the same time<br>
<br>
18)She contacts me, pointing out over and over again how she loves me but I missed out because she is with Bowynn now, but if I only said I wanted her too, she would drop Bowynn because it was me that was meant for her....blah blah.<br>
<br>
19)She tells me stories that she visited Bowynn and that she cannot stand him, and he drinks all the time, and how hes abusive * It wasnt true but 99% of what she said was a lie*<br>
She also then starts to tell me stories that her roommate is molesting her, which apparently has nothing to do with her saying she walks around the house naked * yeah she told me walked *<br>
<br>
20)She pushes even harder to come live with me, and for me <br>
to take care of her and save her from Bowynn and her roommate * I do however help her get into EV * big mistake.<br>
<br>
21)I say no to her living with me, I dont think moving in with people you meet online is a good step when you havent seen them and spent time with them.<br>
<br>
22)A friend introduces me to one of Razzines old friends, whom gives me access to private forums on her board, where she has private rooms for various guys, in each of the room, she is saying the same thing, how she loves each guy. She is playing all the guys against each other in race to see who will let her move in first.<br>
<br>
23)Bowynn cracks, letting her move in with her friend, the moving is paid for by another EQ player who was suckered into all this.<br>
<br>
24)She emails me from Bowynn's house saying she is getting beaten by him, and how all he does is drink, * again with this story * she confesses to having sex with him to me ( dont know why ), but saying he forced himself on her. * All lies again *<br>
<br>
25)I try to contact Bowynn to tell him what is going on, and how she is royaly mindfucking him and playing him.<br>
<br>
26)Bowynn whom hates because of the shit Razzine fed him about me * which were lies *, refuses to talk or see the posts that were copied where she is playing us against each other.<br>
<br>
27)A small flame war builds between me and Bowynn on this board, with me saying he doesnt know all the facts, he refuses to listen, the flames end when Razzines Old Friend who is also Bowynn's friend asks him to listen.<br>
<br>
27)With help from Razzine's Old Friend, Bowynn starts to read the evidence that has built up, where she is telling me she cannot stand him and she loves me, when he is under the impression she loves him and I am stalking her.<br>
<br>
28)Bowynn says he will set traps to see if she is trustworthy<br>
<br>
29)I wash my hands of the whole situation * I find out she is also manipulating people in my guild, after an arguement about her, I decide to back off and let things unfold *<br>
<br>
30)I read on the flameboard she has stolen Bowynn's computer, I am saddened he didnt listen<br>
<br>
So Xaveria, that is my involvement with the situation, if yer gonna pretend to know something at least be in the same ballpark, saying how I was the guy in the whole wheelchair bandit thing is like saying how you will find King Tormax in Vulaks Room. Same continent, wrong person.  <p><center><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/RFthunderkickfinal2.gif><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92681>

Wizards are the only ones that are totally concerned with DPS output.  All other casters have other responsabilities during endurance encounters, so their equipment demands are slightly different.<br>
<br>
The one thing that remains constant for all casters is sustainable mana pool.  For wizards, that translates directly into increased dps, especially dps over time, so its easiest to see what kind of effect equipment has on their performance.  Increasing the sustainable mana pool for the other int casters has a net effect of increasing DPS and sustained DPS, it's just not as easy to see.  Extending a magician's mana pool in effect extends all other casters' mana pool.  I don't know enough about end-game necro's to talk about them.<br>
<br>
Equipment is just as important for casters as it is for melee, its just that they have different concerns about what that equipment provides.<br>

It seems he's developing quite the romantic relationship with krickett. A passionate companionship, kindled in the heat of flamewars. Their love blooming on the battlefield, inspired by the hatred they share for you. It is this hatred that allows them to seek refuge in each others' arms, comforting one and other, assuring themselves that they can defeat you if they work together. They discuss tactics; Krickett with his superior healing skills helps fagmo by alleviating some of the pain generated form his bulbous anal warts. Once they have recooperated, they dive back into the battle, new insults armed and ready. Snide, insipid remarks, so spiteful and vengeful, aimed at cutting the heart out of their enemies. They unleash a barrage of attacks attemping to destroy their foe. And finally they achieve victory, relishing in their victory, they hurry back to fagmo's cave, where they celebrate by mowing each other into the wee hours of the night.<br>

<br>
On a raid, all classes share the most significant sources of mana regen: KEI, canta, PoTG, and some classes have spells that help them above and beyond those provided by other classes. FT fits into this, but is insignificant to stand alone.<br>
<br>
Lets go back to the 4000 manapool and the 2600 manapool, only this time we just pick a random non-shaman caster. Even someone with FT 15 will take more than 9 minutes to regenerate 1400 mana. Add this to the fact that no one burns ALL of their mana at once, having 1400 more mana compared to the guy the guy with 2600 means the one with the larger manapool can sustain a set ammount of mana usage by 60% longer.<br>
<br>
Eating rods is fine, but at the same time you are taking away from other casters on the raid who may or may not need the rod more than you, depending on how many mages you have making rods and making sure they don't rot.<br>
<br>
In order to achieve maximum efficiency, theoretically a caster should maximize their own potential (via manapool) and maximize their mana regen (mostly via other classes). <p><BR>

<br>
Actually, (again wizards pop up, but...) it does matter when a wizard mems their spells.  Harvest provides 300 mana per cast, but has a 10 minute refresh.  It behooves any wizard to mem this spell the second they have zoned in from a death due to the fact that they will want to cast this as quickly as possible following a resurrection.<br>
<br>
This is true whether soloing or raiding.<br>
<br>
Being able to guarantee a TL within seconds of being rezzed to a random cleric recruited to provide a resurrection is a nice enticement, as opposed to making them wait around for you to med up to the amount needed.<br>
<br>
Being able to begin buffing yourself earlier post-rez during a raid is also very nice.<br>
