but that wasn't clearly stated originally. My answer to your question is; I dont.<br>
<br>
It's VI's fault and intention at the same time to make the AoW despawn after an hour. They expect any guild who is attempting the AoW to go through the the first two challenges before hand. Your *attempt* at the AoW is your reward for taking out Vindi and Statue. And his loot is your reward for *defeating him*. That would be my guess as to why he despawns so quickly. You're expected to combat all 3, sort of like an endurance test. I imagine defeating the Statue, and then only having an hour to prep and kill the Avatar was not a flaw in the mechanics of that challenge.<br>
<br>
Of course VI can only do that much on their part to enforce the logistics of that battle. If you (you in the general form) insisted on coming to Kael with the intent of only fighting the AoW, then you probably weren't serious about trying to kill him. That said if you were serious about killing him, you have two options:<br>
<br>
Camp kael Arena with a force capable of attempting the AoW and claim vindicator/statue before another guild can. Thus assuring your attempt at the Avatar<br>
<br>
Or, get in contact with guilds who attempt and kill the Statue but aren't capable of taking AoW yet, and work our an agreement with them to perhaps notify you when they are planning on killing the Statue.<br>
<br>
The other two options are get lucky, or complain until VI changes the spawn time; good luck. <br>
<br>
Basically, if you don't stick to those options, then the &quot;wasted&quot; AoW is entirely your fault. But I prefer to think of it as a lost spawn, not a wasted one. In my opinion there is a difference. You can't expect a less stronger guild to leave the Statue alone because in doing so, they will waste an AoW spawn. Just like you can't expect a shot at the AoW if you don't prepare to be there to take the Statue as well.<br>
<br>
Hope that answers your question.<br>

After all If you can drop the mob and you need his loot then you probably should. Would be nice if some of the guilds that drop him durring our peek hours would send us a tell letting us know they were killing the statue though so we could *maybe* run to kael with a raid force an try him.

If the Statue had zero loot for exemple, then it would be fine.  Or the best solution IMO is that killing the statue would make spawn a quest NPC, then you have to give an item to the NPC or say a key word, and that makes spawn the AoW, who has the normal despawn time.<br>
<br>
Your solutions about that are kinda silly, we cannot have a force able to give a real at AoW at any time.  It's a very hard fight where we need our raid crew there, which means ideally during weekend, or at least during weekdays it has to be during GMT evening.  If AN kills the statue during aussie evening, there's no way we can kill AoW after that, same if SI kill the statue during US evening. <p><center><b>Baron Karim Mishakal &lt;The Companions&gt;<BR>Oracle of the Tribunal<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2978 target=window>My profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucroneustitanis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Croneus Titanis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 1:20:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=309>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.animatedgif.net/cartoons/flhumpy_e0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> Karim, please read my post again.<br>
<br>
&quot;..the problem isn't that you have to kill the Statue for fighting AoW, the problem is that the statue is killed by guilds that can't do AoW.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed. And I never said it wasn't a problem. The &quot;challenge&quot; (in part) is to kill the Statue to make the AoW spawn. The problem with guilds killing it who can't kill the AoW, can only be solved with the solutions I mentioned above. Those are the solutions for the problem in its current form. Changing the form of the challenge would be a good idea, and one that only VI could take care of. Of course if you only changed the Statue to having no loot, you'd only fix half the problem. So the guilds who want AoW will go uncontested, but the guilds who are capable of taking the statue and want a reward for their efforts will get shafted. Isn't that sort of selfish? The idea about a quest NPC spawning after the Statue dies, and turning an item in to trigger AoW is also a good suggestion. But where would you get such an item? Probably from the Statue. And if it was No Drop (as I'm sure something like would be) then you still havn't fixed the problem. Guilds capable of killing the Statue, will do so, loot the item and keep it in their treasury until they are ready to try the AoW. Would you expect them to allow a stronger guild to come in and loot that item? Not likely. I think you nailed it on the head when you suggested that they increase the despawn time of the AoW. That would solve all of the Players concerns, but then you might be infringing on the original intended design (courtesy of VI) of the whole challenge. <br>
<br>
My solutions were not silly. My ideas were specifically for dealing with the problem in its current state, and within the realm of the players' powers/rights/capabilities, whatever. <br>
<br>
&quot;we cannot have a force able to give a real (shot?) at AoW at any time. It's a very hard fight where we need our raid crew there..&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, completely agreed. I never suggested you have a force ready at all times to take him out. I suggested you have a force capable of taking AoW out, then claim, and kill then Vindicator and Statue yourselves, so you can guarentee your shot at the AoW. That only leaves the problem of guilds on southern hemisphere times, killing the statue during their hours, thus never allowing a guild on American/European time, to even have a shot at the statue during their regular hours. That seems to be the current problem for the most part.<br>
<br>
So the ideal solution would be to up the spawn rate of the Vindicator/Statue to twice its current rate. This would in effect double the chances of him being up during your playing time. American/Euro guilds would still be missing half of the potential spawns but that would occur during times that they aren't playing anyway. And it would allow everyone regardless of location to get at least one probable solid chance at taking him out. This would also still comply with the idea of having to kill the statue to get to the Avatar, as I beleive is the intended challenge. Of course there would still be arguments about the spawn never being up during American hours thanks to Euro guilds, and vice versa, but at least those two sets of hours, overlap somewhat. The problem is, does VI want to increase the drop rate of potential statue loot? BP of Erradication is nothing to laugh about.<br>
<br>
Again if a guild wants to try for the AoW, they should be prepared to deal with Vinidicator and statue as well. If he is never up during our hours, thats a problem VI has to fix. My ideas were for dealing with the situation in its current, fucked up form.<br>
