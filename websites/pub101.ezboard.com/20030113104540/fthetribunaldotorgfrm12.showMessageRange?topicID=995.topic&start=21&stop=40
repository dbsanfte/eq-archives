Football is always good, although the Vikings aren't doing so hot lately.  15-1 what, 3 years ago? And they went like 6-10 last year.  Gann.<br>

I stayed up to watch the soccer game last night and I have to admit it was actually exciting.  It was a pretty good feeling when that US dude with the mohawk (Mathis?) scored.  All those Korean fans got all sad.  HAW!  The one thing soccer needs is a 25 minute overtime though.  Sudden death.  Ties are gay.<br>

Hockey, I watched that, it was pretty exciting for a while but I kinda got bored seeing them dump the puck in and hope someone could get it.   <p><img src="http://server17.hypermart.net/catacomb/flasshsig.jpg">

All the pro athletes are grossly overpaid anyway, and as a result they are driving most of their respective sports right into the ground.  I've always maintained that every player should get paid based on performance only.  None of this $4 mill a year for a middle reliever or $10 mill a year for some Ukrainian backup center that I could give 2 shits about.  You could cut every pro salary by 1/3 and then actually lower some of the ticket and vending prices at the arena so it isn't 50 bucks to sit in a decent seat and $6 a beer.  Instead we feel the need to pay a guy $20 million a year to play a game.<br>
<br>
The last bastion of respectable salaries was hockey, but now the greed is seeping into that sport too, and ruining the best sport in North America. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoctraculapinkerton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Octracula Pinkerton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 957<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/02 11:47:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bullshitjob.com/officespace/peter.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Basketball isnt a sport, its a business</span><hr size=1> Everything changes. By and large, change is accepted in most aspects. For some reason, however, these fucking fundamentalist purists of sports just can't handle it. Sure, you have to peel a few layers of corporate packaging off to see it nowadays, but the competitiveness and heart is still there. <br>
<br>
What? Players aren't competitive nowadays? Aight, I'll tell you what- YOU go out against 300 of the best athletes in the world year after year, get beat into oblivion game after game (even basketball erodes the hell out of your body over time) and still manage to maintain the peak physical shape that is, more than ever before, absolutely required to compete at a professional level.<br>

No talent, eh? I guess you've never seen him pass. Or run. Or use some of the finesse post moves that, contrary to what you love-to-haters may believe, he actually does possess.<br>
Quick elbow the jaw? Yeah, after they fucking step on his ankles, try to smash his already arthritic big toe, and rake his eyes for good measure. Shaq gets as much as he gives.<br>
3 second violations never being called? I saw a sequence last week where on three possessions he was called for it twice.<br>
<br>
What's so totally insane about Shaq is that nobody else his size can do what he does. Someone 7'1, 350+ pounds, strictly speaking, shouldn't be able to run as long as hard as he does, or even absorb the cataclysmic shock that is landing after he jumps. I have the utmost respect for the shit he goes through to play the game.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Kobe Bryant practically decked Mike Bibby and the foul was called on Mike Bibby which helped the Lakers get the go ahead score.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Basketball is probably the quickest sport on earth, and when two of its faster players go head to head and come into contact, it can be pretty fucking hard to determine who fouled who. Occasionally there are errors. How about that screen that Chris Webber threw on Derek Fisher to get Bibby the game winning, open shot? Could have been called a foul, but, compounded with the fact that refs absollutely hate to call fouls in the waning seconds of a game, it all happened so quickly that it wasn't.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Most of the Lakers fouled the hell out of the Kings and werent called on it, and it helped them get their last two victories to push them into the finals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And Vlade himself got at least 30 free throws off of flopping from nonfouls. After Bibby hit the aforementioned shot, Kobe missed a shot that could have tied the game. It mght have been because Kobe's aim was off. It might have been because Bobby Jackson's hands was clamped on his forearm. It goes both ways.<br>
<br>
It's a physical game. Making contact is not always a foul. Both teams played their hearts out,and in the end the Lakers were a tougher, more talented team. They had been there before, and it showed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Celtics were supposed to be in the finals, until the rumor started to float about Jason Kidd beating his wife and being called on it, so that upped viewership and got more people watching the Nets.

<br>
The rumor started floating around? She fucking called the police and he admitted to it. Maybe you're referring to when she said &quot;it's nothing to what I usually get.&quot; If anything, that would raise interest in Jason Kidd's character by villifying it, yet he is characterized by the NBA as a great guy- they would either want to downplay or ignore that.<br>
The Celtics were supposed to get into the finals? Not really. There's a few reasons they almost did.<br>
1) Antoine Walker finished his evolution into the prototypical power forward.<br>
2) Paul Pierce hit his big shots. I dunno how you can &quot;fix&quot; physics.<br>
3) Jim O'Brien totally kicked ass. He finished his 'adjustment' period, and his ability to tailor his plan to his player's abilities (Pitino tried WAY too hard to shove square pegs into round holes) and getting his team to buy into team defense did the trick.<br>
4) With the fall of the 76ers, the Nets were really the only standout team in the east. The superstars are concetrated about 75% in the west, so teams in the east win a lot of games against some shitty competition. The Celtics were just fundamentally sound enough to beat the shitty teams most consistently.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And the players don't really play for their team, or for their pride, but for their paychecks... And thats how you see players moving from teams to teams... Because they have a bigger offer.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Back when players didn't move, people across the nation complained about dynasties. Mostly in places like where they didn't have any. Now you have competition, and parity becomes this huge thing. <br>
Look at the best teams from the last decade. Sure, Jordan and Pippen were the only players that were on all six Bulls championships, but in all honesty, they were the only two that really mattered in the long run. The sharpshooter that started out as Paxson became Steve Kerr, and the low post pretty much sucked gonads through the entire era.<br>
The Lakers have kept Kobe, Shaq, Fox, Horry, Fisher- their whole starting lineup (even though they plug in some stiff at the 4 in the regular season, Horry is THE power forward come playoff time) through their three championships. Every year, some team signs a Laker backup to a contract for way more than they are worth (exhibit A- Tyronn Lue. This offseason someone will undoubtedly give Devean George some huge contract too). However, the core stays the same.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ted Williams was the last player to hit over .400 for a season.

<br>
Steroids don't improve your hand eye coordination. The last guys to come really close to .400 consistently was Tony Gwynn, and he was a fat fucker.<br>
Lackluster pitching? Compared to the 50's, theres about 30 teams now to 15 then. However, whereas they had White Americans as a talent base, the major leagues now have all of America, Latin America, and increasingly Korea and Japan as a talent base. On a team per team basis, each team now draws from a talent pool about 7 or 8 times the size of what it was in the old days. So don't try to feed me shit about diluted pitching.<br>

Yep, thats why all of, what, two europeans were represented in the allstar game? (Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojakovic). That's probably why there is a total of one european on the two teams in the finals as well (the Lakers third string center, whatever his name is.)

<br>
If you haven't noticed, every team that makes it to the finals has at least two 3 point shooters that can be counted on to make it. The Lakers have Kobe, Fisher, and Horry. Even Fox isn't exactly a slouch. The Nets have Van Horn, Lucious Harris and Kittles. Jefferson hasn't really shown if he can make them yet, but they obviously have faith in Kidd in crunch time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There's seems to be no concept of &quot;team&quot; anymore, as compared to the teams in the 80s. They're just a bunch of well paid guys jammed together who are trying to stumble on the right chemistry that makes them win games. I would hate to be a head coach in the NBA today.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You kidding? Chemistry is what Phil Jackson makes a LIVING off of. Probably why his teams have won 9 of the last 12 championships. Say what you want about &quot;anyone can win with Kobe and Shaq/ Jordan and Pippen&quot; but the fact is that neither of those duos did shit before he got there. The Bulls got absolutely owned by the Pistons, and the Lakers got swept out of the second round of the playoffs by the spurs (who, with Jackson, the lakers are 8-1 in the playoffs against since) before Phil got there.<br>
<br>
If you want to blame lack of chemistry on someone, blame it on the coaches. It's no coincidence that most often, teams going from average to good or good to great coincides with a change in coaching more than change in players (and vice versa)-<br>
<br>
Larry Brown going to 76ers<br>
Byron Scott going to Nets<br>
Jim O'Brien going to Celtics. <br>
Phil Jackson going to Lakers<br>
Doc Rivers going to Magic<br>
Knicks suck as soon as Jeff Van Gundy leaves and whatever stiff replaced him steps in.<br>
Maurice Cheeks replacing Mike Dunleavy as Blazers coach brings Blazers from poster boys of nonexistancy of chemistry to a feared dark horse in the NBA playoffs (this is before the Lakers swept them).<br>
<br>
As for baseball, you shouldn't be worried nearly so much that players are pumped on steroids as much as the fact that they're about to strike again. If the season is halted due to a labor dispute, I am burning all my Indians and Red Sox gear and never stepping foot inside an MLB affiliated stadium for a baseball game again in my life.<br>
<br>
To say that professional sports are now fixed proves a few things, mostly that you're a clueless fan who believes anything the collective media will try to drum up, knowing that clueless fans like will buy into it.<br>

aye, as an avid Vikings fan it's been a painful decline to watch. However, when you lose your entire starting offensive line to free agency and death (Steussie, Christy, McDaniel, Stringer, and someone else whose name eludes me- regardless, when together they were hands down the best O-line in football, and gave Randy Moss like 10 seconds to sprint downfield and Randall Cunningham enough time to do that ridiculously long windup and throw) in thee years. And, of course, the 15-1 year happened to have 2 more significant things-<br>
1) It was the year Gary Anderson missed no PATs or FGs until the one that actually mattered<br>
and<br>
2) It was Randy Moss's rookie year. The league as a whole just wasn't ready for him. The Packers drafted what, 4 defensive backs the next year? The NFC as a whole bulked up into the best division in terms of secondary JUST to stop the two headed monster (Moss and Carter).  <p><center><img src=http://www.bangalorenet.com/system1/sailo/images/2rips.jpg </center>

<br>
As far as Shaq, i cant agree more with DM. He is just a big guy that dislodges players (a fould btw) for about 80% of his points. Of course the refs only call enough to try and keep the other team from rioting on the court infront of a national audience, and they damn sure wont give him a 6th foul or they would be looking for a new job come morning.<br>

That's what's so great about Horry. He's a pretty damn average player 90% of the time, but he becomes an elite player when the Lakers need him to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
I watched Game 6, and the Lakers simply outhustled and outplayed the Kings. This coming from a Celtics fan, too. <p><center><img src=http://www.bangalorenet.com/system1/sailo/images/2rips.jpg </center>

  When its on an inbound pass, kobe is standing still, then turns and hits mike bibby in the face, KNOCKING HIM TO THE FLOOR AND MAKING HIS NOSE BLEED, WITH AN OFFICIAL STARING RIGHT AT THEM, its a little different.<br>
<br>
  I watched the replay, kobe decked him and the ref was staring right at them.<br>
 <br>
  Divac, Pollard, Webber etc have fouled out of games multiple times. I can't even remember the last time shaq fouled out of a game.<br>
<br>
  Im not saying the lakers arent talented, far from it. They are a great team with a good (if extremelly arrogant and hated) head coach who are a playoff quality team.<br>
<br>
  But anybody that says they had no help from the officials needs to watch the series, and game six in particular, again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=995.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=995.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=995.topic&start=61&stop=66>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=995.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=995.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=995.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=995.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=995.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=995.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
