I know that the USA technically is a republic.  However, in my opinion the word democracy has evolved to mean any governmental system &quot;determined by the people&quot; and not the original legal definition.  It's become slightly nebulous, but it juxtaposes to tyranny and monarcy quite well.  Second, I also know that democracy came from the Greeks as well as the concept of republic.  <br>
<br>
When I say that freedom and democracy are particularily American concepts, show me another government that has gone to war for ideas rather than direct profit or land in the history of the world.  That upon conquering rebuilds a nation of the people's rule.   That is a particularily American ideal.  How many people when asked to be &quot;crowned king&quot; as Washington was, would have declined if their primary motivation was to &quot;lord it over&quot; others.  The framers could have easily set themselves up as a monarchy, and they declined.  Many of them wrote about their concerns about slavery and upon death, many of them freed their slaves.  And not long after the country was embroiled in civil war over the concept of slavery.  But I'm betting that wasnt the &quot;real reason&quot;, and that we'll have to talk about the North's desire for economic conquest as the real reason, since people can't have moral motivation.<br>
<br>
And please drop the &quot;we wanted freedom for to have slavery&quot; bit.  There's enough historical evidence to show that is simply not the case.  Taxes levied were the primary reason.  The cry at the Boston Tea Party wasn't &quot;let us keep slaves&quot;, it was &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;.<br>
<br>
And I want to close with this.  I'm going to wager $100 Shebahn that you are a PhD, and a brilliant writer and wordsmith.  You're obviously extremely educated, but you seem to have &quot;decided and then justify&quot; no different than a backwater hick who hates blacks &quot;just because&quot;.  You show the same vehemency toward any republican or &quot;pro USA&quot; viewpoint.  This is not meant as an ad homonym, but rather a question.  Why do you really hate the USA so much? <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/rigadoon-gag.jpg"></img><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/rigadoon.jpg"></img></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukellianne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kellianne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/9/02 7:10:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bestanimations.com/Fantasy/Dragons/Dragon-03.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Switzerland rejects U.S. immunity from world court</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why do you really hate the USA so much?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I really gotta ask what wars you are talking about here that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the US government and their troops fought in, in this righteous cause? Vietnam?<br>

<br>
Now... once we've gone to the trouble of liberating a country etc... how much sense would it make to tell them, &quot;Ok, here's your nice new democratic system... but if some Communist demagogues decide that they want power, we're not going to stop them and the masses of people who they fool from seizing power.&quot;<br>
<br>
Call us hypocritical if you want - we've &quot;let&quot; dictators etc. overrun countries before, if you want to call it that.  Iran comes to mind.  Call us arrogant if you want - yeah, we're dictating to you what system you CAN'T have... one that not only screws you and your nation over, but poses a threat to the rest of the world as well.<br>
<br>
That is my problem with self-righteous European moaning about American arrogance.  You seem to be trapped in some kind of relativistic wonderland, where each and every theory deserves a careful, close look, and hey... it failed 20 times before, but if they want to try it, its their right to do so!  Well, no.  And *especially* not if its going to endanger us and our allies.<br>
<br>
In fact, I would make the argument that we shouldn't intervene in regime change etc. unless the result will likely affect us or our allies negatively... I dislike the &quot;policeman of the world&quot; idea.  But that isn't even what you're talking about.  You condemn us for trying to make the world safer not only for ourselves, but for you as well, out of an idealistic faith in the sanctity of self-determination.  <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

I see you also agree with me in that the US did it to serve their own interests. <br>
<br>
To take Vietnam as an example (please lets not get into a huge discussion about Vietnam, like we did with WW2 - its just an example) the US was afraid that communism would spread (the domino effect) and threaten the US. To the people in Vietnam, communism would have been an improvement to their former &quot;government&quot;. The people of Vietnam wanted communism, which is one of the main reasons USA lost the war. Vietnam became communist and so did Laos and Cambodia. Did they end up threatening the US? No. Go paranoia and waste of human life (yeah yeah hindsight). <br>
<br>
You can compare countries further back in development - than most of the western world - with young people. Grown ups can share their life experience with the young to try to prevent them from making the same mistakes they, or someone they knew, did. But the fact is that it doesn't work. Young people have to make their own mistakes and try to learn from them. It's a very important part of the process of growing up. Trying to force your experience and way of life on someone will only generate hate towards you, so even though you are right, by doing that you are not only ruining their development, you also ruin your relationship with them. So by being right - you are actually wrong.<br>
<br>
Though I may not agree with communism in praxis, I will fight to the death for everyone’s right to choose it freely. <br>
<br>
My point is, that you should not go an prevent people from choosing to be different than you, just because you don't agree with it, and think/know it's not the best for them. Who gave you the authority to do that? It will only turn and bite you in the tail. If a minority tries to force a hurtful ideology on the majority in their country, to serve their own greedy needs, then you may aid them if you wish.<br>
<br>
Also you have to try to understand that different cultures might not want the same things you do. Saying all men are equal and want the same (as us) isn't true, no matter how much you would like it to be. Some peoples like to be controlled and have a firm government. Some peoples are very proud and wont accept any help or intervention from the outside etc. etc. <br>
<br>
I hope this somewhat cleared up to you, why there is so much &quot;hate&quot; towards the foreign policies of the US, and why your job of &quot;protecting the world&quot; seems to thankless. Get off your high chairs and try harder to understand other cultures, ideas and ways of living - and try to be more open minded as to what &quot;The Right Way&quot; (TM) is.<br>

===================================================<br>
Silliness aside : this is kind of an empty statement. <br>
<br>
Is tyranny a firm government ? Depends on the tyrant. There have actually been a few &quot;enlightened&quot; ones whom the subjects have been grateful of. Unfortunately, since the system has &quot;no checks and balances&quot;, it is practically bound to fail when wielded by people with vested interests.<br>
<br>
Is dictature a firm government ? see above.<br>
<br>
Is democratic republic a firm government ? Depends on the people. Some cultures have a desire to regulate and legislate heavily, others less so. Even then, some aspects are more sensitive to some cultures than others. A perfect example is the differences in gun or drug polilcies implementations across the world. <br>
<br>
Note : i am leaving the capitalist / communist economical implementations alone, as technically, they are not responsible for government power structures per se. <br>
<br>
The real question boils down to : whose hands does eventually power concentrate into, and are those people acting for their own selfish interests, the interests of their supporting lobbies, the interests of the electorate they actually represent, or the &quot;betterment of mankind&quot;. Are we living in a true republic where the government acts fairly in the best interest of all ? In the case of constitutional republics : is the system of &quot;checks and balances&quot; working properly ? Personally, I can see a few serious issues. Others may find they have a good life and may be content with it. LUNCH TIME !<br>
