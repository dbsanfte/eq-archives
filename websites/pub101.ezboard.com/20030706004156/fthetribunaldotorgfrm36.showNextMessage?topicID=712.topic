Iraq Had Secret Labs, Officer Says<br>
Goal was to someday rebuild chemical and biological weapons, general alleges.<br>
By Bob Drogin<br>
Times Staff Writer<br>
<br>
June 8, 2003<br>
<br>
BAGHDAD -- Saddam Hussein's intelligence services set up a network of clandestine cells and small laboratories after 1996 with the goal of someday rebuilding illicit chemical and biological weapons, according to a former senior Iraqi intelligence officer.<br>
<br>
The officer, who held the rank of brigadier general, said each closely guarded weapons team had three or four scientists and other experts who were unknown to U.N. inspectors. He said they worked on computers and conducted crude experiments in bunkers and back rooms in safe houses around Baghdad.<br>
<br>
He insisted they did not produce any illegal arms and that none now exist in Iraq. But he said the teams met regularly and put plans on paper to quickly develop weapons of mass destruction if U.N. sanctions against Iraq were lifted.<br>
<br>
&quot;We could start again anytime,&quot; said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he fears for his life. &quot;It's very easy. Especially biological.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The point was, the Iraqis kept the knowledge,&quot; he explained during a lengthy interview Friday in which he offered tantalizing details of secret programs. But U.S. weapons hunters &quot;will never find anything here. Only oil.&quot;<br>
<br>
The failure to find any weapons of mass destruction since the war has sparked mounting criticism in both Washington and London, where senior government officials have been put on the defensive to explain why both public and classified intelligence estimates now appear to have been so inaccurate.<br>
<br>
The intelligence officer's account, parts of which could not be independently verified, gives ammunition to both sides of the controversy. He said that U.N. sanctions and inspections in the 1990s crippled Iraq's ability to build illegal weapons and that Hussein's chemical, biological and nuclear programs were effectively eliminated in the mid-1990s.<br>
<br>
But his description of an ongoing effort to prepare for illicit weapons production programs in the future suggests that Hussein would have remained a serious threat if U.S.-led forces had not ousted the dictator.<br>
<br>
His disclosure comes as newly reinforced U.S. weapons teams have intensified efforts to round up Iraqi scientists and officials. Three senior biowarfare experts were driven away in a van in Baghdad and have not returned home since a meeting June 1 with an American in civilian clothes who gave his name only as &quot;John,&quot; according to witnesses.<br>
<br>
They said &quot;John&quot; identified the three from a list titled &quot;Taha-7,&quot; which named top lieutenants to Dr. Rahib Rashid Taha. A British-trained microbiologist known as &quot;Dr. Germ,&quot; Taha directed production of vast quantities of anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and other lethal germ agents in the 1980s. She was taken into U.S. custody after the war.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi intelligence officer said that the secret weapons groups were created in late 1996 and 1997 because the regime's unconventional arms programs had been dismantled or destroyed by then and that U.N. inspectors knew most of those who had worked in them.<br>
<br>
&quot;They changed all the [weapons] people after that,&quot; he said. &quot;They not only changed the people. They changed the houses and buildings.... They kept the program alive.&quot;<br>
<br>
He said he had hidden some of the groups' papers to protect himself if arrested, including what he called &quot;red orders&quot; from Hussein and his aides authorizing the operation.<br>
<br>
He said he chiefly had served &quot;on the money side&quot; since the 1980s to help fund and direct a global maze of local trading companies that were secretly run by Iraqi intelligence operatives to supply the weapons programs.<br>
<br>
U.S. intelligence and U.N. inspectors have confirmed the use of such front companies, backed by shady arms dealers, crooked shipping agents and captains, and corrupt customs and other officials, to support Iraq's sanctions-busting procurement schemes.<br>
<br>
7 Overseas Trips<br>
<br>
The officer said he made seven overseas trips between the mid-1990s and 2001 to help oversee the illegal purchase and transport of spare parts, raw materials and other supplies for Iraq's conventional and unconventional weapons programs. He drew money from secret regime bank accounts in Egypt, Japan, Lebanon, Switzerland and other countries.<br>
<br>
On his last trip, in April 2001, he said he used phony passports from neighboring Arab nations to travel to Jordan, Cyprus, Morocco, South Africa and Argentina. He said he spent more than $57 million to illegally purchase and ship towed cannons, artillery fuses, calibrating instruments and so-called &quot;dual use&quot; medical laboratory equipment that could be used for chemical or biological weapons.<br>
<br>
It's possible that the officer's story contains falsehoods meant to deceive or confuse U.S. investigators. He refused to show the documents he said he had saved or to take a Los Angeles Times reporter to any of the safe houses where he said the weapons teams had operated.<br>
<br>
But unlike many of those who have provided false weapons tips to U.S. investigators in hopes of claiming a large reward, the officer appeared highly knowledgeable about the development, production and deployment of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and missiles in the past.<br>
<br>
The officer offered specific details about Iraq's complex weapons smuggling networks that dovetail with U.N. investigations. The U.N. teams also were aware of what one official called &quot;dirty tricks&quot; laboratories run by the Mukhabarat, the chief Iraqi intelligence and secret police service.<br>
<br>
In addition, the intelligence officer described his role getting phony documents and making payoffs to help NEC Engineering Private Ltd., an Indian trading company, smuggle banned material to Iraq between 1998 and 2001.<br>
<br>
U.S. and British intelligence later traced the chemicals and equipment to a former Iraqi poison gas factory and a missile fuel production plant. A Times report detailed the NEC scheme in January, and the officer's new details appeared to match missing pieces of the puzzle.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi officer said he had not been contacted by U.S. and British military and intelligence teams that are supposed to scour Iraq for any evidence of poison gases, germ agents for biological weapons, or nuclear programs. He indicated that he's hiding from the Americans, but it was unclear if they are looking for him.<br>
<br>
The U.S. special weapons teams have heard similar accounts of plans to rebuild illicit arms from other Iraqi weapons officials they have interviewed or taken into custody since the war. At least one intelligence report about the claims has been forwarded to the White House, U.S. officials said.<br>
<br>
The interview with the former senior Iraqi intelligence officer was arranged by a family member of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Majid, who was married to one of Hussein's daughters and who headed Iraq's secret weapons programs until he defected to Jordan in 1994. He was executed after he returned to Baghdad in 1995 under promises of safety.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi officer agreed to speak to two reporters because he said he wanted them to provide a satellite telephone that would not be tapped by U.S. intelligence so he could call Iraqi spies hiding overseas.<br>
<br>
He said he also wanted to see if he could gain access to $600,000 he said is in a Chase Manhattan Bank account. The reporters refused.<br>
<br>
The officer, who said he has a doctorate in aviation electronics from the University of Kiev, is a gruff, barrel-chested man with a harsh voice from chain-smoking French-made Gauloises cigarettes. Using a fake name and phony identification papers, he now supports his wife and six children as a university instructor.<br>
<br>
In the interview, he provided several striking new details about Iraq's covert weapons programs.<br>
<br>
He confirmed suspicions, for example, that Hussein's regime kept double sets of books on its weapons programs to fool U.N. weapons inspectors. &quot;There were a lot of numbers that were in the government that were not given to the U.N.,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Double Agents<br>
<br>
He said some of the Iraqi defectors who were debriefed by U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies were double agents sent by Department 44, a wing of Iraq's military intelligence, to provide false information.<br>
<br>
&quot;They let the Americans think they were anti-Saddam,&quot; he said. &quot;But they were still reporting back to Saddam.&quot;<br>
<br>
He also confirmed U.S. and U.N. charges that Iraq's chemical weapons experts succeeded in weaponizing VX, a highly toxic nerve agent. Hussein's regime insisted that the liquid VX it produced was unstable and quickly deteriorated, and thus could not be used as a weapon.<br>
<br>
He also shed new light on Iraq's recent attempts to obtain 60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes. The White House charged before the war that the scheme proved that Iraq was seeking to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. U.N. nuclear inspectors concluded that the tubes were for artillery rockets.<br>
<br>
The officer said the case was mostly about corruption. &quot;We did not need this many tubes&quot; for artillery, he said. &quot;Someone does this to steal the money.&quot;<br>
<br>
Asked why Iraqi officials had repeatedly lied and sought to hinder U.N. inspectors if the regime had no weapons to hide, he cited the climate of terror under the dictator.<br>
<br>
&quot;We cannot correct the numbers [previously given to the U.N.], because then we will look like liars,&quot; he said. &quot;And that will make Iraq look bad. And people will lose their heads.&quot;<br>
<br>
He said he met Hussein three times, is convinced he is still alive and remains loyal to him. But he acknowledged that the dictator had a weakness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saddam has a thick mind,&quot; he said. &quot;He does not know science. So he believes anything the scientists tell him.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1270<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/03 9:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WMD &amp; Regime</span><hr size=1> Assuming that this is right...<br>
<br>
The problem was Saddam's possession of WMD - yes.  But the problem was deeper than that.  It was with the regime, one which was determined to possess WMD no matter the cost.  So they kept the skeleton system alive, ready to start back up again as soon as the inspectors etc. left.  What were our options?  Maintain the sanctions and containment, inspect Iraq forever... or this.  Which takes us right back to the argument we had before the war.  Personally, I can't help but feel that Iraq is much better off now than if Saddam were still in power and the people of Iraq being killed and starved by him while Blix and Co. flitted around for the next 5 or 10 years, for the cycle to start again... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makino>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 400<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/03 11:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://roforums.dhs.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/Avatars/mage-female.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WMD &amp; Regime</span><hr size=1> Well, at least this is a different argument to the We did it to save the Iraqi people.<br>

That said, if these allegations do prove true, then the war was probably justified.  But "because these two guys said so" does not equal truth... where's the proof?

<br>
How do you figure? This guy said he was going to start it up <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>after</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the UN sanctions were lifted, which would have made it legal.<br>
<br>
This is like saying that a man who keeps a still in good shape so that he can start making shine the day prohibition is lifted is still a criminal. Once prohibition is lifted he can make all the shine he wants, so it is not a crime in any way, form, shape or manner. But what you are saying is that it is ok to confiscate his house and throw him in jail despite the fact he has made none.<br>
<br>
In any event, I think the picture is finally getting clearer and the facts seem to fit  the arguments some of us have made since the end of the war. It sure as hell makes alot more sense than these cock &amp; bull stories of taking hundreds of tons of WMD to the middle of the desert, digging a big hole and either destroying them or burying them on the eve of war.<br>
<br>
It may still turn out that that was indeed what happened, but I will be truly amazed if that is the case. It makes even less sense now than it did 7 weeks ago when they started floating these claims and it sure didn't make much sense then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3448<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/03 12:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WMD &amp; Regime</span><hr size=1> BTW - I am not ignoring the end result of doing the legal thing (not going to get into the moral side).

The thing is, based on his past use of them, I don't seem to see the threat of that like the rest of you do. I have not seen a mad man using VX at the drop of hat. The only time I am aware of him using it was the war against Iran, who also has them and used them.<br>
<br>
He didn't use them in Kuwait and he didn't use them (though he had them) when we drove him out. His history does not substantiate the claims of him being a loose cannon that the US made against him.<br>
<br>
I can think of alot worse problems we face than Saddam having WMD. Too bad we hadn't been concentrating on those as it appears we have now made our global position much weaker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3450<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/03 3:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WMD &amp; Regime</span><hr size=1> Wow, not much of a blatent change in stories here, huh?<br>

Now it's no longer &quot;we will find WMD&quot;, now it's &quot;we'll find a weapons program&quot;.

WASHINGTON (AFP) Jun 09, 2003<br>
US President George W. Bush promised Monday that &quot;history and time will prove&quot; that Iraq had unconventional arms programs and denied that US credibility is at stake in the search for such weapons.<br>
&quot;Iraq had a weapons program. Intelligence throughout the decade showed he had a weapons program. I am absolutely convinced, with time, we'll find out that they did have a weapons program,&quot; he told reporters.<br>
<br>
The Bush administration has come under heavy fire from opposition Democrats and other critics at home and abroad who charge that it exaggerated the threat Saddam posed in order to win public support for the campaign.<br>
<br>
US-led forces have yet to locate conclusive evidence backing the US leader's central case for war: that Saddam possessed chemical and biological weapons, pursued nuclear arms, and might one day have armed terrorists with them.<br>
<br>
&quot;History and time will prove that the United States made the absolute right decision in freeing the people of Iraq from the clutches of Saddam Hussein,&quot; the US leader told reporters after meeting with his cabinet.<br>
<br>
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Saddam's removal had created an environment in which Iraqis familiar with any weapons programs could now come forward, free of intimidation.<br>
<br>
&quot;For those who asked for patience before, they were never, ever going to find anything so long as Saddam Hussein was in power,&quot; he added in an apparent slap at supporters of continued UN inspections in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Asked whether US credibility was on the line over oft-repeated charges that Saddam possessed banned weapons, Bush bristled, saying that the United States had accomplished its central mission by toppling Saddam.<br>
<br>
&quot;The credibility of this country is based upon our strong desire to make the world more peaceful, and the world is now more peaceful after our decision; The strong desire to make sure free nations are more secure, and free nations are now more secure; and the strong desire to spread freedom and the Iraqi people are now free.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fleischer defended Bush's subtle shift from saying weapons will be found to saying that arms programs will be unearthed, saying the president believed both would be located.<br>
<br>
&quot;Programs in and of themselves give rise to tremendous concern. But it's the weapons, themselves, as well,&quot; said Fleischer. &quot;The exact condition of the weaponry remains to be seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bush, who repeatedly linked Iraq to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network in the run up to the war, did so again, saying a Baghdad-based cell of the organization that carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States had ordered the killing of a US aid worker in Jordan.<br>
<br>
His comments came in response to a New York Times report that two high-ranking al-Qaeda suspects currently in US custody have told CIA interrogators the terror network did not work with Saddam's regime.<br>
<br>
Fleischer called a pending congressional review of the case for war &quot;appropriate&quot; but downplayed the likelihood of unearthing any new information.<br>
<br>
&quot;Congress has always been part of this. Congress was provided information both in a declassified and a classified manner in the months and, indeed, the years leading up to the war,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Democratic candidates to unseat Bush in 2004, apparently sensing a weakness, have stepped up their attacks on the administration over allegedly overstating or manipulating the intelligence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if we should find weapons weapons of mass destruction, that won't disguise the fact that they misled the American people,&quot; Senator Bob Graham said Sunday, accusing the administration of soft-pedaling &quot;the level of uncertainty&quot; in intelligence reports.<br>
<br>
But recent opinion polls show a slim majority of Americans say the war was justified whether or not banned weapons are found.<br>

What &quot;blatant change in stories&quot;? Blatant story changes usually last for more than 5 minutes and a president's change in story is usually not blown out of the water on the same day by his main spokesman who puts out the official word of the White House. Reuters puts quotes around the word &quot;program&quot; in their headline and suddenly the very same people and 'media' that jumped on the Guardian &quot;swimming in oil&quot; story go crazy. There is indeed some great manipulation going on with the Iraq story and it doesn't involve Rumsfeld's Iraq intelligence.<br>
