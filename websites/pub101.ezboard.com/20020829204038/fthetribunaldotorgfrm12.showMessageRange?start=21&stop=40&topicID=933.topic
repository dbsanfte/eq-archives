You see, we've been neglecting VP for quite a while, and it really wasn't fair to our casters. So, the raid was semi scheduled, but was delayed 6 and half hours. It was supposed to be cancled, but given the casters' sentiments we decided to go after all. It wouldn't have mattered much if the whole zone was up, or any combination of the nameds. As long as something's up, the trip's worth it.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, we'll probably be heading to VP more frequently from now for our casters, if you ever find us leave Phara Dar or any of the nameds up, by all means kill them if you want.<br>
<br>
We kill whatever we can if our time allows, we don't view any FCFS zone mobs with a sense of ownership. <p><BR>Boinshar Harlishambar

<br>
First, our web admin was mistaken.  We had planned VP this weekend, but we found out that Revo was there Saturday.  Sunday, we go there to see if anything is up, and Phara Dar was...so we offed him.  Yes we only killed one dragon in VP.  But, we cleared what was up, so technically, we DID in fact clear it, even tho our web admin actually erred, because she was given insufficient information, and assumed that we did kill them all.  She's only human after all.<br>
<br>
Secondly, RNG was doing NToV before Feck ever joined us.  In case you're wondering, we started doing it at least 2 months ago, and Feck only recently joined us.  Everything we've killed in NToV was by *our* trying, and dying, to figure out.  Everything we've killed in NToV was by *our* persistence.  We didn't learn one thing from anyone except ourselves.<br>
<br>
How many times has Revo offed Aaryonar?  Zero? How many times has Revo offed Tormax?  Oh, zero again?  How about Cazic-Thule?  Another zero?  RNG has killed every single one of these multiple times.  We did it on our own.  Yes we have people in RNG who have been in EV, and other guilds.  So what.  I'm sure every guild has people that were in some other guild before.  EV has plenty of folks who were once in RNG...you don't hear us saying they stole our tactics, because it would be untrue to make that statement.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Revo was proud that they cleared as much of VP as they did.  However, you left one up, we had the zone planned, and we killed him.  If you wanted him, you'd have gone sooner, after all, it was 8:00 pm Sunday evening before we even started that raid.  It's not like we &quot;beat&quot; you there...you had all day.<br>
<br>
RNG has been doing Trak for a year, and we have over 50 people with keys.  Yes we don't do the zone often, mostly because we seem to lack the proper forces...but we have done it before, and we'll do it again.  This was NOT the first time we'd ever been to VP...We've been going there for several months.  It was the first time we've killed Phara Dar.  But we have killed other VP dragons before.  <br>
<br>
You guys are getting all bent out of shape cuz you feel we're making false claims...Ok, our website is in error, feel better now?  We killed one dragon in Veeshan's Peak.  Phara Dar.  But we killed him fair and square.  And we also fought to the zoneout, so none of the gimp 2 death to exit crap.<br>
<br>
I don't know what Revolution has against RNG, we've never intentionally done anything to you guys.  Yes we've had disputes over spawns...but so has everyone.  It happens.  But to come here and blatantly accuse us of lying...well that's just low.   <p> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59422  target="web"><b>Skeeja Skywolf</b></a> <BR>

But there's an implication you made about me that just isn't true, although from an outside point of view I can see where you could come to that conclusion.<br>
<br>
One of your officers - and an old friend of mine - said &quot;howdy&quot; (or similar) to me that morning and we talked about blacksmithing, fletching, and some other tradeskills and ranger stuff. I really didn't feel that I was 'pumping him for information' any more than I felt he was 'pumping me for information'.<br>
<br>
He apparently noticed some RNG in VP and sent me a tell that said somethign like, &quot;RNG doing VP?&quot;<br>
<br>
I said to him &quot;yup, if we don't get the interest for (luclin zone that I forgot) we'll probably hit VP&quot;<br>
<br>
He said &quot;Dang.&quot; or something like that and then said Revo had a cleric camped out in there.<br>
<br>
I took that to mean that the cleric needed out and said I or someone else would send him a tell when it was safe to log the cleric in for purposes of retrieving them safely.<br>
<br>
That was about it.<br>
<br>
So now you know firsthand how the information traded hands.<br>

<br>
  All of this started from one little typo or the addition of one or two little words, so the RNG gets blasted as not being honest ......hmmmmm OK .....Blame me as I dont give a flying fuck what anyone thinks of me and we all know I cant spell or even talk correctly &lt; beer and EQ dont mix well&gt;<br>
<br>
  As to stealing others tactics, or takeing someone from another guild who has all those tactics .....give me a fucking break, Everyone uses everyone elses tactics, be it an idea off someone elses website or even talking shit with friends in another guild. Dont even say you never used someone else's tactics, as Then you would be lieing, or even useing someone elses idea. <br>
<br>
   Now I can understand if our website said &quot; REVO SUCKS AND WE HAD TO GO CLEAN UP AFTER THEM &quot;  hell i would be pissed too, but it didnt say that,  so just sit back ....smoke a bowl ..... drink a beer .... visit a porn site .... do whatever you have to do to relax. and get off our asses !! <br>

As far as I know..  Revo has nothing against RNG.. <br>
<br>
<br>
But you can bet im gonna come here and give you shit.. when somebody tells me..   go to the RNG board.. they are claiming they CLEARED Veeshan's Peak.. <br>
<br>
I went to your board..  there it was.. plain as day.. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Guards cleaned out Veeshan's Peak and Phara Dar met his maker&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I found this HILARIOUS..  so I came here to give you shit about it..    If your boy hadn't come here pounding his chest about being a big bad NTOV guild.  I wouldn't have even mentioned the fact that your first successful NTOV run came after Feck joined you..   That was just some icing I threw on top of the cake after reading what a badass NTOV guild you guys are.. <br>
<br>
You have actually said exactly what I expected the first reply to be..   OOPS..  we screwed up.. our webmaster is clueless... or whatever the case is...   But of course THAT statement came after a few chest pounding NTOV comments...  <br>
<br>
Even in  your post you try and misrepresent things again..  it IS kinda funny..   You guys havent even killed all the dragons in VP once yet..  Yet here you are just like the previous posters.. claiming that you HAVE done VP..  What do you have..  A couple SW kills..  ONE Hoshkar kill... and ONE Nexona kill..   and now ONE Phara Dar.. <br>
<br>
guess what..   It doesn't really matter.. You have what.. 10 Manaburn wizzies.. or more..    I hope to hell you guys can clear VP with that.. We did all but Phara dar without even casting one MB..  hell, we only have two MB wizzies in the whole damn guild,  period..  But if you dont see how hilarious it is..  That you guys put up your-<br>
<br>
&quot;The Guards cleaned out Veeshan's Peak and Phara Dar met his maker&quot;<br>
<br>
-headline on your web page..  then you take yourselves way to seriously.. <br>
<br>
 Step back and look at it from a distance..   Its pretty damn funny..   and yep..   bet your ass Im gonna call you on it..  If I posted that Revo killed the Sleeper.  and you knew i didn't.. you would call me on that too..  <br>

<br>
Get over yourself with that headline...how many times do I have to say this to make myself clear...<br>
<br>
&lt;b&gt; Our web admin doesn't play alot, and gets info second or third hand.  When she asked how did VP go, and we said we killed Phara Dar and fought to the zoneout, she naturally made the (incorrect) assumption we killed it all. &lt;/b&gt;<br>
<br>
Why is does this stick in your craw so much, we goofed a bit on our website?  Is it because perhaps, just perhaps, you're jealous of RNG?  No, that couldn't be it could it?<br>
<br>
RNG has been doing ST dragons since before Luclin.  RNG has been Doing VP since late December.  RNG has been doing WToV since Early January.  RNG has been doing NToV since late February, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with Feck joining us.  In fact, his trial raid (which I won't go into our recruiting process here) was in NToV, where we were about to kill Lady Nev, and he was cohed in...Ask him if you don't believe me.<br>
<br>
You don't know shit about RNG and our ways.  We &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; an honorable guild...perhaps that's why you're so jealous...I dunno, but we have honor, and we can admit we erred, as many have come to this post and done.  But we don't go to another guild's website, or here, and flame them.  Unless we're flamed first here, you'll never see any flames here by us. <p> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59422  target="web"><b>Skeeja Skywolf</b></a> <BR>

We've left Vyemm up, because he's almost impossible to kill.  Even EV/Comps have troubles with him, and he's been left up by them several times.  But we've killed every other dragon there every time we've done NToV.  Except the fubared RoF Vulak.  And once we left Lady Nev up, was going to do her the next day, but server crash prematurely ended our turn.<br>
<br>
I still don't know where you are getting your information about us never clearing NToV until Feck joined us...you know, Feck was in RNG a long time ago, and has rejoined us.  Yes he was in EV so what?  He is not the reason we can do NToV...he wasn't even in RNG when we killed Aaryonar, and EARNED our right to rotate with EV and Companions.  And as anyone will tell you, Aary is the hardest dragon in NTov except Vyemm and Vulak.<br>

<br>
What strats does Feck give RNG for mobs that they have already killed?? I'm curious as to how you made such and false conclusion to this. Besides all that, where do you get your strats? Its not like you created the CH cycle. (not that I'm saying RNG did) They just figured out a great system that worked for them. <br>
<br>
[quote.. it IS kinda funny.. You guys havent even killed all the dragons in VP once yet.. Yet here you are just like the previous posters.. claiming that you HAVE done VP.. What do you have.. A couple SW kills.. ONE Hoshkar kill... and ONE Nexona kill.. and now ONE Phara Dar..[/quote]<br>
<br>
How about the fact that this zone isnt that much of an upgrade for RNG so they ignored the zone for a long period. And how about the wierd fact that everytime we killed a dragon there were only a few up. We focus on more important mobs. Which is why we are a NToV guild.<br>
<br>
Next time you could be more civil about it. Instead of trying to flame a guild for something as pety as this, A small miscommunication error. <br>
<br>
Oh and what the fuck would you know about honor. <p><center><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6407">

I think this pretty much covers it all.<br>
<br>
As far as I remember RNG and Revo never crossed paths before, until your oversensitive representative there decided to blow a fuse without the common courtesy to give someone the benefit of a doubt on a typo.<br>
<br>
As for me mentioning NToV, it was just to put things into persective for you. If someone can solo Yeldema, you don't need to think too hard to figure out the same person can kill a dar knight in seb rather easily. That's about the difference between Aary, CT or even the new Sont compared to VP dragons. It was used to give you an idea of how misguided your belief was, a mere statement of fact.<br>
<br>
This whole thing started because Xav decided to skip his vallium pills and get all bent out of shape because he felt a simple &quot;I think you guys made a mistake on your webpage&quot; did not suffice to express his anger, angst, or whatever it was he felt and instead decided to post generic flames on our board and this one. Good god, at least be somewhat original, the whole &quot;you stole other people's strategies yadda yadda yadda&quot; doesn't require much imagination.<br>
<br>
The entire issue's based on Xav's assumption that RNG would  deliberately flaunt a false victory over a zone openned over two years ago, which is more than likely stemmed from the fact that Xav takes pride from being able to kill everything except Phara Dar in VP. You can take pride in killing stuff in VP all you want, it's your right but it's got nothing to do with us, your accomplishments are for you and is quite meaningless to everyone else. Do not assume we care about your accomplishments enough to downplay them.<br>
<br>
Enough of this chest thumping crap. The whole thing would have been easily solved with a civil response, but of course that was too much to ask. Common courtasy? Ha. <p><BR>Boinshar Harlishambar

I happen to be pretty busy and worked all weekend, as well as having a kid to take care of, so when I logged late on Sunday night I understood from Guild Chat that the Guards had done VP, and posted that. <br>
<br>
For you to make any kind of deal out of it simply shows how insecure and sad your life must be.

True..only a few weeks ago that you decided to send your monk in and fuck up our Sont pull.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moral of the story is if you chose to &quot;clear&quot; VP that way, have some frigging courtesy and waste your weekend doing it..not ours. <p><b><font color="green"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79222"/a>Kylemall Inthensom</b><br>
