--<br>
<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:13:21 2001] You told mastikor, 'are you still selling a stack of blue diamonds?'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:13:43 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'not any more... i was.. but i dont get good enough deals, im selling them seperately now'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:14:06 2001] You told Mastikor, 'how much? and btw how did you manage to build a stack of them? wow'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:14:19 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'lol my friend did =) '<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:14:32 2001] You told Mastikor, 'what dropped so many bd's?'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:14:54 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'nothing, he just camped them a lot'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:15:37 2001] You told Mastikor, 'but they only drop in high level groups and on raids, pretty unusual to find them solo'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:16:04 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'in ocean of tears..'<br>

[Sat Jun 16 17:18:20 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'u just curious how i got them or u want to buy some&gt;'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:19:15 2001] You told mastikor, 'i'm curious how you got them because i think you ripped off your guild... blue diamonds are so rare on the dino in OOT that you would have to camp it ever since bd's came out'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:19:28 2001] You told mastikor, 'either that or you don't have the bd's you claimed to have'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:19:39 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'whoa'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:19:42 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'jesus chris'<br>

[Sat Jun 16 17:20:10 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'this is retarded forget it'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:20:12 2001] You told Mastikor, 'my other character is in one of the uberguilds on this server and i know how rare blue diamonds are'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:20:31 2001] You told Mastikor, 'the majority of them drop on raids'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:20:51 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'aight bro, im just saying i dont understand this'<br>

[Sat Jun 16 17:21:07 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'and instead of getting offers i get people screaming at me'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:21:09 2001] You told Mastikor, 'you auctioned a full stack, which is what's so wierd'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:22:05 2001] You told Mastikor, 'nobody auctions full stacks of blue diamonds'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:22:14 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'i know that'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:22:23 2001] You told Mastikor, 'then are you lying?'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:22:46 2001] Mastikor tells you, 'no dude im not rich at all, my friend asked me to auction them for him, they are his, so i dunno what this is about'<br>
[Sat Jun 16 17:23:31 2001] You told Mastikor, 'lol ok... who's your friend?'<br>

few tells exchanged, I can see he's confused<br>
so I ask him &quot;are you seriously selling them?&quot;<br>
wait a bit and ask again<br>
2 hours later I ask again and first he tells me he doesnt want to sell them anymore, then asks for 80k (asked 65k before) and then says &quot;nah I'll sell them individually for 4k each&quot;<br>
after that I told him to go fuck himself<br>
god I hate jerks like him, gets me all excited with his auction then makes some gay stuff up and keeps changing his mind<br>

<br>
But that's what i mean... your guild saved them up for your guild jeweller on raids, and if somebody went and sold them you'd be rather pissed off.<br>
<br>
Maybe Equilibrium doesn't like resist gear, I dunno. Maybe the &quot;friend&quot; hoarded this stack of blue diamonds prior to the jewellery upgrade like Rynnia's friend and oops, he forgot to sell them until June 2001.<br>
<br>
Maybe this &quot;friend&quot; is an auction-o-phobe who hides in his anti-auction shelter every time someone mentions possibly buying a blue diamond from him, so he says &quot;plz Mastik0r u sell 4 me!!!1!&quot;.<br>

Mentioned to me that the gems would be returned, yet they never were.  He said it &quot;wasn't him playing Zevokaii&quot; that day in fear.  Mentioned that it was his frat brothers trying to ruin his reputation and that he returned from vacation to find this had gone on and people were sending him angry tells blah blah blah....  said he had found the light and was quitting EQ to do the important things in life like contribute to his fraternity and concentrate on school and such.  Threw a guilt trip on many people for doubting him....<br>
<br>
He currently has a 55 and 60?  cleric on another server.  Dunno what other characters.<br>
<br>
Basically he lost it one day, acted like an asshole, lied to get out of it, and when that didn't work, fucked over friends of his, laid guilt trips on them, lied to them, and ran away.<br>
<br>
He was at the first Test of Tactics on the test server with his 60 cleric in all the best gear and such.  I've been told that since then he's sold his character and seen the light, and is now spending time with his fraternity, family, friends, and school.<br>
<br>
Yeah, right.<br>
<br>
Far as that guy selling blue diamonds, it sounds like a &quot;ok give me the money and I'll log on my other character&quot; type of thing to me.  People fall for that shit every day.  Makes me wonder if they'd fall for &quot;lemme hold yer nuts, I won't squeeze too hard&quot;   People are too easily conned in this world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/01 4:21:28 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A stack of blue diamonds</span><hr size=1> Mastikor isn't too bright, had a run-in with him at the Seb King and he quickly made #1 on my &quot;avoid at all costs&quot; list. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

He sounds like a scared and confused 11 yr old. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uselby.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Selby</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/24/01 4:42:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A stack of blue diamonds</span><hr size=1> hehehe, thanks for the info in game guys... Yes, I am aware of him selling those diamonds. No, they aren't from our guild raids. Any gems we get immediately come into my possession, so no worries there.<br>
As for where his friend got the stacks of blue diamonds, they seem fairly common if you raid Skyshrine or even the Swarmling mother (I think that's what she's called) drops them fairly often and is an easy kill. Then again, maybe his friend ganked em from his guild.<br>
Sounds like Mastikor was doing his friend a favor and got a bit huffy over the whole deal. He dealt with it with panic from all the questions and yes, he's on the young side. If he insulted anyone, I apologize for him.<br>
Now, I am just a bit curious of who this friend was that he was selling these for personally...<br>
On the brighter note, I'd like to thank everyone for their concern regarding this matter. I received many tells giving me a heads up in case they were guild's. Thanks again for the watchful eye!<br>

<br>
Even though he whole-heartedly denies this, and thinks the level 48 ranger should have harmonied/tagged better in Plane of Hate... Mastikor was FD pulling and pulled the entire throne room on our raid party, which had just overcome 2 or 3 CR's...<br>
<br>
I've made it a personal note to ask if he's attending any raids that I get tells to come to... if so, there's a 95% chance I won't go just because he is there.<br>
<br>
I think the Hate raid was doubly cursed because both Mastikor and Loveseeker were there.<br>
<br>
[Wed Jun 20 02:51:22 2001] Loveseeker says, 'if i dont get one part of purple armor this trip i will cry'<br>
[Wed Jun 20 02:51:32 2001] You say, 'We're leaving loveseekr'<br>
[Wed Jun 20 02:51:37 2001] You say, 'So start crying'<br>
[Wed Jun 20 02:51:46 2001] Loveseeker begins to sniff;e.<br>
<br>
I don't mind people stating their hopes of getting loot, you can hope all you want... but when you start to bicker and whine about NOT getting loot, you're just being lame.<br>
<br>
Sure, I want to dress like barney, but I don't cry if I don't get anything.<br>

You can quest for BD's in Velious I believe.  I've seen some Companions pull a few out from the bank, &quot;farmed&quot; by their various twinks/alts.  If you play enough it's all very possible.<br>
