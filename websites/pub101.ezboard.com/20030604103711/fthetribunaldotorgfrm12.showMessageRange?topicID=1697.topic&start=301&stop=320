He throws dogs into a woodchipper every once in a while.  He beats his children.  A few years ago, he set a neighbor's house on fire.  A couple months previously, he set fire to a number of his dogs.  The judge ruled that he can no longer own a charoal grill, but you still see smoke.  People who have been in his house, tell you they have not seen a grill, but they have seen trackmarks on the floor that could be a grill, and smoke on the ceilings.  You talk to his children, and they don't say anything.  Last year, there was a terrible smell coming from his backyard, where he had buried ten or fifteen dogs.  Every so often you smell what seems to be a cookout coming from his house.  You get the police to come to look, but he won't let them into the attic.  Then, after the courts tell him, he lets them go look in the attic.  They find more dead dogs, but no grill.  They find reciepts for 15 grills, but cannot find the grills themselves. He tells you he has gotten rid of them.  He has a large backyard, though, and you can't really tell everything that's out there.<br>
<br>
Now, this man may or may not have a grill.  But shouldn't the way he treats his dogs get his ass thrown in jail?<br>

Since when? I have posted plenty of times that I liked Reagan and respected Bush Sr. I may have disagreed with them on some policy issues, but I never found them to be dangerous to the US (though Reagan did push the envelope at times when it came to the USSR). I have also posted that Carter was the worst president (next to this one) of my generation and he just happens to be a democrat.<br>
<br>
It's not about republican or democrat, it's about the far right and the far left. I would feel no safer with a far left president than I do with this far right one. Both are dangerous to our national security and bad for the economy. Give me a moderate with common sense and I am a happy camper, whether it be a republican or democrat. <br>
<br>
The point was that you slammed on France, Germany and Russia for basing policy on oil deals, but the US throws out it's morals for oil as well, so it's like the kettle calling the pot black.<br>

On the contrary. Since oil is so vital to the national interest in addition to security, the government is doing exactly what its supposed to. Protecting the citizens from threats both foreign and domestic and keeping the US economy prosperous by ensuring, in this case, the access to oil. That's without doubt why we protect Saudi Arabia. It sure as hell isn't their fashion industry we're worried about. It's almost funny because I'm reminded of that movie with Jack... the quote is something like... You sleep soundly under the blanket of freedom I provide then question the manner in which I provide it. Once again I'm dying to know. <br>
<br>
What have you personally done to improve the country, protect its interests, or change it for the better? Opinions are like assholes... everybody has one. Who is the more morally corrupt though? The person who has an opinion and does something with it, or the guy that coasts through life enjoying every freedom and luxury provided by his country, bitching and whining on some insignificant board about foreign policy, then returning to his cushy life too lazy to act on his so called moral convictions. You see folks giving back to your country requires a selflessness that most people don't have the courage to do. It doesn't mean you have to join the military and fight for anything, but it does require you to get off your ass, which if you're reading this, is exactly where you are right now. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587400">Kinvaras</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/28/03 11:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=304>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok you bastards</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The point was that you slammed on France, Germany and Russia for basing policy on oil deals, but the US throws out it's morals for oil as well, so it's like the kettle calling the pot black.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Bad point then.  They made deals with that slimy fuck when they knew he was killing his people by the score, and letting them starve due to sanctions he refused to comply with.

Hahahaha<br>
<br>
Sometimes you are so clueless it's funny. Who do you think gave him the weapons to gas the Kurds and Iranians? Who turned a blind eye to it while it was happening?<br>
<br>
17 of the 19 terrorists of 9/11 were Saudi Arabians. What exactly have we done about it? And need I point out the numerous times Saudis have been caught funding terrorism, unlike Iraq where there is no proof at all? You do realize that the Saudi schoo, system teaches hate rhetoric towards America from a very young age, right?<br>
<br>
And do we even need a history lesson on the atrocities that happened within Kuwait before (and after) we went to war to liberated them? What, are their nice dictators and bad dictators now?<br>
<br>
So what exactly is the difference? I didn't see any of these countries getting hit by 17 Saudis in a terrorist attack and then going back to business as usual with their government.<br>
<br>
You are such hypocrit. Everything the US does is justified in your eyes, but when France or some other country does the same or less, you cry out in righteous indignation.<br>

There's a big difference between not liking the decisions and not liking the system which allows for bad decisions to be made. I have no problems with the structure of the government, just some of the finer details of it.

Are you seriously telling me that you learned nothing in the required high school class of Government? Take a lesson from those who fought the system in the 60s, within the law of course. Those people brought to light and helped bring about legislation that made racism and sexism illegal and not just a dirty word. If I had all the answers I'd be God. I don't have all the answers, but I certainly have more than you do apparently. I sure as hell have already stood up for my own convictions and given of myself to support my country. I just chose to be a fighter because that's who I am. Don't ask me what you should be doing. Ask yourself, do some research, ie. like I said, get off your ass. Otherwise you're just another opinionated nobody without any personal investment or life experience to back you up. Anyone who doesn't have the motivation to actually do something lacks credibility. If you're asking me what you should do then I can only guess you've done nothing. If you're eligible to vote then I'd start there. It amazes me how many people don't bother to exercise their vote but love to whine. I don't have any figures, but I remember reading somewhere that a staggering number of people who are eligible aren't even registered, and of those registered, a great deal of them don't even bother. If people want to point fingers, they need to start with themselves, but ... and here's some more morality for you ... the citizens of this country are largely a bunch of wusses who don't have the courage to take responsibility for either their action or inaction. People like you, the inactive masses that don't have a clue about what they can do to change the government or the selflessness to do something positive for the country, are where the blame ultimately lays.<br>
<br>
I'm with Jas on becoming an expatriot. Not because I don't love my country, but because too many of the citizens living here have corrupted it with their selfish attitude of &quot;what's in it for me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Most countries have mandatory programs of government service. I've always been a big fan of implementing a similar program in the US. For instance in Italy, men and women serve two years in either military, police, or bureucratic jobs. I knew a girl who finished a psych degree and spent her two years doing family counseling at a state run facility in Sienna. <br>
<br>
It's so easy to live in a place where you can be a career couch potato expousing your grand ideals between Bastion of Thunder named spawns isn't it. If you really care about your ideas then let's see some action. If you don't then why bother even participating in the discussion since your opinion means jack without credibilty. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587400">Kinvaras</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/29/03 4:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=311>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok you bastards</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Sometimes you are so clueless it's funny.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The war appeared to be entering a new phase in which the superpowers were becoming more involved. For instance, the Soviet Union, which had ended military supplies to both Iran and Iraq in 1980, resumed large-scale arms shipments to Iraq in 1982 after Iran banned the Tudeh and tried and executed most of its leaders. Subsequently, despite its professed neutrality, the Soviet Union became the major supplier of sophisticated arms to Iraq. In 1985 the United States began clandestine direct and indirect negotiations with Iranian officials that resulted in several arms shipments to Iran.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The way you and all your sickening ilk make it sound, the Iraqis are running around with every gun they own stamped &quot;Made in the USA&quot;  Read that article, and many like it, maggoty one.  The Superpowers at the time BOTH supplied arms to each side, with the SOVIETS supplying the lion's share.  Even if it was skewed the other way by any other article you wrote, stop acting like we were the lone bad guy out there.  It's just one more easily uncovered lie.<br>
<br>
Before you go off and post up ten dozen articles with every cent accounted for (as if), realize this please.  I don't give a flying fuck.  You paint us as if we're the sole arms dealer in the middle east, and guess what?  It isn't fucking true you moron.  You of COURSE won't admit that, you just want to single out the US, don't you Tapeworm?<br>
<br>

&quot;We&quot; don't need a &quot;history&quot; lesson from you.  It would read something like.<br>
<br>
Today, according to a top secret intelligence source who asked to remain anonymous, the US did some monstrous things that rival Adolph Hitler on a scale of pure wrongness, and while that source shall remain nameless, let me assure you all this is true.<br>
<br>
I didn't SAY there were good and bad dictators you lifeless joke.  What I SAID was that Saddam WAS a monster, and that him being tossed out of power was a good thing.  You almost make it sound like you WANT the US to be a police force for the world.<br>
<br>
As to the nationality of the terrorists, I never in any single post here said I agree with going to war with Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, or any other nation because terrorists came from there.  My views aren't as black and white on the issue as you'd like to imagine, and so you're making a rather stupid assumption that I care about the terrorists being Saudis.  Everything the US does is NOT justified in my eyes, but every thing the US does is singled out by you, and held up as an example of Evil, as if the US invented selling Arms to other countries.<br>

Hell yes there IS a big difference.  While I may be lumped on one side of everything by inference of the Tapeworms, I'm NOT a fan of government involvement in private lives.  I think a lot could be done to overhaul the government, especially at a local level.<br>

Actually, I fear that the government's agenda at a state level is too integrally tied to that of the Christian church to be able to change without more work that I am willing to dedicate to a country I eventually plan on moving out of anyways. I believe there are too many voting Christians who don't understand the difference between religious law and societal law, and who impose or support laws which enforce their views of morality. It's a little hard to fight mass ignorance and wanton disregard for the separation of church and state. Things are only really changing when enough of a concentration of people who don't believe in the same exist and vote appropriately.<br>
<br>
I was born here. As far as things go, the country has a lot going for it. But I have both Irish and Scottish ancestry, and find myself wanting to be more a part of THAT culture than THIS culture. Countries are like families-- you don't get to chose the one you were born to. Unlike families, though, you do get to choose which one you get to live with for the rest of your life.<br>
<br>
If I don't go to Ireland/Scotland, Nova Scotia would probably be the next best place, given what I've heard of the Celtic culture there.<br>
<br>
I still think Bush is one of the US's most classic mistakes in history. I think we have seen that Iraq was not the threat that it was portrayed to be which gave us our pretext to ignore the UN. I think it was an unfounded war driven by Bush wanting to appear to be the military leader Bush Sr. was, and hoping for the same level of political sucess. I think time will prove that Saddam did not have the WMD's that we claimed he did-- though I am willing to give them more time to look. Having no results thus far indicates to me that we won't find them-- but time will tell, not my opinion.<br>
<br>
I think when this is all over we will simply look stupid. In fact, I think we already do. I think that we chose to do this for our own reasons, and everything else is just a pretext. After all, if the UN rulings were really what made us tick, I'm sure we would have already invaded Israel and forced them to comply with the UN rulings they've flouted for so long. Woops, they're our allies, let's look the other way and continue efforts of diplomacy.<br>
<br>
I think that most of my opinions have already been stated more eloquently than I can do so (and not here, for the most part). I have a lot of respect for this speech, and the points it brings up:<br>

Though I don't think such a well-spoken post should be placed here, and I don't agree with much of what you said, you did NOT do what Sashanna did to start this post, nor what some other's did to fan the flames.  You stated an opinion, you said you don't agree but also said you'd take the action of leaving because of your convictions.<br>

I can and do respect that.  I won't sit and bicker the little points, and do agree with a lot of what you've said.  There is even more I don't agree with, but I'll simply agree to disagree with you.  I still feel that anyone who DOES sit and bitch and yet does nothing to help the situation, and continues to draw prosperity from this country a Tapeworm, and I always will.  They are by definition parasites, and simply take advantage of their Freedoms to breed hate and paranoia.  IF there was something better in their eyes as a country, they'd be there already.<br>

I'm not sure that would do it. Remember that plastics, lubricants and many, many chemicals require petroleum as well. Then there are aircraft which I doubt could use any other fuel. Large ships could all be converted I suppose, but the cost would be phenomenal.<br>
<br>
Just think about plastic alone... it permeates just about every aspect of our lives. But then, I have no idea what the percentages are, so maybe we could produce enough petroleum domestically to meet our needs if we eliminated gasoline powered cars.<br>
<br>
As to SUVs... come up with another vehicle that has enough traction and is heavy enough to get through the snow during Maine winters (sometimes it snows fast enough that there is 6 inches on the primary roads before the plow finishes their run and cycles back again) and I'll be happy to try it. I'll agree they are wasteful when used in the summer on normal roads, but in the winter they are a necessity in the northern part of the country. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kandilia>Kandilia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/29/03 8:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=318>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok you bastards</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They are by definition parasites, and simply take advantage of their Freedoms to breed hate and paranoia.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
