He said he ported in there at every level.. and he couldn't kill the wanderer till he was level 35.  So that means he died at least once per level from 24 - 35.  Post comprehension is good actually.. you should try it too.<br>

The desperate cry of the loser who cannot get loot, so he convinces himself that having loot = being bad. It just echos my run down of your guild and how fucking joyous you guys are to be in last place in any competition. Some of the best people in the game run with EV, but since they have loot according to your guild's mantra, success equals being bad, failing equals enjoyment. Keep believing you are nice because you havent been corrupted by loot or the end game like all the evil ubers. Seriously, make a promise you will never be like us, I dont need anyone as stupid as you trying to argue for a chance on the AoW a year from now. Stay in the zones like VP. PLEASE, I implore you. Stay in your hole. <p><center>

Not really funny, just a bunch of hot air blowing from the organizational culture of arrogance that E/V fosters.  Of course, it wouldn't even be there if it weren't for people like DM encouraging it...<br>
<br>
If there really are thin-skinned members of E/V, maybe they ought to try and convince the rest of you not to act like such jackasses.  That might help more than you ripping on someone like Rifkind to &quot;make a point&quot;.<br>
<br>
Nowhere in any of the posts flaming E/V have any members of Revolution come across as being personally insulting to the degree that you are.  Trying to pass this off as being some kind of retribution for our persecution of you and your guild is ridiculous.  You count up the posts by members of Revolution on the Flameboard over the last four months... you would be lucky to have more than 200.  Only a few have targeted E/V outright, and those few that did were directed NOT at specific members, but at the GUILD as a whole, and your actions (or lack thereof).  Your whole &quot;poke the sleeping bear (or dragon), get smacked&quot; analogy smacks of so much bombastic arrogance that it is indeed humorous, just not in the way you intended.<br>
<br>
My final point - I thought this board was about EQ.  Isn't that why we have a separate forum for RL issues?  Flame Xav all you want, or me, I don't care.  What I'm wondering, however, is why you feel the need to suddenly start picking on the RL relationship between Xaviera and Rifkind, and insulting both of the people behind the characters in a manner which you cannot possibly even have an inkling about the truth of... when Xav is flaming YOU for you and your guild's actions in EQ.  Stay on topic, DM.  Quit your amazingly pointless tirades, and get to the point.  All you're doing is making am amazing ass of yourself, as anyone who really knows Xav and Riffy can tell you easily. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

Yes, let's turn this into a dscussion about us, then slam on Tarnn a couple times, take some pot shots at our nameless mana robe thief (Hey, not naming any names! not getting personal!), then cry like babies when you get burned.<br>
<br>
If the truth is your glorious guildleaders have a perfect relationship and are the model Ken and Barbie figures, then anything DM says shouldn't sting in the least. You're the ones taking this personal. Either flame him back because he is wrong and have fun with it, or take it all personal and go away crying. Another good solution would be to not turn every thread into your personal soapbox against EV. I have yet to see an attack against your little guild by EV that wasn't started by Xaveira.<br>
<br>
I think I know now why Revo doesn't post here. It's not because they're convinced we're all retarded like Xaveira wants us to believe, it's because their fragile egos can't handle a bad word spoken against them. Might want to muzzle your guildleader until your skin grows a bit thicker. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Kittenslayer</a><BR>

After all the trailer is clean, the baby is napping and I decided to take DM's advice and take my shower for the year.  I forgot how hard it is to clean out all those folds of skin.  Geez.<br>
<br>
Was I crying as I wrote my last post ?  No.  But, I was rather shocked at the hatred radiating from your reply for me personally.  That part I just dont get.  All because I wear the Revolution tag ?  That would be like me hating E/V because I hate that person(s) in your guild.  Oh wait.  I dont hate anyone in your guild.  Hatred is a wasted emotion.  But, it seems that that particular emotion is what rules you here.  I hope that the way you act here is not how you act in your real life, for that would be extremely sad.<br>
<br>
You keep mentioning these shards that we, as a guild, are keeping you from.  You caught me, damn.  Our daily MOTD reads, &quot;Camp shards.  It pisses E/V off !!&quot;  Give me a break DM.  Since when does anything we do keep you from doing the things that your guild does.  Never I think is the correct answer there.  <br>
<br>
As for Ganndor, you have never heard me say one bad word about him.  And you never will.  He was one of my best friends in game for almost 2 years and I miss him dearly.  And no, I dont mean I miss him being in Revo, just a general missing him.  <br>
<br>
And Tarnn...  dear Tarnn.  He hates Xav for personal reasons and he hates me for not stopping the disbanding of Dies Irae.  /shrug.  Nothing I can do there.<br>
<br>
Attack Revo all you want.  We aren't going anywhere.  You are correct when you say its a two way street.  But, dont try and act all innocent for you and your guild do their fair share of attacking us.  Lord only knows when, where and why it first started, but it was long before the Ganndor incident.<br>
<br>
And if it makes you feel good to attack me the way you have been, then so be it.  I am secure enough in who I am for you not to bother me any longer.  (Your skin has become thicker! (200) )<br>
<br>
Well, the baby is awake and it takes me atleast 5 minutes to squeeze my way thru the door to get to him, so I better get moving.  /grin<br>
<br>
So, how am I doing so far FB regulars ?  I know, I know...  No cuss words.  I will try to fit a few in on my next post.  See you soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
Again the lion's share of your flames were about loot..  Seems like thats all you EV people have to fall back on.  I bring up principles . you reply about loot..  I bring up standards for guild admission.. you reply about loot..  I bring up friendship and loyalty.. you reply about loot.. <br>
<br>
About the only thing you have flamed about.. aside from loot..  Is the fact that my wife is too nice and worries too much about how other people feel..  You keep calling her a saint as if thats an insult..  I guess in your materialistic, end justifies the means guild that would be an insult..  Aside from her being too nice, you have flamed some picture you dowloaded from one of your Fat Girl porn sites..   Should we not be more concerned with why you have to pay for access to download those pictures..  Last time I was single,  the fat girls put out pretty regularly and for free..  Put down your mouse and go outside.. you might be surprised..  <br>
<br>
Anyways.. you have given Riffy something to do this afternoon while I was at work and she was watching the kids..  Regardless from what she may post.. She has actually had a good laugh reading your posts..   I guess you were trying to piss me off by going after my wife,  since you have nothing but more  MY LOOT IS BETTER THAN YOURS replies to my questioning your values and methods..   <br>
<br>
I only wish that you had some kind of R/L for me to flame..  I was gonna go after your artwork.. since from what I can tell when you are not playing EQ or downloading Fat Girl porn from websites.. your artwork is the only other thing you have..  But Seli beat me to that..   Thats what I get for having to work on a Saturday I guess.. <br>

Caledhon..  <br>
<br>
He's already shot his load as far as EQ goes..  His guild has much better LOOT than ours does..  <br>
<br>
Thats why he had to move on to flame Riffy.. <br>
<br>
Didn't you read his post..  E/V  has apparently &quot;WON&quot; the game.. and Revo has obviously &quot;LOST&quot; it.. <br>
<br>
So when the day is over.. and all the Revo members tuck their kids into bed.. and kiss their wives goodnite..  getting ready for work the next day..   DM and his EV buddies are still online gloating about their Phat Loot ..  and wishing their mom would either move the washer/dryer out of THEIR basement.. or at least not start so early in the morning doing Laundry.. <br>
<br>
<br>
I guess we have been put in our place..  EV has better loot than us..  and our Guildleader / my wife .. is too Nice ..  I will crawl back under a rock in shame now.. <br>

Its one thing to make a typo. Lord knows I do it enough. You mispelled it twice in exactly the same way which leads me to believe that you are too friggin remedial to even know how to pronounce the damn word.<br>
<br>
I can just see you punching in the 20 minute long distance card code that you bought at 7-11 after scrimping for two weeks to be able to afford one, then drooling with one of your feety pajama-wearing EV buddies about owning a garage full of ferais, jugwars limberginnies and a plethora of other cars you'll never own much less be able to pronounce. Hell, you probably can't even spell BMW. Dreams are good, but take your time junior. Set smaller goals. Clearing up that acne would be a good, applaudable start. Is that why you wear a mask?<br>
<br>
Joe Mad is (HACK!) how Joe Madureira signs (HACK!) his work. Figures you wouldn't (HACK!) know that. You are too busy ripping it off (HACK!)with your tracing paper to take the time to observe the true (HACK!) artist's (HACK!) signature (HACKITTY HACK HACK HACK!). Actually, how many times have you had to erase the sig from &quot;your&quot; artwork after  accidentally (HHAACCKK!!!!) tracing it into your &quot;sketch&quot; book?<br>
<br>
Sorry. coughing fit. Some EV just ran by me in the Nexus and the stench caused me to wretch.<br>
<br>
You alluded to being able to manage your family a little farther up the thread. BIG accomplishment when your family consists of an overflowing trash can, a half eaten bag of cheetos and a G.I. Goe with a Kung Fu grip that's sized just right for helping you to &quot;release&quot; at night.<br>
<br>
And before we revert back to the tired old &quot;My loot is phatter than your loot&quot; argument, let me just say that your guild has its name ALL wrong. You aren't the Elitists. You have the least exclusive invite policy on the server. Hell, you're akin to the putz standing in Gfay /oocing for members to join his new guild. You'll take anyone just so you can possibly get a pair of leggings that has 2 more AC and 5 more hit points. <br>
<br>
My guild is a hell of a lot more &quot;elite&quot; than you losers will ever be. We could swell our ranks in a matter of one or two months if we wanted to. we don't have any desire whatsoever. We choose not to because we see the results of what happens when you do that. You get a bunch of pathetic kids (with a few nice but loot-oriented members who are too chicken shit to speak up when they see how lame the majority of their guild acts). We choose not to invite hoardes of people, expressly to keep out yard trash like yourself. I'd rather get owned by Phinny on a regular basis than have to associate with cowardly losers like you every day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Its one thing to argue against somethng a woman says. Its another thing to pull the cheap shit you did. No one says you can't flame a woman. Just do it with a little class. Christ, you made the regulars on Jerry Springer look high brow.<br>
