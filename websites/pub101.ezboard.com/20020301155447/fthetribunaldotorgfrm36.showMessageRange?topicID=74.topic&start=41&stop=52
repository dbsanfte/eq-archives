The thing is that a lot of people feel the same way, including me.  I dont support ramming planefuls of people into buildingfuls of people, although some people have painted me as supporting such, using my background to also label me a communist, an anti-american, etc.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, to condemn terrorism != absolutely supporting George W. Bush and the current American administration.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel that 9/11 has been exploited beyond its scope to push forward federal agenda on a national level within the U.S. and to push forward American agenda abroad.  I dont like the way its been done in the name of the War on Terrorism.  It is one of my many gripes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udumai01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Messiah of the Flameboard</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/3/02 5:51:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UK reaction to Guantanamo pics</span><hr size=1> Then leave merton.<br>

Even if you conspiracy theories were true, cheap oil from across Afghanistan would be good for the american people. <br>
<br>
Hunting down terrorists is something long overdue.  Voilating the sovreignty of some piss-ant third world country is a risk i'm willing to take if it keeps terrorists from killing americans and damaging our property. <br>
<br>
Yada yada yada, we need to stop pissing off the rest of the world or risk a new generation of terrorists, yada yada yada.<br>
Bullshit.<br>
About once every generation (or more) we need to seriously kick the shit out of some terrorist harbouring country and teach all of those bastards a lesson.  They understand one thing: voilence. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, the current adminstration has made mistakes, and is making mistakes now.  We don't need to send 1.6 billion dollars in aid to Afghanistan.  We need to let them struggle back from the stone age on their own.<br>
<br>
Was there something specific you wanted me to deny?  We already know you are full of far left propoganda and baseless theories, and do not deserve the time it takes for me to type this, but i'd be glad to make you look stupid.<br>
<br>
Grozzer:<br>
&quot;I oppose the Bush administration and its political allies. I am opposed to economic and cultural imperialism perpetrated by large corporations, many of which are US based. I oppose many facets of the manufactured western culture in which I live.&quot;<br>
<br>
You live in the manufactured western culture of your own free will.  Go live in the bush, i'm sure some aborigines need a new water boy.  You can dig up roots or something and bask in the glory that is freedom from our manufactured western culture.<br>
<br>
You hate our economic and cultural imperialism, yet you will gladly partake of the fruits of our (and by our i mean american) labors.  After the WTC was attacked, global stock markets dropped by as much as 10 percent instantly.  If that is not proof that the United States is the backbone of the world, i don't know what is.  So hate us all want, disagree all you want, and ride the wave of our success like one of a billion other hypocrites out there.<br>

Sheer racism. What do you know about Aboriginal culture? What do you *really* know about native American culture? Do you even know if there's anything in it that could help your own life?<br>
<br>
I live in my own culture, with my own people. I do not like the direction my people are taking, and I have great respect for indigenous cultures which white western culture tends to disrespect (just like you have done). White society in Australia and America has such a crappy, immature culture because most of us are brought up to think of everyone else in terms of racist stereotypes. Gotta learn respect, and lose your blinkers.<br>
<br>
P.S. I note Mr Bush is now treating the Taliban as prisoners of war. My original post was quite correct -- what a PR nightmare! <p><br><br>

&quot;What do you know about Aboriginal culture? What do you *really* know about native American culture?&quot;<br>
<br>
The real question is what do i care about their culture.  The answer is nothing.<br>
<br>
I am a racist now?  Because i mentioned that some indiginous peoples still dig up roots to find water/food?  Wow you have a very loose definition of the word.<br>
<br>
According to dictionary.com:<br>
<br>
racist adj 1: based on racial intolerance; &quot;racist remarks&quot; 2: discriminatory especially on the basis of race or religion [syn: antiblack, anti-Semitic, anti-Semite(a)] n : a person with a prejudiced belief that one race is superior to others [syn: racialist]<br>
<br>
Was i intolerant of the aboriginal lifestyle?  No.  I provided it to you as an alternative to a culture which you do not like.<br>
<br>
Did i discriminate on the basis of race or religion?  No.  I have never treated an bushman or native american any different than i have ever treated a caucasian.<br>
<br>
Did i ever say white folks are superior to the bushmen?  No i did not.  <br>
<br>
Do i prefer my lifestyle to that of subsistence hunting and gathering in a desert?  Absolutely. <br>
<br>
You can take your attempt to brand me a racist and shove it up your ass.  That is a typical ploy of the liberal.  When beaten, you attempt to use destructive and innacurate labels on those who disagree with you.<br>
<br>
&quot;I note Mr Bush is now treating the Taliban as prisoners of war&quot;<br>
<br>
They were never mistreated according to the geneva conventions.  Please, quote the line of the geneva conventions the United States violated in our treatment of the Taliban?<br>

To make them crawl back up by themselves would be wrong. Look at what we did for Europe and Japan after ww2. Look at Korea after the korean war. We dished out loads of money to help them get back on their feet, and they are productive members of the world now. Vietnam(as an example) didn't get their helping, cause they 'won', and look at what a shithole that place is(comparatively speaking).<br>
<br>
We need to give them money, but it needs to be accounted for, with goals set and met, blah blah blah. But to leave them on their own now is wrong. <p><IMG SRC="http://home.sc.rr.com/guardians/Vaseelsig.jpg" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrozzer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 2:03:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UK reaction to Guantanamo pics</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The real question is what do i care about their culture.

I am sad for you. Their culture is wonderfully complex and wise, and you are prepared to let it disappear without even knowing anything about it. You see, that's the problem -- western culture promotes itself at the expense of all others. It's a disaster.<br>
<br>
Your racism is in your attitude towards Aboriginal people. You belittle their traditional lifestyle and culture as inferior to your own. You clearly assume you are somehow superior, without even investigating what you are talking about. That is racist -- the people reading this board don't need a dictionary to determine that.<br>
<br>
Your racism also lies in your assumption that Aboriginal people living a traditional lifestyle are somehow living a less complex, less evolved life than yours, because you surround yourself with plastic possessions and they don't.<br>
<br>
Your ignorance is further displayed in your reference to &quot;bushmen&quot; and the whole thing about digging up roots. You have in your mind people from South Africa, not Australian Aborigines.<br>
<br>
Aboriginal people make up about 1.5% of the Australian population. None of them still live a fully traditional lifestyle, thanks to the impact of white settlement. However, many of them are still deeply in touch with their culture and, especially in remote areas, live a combination of western and Aboriginal lifestyle. For example, Aboriginal attitudes to ownership are based around shared custodianship of land -- you don't buy, sell or dig up land, because it's part of who you are. You don't cut down all the trees in one area at the same time, or wipe out all the animals in one place -- you move your activity elsewhere when you've taken a certain amount.<br>
<br>
Whereas we tend to sit around exploiting each other via inflated land prices, overfarming the soil and exploiting everything on it or under it, to the detriment of environmental health. There is a need for a reconciliation of the two extremes.<br>
<br>
Your bigotry is also apparent in your assumption that I am presenting some kind of &quot;choice&quot; between a subsistence lifestyle that involves &quot;digging up roots&quot; and your western existence. That's bullshit designed to throw this argument off course -- you are fully aware I am talking about beliefs and attitudes, and the need to revise Western culture on the basis of wisdom that will give us a better future, rather than living by the single goal of short-term profit.<br>
<br>
Then again, you are Mr Bush's disciple. This fucked-up time in history is your finest hour. <p><br><br>

Where do you get this information? &lt;i&gt;White Supremacist Monthly&lt;/i&gt;? Would it be acceptable in your country to say these things about native American people?<br>
<br>
According to the most recent census (conducted last year), there are more Aboriginal people in Australia than at the last census. Aboriginal culture has suffered 200 years of disease, massacres and discrimination following European settlement and is on its way back.<br>
<br>
It is horrific to see someone say &quot;why has Aboriginal culture failed&quot;. That is the flaw in western culture -- to judge everything by might and power. It is so sad that you can't see there is more to human existence than who can stomp on others the hardest. Because that's all that happened to Aboriginal people -- they got invaded by a numerically superior people corrupted by greed.<br>

&quot;Their young&quot; (gotta wonder why you use the animal term) do not reject their heritage... Aboriginal culture is extremely strong among young people.<br>
<br>
We are talking about a history of people rounded up at gunpoint and placed in white-run settlements, a generation of children taken from their parents for forced &quot;integration&quot;, and the deliberate withholding of their history. That was official government policy until the early 1970s.<br>
