Letters from home these days never seemed to bring her comfort.  But this one did, and she sunk back into her chair by the fire with a satisfied grin on her face.<br>
<br>
When your family suffers long, it is not hard to become accustomed to the hardship.  Long before the mark’s true meaning was revealed to the Halasians, it meant isolation, rejection, and if you managed to survive, exile.  Her entire clan had been blessed with the mark after engaging Vox on a rescue mission.  For years, the Pinesent clan was ostracized.  A once proud and glorious family diminished into factions and then individuals.  Clan Pinesent scattered to the winds rather than face the troubles at home.  And those that stayed, either because of being too old or too young, were left to their own devices.  The only thing that remain intact for so long was the clan compound.  A large empty circle carved into the rock of the mountains that protected eight family homes and a communal banquet hall, it echoed in the wind, devoid of family cheer.<br>
<br>
Memories have a way of showing themselves on the face.  Urda had been bitter about her family’s treatment.  The eventual revelation of the mark’s meaning brought back some prosperity.  But there were still those who feared what they did not understand, and thus treated her clan with the same contempt and fear they always had.  It was dark by the hearth, the fire’s low burning embers casting a dark orange glow on her features.  Reaching out from underneath her fur blanket, Urda found her cup of tea sitting on the heart and brought it slowly to her mouth.<br>
<br>
The letter was from home.  Wora, her younger sister had been found living among the halflings in Rivervale.  She smiled at the thought of Wora, being the barbarian female that she was, towering over the halfling population.  She was one of the one’s who left long ago after Urda herself had gone out on a mission from The Tribunal.  And rather than continue the tradition of the shamanistic rites, Wora had opted to don the warrior’s mantle.  This made Urda smile.  Wora was tall to be sure.  But a muscled warrior?  Among the halflings?  It was a comical juxtaposition.<br>
<br>
She was saddened that there would not be another shaman after her in the clan.  But each had their own call to follow.  And hadn’t Urda herself once questioned the rightness of being made a shaman without formal consent?  The family’s downfall had left wiggle room inside of tradition.  No doubt Wora did what she had to to help the family prosper in any way they could.  There was no shame in that.<br>
<br>
The chair across her was empty.  But for a moment, Urda imagined Wora sitting there.  It had been so long since she had seen her.  She was a strange girl when she was younger.  Urda remembered how she used to always smell of woodchips.  She would bury herself in them by the carpenters hut and come out with chunks of the stuff in her hair.  Would she still smell like that?  The thought of Wora hanging out by a halfling carpenter’s shop made her chuckle.<br>
<br>
Urda continued sipping her tea as the embers continued their glow.  Yes, good news indeed, she thought.  Good news indeed.<br>

The woodchips were fresh, a recent byproduct of a full bedroom set that Fipple the carpenter had been working on all week.  The wood was oak.  And the shavings were find and pillowy.  He’s improving his planning skills, Wora thought.  But the thought was short-lived.  Fipple was a solitary halfling.  And while he showed a gruff tolerance of Wora on occasion, he found her woodchip fetish to be annoying at best and infuriating at worst.<br>
<br>
Wora had apparently caught him in the latter.  With a few swift moves he had managed to completely unearth the barbarian and was ready to make sure she thought twice about coming back.<br>
<br>
“Aye. There ya are.  Looking stupid as per usual.  Never met a barbarian who wasn’t.”<br>
<br>
“Yee canna blame me Master Woodworker.  I have tried other carpenters.  No one gets them as fine and lovely as you do.  And besides,” Wora quickly added, “Limble uses that blasted alder wood.  Who would like the smell o’ that?” She tried winking at him, but Fipple just scowled at her. <br>
<br>
“Bina’s looking for you, you overgrown treewee.  Says she has something for you.  Get going before I set you to her full of holes.” He brandished his pitchfork convincingly enough that Wora backed off, but not without blowing him a kiss and smiling before she took off to see Bina.<br>
<br>
“I shoulda known that’s where you’d be,” Bina said as she watched Wora duck into the kitchen.  “Just look at you!” she plucked a few chips out of wra’s hair and then gave when she realized how many there were.  “The Brandil’s have been looking forward to that bed all week long.  Should have put two and two together…a messenger came bearing this my dear.”<br>
<br>
Bina handed Wora a scroll sealed with a symbol she had never seen before.  But one wiff told her where it came from.  She quickly opened it and scanned the contents.  She nearly burst from the volume of tears she was holding back.  She did not want Bina to see her explode like that.  It was from Urda!  <br>
<br>
“Such wonderful news…glad to hear…miss you terribly…have some fine mead, well of course she does…the mark of Veeshan…many friends…come as soon as you can…enclosed is….a key!”  a small pouch dropped into her lap as she read, containing a small brass key.  “And a map…Oh Bina!  My sister is alive!  And she wants me to join her!”<br>
<br>
“We always knew we would not be able to keep you long, dear one.” Bina looked sad but understanding.  “Your own clan is setting itself to right again, and it is time you joined them.  No no no, little one,” Bina always called her that as a sort of joke, “you must go.  But make sure to say your goodbyes to everyone first.  We want to be ableto welcome you back with open arms.”<br>
<br>
Wora bent down and hugged Bina as hard as she could without snapping her little ribs.  Bina had been her family since she arrived here and owed her a great deal.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be back soon enough, Bina,” Wora promised.  She started collecting things to take with her on her trip. But Bina had already left the house.  <br>
<br>
After all was collected and arranged, Wora gathered her things together and grabbed her sword.  It was time to go, but where was everyone?  She wandered through Rivervale trying to find people to bid farwell to, but everyone seemed to have vanished.  Disappointed and a little sad, Wora made her way to Misty Thicket.  She could not delay any longer if she was to make Kithicor Forest before nightfall.<br>
<br>
As she made her way to the tunnel leading out, she noticed one lone figure standing there waiting.  It was Fipple and he held in his hand something that looked like a pitchfork.  Great, Wora thought, wonderful way to send me off into the world, with a halfling bumblebee on my tail.<br>
<br>
But Fipple stood his ground.  His face was a study in forced passivity.  When Wora came close enough he held up his hand.<br>
<br>
“You’ve been a thorn in my side since the day you showed up here,” he began.  “You talk funny.  You dress funny.  And you drink too much.  Those little ‘constitutionals’ you like to take behind my woodshed disturb my privacy and showed your complete lack of respect for anyone but yourself.”<br>
<br>
Wora looked at the ground and shuffled her feet a bit.  This wasn’t the goodbye she was hoping for.  But she stayed and listened, determined to prove him wrong about her respect for him.<br>
<br>
“There hasn’t been a day that has gone by when I didn’t curse them that brought you into this world,”  Fipple sighed at this last statement.  “But you’ve also protected all of us from things too powerful for us to defend against on our own.  You have showed an inkling of decency on a few occasions and I would be a bad halfling if I didn’t at least acknowledge that you saved my butt on a few occasions,” he was frowning now, the admission of this was obviously unpleasant.<br>
<br>
“In return for that, I offer you this spear.  I crafted it myself with you in mind a few months ago.  Finished it as soon as I could.  Should allow you to take advantage of that blasted reach of yours.”  He handed her the spear gruffly, which she took in awe and gratitude.<br>
<br>
“And to keep you from inflicting yourself on any other undeserving soul, here you go,” and with that he handed Wora a pouch.  When she opened it, the sent of fresh woodchip wafted up to her nose and she closed her eyes and smelled it deeply.<br>
<br>
When she opened them again, Fipple was gone and the way to Misty Thicket was clear.  She said thank you to the air around her and strode forward.  Before leaving the city entirely, she decided to take one last look behind her.  <br>
<br>
There in the corridor stood every last resident of Rivervale.  No one waved.  No one said goodbye.  Fipple and Bina stood in front of them all and smiled.  Wora smiled back and nodded before she made her way to her sister.  Her long lost sister.  <br>
<br>
“Urda…listen to the wind…I am coming…”<br>

&quot;Bah...that never worked...stupid parlor tricks...&quot;<br>
<br>
Urda instead opened her cloak and watched the sun creep below the horizon.  She's on her way to Kithicor by now.  She best camp before trekking across.<br>
<br>
Knowing the opposite was likely the case, Urda summoned her wolf spirit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wora is out by Kithicor's edge.  Go and protect her.  Now!&quot;<br>
<br>
The wolf spirit made no motion except to immediately begin running off into the distance.  She doubted he would make it in time to stop her.  But he might be able to defend her.<br>
<br>
Urda returned to the hearth and began pacing back and forth.  There was nothing she could do.  Except wait.<br>

Far away, if possible, and wait until daylight to cross it.  Common sense would not lead you down said path just as the sun was passing beneath the horizon.<br>
<br>
Of course, she knew no one named Common Sense.  And since camping now would delay her reunion with Urda, Wora opted to make a run for it.  She was sure she could outrun anything this forest threw at her.  Well almost sure.  But what could possibly happen?<br>
<br>
So it was very lucky when, after falling in battle with a large, red skeleton with its hand about to touch the area above her heart, that a blur of wolf knocked it off its feet, scattering its odd colored bones in every direction.<br>
<br>
“…huh?…oh!” said Wora as she realized what had just saved her.  She went to pet the animal only to have her hand run right through it.  The wolf spirit smiled its canine grin at her and sat down by her side while she tended her wounds.<br>
<br>
“You know…I had that creature right where I wanted it.” Wora said to the spirit.  She doubted it could understand much of what she said but she went on anyway.<br>
<br>
“Urda must be getting good if she can send a wolf all the way out to meet me.  Must still think I’m too young to travel.” She could have sworn the wolf just shrugged at her then.  Wora dismissed it and finished the last of her bandages.<br>
<br>
“Ok, I’m good to go wolfie.  Much oblidged and all.  I’m ok now.  Off you go!”  The wolf stayed by her side.  Wora wasn’t really surprised.  She sighed and continued walking.<br>
<br>
The rest of the forest walk went smoothly enough.  The wolf easily batted aside those few creatures that would do Wora harm.  He seemed to humor her toward the forest’s edge however, backing off a bit and letting her get that last few strikes in on a half crippled zombie.  When Wora gloated a bit, the wolf spirit merely sighed and trotted over to her side.<br>
<br>
It was now pitch dark, and Wora had to admit to even herself that she was tired.  Being on alert at all times was exhausting work.<br>
<br>
“Ok wolf.  Be really useful.  Find us a safe spot to camp.”  The wolf did a quick scan and walked over to a clearing behind a boulder and sat down.<br>
<br>
“Ah wonderful.  Ok.  Let’s see here…”  And with that, Wora began to make camp.  The starry night sky lulled her into dreams with their twinkling.  The moon of Luclin reminded her of the moon shaped cakes that she had grabbed from Bina’s kitchen.  She ate it and felt a small pang on longing.  She wasn’t sure when she would return to Rivervale again.  With that thought, the moon cake became that much sweeter, and she savored each bite with a small tear.<br>
<br>
The next part of her travels, she knew, would be tricky.  And she wished for the first time since leaving Rivervale, that she hadn’t come this far alone.  How was she going to find Urda without getting ripped to shreds?  Urda couldn’t have just come to Rivervale to fetch her?<br>
<br>
All young people think they are invincible.  But every so often they face things that they realize are bigger and more difficult than they ever imagined.  In a few cases, failure could mean death.  And that’s where Wora was now.  Failure could kill her before she got to Urda.<br>
<br>
To someone older, this would  not be that big a revelation. Clerics could resurrect lost souls.  But Wora knew no clerics who could come to her rescue.  She was alone for the first time in a long time, minus the wolf spirit, but for some reason the thought brought little comfort.  Tears began to flow down her cheeks.<br>
<br>
“Stupid sister.  Stupid me. Should have stayed in Rivervale.  And what are you looking at?” the wolf spirit was staring at her with a sad puppy expression.  “You can’t protect me from everything.  My family relied on your kind too much anyway.  Never saw the point.  Spirits….BAH!”  <br>
<br>
Wora kicked some dirt toward the fire, which effectively smothered about half of it.  Wora scowled.  Things were not as fun as she thought they would be.  She went to sleep hoping that tomorrow would provide some clarity.  And maybe some idea of how not to die a horrible death.<br>

Urda’s pet was still by her side, looking off into the horizon.  When it heard her wake up, it turned and stood looking at her face with its puppy like smile.<br>
<br>
It took a while for Wora to realize where she was.  It had been years since she had woken up in a place other than Bina’s hut.  After reorienting herself and sighing with realization, she began rummaging through her packs to find another Bina cake for breakfast.  She had a long way to go yet and was certain that she would need to muster up her resolve in order to make it to her destination in a timely matter.<br>
<br>
The world of Norrath offered her many challenges.  Thankfully, Urda’s pooch kept to his duties and Wora begrudgingly thanked him on numerous occasions when he stepped in and fended off a creature that would have certainly meant her demise.  When she arrived at Freeport, a place that Urda had called a wretched stinkhole of humanity, Wora breathed a sigh of relief.  She dropped her bags in a corner and propped herself up against one of the towering stonewalls.  Wora looked around.  Sure it was dusty.  And the guards kept looking at her funny.  But at least she was out of reach of orcs, ogres, gnolls, the undead, giants, tigers, bears, snakes, drakes, and the occasional talking griffon.  How bad could this place be?<br>
<br>
The trip had exhausted her supplies, so Wora wandered into what looked like a local bar and sat down.  She was alone except for a small rat scurrying along the floor.  The bartender eyed her up and down and then poured a big stein full of mead.  Wora smiled.  That stein of mead was just what she needed.  So when the barkeep set the mug down on the floor, she frowned slightly.<br>
<br>
“I would rather serve the rat at my feet than the likes of you.” He grumbled.  His stare seemed to be daring her to do something, anything that would give him an excuse to call the guards on her.  So when two of them entered and sat down on the opposite end of the bar, she picked up her things and decided to go…quickly.<br>
<br>
The barkeep had apparently said something because no sooner had she left the place, she heard the clink clank of guard armor following close behind.  Without looking behind her, Wora picked up her pace.  The guards did the same.<br>
<br>
Where was Urda’s pup now?  She remembered with shame that she had told it to guard near the exit of the city.  Picking up into a run, she made her way back out to the city gates.<br>
<br>
The pup was there waiting for her where she left it.  When it saw what was coming behind her it bared its fangs and grimaced.  Wora motioned wildly with her hands.<br>
<br>
“No! No!  Just lead us out of here!”  The wolf stopped growling and started running alongside the city walls.  Wora followed.  From the sounds of it, the gate guards had joined in the chase.  She doubted they would wait for an explanation before they reached her.<br>
The wolf had come to a dead stop in front of a pedestal and was eyeing a book sitting on top.  Wora was dumbfounded.  She couldn’t hide behind a book!  Stupid dog!  But the dog just stared at it and Wora followed its gaze.<br>
<br>
There was a handprint on the open page.  Not front one hand but from the weight of many hands touching this one spot.  Touch the book?  Touch the book!<br>
<br>
She felt one of the guards grab her shoulder just as she placed her hand on the page.  She felt a strange pulling sensation as the world around her disappeared and was replaced by another place entirely.  It took Wora a moment to get her bearings.<br>
<br>
She was surrounded by green and gold and beauty everywhere she looked.  And people.  People of every race and size and color.  She grabbed the first halfling who would look at her and asked her where on earth she was.<br>
<br>
“Why, the Plane of Knowledge lass.”  The halfling looked up at her with round, concerned eyes.  “Are you ok?”<br>
<br>
Let’s see.  She hadn’t eaten for a few days.  She had been taunted by unreachable mead. And she had used the last of her energy to escape the Freeport guards.<br>
<br>
As Wora fell face first toward the floor, she managed to eek out, “Oh yeah.  Super.  Never felt better.”  And with a thunk, Wora was out cold.<br>
