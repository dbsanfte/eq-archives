<br>
_______________________________<br>
<br>
        The druid’s ring in the Butcherblock Mountains nestled in an isolated valley was never empty for long. Druids like their wizard counterparts, opened portals to help the people of Norrath move more freely across the known world.  As had happened many times that day and would happen many times more, there was shimmer in the area and a group of people appeared.  A barbarian shaman from Everforst, a half elven Paladin, a wood elf ranger and a wood elf druid got their bearings and then moved away from the portal location.  Their equipment told pass-by that these were seasoned travelers of Norrath, battling many of the powerful foes of the land.<br>
<br>
        “Well, ladies, I am off for Boab’s tavern! Who else is going?” asked Vortigern, the barbarian shaman.<br>
<br>
        “I can’t,” replied Sashanna, the druid.  “I need to get to Kael and help out those there.”<br>
<br>
        “Well, I am in! I hope Muse is there! Would be fun!” said the paladin, Tuwene. “What about you Kess?  Kess?”<br>
<br>
        Kesselee, the wood elf ranger, just stood there, gazing off blanking into the mountains.<br>
<br>
        Vortigern gently touched her arm. “Are you ok, sweetpea?”<br>
<br>
        Kesselee’s gaze snapped to Vortigern. “Oh…yes… I am fine.  Can I meet you all later at Boab’s? I need to go to Kelethin first? Is that ok?”<br>
<br>
        “Sure, Kess, we’ll see you tonight,” replied Tuwene.<br>
<br>
        Kesselee hugged all her friends and ran off in the direction of the Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
        “Is that what has been troubling you two about Kess – that blanks stare?” asked Sashanna.<br>
<br>
        Tuwene nodded and said, “Yes, it is happening more and more often. Sometimes Kess seems so withdrawn, almost as if she isn’t there.”<br>
<br>
        “We have tried to get her to talk about it a few times but she doesn’t seem to want to talk about it,” Vortigern add.<br>
<br>
        “Well, I don’t see what we can do other than be there when she is ready to talk,” shrugged Sashanna.<br>
<br>
        “But Sash, it is happening more often and last night she started muttering in her sleep,” replied Tuwene.<br>
<br>
        “Lots of people talk in their sleep”<br>
<br>
        “But in dark elvish?” said Tuwene with a frown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        No matter how often she did, sprinting through the city in the trees, Kelethin, always brought a smile to Kesselee’s face.  For those few moments, as she raced over the platforms and connecting bridges, Kesselee left her troubles behind.<br>
<br>
        She pounded down the ramp and entered the ranger’s guild.  Ran Sunfire, her teacher and mentor, was instructing a young ranger, give them their first task.  She recalled her days of hunting the pixie tricksters who constantly harassed the city of Kelethin, despite the horde of young elves ready to keep them at bay.  Finally, Ran Sunfire was free.  Kesselee approached and greeted her mentor.<br>
<br>
        “Ran Sunfire, I need to ask you something,” said Kesselee.<br>
<br>
        “What is it?” Ran replied.<br>
<br>
        Kesselee took a deep breath. Suddenly the words were stuck in her throat.  Something was stopping her. It would not let her ask about her dreams.  She clenched her will, the force stopping her voice continued to fight, becoming stronger with each momemnt.  Finally, using all of her strength she forced the words out. <br>
<br>
        “I’ve been having dreams about doing horrible things. I feel like…”<br>
<br>
        “I am not surprised that you have nightmares since you associate with all those teir’dal. They are an evil influence on you and all that visit that tavern in the Butcherblock Mountains.  Forsake them and I am sure that your nightmares will end.  And until you do, don’t ask me for advice.”<br>
<br>
        “I can’t forsake them, they are my friends.” <br>
<br>
        “Then there is nothing I can do for you,” replied Ran Sunfire and turned to the young ranger who had just entered the guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Boab's tavern was off the beaten track in the Butcherblock Mountains.  People didn't stumble upon it; you had to know where to look for it.  The Stromguards knew where is of course, but like to pretend it wasn't there.  After all, it was a perverse place, where all the races of Norrath were welcome, the one rule of the house being &quot;Accept all of Norrath&quot;.<br>
<br>
        As Kesselee entered the tavern, she nodded to her friends.  Vortigern was with Maleus and Apol. The 3 shamen were arguing whether a poison spell was better or should you slow it first?  Tuwene was near Muse, who was playing her lute. The two of them were singing together.  She looked into the dark corners and saw Voldraxx.  Ah, good, no Xanta, he was alone. She began to walk to his table.<br>
<br>
        &quot;It was just so wonderful to Qanwen again - Hey Kess!&quot; a bright voice called.  “Wasn't it wonderful to See Qanwen, to know he hasn't forgotten us in Death&quot;<br>
<br>
        Kesselee closed her eyes to try and stop it from beginning again.<br>
<br>
        &quot;YOU ARE ALONE!&quot;<br>
<br>
        That day at Karnor's Castle, when the shade of the paladin, Qanwen came to beg of boon of Gorenaire to put his brother's soul to rest; it had started that day.<br>
<br>
        &quot;YOU ARE ALWAYS ALONE!&quot;<br>
<br>
        The words blocked out all other thought.  But each time, the despair that followed was deeper.<br>
<br>
    &quot;THOSE YOU CARE FOR WILL BE DESTROYED&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Qanwen had died, Kesselee suddenly realized that she had begun to care for him, that she was willing to let someone inside the walls she had built around herself-- and then he was gone.<br>
<br>
        &quot;YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ALONE!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        When the words had been spoken only by the harsh male voice, they had been easy to push back.  But now, there were 2 voices, the harsh male and the soft female. And every time the female voice spoke, the wounds in her heart got deeper. It was drowning her, she was losing herself.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Wasn't it Kess?&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Yes, Raveina, it was good to see Qanwen again.&quot; she quietly answered.<br>
        <br>
        Kesselee headed to Voldraxx's dark corner and greeted him with a hug.  Tonight he returned it, he didn't always.  Usually when one of her teir’dal friends returned her greeting, she was so happy that they were learning to show their caring.  Tonight, it only deepened her despair.<br>
<br>
        &quot;HE HAS THE BOOK.&quot;<br>
<br>
        They both sat quietly for a while, watching the Shamans argue, listening to Muse play her music, watching their friends talk, sing and laugh.  Voldraxx broke the silence at last.<br>
<br>
        “What’s up Kess? Why are you with the others?  You are usually trying to drag me out of my corner” asked Voldraxx with a slight smile.<br>
<br>
        “ I want to ask you something, Vold.  Do you remember the raid on Sebillis where we found that strange book?”<br>
<br>
        “Yes, I held onto the book.  What about it?”<br>
<br>
        “I would like to see the book”<br>
        <br>
        “Kess, other than the first page, there in nothing, it is a blank book”<br>
        <br>
        “I would still like to see it”<br>
<br>
        Voldraxx was amused that a Fier’Dal, who always seem more interested in trees and animals than rituals of power, would think that they would be able to decipher the book, which seemed to be a ritual to give Innorruk dominion in Norrath.  To satisfy her curiosity he pulled out the book.<br>
<br>
        “I will open it to a page – if you see anything, do you promise to read it aloud to me?”<br>
<br>
        “Yes Vold, I promise”<br>
        <br>
        “Here you go” Voldraxx watched in amusement as Kesselee took the book.<br>
<br>
        “And when the interlopers in my land are no more, and their blood consecrates their ring to Me, proceed then to…”<br>
<br>
        Voldraxx snatched the book away from her.  No, not her – he would not allow it!<br>
        <br>
        “You are not reading anymore” he glanced at the page she had read. Damm! He could see what she read now!<br>
<br>
        “Why not? It may help..”<br>
<br>
        “You aren’t. I forbid it”<br>
<br>
        “Who are you to forbid me?”<br>
<br>
        Voldraxx was stunned. In all the months he had know her, he had never heard her voice so harsh, so cold, so angry.  For an instant, her face mirrored her voice and then something seemed to break, and she looked just as stunned as he was, and even more terrified.<br>
        <br>
        “I am sorry Vold, I don’t know why I reacted that way.  Maybe I need some rest,” she said, sounding like a lost child.<br>
<br>
        “Anything you want to talk about Kessy?” he tried to pitch his voice as gently as he could. For a moment, he thought that she would, then she shook her head and looked down. “Get some rest, things will be better in the morning.”<br>
<br>
        After she went up the stairs, Voldraxx walked over to Tuwene, and beckoned her away from Muse.<br>
<br>
        “Go upstairs and stay with Kess, Tuwene.”<br>
        <br>
        “Why? Did something happen?”<br>
        <br>
        “Not yet, Tuwene, not yet.”<br>
<br>
        <br>
        Sometime, in the dark hours between midnight and dawn, Tuwene suddenly dozed off.  Kesselee stood up and silently moved out of the room, out of the inn.  For a moment, she stood staring up at the stars, and then blended into the shadows.<br>
<br>
<br>
        Sometime in the dark hours between midnight and dawn, Voldraxx left Boab’s Tavern and headed for Felwithe in the Greater Faydark.  Hopefully, Kess was asleep by now, with Tuwene watching over her.  He didn’t particularly relish trying to get to Xanta in Felwithe but the book HAD to be destroyed, now.  Surely the clerics of Tunare would be able to call upon their goddess in order to protect on of Her children.  A Fier’Dal, the chosen of Innoruuk, who would have believed it!!  The only words that he had been able to read when he found the book still hung before his eyes.<br>
<br>
        “Behold and heed my word! What is revealed here shall be that which bring My reign to Norrath. You shall know the time is near when my chosen one reveals the words in this book for all to see. My chosen one shall be my Vessel, to prepare for the rite, which will make HATE supreme.”<br>
<br>
        He had always felt that those who spent their time studying the wilds were wasting their time, that there was much more to learn, much more power to be obtained from the study of death.  Tonight, he now wished that he could move more silently through the woods; that he could blend more easily with the rocks and bushes.  As it was, he had to stay near the road and risk the guards attacking him.  He moved slightly deeper into the shadows as he approached a dwarven guardhouse.<br>
<br>
        What was that?<br>
<br>
        He turned and saw a gray wolf behind him.  The intelligence in its eyes declared it to one of Tunare’s Children.<br>
<br>
        “I wish you no harm. I am merely traveling from one place to another but I will defend myself!” Voldraxx stated.<br>
<br>
        Voldraxx summoned a long dead warrior from the earth to be his solider.  He cloaked himself and it in dark energies.  A bolt of poison hung to his fingers, ready to be thrown.<br>
<br>
        The wolf just stood there for a moment, looking at him.  It then loped off into the darkness of the mountains.<br>
<br>
        Voldraxx made his way quickly to the pass that lead to the Great Faydark.  <br>
As he entered the pass, he released is minion back to the earth.  The roads in Greater Faydark were too traveled to allow him unchallenged pass with a minion.  He quickly made his way through the pass.<br>
<br>
        Dawn was beginning to filter through the trees of Great Faydark, almost dim enough to remind him of his home in Nekulos Forest.  There were not many on the roads this early. He should be able to make his way to Felwithe quickly.<br>
<br>
        Something fast and gray appeared in the air in front of him, knocking him down.  It bit him, it clawed him, it held him down.  It blurred, and became an elven ranger.   He tried to get a spell off, to freeze this attacker, to summon aid, and then he recognized his attacker.<br>
<br>
        “Kess!?!”<br>
<br>
        Kesselee took her warhammer and brought it down against Voldraxx’s skull.  At the last instant, her arm jerked, changing a killing blow into a stunning blow.  As Voldraxx sank into the darkness he heard,<br>
        <br>
        “You should not have defied me”.        <br>
          <br>
        Kesselee searched Voldraxx’s robe, and took the book of dark rituals.  She melted into the wildness opened the book and started to read.  Unnoticed, a tear washed Voldraxx’s blood from her cheek and splashed onto the book.  The next step was known.  She blurred back into wolf form and headed off into the woods of the Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
        Residents of the Great Faydark were so used to hearing the howl of wolves that they didn't really hear them.  But that day, they all agreed, one howl forced itself into their awareness.  They all agreed it sounded like a howl of utter despair. <br>
