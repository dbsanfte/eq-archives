Trolling = saying provocative things that one does not mean, hoping to provoke anger amongst other posters. Unfortunately, the troll has to be smarter than those he wishes to provoke, and the sad fucks who so desire the attention that a successful troll gets, are most often less than generously endowed, intellectually. How ironic. <br>
<br>
However, Merton, it seems, is not. I thought fer sure you were trolling Merton, but when you mentioned your background in a post, I started thinking that you may actually be serious about what you post here. Your family fleed to the US because the nation you lived in had been controlled by the USSR, and your mother being Russian, your family feared a backlash against her. Did I get that right? <br>
<br>
If I am way off, then perhaps my point is way off too. My point is, you speak of hypocracy. Yet, you seem to have nothing but scorn for the nation that took you in, as you fled your native land. Is this not hypocracy? <br>

<br>
Correct.  But there was really only backlash against the pure Russians.  So mixed folk (Latvian/Russian) like me and my brother were not really in any danger of that backlash.  <br>
<br>
Back to the topic however, you speak of hypocrisy.  I see your point.  To this I can only say, I am part of the problem as by working and living in U.S., I support its ideology involuntarily.  At this point I really don't have a choice.  I need to wrap up my studies (another 2-3 years), build up some capital and then I fully intend to leave U.S.  However, by the same token, although I may be a cog that helps support the very machine I resent, I will be a cog with a voice that will damn my own actions until the day that I can set myself free.<br>
<br>
The only time I was trolling was in a thread some time ago that had to with Make-A-Wish foundation granting a boy his wish to play EQ at VI's offices or something to that extent.  I regretted those actions for they undermined my credibility.  I would never troll again. Everything I say now, I am dead serious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucogito.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cogito</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of the Whacky Woondarland</span><br>  Posts: 1320<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/8/01 10:57:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://voxton.hypermart.net/sigs/sig.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> You do have a choice.

<br>
Some Americans cling to the bizarre notion that the US surely must be the best country in the world to live in, and that every single human being on this planet dream of living here. This is ludicrous, and a sadly appropriate stereotype of American ignorance. I know there are many countries in this world, that have benefits that the US do not have, and people's preferences differ greatly. Americans do emmigrate to other countries also. So I'll never subscribe to the whole #1 hoopla BS. <br>
<br>
But to live in this country, accepting its benefits, with your attitude, is nothing short of hypocracy. Infantile, spoiled, bratty and blind hypocracy. You are dining at a table, while giving the host lip about what he does for a living. When told that you can just leave, if you do not approve, you respond &quot;I have no choice, I am hungry&quot;. <br>
<br>
I do not see any wisdom in this. <br>

Yes this country has tards in it. White supremacists scum who'd chain a black man to their truck and drag him to his death, or whatever other gruesome act.

Thuswise and &quot;Innocents&quot; killed in Afganistan were not killed on PURPOSE and were in the wrong place at the wrong time. If I knew the closest town to me (5 miles) was gonna be bombed I would be smart enough to get my family a few more miles away from the intended target.<br>
So for all the Afgani babies killed its your stupid parents fault not the US. But hey chances are if your parents are hanging that close to the Taliban you will be raised as a terrorist anyways so instead of being allowed to get older and reach the age of accountability and burn in hell the US bombs did you a favor. You get to spend eternity in heaven instead of hell.<br>

A few weeks flipping burgers at McDonald's should be more than enough to get you a plane ticket.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Most of my earnings go towards paying for school. I am stuck until I get my degree, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
No you are not stuck here, you do not HAVE to have a degree, plenty of people do just fine without them.  The problem is Merton, I don't dislike you for your opinion on the whole war, what I can't stand is that you have come here, to make your life better, to use our country, to get an education and then verbally stab this nation in the back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel I've said too much about my private life already on these boards, I regret it but at the same time I think it was necessary for some folks to realize where I was coming from&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, you've proven that you as a human being deserve zero respect, you have an opinion great, but you don't have the balls to back it up with actions (Well, at least until after you have a degree, which you will use your helping terrorist factions develop weapons of mass destruction to use against the U.S.).  Please, Merton, if you have any shred of humanity, stop supporting the US now by working here and leave immediately.  If not, hopefully the sedition laws will be enough to catch you and throw you back to whicher primitave mud hut you slithered out of upon your birth.<br>

Go back to Russia and count the dead that the Afganees killed and revel in the fact that the U.S. could wipe out the entire country and loose not even a 10th as many. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

<br>
<br>
I remember a little 13 year skirmish in Vietnam, do you?<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
huh? <br>
<br>
If you are going to drag it out longer then the march '65 - september '72 timeframe, at least go all the way from late 40's to '75.<br>
<br>
As for your background, thats pathetic. Hispanics may irritate me at times, but in my experience not a single one has ever bad mouthed the US, and stayed here. They come, they work, they go home with the money they made. But your kind from eastern europe/russia make me think bad thoughts. <br>
<br>
You have no conscience at all, to come here, to eat our food, sleep in our homes, enjoy our freedoms and safety, partake of our recreation and financial reserves and then spew off how nasty and foul the whole system is. The US may be one of 2 countries in the world with superb education, but other countries have good schools. I'm sure you would find more support in France for your anti US views. It never ceases to amaze me who college kids can be the dumbest people on earth. <br>
<br>
Go flip burgers for a few weeks, work in a factory for a month, that will get you a plane ticket to some european anti US community where you will be revered as a returning hero, who had successfully eluded the brainwashing that goes on over here.<br>
<br>
You remind me of a kid in Bulgaria. He came up to me and started to spew off how bad america is, and how great bulgaria is(mind you, bulgaria had just come in 4th! in the world soccer championships and he was riding a national high). Going off about how his education was free, how his medicene was free, how his housing was low cost, etc. Turns out this kid hadn't even left Sofia,let alone been outside Bulgaria. But he still thought his poor education(cause all the good teachers have left and the buildings are falling apart), free space in a hosptial(cause hospitals are supposed to recieve federal money but don't, so patients have to buy everything themselves and be operated on by doctors not good enough to be hired by western countries), and lost cost housing(in crumbling cement blocks with a designed life span of 40 years, that are missing most of thier windows, outside doors, lack cleaning services, high crime) and lack of a national ability to exert influence outside of her own borders, was much better then the decadent Americans.<br>
<br>
It's good to see that you have latched on to one of our most precious freedoms, freedom of speech, and are using it to your fullest advantage on an internet messageboard.  <p>Vaseel Doomherald 51 minstrel<br>Wittles Woodfurfun 54 champion<br>
