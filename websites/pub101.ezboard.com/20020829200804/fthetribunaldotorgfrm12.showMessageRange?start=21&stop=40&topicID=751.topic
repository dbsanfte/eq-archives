One of the best times I ever had in EQ was when I was on my first character, a level 6 halfling warrior, and a level 48 necro decided to show me around in Runnyeye.  I basically tried to keep up with him.  I say tried, because while he was grabbing all the coin, I was scooping up all the high-quality ore right behind him.<br>
<br>
I wished I had taken some SS, but I think the funniest few lines he said over group were:<br>
<br>
necro -- /g OOM<br>
necro -- /g doh, pet dead<br>
necro -- /g ROFL! -- I'm meleeing!<br>
necro -- /g Can you tank these 6 while I try to med a bit?<br>
LOADING PLEASE WAIT....<br>
necro -- /g Sorry about that.  I dragged you to zoneline<br>
<br>
Now, I guess some people would have been angry about this, but I had a blast.  Even now, when I run OOM and begin meleeing I think back on that and smile.<br>

<br>
It's true, there are thousands of genuine newbies still around. EQ still sells, people still hear of it for the first time. The overall number of people with active EQ accounts is apparently still growing (about 400,000 in Verant's last press release) and plenty arrive to replace those who leave.<br>
<br>
If you start a new character and level up the old-fashioned way (it's actually quite fun to go back and do that) you can find them. I did this as an enchanter last year and it was frustrating as hell because the zillions of n00bs are just like we all used to be... they have never heard of the efficiencies we use at higher levels to increase our success (prime example being assist ... it was being used to mean &quot;ease the load on the tank, by targeting one of the adds yourself&quot;). It's hard to find other twinks to group with -- pickup groups of n00bs are what you get most nights.<br>
<br>
I also found people who started in 1999 and are still not level 50 with any character. Those of us who visit message boards and play the high level game are a minority.<br>
<br>
Stand around in Lake of Ill Omen and you'll see it in OOC/Shout... the twinks with knowledge arguing with the genuine n00bs. They will make you cringe, but they're just n00bs, still full of misinformation and misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
And it is good entertainment. <p><br><br>

I remember how the elevators to kelethin were high tech shit. Enchanters use to minor illusion and die on top of each of the lift levers, which would essentially shut down Kelethin for hours. Now that was real newbie harrassment.<br>
<br>
My first character was an enchanter named Tatianna. I used to get into crushbone groups and people who had played EQ from other severs would try to exlain to us newbies how /assist worked. But macros were for hard core gamers only. I'd be damned if I was gonna type that out every fight. Luckily, as an enchanter you can go 60 levels without ever having to learn assist. You just have to know how to boss other people around about using it. When I finally learned how to make a hotkey I think it was &quot;/g Assist the main tank or I'm leaving!&quot; Hahaha.<br>
<br>
When I went back to playing my bard during Kunark I had being playing EQ for over a year before I finally made a hot key to use assist. Now days I locate the group enchanter and make an assist on her hotkey immediately! Breaking mezzes is one of the few small pleasures left for me in this game.<br>
<br>
Next edition I will dress in my gold pog armor and look for a drolvarg group in dreadlands needing a cleric. Let's find out who our level 40+ newbies are on Tribunal.<br>

I kept quiet, and had no twink gear, so nobody knew I were a twink. An the only player who spotted the well equipped twink, was me -- the n00bies were too n00b to see it. <br>
<br>
The newbies were very inefficient, and played in a typical newbie way: unorganized, no plans, no attention to spawn times, inefficiency, etc. They'd heal and med until everyone were full, before attacking anything -- and when fighting, some would blow all their mana, whereas others would preserve theirs. Some fighters were near death, but others neary full hp. So we'd sit around for ages and wait for one tank or caster to recoup a lot. Very inefficient. Typical noobie stuff. <br>
<br>
But this twink got things rolling pretty well. Coaxed the big nukers to slow down a bit, and have the heroic front-of-the-battle-line tanks to back off every now and then. Space the spawns, pull from other areas in between pops -- the noobies were really amazed, cos we were killing things at three times the rate all of a sudden. <br>
<br>
The problem however, was that there were so many dead mobs, and the noobies were all completely nice players, and not a single one of them were greedy -- pretty unusual. So, they'd spend a lot of time deciding who'd loot what. Basically, they were so polite, they'd all insist they had looted the last one, and surely it must be so-and-so's turn, until finally someone graciously, and gratefully stood up and looted a mob. <br>
<br>
But thing was, the twink got REALLY frustrated with this, cos the bodies would always be cluttering up the floor. So when she came back with a pull and found shit on the floor, she'd loot it to get rid of it -- obviously didn't give a damn about the loot. <br>
<br>
But to the newbies, this felt like ninja looting or something. So they booted her ass from the group. That really made me laugh... She was SO fucking hopping mad. She wanted to know WTF they had booted her, the replied she had to stop looting so much. She agreed, came back, but told them to please loot the stuff, cos leaving mobs on the floor made it harder to target things. <br>
<br>
But they kept lagging behind in their looting efforts, and when she returned with a pull, only to find a shitload of dead mobs on the floor, she looted them -- and got booted a second time. <br>
<br>
She threw a complete shitfit. It was awesome. <br>

Then they chased me all through GFay while I shouted for help and asked if there was a GM event going on or if these Named Wolves had been added in the latest patch...<br>
<br>
It was amazing how many people actually believed the wolves were mobs.  The shouts were unbelievable as everyone tried casting on these &quot;mobs&quot; and couldn't get anything to stick...  I was hit with every kind of buff in the game as I ran around and peeps tried to &quot;save&quot; me from the rampaging wolf pack.<br>

One of the funnest 15 minutes I have spent in EQ. <p>Peechai Saanuuk, Druid of Tunare <BR>
