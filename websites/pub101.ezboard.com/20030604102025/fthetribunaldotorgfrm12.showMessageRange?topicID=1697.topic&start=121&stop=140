thing I hate is that Bush and Co. set the standards by claiming to have concrete intelligence (that they refused to share with UN inspectors) that Saddam had WMD, but when we try to hold them to that standard then we are anti-American.<br>
<br>
If they had said &quot;we suspect Saddam was WMD, but we don't know where&quot; then this war would have never been supported, so they took it to the next level and claimed that they had the intelligence, that they wouldn't share it because it would burn their sources and we are going to war because our intelligence says it's an imminent threat that needs to be neutralized immediatly to save US lives.<br>
<br>
And now we are the bad guys because we won't just forget what this war was based on and the reason given for defying the UN and world opinion? Not having amnesia is un-American?<br>
<br>
The facts are that Bush did not make his case for immediate military action based on human rights violation or suspicions - he made it clear that we were going to war because Saddam was in violation of UN sanctions by possesing WMD. Now he wants us to forget those claims and approve his actions because Saddam was a bad guy.<br>
<br>
This is like a cop getting a search warrent based on false statements and then afterwards calling the judge pro-crime for throwing the case out when the false statements are brought to light.<br>
<br>
It is not anti-American to demand the proof this administration promised before going in. Saddam being a bad guy does not absolve Bush of making false claims as Saddam was a bad guy before we went in and that was not the reason given. <p><br><br><br>

Memo To: Karl Rove, President’s political counselor<br>
From: Jude Wanniski<br>
Re: Saddam Did Not Gas the Kurds<br>
 <br>
(portions snipped for brevity)<br>
<br>
Go to Amazon.com, Karl, and look for the author Stephen Pelletiere. His book is entitled Iraq and the International Oil System: Why America Went to War in the Gulf, published in 2001 by Praeger. It is $70 and worth the money. Pelletiere is also the author of the 1990 report I have previously cited that exonerated Iraq from the gassing at Halabja. It is listed by Amazon but is &quot;out of print.&quot; I believe it was the report Jim Baker cited with Tariq Aziz in their 1990 Geneva meeting, telling Aziz he did not believe the story of Iraq gassing the Kurds.<br>
<br>
Pelletiere is retired at age 70 and living in central Pennsylvania. He is a Ph.D. in political science and was the chief of the CIA Iraq desk at Langley in the 1980s. He left the CIA in 1987 to become a lecturer at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., and was sent in 1988 to investigate Halabja. He based his conclusions that the &quot;several hundred Kurds&quot; who died at Halabja must have been killed by Iranians, because the deaths were caused by cyanide gas, which Iraq had not used in the war against Iran (they used mustard gas), and which, says Pelletiere, they had no ability to produce. He says the Iranians blamed the deaths on the Iraqis and won the public-relations war that followed, even though journalists at Halabja could see the symptoms being caused by cyanide gas. In his new book, Pelletiere again addresses the question of the alleged gassing later in 1988, which Secretary of State George Shultz at the time said resulted in the deaths of 100,000 Kurds. Pelletiere argues that story was a complete fabrication, and that to this day no bodies were ever found. His account is consistent with the account of the Iraqi government, but as time goes on, the Shultz account still winds up being accepted by our press corps.... and our President. <br>
<br>
I’ll return to this issue again and again, Karl, until the President and Vice President give some indication they have been correctly informed on it. Following is Dr. Pelletiere’s brief account of Halabja. I spoke to him last week by telephone and he told me: “You are on solid ground in saying Saddam did not gas his own people.”<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
HALABJA<br>
<br>
On March 16, 1988, at Halabja, an Iraqi Kurdish city near Baghdad, the Iraqis and the Iranians both used gas. The Iranians, it seemed, had come to see the advantages of chemical warfare under circumstances advantageous to them - not mustard gas, the persistent agent that the Iraqis used, but non-persistent forms that disorient the enemy but then are quickly dissipated, allowing the human wave attacks to pour through.<br>
<br>
At Halabja the action developed like this. The rebel Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani, facilitated the introduction of Iranian forces into Halabja by night so that the Iraqi commander was unaware of the penetration. In the morning, the Iranians burst from hiding, overwhelmed the Iraqi garrison, and drove it from the city.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi commander, in an attempt to regain possession, called in a chemical barrage (of mustard gas). This had the effect of disconcerting the Iranians, which allowed the Iraqis to regain possession. The Iranians now sprang their surprise, as they dumped a blood agent on the reoccupying Iraqis. <br>
<br>
Mustard gas from the Iraqi side, cyanide-based gas from the Iranian side -- and the citizens of Halabja caught in the middle. Several hundred Kurdish civilians were killed during these successive attacks. <br>
<br>
However, when the Iranians took back the city, they photographed the dead Kurds and subsequently publicized the deaths, making out that Iraqi gas had killed the civilians and denying that they had used gas as well.<br>
<br>
Reporters let into the city to inspect the devastation noted, however, that most of the dead Kurds were blue in their extremities, implying that they had been killed by a blood agent, a chemical that Iraq did not use and, at this time, lacked the capacity to produce. This fact was noted in the press accounts and also by officials of several nongovernmental agencies called to inspect the scene.<br>
<br>
Later, the U.S. government confirmed the fact that both sides had used gas and averred that, in all likelihood, Iranian gas killed the Kurds; however, this new information was not revealed until 1990, so the impression remained in the public mind that the Iraqis alone were responsible for the gassings.<br>

<br>
On the Jim Lehrer News Hour Monday night, you repeated the assertion that Saddam Hussein &quot;gassed his own people.&quot; As the President’s National Security Advisor, I had assumed you of all people would not make such assertions without having supporting evidence. Early this year, on the supposition that the Iraqi situation would blow up again, I made serious inquiries about this charge. On April 7, I sent the following memo to Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If you have better information, Mr. Berger, I hope you can supply it, as this is the most serious of all charges made against Saddam Hussein. The Iraqis readily acknowledge using chemical weapons against Iran a few times late in the war, but using such weapons in wartime is not nearly as serious as &quot;gassing his own people.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
To Senator Helms:<br>
<br>
I continue to make inquiry into the situation in Iraq, as it is likely to brew up into another crisis one of these days when the United Nations has no choice but to conclude that Iraq is not hiding any weapons of mass destruction -- or if they are, they are so well hidden that nobody is going to find them. As you know, I’m sure, the warhawks in the United States will continue to insist that the embargo remain in place no matter what, and there will be assertions from around the world that we have not been acting in good faith. As you also know, I believe there are serious questions regarding our behavior toward Iraq that go back further. You would agree, I think, that at the very least our State Department gave a &quot;green light&quot; to Saddam Hussein to go into Kuwait in August 1990. The more I read of the events of the period, the more I believe history will record that the Gulf War was unnecessary, perhaps even that Saddam Hussein was willing to retreat back to his borders, but our government decided we preferred the war to the status quo ante. <br>
<br>
In my previous correspondence with you on this matter, I had been in a quandary about the state of our relations with Baghdad during that critical period. In the months immediately preceding the &quot;green light&quot; given by our Ambassador, April Glaspie, a number of your Senate colleagues including Bob Dole had traveled to Baghdad, met with Saddam, and found him to be a head of state worthy of support. Even Sen. Howard Metzenbaum [D-OH], a Jewish liberal and staunch supporter of Israel, gave him a seal of approval. What disturbs me even now, Jesse, is that these meetings occurred after the Senate Foreign Relations committee had accused Iraq of using poison gas against its own people, i.e., the Kurds. Like all other Americans, in recent years I had assumed that what I read in the papers was true about Iraq gassing its own people. Once the war drums again began beating last November, I decided to read up on the history, and found Iraq denied having used gas against its own people. Furthermore, I heard that a Pentagon investigation at the time had also turned up no hard evidence of Saddam gassing his own people.<br>
<br>
This is serious stuff, because the United Nations tells us that 1.4 million Iraqi civilians have died as a result of the sanctions, which is three thousand times more than the number of Kurds who supposedly died of gassing at the hands of Saddam. Many of my old Cold Warrior friends practically DEMAND that we not lift the sanctions because if Saddam would gas his own people, he would gas anyone. Now I have come across the 1990 Pentagon report, published just prior to the invasion of Kuwait. Its authors are Stephen C. Pelletiere, Douglas V. Johnson II, and Leif R. Rosenberger, of the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The report is 93 pages, but I append here only the passages having to do with the aforementioned issue: <br>
<br>
Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East<br>
<br>
Excerpt, Chapter 5<br>
<br>
U.S. SECURITY AND IRAQI POWER<br>
<br>
Introduction. Throughout the war the United States practiced a fairly benign policy toward Iraq. Although initially disapproving of the invasion, Washington came slowly over to the side of Baghdad. Both wanted to restore the status quo ante to the Gulf and to reestablish the relative harmony that prevailed there before Khomeini began threatening the regional balance of power. Khomenini’s revolutionary appeal was anathema to both Baghdad and Washington; hence they wanted to get rid of him.<br>
<br>
United by a common interest, Iraq and the United States restored diplomatic relations in 1984, and the United States began to actively assist Iraq in ending the fighting. It mounted Operation Staunch, an attempt to stem the flow of arms to Iran. It also increased its purchases of Iraqi oil while cutting back on Iranian oil purchases, and it urged its allies to do likewise. All this had the effect of repairing relations between the two countries, which had been at a very low ebb.<br>
<br>
In September 1988, however -- a month after the war had ended -- the State Department abruptly, and in what many viewed as a sensational manner, condemned Iraq for allegedly using chemicals against its Kurdish population. The incident cannot be understood without some background of Iraq’s relations with the Kurds. It is beyond the scope of this study to go deeply into this matter; suffice it to say that throughout the war Iraq effectively faced two enemies -- Iran and the elements of its own Kurdish minority. Significant numbers of the Kurds had launched a revolt against Baghdad and in the process teamed up with Tehran. As soon as the war with Iran ended, Iraq announced its determination to crush the Kurdish insurrection. It sent Republican Guards to the Kurdish area, and in the course of this operation -- according to the U.S. State Department -- gas was used, with the result that numerous Kurdish civilians were killed. The Iraqi government denied that any such gassing had occurred. Nonetheless, Secretary of State Schultz stood by U.S. accusations, and the U.S. Congress, acting on its own, sought to impose economic sanctions on Baghdad as a violator of the Kurds’ human rights.<br>
<br>
Having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us, we find it impossible to confirm the State Department’s claim that gas was used in this instance. To begin with there were never any victims produced. International relief organizations who examined the Kurds -- in Turkey where they had gone for asylum -- failed to discover any. Nor were there ever any found inside Iraq. The claim rests solely on testimony of the Kurds who had crossed the border into Turkey, where they were interviewed by staffers of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<br>
<br>
We would have expected, in a matter as serious as this, that the Congress would have exercised some care. However, passage of the sanctions measure through the Congress was unusually swift -- at least in the Senate where a unanimous vote was secured within 24 hours. Further, the proposed sanctions were quite draconian (and will be discussed in detail below). Fortunately for the future of Iraqi-U.S. ties, the sanctions measure failed to pass on a bureaucratic technicality (it was attached as a rider to a bill that died before adjournment).<br>
<br>
It appears that in seeking to punish Iraq, the Congress was influenced by another incident that occurred five months earlier in another Iraqi-Kurdish city, Halabjah. In March 1988, the Kurds at Halabjah were bombarded with chemical weapons, producing a great many deaths. Photographs of the Kurdish victims were widely disseminated in the international media. Iraq was blamed for the Halabjah attack, even though it was subsequently brought out that Iran too had used chemicals in this operation, and it seemed likely that it was the Iranian bombardment that had actually killed the Kurds.<br>
<br>
Thus, in our view, the Congress acted more on the basis of emotionalism than factual information, and without sufficient thought for the adverse diplomatic effects of its action. As a result of the outcome of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq is now the most powerful state in the Persian Gulf, an area in which we have vital interests. To maintain an uninterrupted flow of oil from the Gulf to the West, we need to develop good working relations with all of the Gulf states, and particularly with Iraq, the strongest. <br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
I wonder, Senator, had you ever read this material? The entire report is worth reading, as a matter of fact, because of its credibility on the threshold of the Iraqi invasion. The authors are quite emphatic, by the way, in stating that Iraq was struggling for its financial survival at this point -- because of its debts from the Iranian war, and the decline of the world oil price. That is, they did not believe Iraq would have expansionist designs in the Middle East for years to come, given how financially flattened they had been. <br>
<br>
It does seem to me that if Congress did act more on the basis of emotionalism than factual information, it may have contributed substantially to the economic distress of our ally in the war with Iran. That is, by squeezing Saddam with sanctions that included a cutoff of IMF assistance, it thrust Saddam into the confrontation he had with the Emir of Kuwait over oil fields and better port access to the Gulf that the Iraqis claimed going back to World War I. <br>
<br>
The more I pull on this piece of string, the more I believe you should commit resources of the Foreign Relations Committee to a review of this history. In this period, the Democrats did have control of Congress and another senator chaired Foreign Relations. It could be that a different viewpoint at a distance of time would enable even slight adjustments of policy. It is now a season where everyone is asking for apologies of events that occurred generations ago, even hundreds of years ago. We should deal today with those issues which could grow tomorrow into embarrassments for which our grandchildren will have to apologize. Meanwhile, I’ll continue to keep you informed as I collect this Iraqi ball of string.<br>

The war was supported?  By whom?  Blair supported it based on his own intelligence reports.  (I can post yet another link to his own speech to parliament, but you won't read it anyway)  The French, Russian and Chinese didn't support because they stood to loose a lot of lucrative developments, and tied up the UN in vetoes and calls for &quot;more time&quot;.  The allies we had believed the evidence, and it's there for all to see.  They broke the sanctions of the United Nations (hello Tapeworm of the World.. you should support those sanctions as just if you're the citizen you claim to be)<br>

<br>
No, you're anti American because you're a paranoid fuck, Tapeworm.  The reason given was that he ignored the UN sanctions.  They demonstrated his ability to make WMD's before the sanctions, and the fact the facilities and acquisitions made by that government AFTER the sanctions did not in fact LESSEN as was demanded by the UN, but instead increased.  Demanding immediate answers is als unreasonable and in fact, retarded as fuck.  The fact that they got rid of a goddamned monster is just icing on the cake.<br>

Nuffa that.  Why is it that throughout this, your kind sits and puts the deaths caused by UN sanctions (NOT the US), at the feet of the US?

<br>
Now, when it comes to believeing the CIA who has feet on the ground and eyes in the feild or an administration sitting on their ass in DC who pressured them to give the answers they wanted and when the CIA refused to fudge facts, went out and created their own &quot;intelligence&quot; group to tell them what they wanted to hear.... I'll go with the CIA thank you.<br>
<br>
And I could care less that you disregard my material or call me a tapeworm, because almost anything is better than being a mindless borg like you who is desperate to make a broke down, has been dictator worse than he really was to justify your warmongering hero's actions. I can admit Saddam was a ruthless dictator who maintained his rule with an iron fist, but unlike you I don't need to fudge the facts to make him into some mini-Hitler.<br>
<br>
Saddam is what he is and the US did what it did. Put it on the scales and it doesn't balance out in my book. <p><br><br><br>

<br>
What exactly is your point?<br>
<br>
What do you suggest is done?<br>
<br>
The US still hasn't come up with the smoking gun after 2 months so you hop on one side of the fence or the other, either way it makes you just as much of a mindless borg as anyone on the other side of the fence Loegan.<br>
<br>
I'm not wasting hours of time in front of a computer quoting every fucking line of your symantics, because you can't disprove anything, all you can do is give your own bull shit spin on it.<br>
<br>
To even SUGGEST that any of those things you tried to disprove up there was false just shows you are either<br>
A) misinformed<br>
B) Biased<br>
C) Retarded<br>
D) All of the above<br>
<br>
You freely admit that you are biased against Bush, and this proves a great way for you to drag him around in the dirt for a while.  Have fun dude I don't care for him much either but I'm not pee brained enough to drag the American moral high ground in the dirt behind him.<br>
<br>
You and Sashanna can go get a room somewhere and dream of the world rallying to topple President Bush all you want, it's not going to change the fact that noone in the world can say without a doubt that there was WMD or wasn't...exept George Bush and Saddam Hussien...2 people who niether side will believe.  <br>
<br>
Either they find it or they don't.  Doesn't prove or disprove anything if they don't.  If they do then that's a bonus for the Coalition. This is a fact, a certainty, something derived completely from unbiased logic. Something you either do not posess, or do not understand.<br>
<br>
So keep whining about it and maybe it will change that.<br>

Au contraire moronic fuckwit.  A Tapeworm is a parasite that lives inside it's host, slowly sucking life and corrupting it.  You too gain this illustrious title if you live in the US and truck with the tinfoil wearing conspiracy theorists who rail against the US, provide NO solutions but their pathetic mewling and live here, making a comfortable living off the country or government they so hate.<br>
<br>
Disagreeing with the government is one thing, but sitting in your American home cheering the vomitous maggot that butchered thousands of his own people (NOT counting the ambiguous number gassed (according to Tapeworm Loegan), is something that qualifies you as a parasite.<br>
<br>
Why punch holes in your facts.  I didn't say I agreed with Ranna fuckwit.  I said &quot;good post&quot; meaning it wasn't filled with paranoia.  Why refute your historical facts when I know they're true?  You may also be a Tapeworm, but I don't have to sit there and point out your anonymous or questionable facts.<br>
<br>
Take Loegan the halfwit for instance.<br>
<br>
He goes on and on about how the US had concrete evidence of Nukes, but wouldn't reveal their sources of intelligence, but then he vapidly sits and uses an ex CIA person as &quot;proof&quot; (as if his word alone is gospel), and shows an article rife with anonymous &quot;sources&quot;.  He does that bullshit, and you just throw out 200+ years of history, as if Bush or Powell were currently responsible for Slavery.  Big difference, but still amounts to the same smelly heap of useless pigshit.<br>

See here in the US since right after the Golden Era that Merton loves to refer to so much (the 50s), we have had a set of Laws that were put in place that guarantee every one Basic human AND civil rights.  <br>
<br>
Slavery??, please....how the fuck does that have anything to do with Iraq?  At least try to stick on topic Merton.<br>
<br>
Hey you know what...back in 3100 B.C. there was this Caveman who was a Tribal Leader in the US who savagely raped and pillaged every town in America...so America doesn't have any right to say that what Saddam was doing was wrong damn you!<br>
<br>
Why do you think problems like what is going on in Isreal right now exist?  I think it's because of ignorant fucks like Merton that have to constantly drudge up the sins of the father but are unwilling to look at the world they live in and make sound judgements without the bias of the past clouding what should be simple.<br>
<br>
Is there Slavery in the US today Merton?<br>
<br>
Are Japanese people being held in interrogation camps today Merton?<br>
<br>
Did someone tell you recently that you couldn't Golf in thier club because of your yellow belly?<br>
<br>
I am a white american and I don't owe anyone shit for any of that stuff, niether me, nor my anscestors had anything to do with it, and even if they did it wouldn't make it my problem to answer for.<br>
<br>
And trying to sully the image of the current administration by somehow tying them into these past misjudgements is just as ignorant, inflammatory, and wrong. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 2565<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/03 5:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Actually, Loegan is and has been providing solutions.

I want you to point out a single quote where any of the posters here cheered Saddam on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He goes on and on about how the US had concrete evidence of Nukes, but wouldn't reveal their sources of intelligence, but then he vapidly sits and uses an ex CIA person as &quot;proof&quot; (as if his word alone is gospel), and shows an article rife with anonymous &quot;sources&quot;. He does that bullshit, and you just throw out 200+ years of history, as if Bush or Powell were currently responsible for Slavery. Big difference, but still amounts to the same smelly heap of useless pigshit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And you discount historical precedent, as if it was irrelevant.  The crux of the issue is that Loegan is right.  No one is contesting that Saddam is a bad guy, and no one is contesting the fact that he had WMD's at some point and probably did before the war.  What they are contesting is that the war was presented and sold to the American public on a lie.  If American secret intelligence was so good that they could present photos and data of WMD locations at the UNSC, why isn't that intelligence being used anymore to find those WMD's?    You mean Saddam could magically hide and destroy tons and tons of <br>
biological and chemical agents in mere weeks without a trace and these surveillance satellites couldn't find any evidence of where those WMD's were being moved or where they were destroyed?  You got played for a fool and you probably realize it, but nobody wants to be proven wrong - which is why you so vehemently defend it despite evidence to the contrary.  If you don't think that American government would lie to further its agenda, I got 3 words for you:  Gulf of Tonkin<br>
<br>
Who sold the WMD's to Iraq?  USA<br>
Who gave him the green light to attack Kuwait?  USA<br>
Who encouraged Saddam to keep fighting Iran?  USA<br>
<br>
And now you're trying to play the role of the righteous man?  How ironic... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dextromethorphanhydrobromide>DextroMethorphan hydrobromide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/03 6:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> la</span><hr size=1> &quot;Naturally the common people don't want war, neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany.

That was the claim.  You can argue that US isn't committing any human rights violations right this very moment, but that doesn't mean its not capable of it, as shown by historical precedent.

Heh.. as for your right to bitch, that's why I'm here too maggot.  I'm here to see your &quot;Lessons of history&quot; bullshit, and Loegan's Conspiracy Theory shite exposed for what it is.  Inflammatory and useless rhetoric, designed to evoke fear and distrust of the government.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guess what?  I didn't vote for Bush, nor do I care for his politics, but that doesn't mean I think he's &quot;Out to get me&quot;.  Guess what?  He's in for 4 fucking years and then someone else gets in.   He's not going to have a chance to do much more &quot;getting us&quot; or being &quot;out for himself&quot; before there will be someone else to hate.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of his policies, including Homeland security are a problem, and I'd even discuss them.  Would I quote my CIA sources or talk about how the US has a history of keeping slaves to get my point across?  Don't think so, though I might try one of your keen silver hats on.<br>
<br>
Also, I personally view every maggot here that thinks Saddam should still be in power OR thinks that his removal was a bad thing is in effect cheering him on.  That is, of course my own view, and that of Tapeworms may vary.<br>
<br>
Gulf of Tonkin.  More l33t history!  Woo Hoo.  The &quot;lie that launched Viet Nam&quot;.  Hey.. wasn't the President about 18 then?  Maybe he heard of that shit and it corrupted him to make him the monster he is today.  Wow.  Food for thought..  IF you're an old fart with nothing better to do than believe that evil and corruption somehow pass from President to President like cooties.<br>
<br>
The only thing Loegan is right about is the Government Mind Control Rays.  They invented them in 1842 and made all us White Folks hate the Colored Folks.   Turned the whole dang government into a bunch of twisted and evil fucks who do evil shit like liberate people who've suffered at the hands of a madman for decades.<br>
<br>
I'm playing the role of the guy that thinks you're a pathetic old monkeyfuck with nothing better to do but spout off your scary bullshit in hopes that everyone ELSE will rise up and fix your problem.  What does YOUR chubby ass do to fix any of the shit you're complaining about.  Oh yeah.  You play EQ and post here.  Wow.  Now I'm confident I'm making a difference.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
Shuddup already you fucking old geezer.  Cuddle in close to Loegan and keep sucking the teat of American Comfort.  Sick fucks.<br>
