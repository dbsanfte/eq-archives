Since I would say mid-summer of this year my interest in EQ has been weigning down. Perhaps I was being an asshole at times ( to all those that talked to me on a regular basis, was i?), but I had no part in stealing items intentionally or master looting and never to be seen again.<br>
<br>
For the character forsetti,here is what &quot;went down&quot;. Near the end of my playing EQ my friend Hadina was trying to get back his original account because he had sold it to the player formally known as Mailaki. Through talking with customer service, he was able to obtain it and proceeded to log on. Unknown to hadina, there was a 51 cleric on that account named forsetti, also a few minor characters but nothing serious. He also started to get tells from Mailaki, asking why the hell he just lost his account. I dont know what exactly went on between the two but after a few days Hadina's account got cancelled. I had noticed because I was trying to log on his account to help him transfer a few items from the account he had hadina on. Being a friend I temporarily put the account in my name to keep it alive, and phoned Hadina. He told me he'd just give me the money for the account every month, sounded reasonable enough to me. For kicks once in a while I would log on the half naked cleric and just res random people. Then around mid-august when I was trying to log in I got the message &quot;password and username invalid bla bla bla the perky lot&quot;.  Alright, so maybe hadina changed the account, maybe Mailaki took it back for himself, no clue. By this time I had not talked to hadina for a bit because both our schedules were rather busy so I just let it be. I assumed he wasn't being played anymore after a while because i had him on my friends list and just never saw him. <br>
FLASH! Yesterday, hadina comes up to me in school and says &quot;hey, you know you made the shittiest player's of the tribunal list. yeah hadina, dorbin, and even reathorns up there with alexandr and other POS's.&quot; .. needless to say thats why im here.<br>
<br>
whatever transcribed between Forsetti and whoever else it affected I would like to apologize for being reckless with an account. I really shoudnt have even taken it under my wing but whatever too late to change the past.<br>
<br>
As for dorbin, I havent played him in almost a year because around 8 or 9 months ago he got bind killed from level 54-40 in about an hour in oggok. Gm's wouldnt give levels back to me, said fuck this, im outta here. if at all ive used him for a few ports here and there.<br>
<br>
For reathorn, a few occasions I went link dead while master looter, but all I had was 80 pp gems on me and even then not that much. Once or twice I had an item and made sure whoever won it got the item back.<br>
<br>
For the record, Mitri isnt even my character so I really dont know how he got combined with me. <br>
<br>
I was really disappointed to see my name on the tribunal shitty players list. I have been a part of this server since about 5 months after It got released and have gotten to know many people. For whoever said I pretend I got hacked to keep the items is so loaded that it's not even funny. During the summer once I did get hacked I will admit but you know I lost almost all of reathorns equipment, and out of those only 2 pieces were other people's and i felt bad as it is, let alone have it broadcasted all over as if I did this pre-meditatively.<br>
<br>
As to my friends, I have a new character I play once in a while, his names snurkins and hes a level 5 magician, (wow shows how much time  I play now) anyway if ya know me give me a ring sometime. <br>
<br>
I'm just posting this so that if luclin is addictive and I start back up reathorn or dorbin I wont get spammed with tells accusing me of some garbage or another. This forum gives you the right to speak your mind , I'd prefer it was done not on rumors. <br>

<br>
I will say that I have heard something of this before. I recieved an e-mail from a friend of yours, maybe the guy you ran into at school. He asked me to remove your name considering the fact that it was your roommate who had the characters Mitri and Forsetti.<br>
<br>
I considered it, but then I came to the conclusion that 1)Being his roommate, you would know about some of his low actions &amp; that 2) he would have access to your characters.<br>
<br>
It seemed best to keep your name up their, for know &amp; supporting his deeds &amp; the fact that he could use your character for them.<br>
<br>
I do want to know what people who know of you say about this. I will consider removing you from the shit list depending on what results from this thread. <p><BR>

<br>
He's never scammed people, he has a terrible computer and goes linkdead a lot, but never intentionally with loot. When it's happened, it was never anything big anyway. <br>
<br>
The account with Dorbin and Reathorn on it got hacked a LOT, because of weird in game girlfriends that he had who kept getting hold of his password.<br>
<br>
As for me, I didn't SELL the account to Mailaki. We were both in Diamond Circle together, and I gave him it to him sometime during late 1999 or early 2000, I don't really remember. On friends accounts I saw him powerleveling up a cleric named Forsetti, whether for his own use or a friend I don't know. I started playing a shaman named Hadina on another friend's account, and got sucked back into EQ for 54 more levels.<br>
<br>
After having quit for a while, during summer of 2001 I had a desire to play my level 36 ranger, Udail, again. I emailed the address that I had contacted Mailaki on a year and a half ago asking if he was still using the account. Never got a response, and never saw Forsetti or Mailaki playing EQ. I hadn't seen Forsetti on in about a year at that point. I knew Mailaki had been playing Hodur, but assumed that was on his normal account with the paladin Mailaki. <br>
<br>
I used the password reset page on station.com to gimp my account back since Mailaki never responded. Upon logging in, my beloved ranger was gone and there were some low level characters and a 51 cleric named, what else, Forsetti. He had some crappy gear excluding the chetari ward staff, and was a member of Sol Invictus. I made a ranger named Mitri and PLed him up to like 25, where I got really bored and quit EQ again. <br>
<br>
Reathorn also had access to the account and played Forsetti occasionally, but didn't really act like a dick or anything unusual. <br>
<br>
I knew that what I was doing was quite possibly going to piss some people off very much, but I felt like doing it so I did. Yeah I'm a cocksucker, oh well. Had I seen that Forsetti ever played the game, I wouldn't have done it. I suspect he was probably just being used as a rez gimp.<br>
<br>
If it makes you feel any better, upon trying to reactivate my primary account, which had Hadina the level 54 shaman on it, I found that it had been hacked and the password changed, so I couldn't access it. I used the password reset tool, but the info was sent to my friend's, the original account holder, email address. This kid joined the Navy and I have no idea how to contact him at this point. <br>
<br>
So in conclusion, Dorbin / Reathorn is a good guy and doesn't dick people over, but I am an asshole and do fuck with people. Unfortunately I got fucked with too, so in the end, everything evens out. Except for the guy who played Forsetti, I guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www228.pair.com/judygale/Gsmile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 459<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/28/01 7:35:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.diveshack.com/images/nuke%202.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /</span><hr size=1> I grouped with Reathorn on several occasions and never had any problems with him.<br>

BTW, Ladida, the friend that sent you an email was a mutual friend of both mine and Dorbins...I told him about the list, and he took it upon himself to write you in D's defense.  I perhaps should have done the same thing, as I was shocked to see him up there myself, but for whatever reason I didn't.  I'm making up for it now, hopefully.  <br>

<br>
Hey, Hadina, I think Kreese was referring to this statement made by Reathorn. He can read &amp; interpret, he just might have believed your friends statement more than yours.<br>
<br>
The way I see things, is that we had an asshole &amp; a nice guy as roommates. The asshole had control of the nice guys character &amp; that is the reason the nice guys character is on the list.<br>
<br>
The fact that they are on different accounts is irrelevant. I put up all the characters that the asshole as access too.<br>
<br>
However, Dorbin seems like a nice guy. And this does seem unfair to have his character tainted just cause he roomed or rooms with an ass.<br>
<br>
I do want to hear from the 2 people I named earlier, but I imagine I will take his name off. Till then, I wish all of you to refer to me as King Solomon &amp; comment on my wise &amp; just rulings &amp; large member. <p><BR>

I tried to read the whole soap opera that Dorbin described as his history of his accout. =)  I didn't have the energy to follow it all. =)<br>
<br>
When I first learned that Forsetti was an Alt of Dorbin, I was very surprised.  I've known Dorbin in passing, and though he's one to cause trouble with the women on our server he wasn't known to be of the untrustworthy sort.  In my search for Forsetti, many people I came across would agree with my opinion on Dorbin.<br>
<br>
As for as a resolution to this matter....<br>
<br>
I'd suggest that Dorbin find out whomever was playing his account at the time (it may be figured out already in his above explaination), and Forsetti's name be replaced with the real scumbag's name.<br>
<br>
Also, I think restitution should be given to those affected.  Unfortunately I can't remember all those affected, I do know that Diamondeye is out one Lam.  So, I personally would be satisfied if Diamondeye was presented with a Lam.  A Lam isn't all that great these days, but on the day that this happened, DE was needing to obtain one.<br>
<br>
As for people saying he pretended to be hacked, in order to not turn over items.  I'm not involved in those accusations.<br>
<br>
Ladida: Your idea of having that thread rocks.  If it helps to resolve these issues that the GMs so easily fail at doing. /bow  Thanks <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udorraxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorraxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://drakksnet.homestead.com/files/Ghost.gif height=50 width=60" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/30/01 7:56:25 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MY KING!</span><hr size=1> Why do Daeja's posts always give me that special feeling?.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><hr size=5, width="55%">
