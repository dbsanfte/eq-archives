<br>
Frozen in mid step, Kalelce cringes as the squeaky floorboard protests.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Sneaking down the hallway in the sisters guildhall is not so easy.  Good think Kivrin is asleep&quot;<br>
<br>
SNNOORRRKKK<br>
<br>
Kivrin's snore, two rooms away sound like a tundra mammoth calling to her calf.<br>
<br>
Kalelce moves his foot to another spot and continues down the hall.  He finds the room he's looking for, and slips inside, silently closing the latch.<br>
<br>
THUD!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;Marr!&quot;, Kalelce mutters under his breath as he stubs his toe on something in the dark.  Fortunately the accident occurred in the middle of another one of Kivrin?s deep snores.<br>
<br>
Kalelce fumbles around in the dark until he finds the boots.  Taking a jar from his pack, he opens it up, and takes a deep sniff.  &quot;Ah! just right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pulling out the final pickle, he begins to munch.  Next he pours the remaining juices, into each boot.  Just enough to thoroughly soak the bottom.  He then replaces the jar in his pack, and returns the boots.  Kalelce decides to take a quicker exit, and opens the nearby window. <br>
<br>
&quot;Arania will be surprised!&quot;, Kalelce giggles before falling out the window, landing flat on the ground with a resounding &quot;OAF!&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
Kivrin lay facedown in bed next to Jorrick, pressing a pillow tightly over her head in an effort to block out the sounds coming from her husband’s mouth. It was a vain attempt, she knew, but as she buried her face deeper into the mattress she thought to herself that at the very least the lack of oxygen reaching her brain might make her pass out. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Tunare, I just want to sleep!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
SNOORRKKK<br>
<br>
Kivrin sighed as she flung the pillow away. Jorrick had a cold – <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> a cold, of all things!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> – and had spent the last three nights tossing and turning and snoring fitfully in his sleep. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Grrr,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself, turning onto her back. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> At least he CAN sleep.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
 She had tried everything she could think of to get him to stop snoring, and nothing – not even her ability to cure disease – had helped. She sighed again. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Maybe Mirabor or Kerys can make a potion that will help.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She made a mental note to herself to talk to them first thing in the  morning. <br>
<br>
SNOOOORRRKK<br>
<br>
She sat up and leaned over him, staring him in the face, as she silently willed him to stop snoring. She was suddenly struck by how handsome he was, and a feeling of giddiness rushed over her as she reached out her hand and lightly caressed his cheek. She smiled down at him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> My husband.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The thought was immediately followed by another: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hmm…I wonder what would happen if I...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She pinched Jorrick’s nostrils shut with her fingers, then waited, curious. He took a deep breath, then started to cough, violently. Quickly, she drew her hand away and suddenly felt very mean. As quietly as possible, so as not to wake him, she slipped out of bed and tiptoed across the room, holding her breath. Several minutes passed before she heard his slow rhythmic breathing, and she threw her arms up in the air in a silent gesture of triumph. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yes! It worked! I can finally sleep!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“You…what…” Jorrick mumbled, turning to his side. Kivrin gasped. “He speaks!” She ran back to the bed and knelt by his side, waiting with bated breath for him to proclaim his love to her. She placed her hand on his chest and nodded, waiting. Standing up slightly, she leaned over and pressed her ear closer to his mouth, and quietly whispered, “Yes my love?”<br>
<br>
SNOOORRRRKKK<br>
<br>
“Argghhh!” She backed away from the bed, fumbling for her robe. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Maybe I should just take a walk</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she thought dejectedly, when suddenly, she heard a male voice emit a low but perceptible grunt right outside her window. She ran to the window just in time to see a barbarian scurrying away into the night. Frowning, she silently strode across the room, flung open the door, and stepped out into the hallway. She stood there listening for a moment, and, hearing no other sounds, slowly made her way to the top of the stairs. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Who was that? Is someone trying to threaten one of the sisters?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Suddenly, she stopped. There was a whiff of something in the air…the scent of…she sniffed again, and shook her head. “What is that smell?” she muttered. “Why…it’s coming from Arania’s room!” Suddenly it dawned on her. “Pickles!” <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  A barbarian…pickles…it could only have been Kalelce, </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought. Her frown grew deeper, and she chewed on her lower lip as she contemplated the meaning of what she had seen. What was Kalelce doing in Arania’s room, so late at night? And why did he sneak out of her window? Why didn’t he just use the front door? <br>
<br>
Kivrin gasped. “Why, it can only mean one thing,” she whispered. “Arania and Kalelce are planning a surprise for Mirabor!” Humming happily to herself, she ran down the stairs and into the kitchen. She suddenly had a craving for pickles. <br>
