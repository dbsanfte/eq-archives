You state in the title you are showing respect to our server's computer stolen thread but in that entire episode, which involved real life items by the way, Bowynn never endorsed the posting of real life info so a bunch of retarded messageboard geeks could get thier jollies crank calling her or her employers. That fact that your server does is the strongest evidence yet that EQ is in serious need of a moron enema.<br>
<br>
You all sound like a bunch of pussies screaming that someone stole your guild's manna robe! Fine, complain and bitch and put pressure on the evil thief in game; but to condone posting real life info so you can pester him outside a video game? I've never said this to anyone that plays EQ before, but man your server has people that are in serious need of a life.<br>
<br>
Sorry to spoil your servers ~pwned!ness jerkathon d00d, but your handling of that situation doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as Bowynn's computer was stolen discussion. Go back to Fagaelle if you want to cry about stolen pixels, we have our own manna robe thieves to crucify. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

<br>
It forces the individual to act in a fashion they would act face to face, or at least thins the line between face to face and hiding behind a computer screen.<br>
<br>
People should be held accountable for their actions.  The whole anonymity of the internet sucks, in my opinion.  Many of the people who are assholes or spew forth shit at every turn would not do the same face to face.  They only do it because there is no consequence when they turn off that computer screen.  Every action should have a consequence for the individual that performs that action.  When consequences can be shut off with the press of a button or the pulling of a plug, you enter dangerous territory.  Stealing someone's mana robe is a minor example.  The concept spans a wide range of actions not only limited to EQ.<br>
<br>
Then again, some believe in a hard line between RL and &quot;on the computer&quot; as something that shouldn't be crossed.<br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
Also, people need to stop calling RL names, addresses and phone numbers &quot;personal information.&quot;  It's all PUBLIC information.  Your name, address, and phone number will be sold, traded, and tossed around tens of thousands of times throughout your life.  Nothing you can do about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 539<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/02 12:30:53 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~jakecj7/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> There are consequences to everything you do on the internet and in EQ. But those consequences should stay relative to the internet and EQ. <br>
<br>
If some person from AT&amp;T calls you every night getting you to switch to AT&amp;T long distance do you finally go bezerk, find her name and address and post them to every messageboard you can find? &quot;Hey everyone! This bitch is bothering me at home, let's all call her!&quot; As funny as that sounds I hope you can see that it is crossing the line.<br>
<br>
You go to a pickup soccor, hocky, or tag football game with some people you don't know at a local park. They tell you their first names but aren't about to let you know their life story. Well, your whole team is fucking around, pissing someone off, not playing by the rules, whatever... and the guy who owns one of the footballs flips out and says, &quot;Fuck this I'm taking my ball and going home&quot;. Do you think it's appropriate to follow him to his house then kick his ass? Then when every new person comes to play you tell them about this asshole you dont like and hand them a piece of paper with his phone number on it and encourage others to go pay him a visit? No, the appropriate consequence for that situation is just don't play with the guy anymore since you don't agree to play the game the same way.<br>
<br>
See Rynnia, you are one of those people who takes this game (and it is a game, you know) way too seriously. Your first reaction if someone wrongs you or doesn't play the game the same way you do is to look them up and find out where they live. That's seriously obsessive behavior man. And scarily enough there are even more fucked up people then you that play EQ and they would actually act on that real life information if it was posted somewhere.<br>
<br>
EQ IS NOT YOUR LIFE! Think of it as a pickup football game in the park. If someone steals your football, report them to the police or go pay them a visit yourself if it bothers you that much. But posting &quot;Soandso stole our football and this is where he lives!&quot; on a messageboard for other fucking retards to see is probably the most pussy thing I can think of doing.<br>
<br>
Even the police don't release personal info on convicted felons and for good reason. Sure that information may be available through public means, but there's a huge difference between publically available information and taking out a full page add in the New York Times because someone stole your pixels. If you can't see the difference Rynnia then there is something very wrong with how you view society and modern day sociological values.<br>

Blasphemy!!!!  EQ IS LIFE.  EQ surrounds us, flows through us, and binds us.   Through EQ you will be able to see old friends, see things in the past, and see the future..<br>

I'm not sure if you read through the entire post, but this guy is no joke. Normally I'd agree that the annoymity of EQ permits people to act in a way they might not ordinarily act in RL when faced with a similar incident. <br>
<br>
But this guy is not only malicious, and vindictive in the game, but equally as disturbed in RL. I mean he not only robbed his guild of their entire funds, causing a lot of anger and fury with the members of that community, but he also was involved with a RL computer scam 10 years ago when he was a high school student, that ripped off nearly 36 thousand dollars. He wasn't found guilty of the charges, but his name was still publically announced as one of the suspects. And all this information was posted on those messageboards, along with his address, phone number, employer, even his picture. <br>
<br>
And this guy was not to be taken lightly. He was dead serious not only in his threats to his online ex-guildmates about what he'd do to their stuff if they kept pushing him, but he swore &quot;with every fiber in my body&quot; that he would defend himself if anyone tried to track him down. He said he would be &quot;amazed and dissapointed&quot; at the same time if someone came to his apartment complex (which they also posted the info for) and tried to mess with him. He warned that he was armed and swore that someone would die if he was attacked. I mean the people on that board took things way to far. <br>
<br>
This guy is uncaring, unfeeling, malicious, and mentally unstable. And the people wanted blood. He doesn't need stalkers and enemies, he needs therapy. We always talk about two wrongs not making a right and this was a clear case of that. And I agree that you deal with issues in the realm where they originated from. I mean this guy might easily have been a convicted felon, but in the realm of EQ, he's just an un-sportsman. It's important to make that distinction. <br>
<br>
None of his other shady history would ever have been brought into play if everyone (including those people who weren't even involved) treated EQ for what it is; a game. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162713" target="_blank"><b>Croneus Titanis</b></a><Br>

<br>
As far as the analogies they are off base and irrelevant.   Someone stealing a football has nothing to do with online activity.  I would fully understand if a person who acted in the fashion which you illustrate was deemed &quot;unstable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Online staying online and RL staying RL is a noble concept, but as realistic as expecting people to play by the rules set forth in a consequenceless society.  Sure there's a line between the two, to some extent, but it's dotted and far from solid.  Slandering someone online should have the same consequences as slandering someone in real life.  Stealing from an individual or group online should have the same consequences as stealing from a group or individual in real life.   All that separates on online community (and I use the term loosely) from a real life community is that little wire.<br>
<br>
Have I looked up people's RL info?  Yeah.  How long does it take?  5 minutes.   Have I posted RL info?  Yep.  Why?  One was a liar to the point it was getting obnoxious, and they had given me enough grief in the past, accusing me of doing what they were doing themselves.   One was a con artist, ripping people off for large amounts of money.  The posting of their RL info was limited to a messageboard devoted to tracking down this individual, so that people could pursue the person to get their money back.<br>
<br>
Sick?  Obsessive?  I'd agree with ya were I posting RL info left and right, or if anyone who wronged me online I  instantly ran off to pull up their precious secret information.  I don't  : )  My personal feelings on the matter is that it is a sick mentality wanting and or needing that line to be there.  Wanting or needing for an escape.  Wanting or needing an alternate reality which does not blend with real life.  Sure, EQ is a game.  A game which people play in their spare time in real life.   Sure, the internet is a tool.  A tool which people use in real life.  This isn't Mr. Roger's Neigborhood land of make believe here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 754<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/02 4:16:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> &quot;If some person from AT&amp;T calls you every night getting you to switch to AT&amp;T long distance do you finally go bezerk, find her name and address and post them to<br>

<br>
Yeah that'd be a great solution.  It's not crossing the line, assuming you asked for her to stop and she did not.  Why, if I was the one being called in this situation, should I have to be the one to be inconvenienced in this matter? Alot easier to toss it right back at her, rather than endure continuing unwelcome phone calls.  Do you realize how difficult it is to get this kind of shit to stop if it is happening?   You can change your phone number, which is a MAJOR inconvenience and costs money.  You can get the police involved, and they certainly have better things to do with their time.  Going this route will take you damn near forever as well.<br>
<br>
Making a quick post takes all of a minute, and problem solved.<br>
<br>
Or you can just deal with the phone calls for as long as she wishes to keep calling you, wasting your time.

<br>
Anyway, I'm pretty confused on how you missed the football reference.  <br>
<br>
There is a line much thicker than CAT 5 separating RL from EQ.  If you dug up my PERSONAL INFORMATION and posted it for everyone to teach me a lesson, you would be the first person i would invite over to my house to 'chat' about it.  Hey with all this new Online Legislation flying out of senators asses i might be able to sue you for the cost of changing phone lines and finding a new place to live, basically relocating my life, if the harassment was too much.  I'd have  a pretty good case if there is a post with your name on it directing everyone where to go.  Or maybe i'd just post yours up and continue the little pussy game.<br>
<br>
as far as i'm concerned, if i'm on an EQ board, it involves my EQ experience.  I dont come here and talk to everyone about my work day or how the kids are.  If you would look there is a SINGLE SPECIFIC forum for Real Life chatting.  Why would that be necessary if you are correct in you view of online interaction?  In game, /OOC.  hmm....granted everyone thinks that /shout does the same thing.  <br>
<br>
You're a wonderful case for why single player games are still very popular. <p><i>There is not to reason why, there is but to do and die.</i><p>

<br>
You compare online items to real life items because you made your money that way for a year or two with you and your guild's ebay franchise ( so much so that SI had to have a no ebay clause ), so its understandable how you do not see a difference.<br>
<br>
The sad part is, you also ratted on all your customers to keep playing, you gave their information to VI in exchange to keep your characters. Not only were you guilty of doing it, when the ship was going down, you were pushing people into danger so you could get to safety. That is what makes you a very fucked up person.<br>
<br>
You talk alot about people being more brave because they are anonymous ( behind the screen ), but you yourself are also taking advantage of this, you post real life info of others, without posting your own, making the charge, that if someone really wanted to find out it would be easy, well what I am saying, if you think its okay to post someone else's info, why not post your own at the same time, your phone number, your address, your work number, I mean if you believe so truely that this isnt personal information, please share it with us.<br>
<br>
You do know, you can also can do a search for Social Security Numbers right? So if I can find that publically, why not post that also,and your drivers license number, thats public information......I urge you to do so, show us all how brave you are. How you dont hide behind your screen. <br>
<br>
You believe this to be &quot;public knowledge&quot; so its okay to share it, but I consider it personal information going to people I dont know, nor do I want to know, what you do is cross the line and seek the information, and more so, post it, twice, in order to get retribution. How would you feel if you posted some information that got some injured or killed? Its okay though right, because &quot;Anyone&quot; can find it, but the rub is not &quot;Anyone&quot; is posting it, you are, so you are responsible for any reprecussations taken from your irresponsible act.<br>
<br>
You might not have actually commited the crime, you helped it happen. The places that you get your information from arent posting, they will produce results for a search for those who go looking, but there is a huge difference for those who actually put the information in a public area in order to get retribution. You are basically putting a virtual contract out on the people whose personal info you post.<br>
<br>
I will give you one final example, a guy goes to war, leaves his wife and children, a person with a grudge decides to look up his wedding certificate, then does a search for matching names, and then cities, and this same person then posts that information say on a site that frequented by the Taliban, to which the Taliban orders a sleeper agent in the US to kill or kidnap the family, you are telling me, if you were the person who did the search and posted the info you wouldnt feel any guilt whatsoever for the reprecussions of your foolish actions?<br>
If you believe that this personal information you feel so ready to post cannot be used to terrible ends, then you are more foolish then I ever thought. You also had a hand in that act happening by helping it happen.<br>
<br>
Yes you can argue its a stretch, but so was the idea that terrorists might take planes and plow them through buildings, but when it happened it became a grim reality.<br>

I always appreciate when someone of your intellectual stature consults his personal library of Star Wars Films, &quot;Highlights for Children&quot; magazines, and &quot;He-Man&quot; Coloring Books to convey a gem of wisdom for all of us here in this online community to marvel at.<br>
<br>
In regards to the separation of EQ and reality, I must say that I feel that there is a parallel between the way one acts in real-life, and the way one acts over the internet.  Rather, one's character is the same in-person as it is over the internet, while a real-life conman may wish to be seen as a suave, caring individual over the net, were he given enough time he would start to exhibit some of his characteristics that he shows in life.  One cannot maintain such a masquerade for long without revealing his/ her true self.<br>
<br>
However, there is a line between EQ and the real world.  It is there, whether we like it or not and how we deal with it are the only choices we can make in acknowledgement of its presence.  When we join things like Everquest, an online community, whatever, to the other viewers we are only what we wish them to see (for a time).  Most of us like carrying out these private lives, and if we want others to know our private information, we'd like to be the ones to give it out (and I'm not talking about credit card companies who pass out info, somewhere down the line we filled out an application that resulted in the propagation of such data).  When you say that the punishments for one's online actions should mirror the punishments for one's real life actions, I challenge you to reevaluate the fleeting nature of the internet.  The internet is a Great Illusion, home to those who wish to masquerade as DarthCowDestroyer666 instead of John Doe for a little while.  The internet plays by a different set of rules pertaining to relationships than real life, and it affords ne'erdowells a larger space to hide in.  Accountability on the internet is next to nonexistent almost, and in reality, it's a bit harder to hide from your offenses.  As such, there is a line between the two, as they don't necessarily function in the same way.  <p>View <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130889>Tarj's Stuff</a> or view

<br>
You saying i should get jailtime for ninja looting? Or running off with your gear that i was supposed to be doing an item transfer on? Everything has a price, even stupidity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope.  All items are property of Verant Interactive within EQ.  You pay for the right to use this property.  Someone ninjas something?  No consequence other than dealing with Verant as they hold the exclusive rights to their property.<br>
<br>
Commiting an act of theft or fraud online, in which something is stolen should have the same consequence as it would if that same thing were stolen in RL.  Defraud someone outta $500 online?  Should have same consequence as doing the same in real life.<br>
<br>
&quot;you familiar with gang fights? they piss me off, and here is why. You got a problem with someone deal with it yourself. If you need the support of 10, 20, maybe 30 other people what does that say about you? Not a whole lot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Excellent, then I am sure that in any instance where an individual enlists the support of others, or others support an individual, in a dispute that that individual is involved in, but the others are not, that you would have a problem with this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, I'm pretty confused on how you missed the football reference. <br>
<br>
There is a line much thicker than CAT 5 separating RL from EQ. If you dug up my PERSONAL INFORMATION and posted it for everyone to teach me a lesson, you would be the first person i would invite over to my house to 'chat' about it. Hey with all this new Online Legislation flying out of senators asses i might be able to sue you for the cost of changing phone lines and finding a new place to live, basically relocating my life, if the harassment was too much. I'd have a pretty good case if there is a post with your name on it directing everyone where to go. Or maybe i'd just post yours up and continue the little pussy game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Certainly.  Were I to do that without cause you would have every right to be upset.  Were I to do that with good cause, then the line again becomes thin.  Did ya start it?  Were you harassing me to begin with?<br>
<br>
&quot;as far as i'm concerned, if i'm on an EQ board, it involves my EQ experience. I dont come here and talk to everyone about my work day or how the kids are. If you would look there is a SINGLE SPECIFIC forum for Real Life chatting. Why would that be necessary if you are correct in you view of online interaction? In game, /OOC. hmm....granted everyone thinks that /shout does the same thing. &quot;<br>
<br>
I agree.  Stuff here is EQ related.  Stuff here stays EQ related.  People do bring &quot;real life&quot; here, though.  Oftentimes people comment on another person's real life here.  We're not talking phone numbers and addresses, but perhaps commenting on another's weight, RL habits, RL sexual preference, or commenting on another's family / friends etc.  We can even take the mess between Razzine and Bowynn as another example.  RL brought here.  Again, no numbers, no addresses, but it's RL being brought here.  It does cross over.  There is no hard line.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a wonderful case for why single player games are still very popular. &quot;<br>
<br>
Because of my views on the matter?  Perhaps you have me confused with the individual in that thread, or you read and believe what Darkmask / Arleanna say.   My views are just that, views.  You've not stolen from me or friends, or slandered me in any way other than posting your disagreement here.

That is being a good samaritan. That is making sure that the guy won't commit the same crime again. Nothing done on everquest (excluding the buying and selling of characters because that really isn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> in</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the realm of EQ) is considered a crime. It is simply foul play. What can you do within the realm of the game? The same thing you'd do in RL to someone who cheated you in a game. No longer associate with them, tell people you know to stay clear of the guy, make sure he is known for what he did, let his rep be completely tarnished and obliterated for all I care. But telling people where he lives, inspring people to go and kick his ass because he's a baby who can't play games fairly? That's not only a waste of my time, but its not proactive or ethical. It's being as malicious as the person who wronged you. It's being as juvenile as him. And it's inspiring hate and violence in a world that really doesn't need more of that.<br>
<br>
Fact is, the guy in this story is off his fucking rocker. Why would you want to further him down his twisted spiral of insanity. Why would you want to see him dead? The majority of the people on that messageboard wanted exactly that. I can't imagine anything that someone in EQ could do to me (in EQ) that I would wish that person dead. Nothing.<br>
<br>
And of course you can argue that there is a thin ine between the two, and that realistically it isn't something that will cease to happen, but that wasn't my point. I'm not arguing that people shouldn't do it. I'm arguing that it's wrong. Slandering someone in EQ and real life should have the same consequences; within their seperate realms. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162713" target="_blank"><b>Croneus Titanis</b></a><Br>

Done. I encourage you to do the same, although I doubt that you will  : )<br>
<br>
&quot;You compare online items to real life items because you made your money that way for a year or two with you and your guild's ebay franchise ( so much so that SI had to have a no ebay clause ), so its understandable how you do not see a difference.&quot;<br>
<br>
So you are saying that Sol Invictus was an ebay franchise.  Does this encompass every member of Sol Invictus?  If not, who were the members involved?  How were the items sold?  If they were sold on ebay, what was the name used to sell them?  If they were sold direct, please post up any material you have proving that such a thing was done.<br>
<br>
Sol Invictus does not tolerate ebaying of items.  It's been that way since the guild was formed.  Perhaps you would like to talk to some of the other leadership on the subject who you just accused of ebaying.  If you'd like I can provide you with a list of officers / leaders you may speak with, or a full listing of guild membership past and present so that you can investigate and come up with even a shred of evidence : )<br>
<br>
&quot;The sad part is, you also ratted on all your customers to keep playing,&quot;<br>
<br>
Rattled on who?  Darkvenom?  Someone buys a can of coke from ya... then a week later goes running around town calling you a filthy coke seller.  Would you not remind that individual and express to those around that that individual not only bought a can of coke from you the other day, but also has his own coke business on the side?  My only fault was being honest about it when it took place.  Probably a bad move, but then again I've never hidden myself or my actions.<br>
<br>
&quot; you gave their information to VI in exchange to keep your characters.&quot;<br>
<br>
To date, I've not once worked with VI on anything whatsoever.<br>
<br>
&quot; Not only were you guilty of doing it,&quot;<br>
<br>
Not only are you pulling things outta your ass....<br>
<br>
&quot; when the ship was going down, you were pushing people into danger so you could get to safety. That is what makes you a very fucked up person.&quot;<br>
<br>
What ship?  Who did a push?  When, where, why, how?  Enlighten me.<br>
<br>
&quot;You talk alot about people being more brave because they are anonymous ( behind the screen ), but you yourself are also taking advantage of this, you post real life info of others, without posting your own, making the charge, that if someone really wanted to find out it would be easy, well what I am saying, if you think its okay to post someone else's info, why not post your own at the same time, your phone number, your address, your work number, I mean if you believe so truely that this isnt personal information, please share it with us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Done.  I am an independant contractor for AT&amp;T.  My work number is the same as my home number.<br>
<br>
&quot;You do know, you can also can do a search for Social Security Numbers right? So if I can find that publically, why not post that also,and your drivers license number, thats public information......I urge you to do so, show us all how brave you are. How you dont hide behind your screen. &quot;<br>
<br>
My driver's license number is the same as my social security number.  I've provided you with enough information to acquire my social security number if you wish.  Feel free.  I do feel posting such information is a bit unnecessary, though, and have never, nor would I ever, entertain the idea of posting such information.<br>
<br>
&quot;You believe this to be &quot;public knowledge&quot; so its okay to share it, but I consider it personal information going to people I dont know, nor do I want to know, what you do is cross the line and seek the information, and more so, post it, twice, in order to get retribution.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once was retribution.  Consider the coke scenario above.  It was obnoxious enough that the individual caused an intrusion in my real life unprovoked.  I returned the favor.<br>
<br>
The second was assitance.  An individual named Jason Leydon (free to use that name here as nobody knows the individual, where he lives, etc) was committing fraud, several counts at that.<br>
<br>
Little bit of info on this &quot;kid&quot;  (18 years old at the time of the actions, likely 20 now).  Worked at GNC in his local mall.  When a customer would come and do a return, he'd take the info off the person's return slip... name, CC #, etc. and trade this information online for money and goods and other information.   CC #'s that were traded to him from individuals doing the same thing in other parts of the country (harder to trace wtf is going on if this information is passed around 10x before used) he would use to create online accounts.  Ebay, Paypal, etc.   Creation of several ebay accounts allowed him to buy and sell from himself, and boost his feedback rating.  Then he'd go and list a couple hundred auctions on ebay for everquest items.  Someone would see &quot;Cloak of Flames&quot; and his impeccable feedback rating, bid on it, and send him the money.  $1500 in debt, and sitting online like a dumbass waiting for this guy to give him his cloak of flames, the person would quickly (or not so quickly) figure out they had been scammed.   Mr. Leydon would take the large sums of money he acquired in this fashion, shuttle it around a bit between paypal accounts, buy things with it, etc. or just convert it into cash and have it sent to a drop location, and he was $20,000 richer.  Yes, I had friends who were scammed by this individual.  Hell, some of them post right here on this board.  Yes, I had people I disliked who were scammed by this individual, some of whom post right here on this board.  I enjoy &quot;finding&quot; people.  When you look at it as a game of hide and go seek it's actually alot of fun.  When the individual knows how to hide, it's ALOT more fun.   This guy was HARD to track.  Took 2 weeks, and yeah, I got absorbed in it.  During those two weeks I gathered all the information I could on him, and finally found him through a little luck and a little bit because of his carelessness in trusting another individual.<br>
<br>
Found his info, called his house, got his &quot;mom&quot; on the phone.  She freaked out, put me on phone with &quot;dad&quot; who was wondering where his son had been getting &quot;all this money.&quot;  Walked &quot;dad&quot; through his son's files on his computer, confirmed what he was doing, &quot;dad&quot; flips, much smashing is heard on the other end of the phone, &quot;dad&quot; apologizes and says he'll have his son call me.  Kid calls me about 30 minutes later.  I informed him of what was going on, he acknowledged it, I also informed him that I would be providing those he defrauded with the means to contact him, he did not object.<br>
<br>
Turned the rest of the info I had over to the proper authorities, who contacted me later to ask questions.  Helped as many people as I could get their money back, and that was the end of that.<br>
<br>
Pretty fucked up of me.... what the fuck was I thinking?<br>
<br>
&quot; How would you feel if you posted some information that got some injured or killed?&quot;<br>
<br>
Posting information does not get anyone injured or killed.  Kinda like blaming a brewery for causing a drunk driving accident.  It's the individual's poor judgment that creates the action, not the provision of the tool.<br>
<br>
&quot; Its okay though right, because &quot;Anyone&quot; can find it, but the rub is not &quot;Anyone&quot; is posting it, you are, so you are responsible for any reprecussations taken from your irresponsible act.&quot;<br>
<br>
You mean repercussions?  Repercussions such as?  Repercussions happen from slander and libel.  Guy up in a bell tower next to a heavily traveled area, and every time someone walks by he pisses on them.  No way to get up to that belltower so people just gotta deal with being pissed on.  Someone comes along and props a ladder against the bell tower wall.  Angry mob rushes up and pisses on the guy in the belltower.  Blame the provider of the ladder?<br>
<br>
Now, if some guy was sitting up in a bell tower minding his own business, and some guy came along with a ladder, propped it up against the wall, and then shouted that the guy was pissing on people from up there, and the crowd did the same, then fault lies with the guy with the ladder.<br>
<br>
Kinda like above.  You are presenting things about me which are not fact and which you either have no means to prove them, or outright you know them to not be fact.  Not only have you slandered me, but you have gone beyond that and implicated every single member of my guild in the same paragraph.  If I receive harassment, or my guild receives harassment due to this, you are at fault, as the things you have said are not true.  Had I, or my guild actually done those things, and you merely brought them to light, I / we would be at fault.  The person in the &quot;wrong&quot; here, is you.  Feel free to look up &quot;slander&quot; in the dictionary.<br>
<br>
&quot;You might not have actually commited the crime, you helped it happen. The places that you get your information from arent posting, they will produce results for a search for those who go looking, but there is a huge difference for those who actually put the information in a public area in order to get retribution. You are basically putting a virtual contract out on the people whose personal info you post.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then we must jail every gun seller.  We must bring some responsibility to knife manufacturers.  Automobile dealers will need to be fined and or jailed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will give you one final example, a guy goes to war, leaves his wife and children, a person with a grudge decides to look up his wedding certificate, then does a search for matching names, and then cities, and this same person then posts that information say on a site that frequented by the Taliban, to which the Taliban orders a sleeper agent in the US to kill or kidnap the family, you are telling me, if you were the person who did the search and posted the info you wouldnt feel any guilt whatsoever for the reprecussions of your foolish actions?<br>
If you believe that this personal information you feel so ready to post cannot be used to terrible ends, then you are more foolish then I ever thought. You also had a hand in that act happening by helping it happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes lets blow this way out of proportion  : )   Make ya a deal.  If the Taliban goes and kills Jason Leydon, I'll feel bad.  You dumbass.  : P<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes you can argue its a stretch, but so was the idea that terrorists might take planes and plow them through buildings, but when it happened it became a grim reality.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
Wasn't a stretch.  I wondered why it hadn't happened sooner.  <br>
<br>
<br>
And before you people go all fucking crazy, just cuz I wondered that doesn't mean I wanted it to happen nor does it mean I think in any way was it a good thing at all.  I think it's fucking tragic, I cried for days over this shit (what little good crying does) and honestly I feel it's WAY off base in this discussion.  Some fucking moron always has to take things to the extreme.  Comparing posting someone's information on the internet to crashing a two jumbo jets into hundred + story civilian buildings and killing tens of thousands of people is classless and clueless, and extremely disrespectful to those directly affected by this incident, and had no place in this thread.  Yeah yeah this is the flameboard, but that was just ignorant.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, Darkmask, does the e-mail you sent to me on 12/10/2000 apologizing for basically the same shit you are doing here (posting untruths about myself, ebay, and Sol Invictus) still apply?  I mean... really... that's the spineless shit right there  : )  Posting a mess of crap publically, beating your chest and trying to look cool, and then apologizing in private. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=984.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=984.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=984.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=984.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=984.topic&start=101&stop=116>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=984.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=984.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=984.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=984.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=984.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=984.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
