<br>
I resent that... My problem is not with America or it's citizen, it's with a blatantly corrupt government, policies and corporate lack of ethics. It's not restricted to the US, but as happen to live here : is it so strange that my interests are focusing on the US at the moment ?<br>
<br>
>To get in power in this world, you almost need to be corrupt. <br>
<br>
So we kind of agree no ? Somehow the system that distributes responsibilities  has some serious flaws ?<br>
<br>
>Its the way things are. <br>
<br>
We live in a democracy. I was taught that "using my vote" to "make things better" was my civic duty...<br>
<br>
<br>
>The world is a lot better now than it was 100 years ago.<br>
<br>
Oh really ? For who ? <br>
<br>
>More examples of your hatred for America. No one is turning on America, its your warped perception of things.<br>
<br>
Heh - read this forum... I am not even the one who posted that statistic of world opinions about US policies. And according to the news, your government seems to share my warped perception of things enough to devote a few millions of it's budget.<br>
<br>
>"Make all public servants accountable.": What does this mean, exactly? I thought voting WAS accountability?<br>
<br>
Not when the elected president and his staff have virtual immunity from  investigation by SEC for instance. Not when there is no restriction on electoral campaigning funding (ie. lobbies...). Not when a party's electoral funding disclosure takes years to be published. <br>
<br>
>I am fairly certain they do these types of things all the time. I would venture to say that America is the cleanest industrialized nation in the world.<br>
<br>
Then keep venturing... but don't check for facts : it might hurt your feelings. Mind you : the Australians have the badass spotlight in the ecological department lately.<br>
<br>
>"Start sticking to trade agreements." What does this mean or refer to?<br>
<br>
To the steel trade agreements. To the lumber agreements with Canada. Check the news.<br>
<br>
>First off, the public education system has gotten WORSE the more money <br>
we have thrown at it.<br>
<br>
Then I hope you have cheap creative ideas on the subject, because the US public undergraduate education system is one of the worse... <insert crappy study of high school academic achievements worldwide for the analy retentive reader><br>
<br>
>Your sense of entitlement of the money I earn is absurd to say the least.<br>
<br>
I never talked about your money. Not once did you see me promote any socialistic economic policies (even though I do think some have some very positive results). Not once did you see me ask for more taxes. I do however ask for my contribution to be used in the interest of the majority, rather than to further the goals of an elite whose claim to power is anything but democratic.<br>
<br>
> I want the government to provide me with SAFETY (i.e. police and military)<br>
<br>
And that's where all of us contradicting you disagree : wiping out Iraq has -nothing- to do with your safety, and everything to do with the greed of private interests. In other words, what we are fighting in this discussion is the naive belief that more guns and more violence will do any good, when the core of the problem is greed.<br>
<br>
>And I am sure you give your money to anything that opposes America, <br>
Not worth commenting.<br>
<br>
>I hope you don't live here (in America), because, you know, your only adding to the world's misery if you do, right?<br>
<br>
Too bad... Your taxes paid for a weapon to protect me, my taxes paid for a teacher that's lecturing your kids. Enjoy what's left of the summer sales on democracy before the winter collection arrives.<br>

Im on you with this, partially. But now you need to convince me that hundreds of individuals, groups or organizations are willing to fund the construction, management and administration of non-religious private schools. Oh wait, we have those. Theyre called public schools :) The only problem evident is poor management of public schools atm. That I agree with and a common solution desperately needs to be found to resolve the issue.<br>
<br>
The issue is complex. Overcrowding, social workers as teachers and lax administration are rampid currently. Honestly, the biggest problem is inferior quality of teachers. I refer to teachers nowadays as social workers because that is what most of them really are. There are very few &quot;true&quot; teachers left. This problem is nearly identical with the medical profession. Almost comparitive to our nation's recent business industry issues. Social wars and backstabbing. I honestly dont have a solution for all of this weird shit, Dumai, but I dont feel that vouchers is an honest and unbiased solution and remedy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwittlesvaseel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WittlesVaseel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 431<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/23/02 4:10:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War of the Worlds meets Keystone Kops</span><hr size=1> &gt;The world is a lot better now than it was 100 years ago.<br>

<br>
- Money : Universities have a very economic interest to attract foreign students : they don't have to provide scholarships (apart for a rare few certified geniuses) and you pay double your tuition fees. It's actually even worse in the UK where universities compete against one another to attract students from neighbouring districts.  I have taught a regular IT class that had 3 UK students and 31 foreigners... It's not as bad in the US though, but both have very very aggressive advertisement budgets  (pamphlets, sending lecturers on recruitment trips etc etc)<br>
<br>
- Language : Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't see a whole lot of students who master a foreign language well enough to enroll courses abroad. I don't speak swedish or japanese : it would be hard for me to enroll there, even though i would have had a very good reason to. Whereas english is a second language for a lot of people around the world...<br>
<br>
- Having said all that : depending on what technical field you are interested in, it is very true that you really want to study in specific universities, and there are quite a few very good ones in the US. <br>
<br>
High school however is a very different can of worms...<br>

Iraq tries to kill israel..Israel atacks Iraq...Other islamic nations atack israel...India atacks pakistan...and all are itchy to use thier new atomic bombs....<br>

I didn't read this thread, cause much like the last 20 threads its Loegan taking something out of context and crusading against Bush.<br>
<br>
BUT, I never supported nor advocated Communism in any form, I merely pointed out the hypocricy in the actions of the American government and the foreign policies of the American government, dozens upon dozens of times, ever since 9/11.  If my stance seemed ultra-liberal - then so be it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will mention the fact that I denounced American foreign policy from the get-go after 9/11 and placed the blame of the American/Muslim deteriorating relations squarely upon the American shoulders.  I was called a communist, I was called a terrorist sympathizer, I was called a vicious hater of Americana.  And now, most of you are jumping or have already jumped on my wagon.  No longer is America the epitome of ravaged innocence that everyone portrayed it to be on 9/11, people are peeling their American flag bumper stickers off their SUV's.<br>

I do not agree with using 9/11 to push your own agenda and say that anyone who disagrees is unamerican because we are at war. He is using 9/11 to do anything he wants without having to convince us it's right or answer to public concerns.<br>
