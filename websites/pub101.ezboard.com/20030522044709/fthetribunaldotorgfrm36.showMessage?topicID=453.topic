<br>
The UN allows Iraq to have missiles with a range of 92 miles.<br>
<br>
The al-Samoud has flown 112 miles.<br>
<br>
20 miles farther than allowed. Wow. I had mistakenly thought they went 135 miles and even that seemed a ridiculous reason for concern, but calling a missile that goes 20 miles farther than allowed the smoking gun is so grasping that it isn't even funny. I can't even believe the UN could ask him to destroy them with a straight face.<br>
<br>
92 vs 112. This is the kind of insignficant shit your government is going to war over.<br>

Who said it was a smoking gun? It's no more and no less of a smoking gun than the rest of the evidence presented. Take that for what you will, and we all know what you will take it for. <br>
<br>
The &quot;type of insignificant shit&quot;? What are you comparing it to? Nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons? Not insignificant. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I can't even believe the UN could ask him to destroy them with a straight face.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh holy god Loegan. Now you don't even trust the UN inspections team. Where does it end for you?<br>
<br>
Loegan, pure and simple, security council set a limit for the Iraqi missiles. Doesn't matter if they go 500 feet further, 1 mile further, 12 miles further, 50 miles further, 100 miles fruther, 1000 miles fruther. It's defiance on the Iraqi's part. They're saying &quot;We don't take the UN's decisions seriously, we can build a more powerful missile than they clearly and strictly specified. The idiot liberals will be on our side so it'll work out in the end!&quot;<br>
<br>
France said it was a serious mistake on Iraq's part and that they must destroy the missiles. Germany said it was a mistake on Iraq's part and they must destroy the missiles. Kofi Annan(soon to be replaced by your all knowing favorite president) said it was a mistake on Iraq's part and they must destroy the missiles. Clinton said it was a large mistake on Iraq's part and they must destroy the missiles. Bush said it was a mistake on Iraq's part and they must destroy the missiles. Funny you get on war supporters for not seeing the whole picture while the millions of protesters world wide and the 70-80% of most country's populations actually see what's going on, yet you go alone on this subject yourself and say the UN shouldn't have asked Saddam to destroy the missiles, going against the wishes, desires and beliefs of just about every single country and civillian in this world. You're quite alone on this subject.<br>
<br>
No one of note is saying it's a smoking gun. It is however clear proof that Iraq has no problems in defying the international community. Stop apologizing for Saddam. It's making me sick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2432<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/03 8:27:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=453.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh holy god Loegan.

That's not what I said. I am saying I can't believe they would even ask him to destroy them over a 20 miles difference, when they didn't even have a warhead or guidance system on board when they went the 20 miles over. I would be embarssed to ask him to destroy him because it's such obvious Bushit. Hell, they even declared them in their report - it's not like they were trying to hide it. <br>
<br>
When you add that extra weight, do you think they will still go 20 miles over? And even if they do, inspectors said it gives them no military advanatge at all -none-.<br>
<br>
It just shows the knit picking bullshit that they will stoop to to justify this war. It's ridiculous. Tell me with a straight face that 20 miles extra range is significant in any way. Tell me with a straight face the US didn't force the UNs hand on this. One week they say it's insignificant, the next week they hand deliver a letter to Saddam demanding he destroy them.<br>
<br>
It's like an officer taking you to court for going 57 in a 55mph zone. Sure, it's the law and he can do it, but any honest judge is going to have some choice words for that officer. It's bullshit despite complying with the letter the of the law.<br>
<br>
If the us has such conclusive evidence, why do they waste so much time pointing out minor shit like this? And why should he destroy them when Bush made it clear destroying them would change nothing?  <p><br>

Loegan, stop copying other people's words. We aren't talking about a car going 57 in a 55. Anyone that compares a speed limit to international law is a moron.

Might as well let them go to 132 mile range.  That's only a measly 20 mile difference from 112 (which was also a measly difference).<br>
<br>
But there isn't much difference between 132 miles and 152 miles, so they might as make them with a range of 152 miles.<br>

No appreciable difference between 152 and 172, so we might as well let them have 172 mile range.<br>

<br>
These missiles with the extra weight of the warhead will probaly not go over the limit. Yet, you people expect Saddam to destroy millions of dollars worth of them in the face of forces mounting on his border with the intention of invading. It's situations like this that the US creates which makes war inevitable.<br>
<br>
I always said from the start that the UN resolutions were designed to make sure Iraq would breach them, since they ask for actions that no country would reasonably comply with.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I am no fan of Saddam, but they way this game is being played, it's getting hard to tell who is the biggest threat to US safety these days. <p><br>

There is no one debating this situation except Saddam and various out of work 'experts' in the media. I'm no expert on this myself of course but since even countries that are the most weary of the US push for war agree- and surely these countries have many expert advisers among their ranks themselves- that these missiles are a legitimate problem, I tend to believe that these missiles are indeed a legitimate problem. I just do not see how you can look at the facts and decisions presented, by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every UN member actively involved in this situation without exception</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,  and claim otherwise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 650<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/03 11:31:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=453.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Jebus you guys have no imagination. Why do you think all of a sudden everyone jumped in and asked him to destroy those missiles ? They have already negociated contracts on missiles that are 150km sharp kosher under the table so he can replace his clunky Al Crapmud experimental junk with top quality gear, probably with guidance systems that actually will hit the designated target and not 10 miles off in the desert. More weapons sold - good business for everyone ! This is not even the sacrifice of a cheap pawn on the board. And don't give me that sanctions bullshit... this is a futures market everyone is playing.<br>

Hussein knows as well as everyone else on the planet that there will be a war. Why disarm himself of weapons that's about to become useful. Doesn't even take a rocket scientist to figure that part out.<br>
