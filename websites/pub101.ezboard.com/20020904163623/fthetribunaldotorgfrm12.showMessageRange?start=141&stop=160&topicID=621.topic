First of all, your vocabulary is atrocious.  Obviously the only experiences you've had involve &quot;cock gobbling faeries&quot; and &quot;dildo conventions.&quot; However, this doesn't really matter, as, in the grand scheme of things, you are just another insignificant, ignorant twat out to piss a few people off.  Congratulations, your life is fucking meaningless.<br>
<br>
Second, you are late.  The Vaz-Tribunal thing was over a week ago, we both figured that we didn't know anything about each other, and flaming each other was kind of pointless.  Obviously, you are as clueless as the rest of the bozos that come here trying to resurrect a dead rivalry.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, if you really want to piss off our mods that badly, I am sure they will be more than happy to make you look like a complete idiot.  You have given them such a running headstart that they really don't have much of a task in front of them.<br>
<br>

Well guess what? You didn't we took out our 24&quot; steroid induced cocks and shoved them straight up your weak flaming asses.

It was a simple game, of the action genre, that created a small but rabid and dedicated group of players that competed against each other day in and day out.<br>
<br>
They formed guilds to compete with each other, with about 15 to 30 or so players per. After about a year, these guilds became great enemies. Every game resulted in an hours worth of shouting matches. Later on, race, sex, religion, and sexual preference became factors in the arguments.<br>
<br>
Blasto became a game based on rage and hate. Since it was the newly born Internet, no one thought much about it. They were all spread out all around the world, they thought. They'd never act out on their threats and hate, they thought. The developers just sit idly by, thinking nothing of what was happening.<br>
<br>
But soon, the players found out they were rather close to each other in the United States. All from the east. Guilds soon learned that other guilds had real life meetings on the east coast. Seeing the opportunity, the guilds decided to act out on their 2 years worth of hate. The leaders met up online, and set up a meeting place in southern Florida.<br>
<br>
45 Blasto players, about 30% of the games population, met up in Florida on March 15th, with weapons in hand. Words were traded, arguments erupted, brawling started. On March 15th, 45 people were sent to the hospital. 45 people were severely injured. 45 people wasted their lives away on a simple video game, learning to hate, learning to love hate, learning to act on hate.<br>
<br>
45 people were sent to jail. 45 people had to pay $15,000 dollars to the state of Florida. 45 people, with a love for hate, wasted their lives hating in a video game.<br>
<br>
The state of Florida discovered a unique trait for each of those 45 people. Each suffered from the same mental troubles. Each grew up in broken homes, each had problems with drugs, each loved to argue.<br>
<br>
The common symptoms for those 45 people were constant use of profanity, constant grammar errors, constant use of &quot;!&quot;s and &quot;1&quot;s, constant use of images to get across their feelings and ideas.<br>
<br>
The moral of this story? <br>
<br>
Stay the hell away from this server with which you are arguing with, fellow Tribunalites. They have a major population of Blasto type players. I fear for your saftey if you continue this rivalry. Ban them from this board, avoid slipping them your IP address, your email address, any personal information which may lead them to have the ability to track you down.<br>
<br>
I continue to study their servers population. Each passing minute leaves me even more fearful of Vaz's population. I'm currently in the process of writing a letter to Sony which details my findings. I only hope they will listen.<br>
<br>
Peace<br>

Ya, and seriously, that post about those 45 fucking losers, doesn't even apply here. The day I find myself going to battle with people, in real life, over a fucking internet message board, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> game</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> etc... is the day I smash my nuts in with a meat cleaver.

In all honesty, I could care less what the Tribunal does, I'm just bored, so I figured I'd take you up on your cross-server flaming <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
