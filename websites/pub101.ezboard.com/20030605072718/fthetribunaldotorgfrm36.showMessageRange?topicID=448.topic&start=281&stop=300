<br>
Simply because something is debatable does not mean that there is no single best or correct judgement.  We may not possess all of the tools or information necessary to make that judgement or have that knowledge, but that does not mean that the final judgement and/or knowledge does not exist!  We do the best with what we are given.  Yes, there is always the possibility that we lack further evidence or knowledge of the Truth, but that doesn't mean that we should resign ourselves to remaining ignorant of it!  We take what we have, what we know, and we do our best with it.  Of course there is the possibility that we are wrong, that there is further evidence, etc.  That is why we are not to judge others.  That is also a core principle.  Now you will say, of course, &quot;But we are judging Saddam!!&quot;  Remember way back in the thread...?  If someone's moral values clash with mine, but they do not infringe on the safety or the rights of others, that's just dandy.  Now - wouldn't it be safe to say that Al Qaeda infringed on a whole hell of a lot of Americans' rights and safety?  As for Saddam, the whole argument of his threat to us is ongoing, but for those who believe he does the same, the justification is present.  Even if he hasn't infringed on ours, of course, he sure as hell infringes on those of Iraqis.  Maybe that's why some of the biggest supporters of this war are Iraqis.  Their rights and safety have been made a joke of by Saddam.  It's called &quot;just war&quot;...<br>
<br>
&quot;The question is whether it's a choice or a natural urge that they were born with. Whichever you believe it to be will determine your decision&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure, not being a homosexual myself.  I'll give homosexuals the benefit of the doubt and say its probably a mix of both, though.  We're each drawn to particular sins, some more than others.  In each case, it is that person's responsibility to exert self discipline.  I'll say it again - homosexuality is just another sin.  If I singled out homosexuals for judgement I'd have to single out everyone else on the planet, myself included, for the various other sins we've all committed.  My only peeve with homosexuals is when they decide that they're going to flaunt their perversion publically, especially for the purpose of attempting to numb society into accepting homosexuality as a norm.<br>
<br>
Walkabout, I don't really have much to say except that I sure am glad I don't live in your fairy tale world.  Church bells?  You just showed much better than I the ridiculousness of moral relativism, probably without even knowing it.  Of course, you think it was a perfectly valid point... more's the pity.<br>
<br>
Myself, I'm glad that Bush wants to liberate Iraq from a murderous dictator.  I'm glad that he realizes that yes, Western values of individual liberties and civil rights are &quot;better&quot; than despotic tyranny.  I'm glad he realizes that changing Middle Eastern political culture is the one and only way to solve the problem of terrorism.<br>
<br>
You probably suscribe to a &quot;passive realist&quot; viewpoint:  Take the world as you find it. You can't change people. Assume the worst. Earth is a dark and dreary place and you pocket your winnings where and when you can. Don't ever bet big on optimistic scenarios. We live in an oasis, let &quot;them&quot; kill each other. Applied to the Arab and Muslim world, this outlook says &quot;they&quot; can't change. The best you can hope to do is manage the problem, but don't be a fool; don't try to solve it. Don't stick your neck out; *you* can't and shouldn't really do anything. Better to work with reliable thugs (Saddam) than with unpredictable idealists (Bush). Bribe bullies to leave you alone. Israel's real crime, for example, is that makes trouble for us. After all, the people who hate Israel don't mind dead Arabs or occupied countries. They don't care if Syria occupies Lebanon. They don't care if Saddam kills Iraqis. Israel is an inconvenience to the Westerners who want to go along and get along, because suicide bombing and war are just what &quot;those&quot; people do, and Westerners should know better.<br>
<br>
Am I right?  Go ahead... that's not the world that I live in.  And if that's the way most Europeans think, then I'm proud for America to stand against them.  The acid test will be, as with the rest of it, after Iraq is over with... I guess we'll see then who's right. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 3/10/03 12:17:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/03 12:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=282>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Myself, I'm glad that Bush wants to liberate Iraq from a murderous dictator.

<br>
If you dont have the information and the tools to possess that knowledge like you said, how would you know that it exists?  You wouldn't.  And that is the main pitfall of your argument.  Like I said before, your arguments only go so far before they run into a wall, at which point you defer the argument to faith and God because you can't explain the rest.<br>
<br>
Frankly, it's good to see that Christianity is withering away in the Western world.  People dont need Christianity to know that murder/rape/robbery/etc. isn't generally constructive.  Hopefully in 50 more years we can drive the fatal stake through this hobbling, wounded animal of a religion.  The pissing on the cross, Virgin Mary painted in shit and the child molesting priests by the truckload are a good start.<br>
<br>
Don't bother claiming that my &quot;anti-Christianism&quot; somehow invalidates my arguments, because it doesn't.  <br>

Perhaps you fail to see the hypocrisy in fags being &quot;born that way&quot;...  The Bible says they are going to hell, yet they were born that way, so apparently God MADE them gay.  <br>

This is the equivalent of forcing YOUR morality down another culture's throat as &quot;superior&quot;.  Even after you've just admited that you &quot;may not possess all of the tools or information necessary to make that judgement or have that knowledge&quot;.  <br>

That is just wrong. Our soldiers have to do what is commanded of them. Blame Bush all you want (as well you should), blame congress for defeating the constitution and giving Bush total control (as well you should), but don't blame the soldiers who are only doing as they are ordered.

That's the reason given, and its the reason so many people think that &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech was the most internationally-politically stupid thing said in a generation or more.<br>
<br>
Now, what are our REAL reasons for going?  Defense (saddam is gonna directly lead to us being hurt)?  Offense (we'd love control of the oil fields)?  Who knows.  But if we do it solely because we deem him &quot;evil&quot; and don't like that he's killing kurds... we're most assuredly going to war to impose our morality.<br>

But that is neither here nor there,......the questions still remains is Morality relative or not.  I believe in morality, just as I believe that people who are agnostic can still live good lives and be admited to heavon.

I am not sure but it strikes me that maybe the real question is not is Morality Relative, but are their self evident Truths in reality.  There are truths which are subject to change, like it's illegal to turn right on red in most US states unless otherwise noted.  However a Truth, like it is wrong morally, spiritually, and fundementally to take another persons life.<br>
<br>
Are there such Truths out there I think is the real question, morality is the frame work within a gven society I think and is more geared to the truth, not the Truth. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/thiaz.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Just because you can debate what morality is correct doesn't mean there isn't an absolute morality.<br>
<br>
Man has no automatic code of survival.  Every action man takes is either conciously made or made for him by social influence (eg someone elses concious decision at some point) or feelings (the summation of previous concious experience) - but if you make decisions based on rational decisions - then you are exhibiting a morality.<br>
<br>
Now why do you need morality? Because every rational living being must choose a course of actions or as stated above, have it chosen for them.  Your chances of survival and happiness increase when you make them yourself.<br>
<br>
Now why an absolute morality - because there is an objective reality we all live in that is inescapable - and this objective reality dictates a series of values that promote the ability to survive - that set of values is the absolute morality.<br>
<br>
Ah, but what if I live in a tyrannical society or some other society where the rules are different?  The base facts of objective reality do not change, and at this level is where morality is discovered and determined.  Even if you are not allowed to exhibit the correct absolute morality - it does not change that you can envision a society where you would be allowed to practice it - and move to change the society in which you live.<br>
<br>
The United states is the first nation on earth founded on principles that allow for the exercise of a morality of life.  There are some flaws, but overall, it's still the closest.<br>
<br>
If there is an objective reality, every IS implies an OUGHT, ought being a red flag you are making a moral decision.<br>
<br>
To answer my question about the desert island, then, on a desert island you need morality most - because there is noone else to help you survive, no automatic tool to do the processing for you.  Every is in your situation implies something you ought to do.  The objective reality of your situation dictates the actions you must exhibit to achieve the value of life.  These actions contitute, at their core, moral decisions.<br>
<br>
It takes a lot more than a few paragraphs to explain why you need morality, which morality is correct, and in the end why there is an absolute correct objective morality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 414<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/03 1:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=292>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Haven't a lot of the protestant religeons acknowledged that biology determines sexuality.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Not even science has said this definitively yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There's still a lot of research going on to answer the nature vs. nurture question with homosexuality, but a huge amount of evolutionary biology theory would state that it's not genetic.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because genetic changes which lead to lower or nonexistant ability to reproduce by definition select themselves out.  If you had a homosexual gene, and you didn't mate, you wouldn't pass it along to your children, and pretty soon that gene would die out.  Sure, some homosexuals reproduce, but at a vastly lower rate than heterosexuals.  What you would expect to see would be a rapid dwindling of the number of homosexuals in the population, as each successive generation had fewer and fewer children born with the &quot;gene&quot;.<br>
<br>
What we see in society, however, is a pretty steady 5-10% homosexuality rate, and it's hard to say if that's a figure that is historically true (say, for the last 5000 years or so), but the rate at which a gene that led to little or no reproduction would disappear would mean that even 10 generations (300 or so years?) ago we'd have been at like 75% homosexuality to be down to 5-10% now.<br>
<br>
Clearly that wasn't the case.  So - the generic rules of evolutionary biology say that homosexuality is probably a &quot;nurture&quot; issue, not a genetic one.  That said, there is very loose evidence showing genetic differences in the brains/hormone levels/etc of homosexuals versus heterosexuals - nothing is proven yet, so for any church to come out and call it genetic would be pretty premature <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigadoondemortis>Rigadoon deMortis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/03 1:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=293>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Dare we label something evil?  To most of you in this thread - there is no evil because there is no morality.  You escape judging - you are the ultimate exhibitors of the Christian ethic &quot;judge not lest you be judged&quot;.  I laugh at how many of you who believe so strongly in this statement are pissing on Christianity - and for the completely wrong reasons.  Piss on it because it defies reality if you want - not because it has a moral code or because people follow it.<br>
<br>
To you, a moral code is the whim of me, the people around me, or your whim, your feeling, your government, or in Walkabout's case, his hatred - which requires a concept of evil - even if he cannot identify what he believes as evil.  <br>
<br>
But it suprises me not much.  &quot;Hatred of the Good for being the good&quot; is the predominate metaphor of the 20th century.<br>
<br>
How dare we label Saddam evil!  His idol is Stalin.  He has massacred tens of thousands of his own people.  He supports terrorism.  He has invaded his neighboring countries.  He has called for the destruction of Israel.  He has created a country of absolute tyranny.<br>

I believe I should live my life by my morals, but I don't necessarily think that gives me the right to impose my morals on anyone else.  I guess the society i'm a part of has the right to have a collective morality (its &quot;laws&quot;), and because I choose to be a part of the society, I accept its &quot;morals&quot;.  If I were held in this society against my will, that'd be wrong.  If my society decided to impose its morals on another society, that'd be wrong.  However, it's &quot;majority rule&quot; in human societies - when its 10 societies versus one, the 10 will win, so at that point you're talking global morality.<br>

We cannot take out everyone in the world who is evil, however.  What makes Saddam special is that he fits the bill for a just war in the first place (WMDs, terror connections, etc.), *and* its the perfect place to start our campaign to reform Middle Eastern political culture.  War on Iraq is in the end about self defense, but not merely by removing Saddam and his WMDs, but by shaping societies to remove the threat at its roots.  That is the only way we will truly be safe.  It's idealistic, and that's a huge strike against it for some, but it needs to be done - 9/11 proved that.  It's risky, yes.  It's dangerous, yes.

The moral code (broadly speaking) and the political values and culture of the United States of America have produced the most prosperous, free nation on the face of the planet.  The moral code, political values, and culture of Iraq and the rest of the Middle East have produced brutal tyrants, repression, injustice, and a subset of the population who are driven to fly airplanes into big American buildings.

They gave us the right to judge them when they killed 3,000 of us unprovoked.&quot;  That is why we did not replace Saddam in 1991, imo.  The cauldron was bubbling, but it had not yet boiled over.
