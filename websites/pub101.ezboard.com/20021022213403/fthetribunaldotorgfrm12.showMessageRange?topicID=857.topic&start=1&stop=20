That's 39 24-hour days I was sitting at my freakin' keyboard!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>For as long as he's been playing, while only having one 51st level character, with only 39 days total played, I doubt he can call himself addicted. He's making us all look very bad by saying that.<br><br>But anyways, former Formula 1 champion and Indy 500 winner Jacques Villeneuve plays. He's famous... sorta. There's quite a few MLB players that play, actually. Lots of time on their hands while on the road.<br><br>I'm actually surprised there hasn't been more bad press against EQ and Verant because of this evil addictive game that's destroying 500,000+ lives as we speak. If I really wanted to, I'm sure I could sue Verant for causing me to rush a school report, which resulted in me getting a C- rather than an A+, which greatly effects my grades which effects my future. Verant and their game of EverQuest may have caused me to lose some high class job in the future, cause I got such a low grade on that report. I mean, they should have put a warning label on the game telling me that it's addicting and has the potential to ruin my life. <br><br>We can't rely on common sense these days, after all. We need detailed warnings, precise instructions on how to stay away from EQ addiction, free support groups that will help us finally cancel our accounts for good, free marriage counceling, loans for when we get behind on our bills cause we were blatantly grabbed by the hand and<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> forced</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to stay home from work so I could kill this very last dragon which made me famous.<br><br>Verant has offered us none of this. They deserve to have every last dime and penny sucked away from their company because of their <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> zero</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> attempts to help us mentally sound people who choose to play their game for 14 hours a day, 7 days a week because of the addiction that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> EverQuest</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so obviously caused.<br><br>I know one guy who was on his first Vox raid long ago. He was so excited and tense, he was sitting on the very edge of his chair. As the dragon was inching closer and closer to death, he got a bit too anxious and slipped off the chair, hit his head, and was knocked unconsious. It was minutes before someone found him, covered in blood. He had to sit in a hospital waiting room for 12 hours before he was finally admitted into intensive care for internal bleeding. He is a vegetable now, because of EverQuest. Verant never said anything about the possibility of getting over anxious, and causing great physical harm to yourself because of the dragon encounters in the game. I want background checks run on all high ranking Verant employees, because it seems that they are intentionally trying to hurt people and will not even stick warning labels on their games. <br><br>I cringe when I think about what Star Wars Galaxies will bring. It's gonna cause thousands of people to sit at a computer all day, reading up on star wars lore and roleplaying some star wars character. They will be absoulutely obsessed over Star Wars. This has never happened before, but now Verant is presenting that possibility! They will create online star wars freaks! People may even line up at Toys R Us for weeks, hoping to be the first to pick up the game. Something that I never dreamed possible before the SWG announcement. Online games are truly an evil product in our current joy filled world.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Martha Stewart plays on the Trib<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I grouped with Martha Stewart just the other day in Great Divide.
