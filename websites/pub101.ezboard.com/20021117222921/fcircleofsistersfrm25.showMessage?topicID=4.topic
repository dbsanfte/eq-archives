<br>
Here are the rules for this forum.<br>
<br>
1) <b>All IC</b>: Unless otherwise specified (marked OOC), everything that goes in this forum is IC.<br>
<br>
2) <b>Play Nice</b>: All of Verant's usual play nice rules apply (at least, those that make sense. I don't foresee much KSing or intentional training here). In general, be respectful of other player's sensibilities. In particular, scenes of sexual abuse are EXPLICITLY OFF LIMITS. You can hint at horrible deeds happening "off screen" so long as they are only hints. This applies to NPCs as well as PCs.<br>
<br>
3) <b>Anyone Can Play</b>: This is an open forum, and anyone can play whether they are in the guild or not. This is limited only by the person controlling a thread (see # 4 below). I suppose gross violations of the rules (esp. #2) might get someone kicked out, but I would be surprised if that happens.<br>
<br>
4) <b>The Person Who Starts the Thread Has Control</b>: The person who starts a thread has control of that thread. In particular, they can decide who may and may not participate in a particular storyline, and have veto power over its direction. Unless stated otherwise, a thread is a free-for-all, and anyone can join, but there is nothing wrong with putting limits on who can join a particular thread. Possibilities include sisters only, limiting it to a few characters, or explicitly limiting it to NEW posters. Also, if you don't like the way a particular thread is being run or the limits that are being placed on it then ... start a new one.<br>
<br>
5) <b>Everyone Has Veto Power Over Their Own Characters</b>: This is the main exception to #4 above. Anyone, at anytime, can veto something that happens to their own character. This extends, to a lesser degree to any NPCs invented by a particular player (though not NPCs that exist in the game). A "Veto" doesn't have to mean that a particular scene is erased. It could be a simple as "My character wouldn't do or say something like that. Please change it so that I do X instead." We have the ability to edit our posts, so lets use it.<br>
<br>
6) <b>Don't be Afraid to Put Words in Someone Else's Mouth</b>: In light to #5 above, you can write stories that have other people doing things or reacting to what you do. After all, they can veto it if they don't like it. But (a) be respectful and don't go overboard and (b) wait until that person has actually joined the story thread before you describe their actions. Oh, and if someone does this to your character and you don't like it, <i>please</i> veto.<br>
<br>
7) <b>Start Stories Small</b>: Always begin your stories on a small or personal scale. Rather than writing a story about how <i>all</i> the sisters suddenly contract a mysterious illness, start with a few sisters who like the idea. Just because a story starts small doesn't mean it has to stay small. If it catches the fancy of the elders, we may choose to grow it. Or if everyone is so enthusiastic about it that they join in, it can grow on its own.<br>
<br>
8) <b>Don't Be Upset if a Story Doesn't Go Anywhere</b>: It will happen. Not every idea is going to take off. Don't give up. Try something new, or play in someone else's story for a while.<br>
<br>
9) <b>When in Doubt Ask an Elder</b>: If you have any questions, disputes or want help getting started, ask an elder. I expect Sneaux and I will be all over this forum, and other elders will probably be around as well. Try Sneaux and I first, since it is our job, but other elders will probably be willing to talk as well. (Especially if it happens that your problem is with me or Sneaux, hehe).<br>
<br>
If you don't want to post your questions here, some email addresses of elders are:<br>
<ul><li><b>Nysa</b>: eq_nysa@yahoo.com</li><li><b>Sneaux</b>: EQSneaux@AOL.COM</li></ul><br>
<br>
(I will edit this later to add the addresses of other elders that are willing to answer questions via email. And before you volunteer, remember that this is a <i>public</i> forum)<br>
<br>
That's it. Have fun. And as usual, nothing is written in stone, so if anyone has any problems with the rules above, let me know, and we can fix them.<br>
