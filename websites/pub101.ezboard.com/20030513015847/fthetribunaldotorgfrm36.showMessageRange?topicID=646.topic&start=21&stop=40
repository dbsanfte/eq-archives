<br>
I have to disagree.  It plays an absolutely MINOR component.  If you take a look back at some of the things I posted earlier you will see something about &quot;physically impossible&quot; and &quot;net calorie consumed minus net calorie burned&quot; and along with a (scientific, I might add) definition of what &quot;metabolism&quot; is.  Some assume that &quot;metabolism&quot; means your body automatically always tries to run at a certain rate of energy burning, when infact by scientific definition it means the amount of energy you burn in one day through the activities that you commit to.<br>
<br>
You do realize that a fat person has, on average, a higher metabolism than a skinny person, right?  The reason for this is that the more fat cells (or rather, cells in general) that you contain, the more maintenance that is required to &quot;upkeep&quot; those cells.  Thus, a fatter person, who has more cells collectively than a skinny person, has more &quot;upkeep&quot; to maintain their body.<br>
<br>
Anything that is ever said about &quot;I know a skinny person who eats a ton and a fat person who eats a little, therefore you can't be right&quot; is just pulling a crock of crap outta their mouths.  Who here has actually gone and weighed out all of the calorie intake of several skinny people and several fat people overtime to see whether their statement is actually true?  I think its just an old wives-tale type of thing personally.  Somedays I eat a TON of food and other days I eat very little, basically whatever I feel like eating.  Many skinny people do this.  However, I lived with an extremely obese family for a summer and received first hand experience of listening to fat people claim &quot;you eat so much and I eat so little and yet you stay so skinny its not fair, my metabolism sucks, etc etc, blah blah blah&quot; and honestly, they weren't farther from the truth.  I paled in comparison to the amount they ate each day.  I eat two MAYBE three times a day and they would eat constantly the entire day, all day long.  They claimed that they ate very little.  To add to this, I have NEVER seen a fat person who ate very little food but have heard MANY fat people claim that they don't eat a lot.<br>

<br>
The difference between fat people and skinny people I think here is that &quot;eat REALLY well&quot; and &quot;exercise hard&quot; means to a fat person as &quot;oh, I decided not to eat one meal today, no biggy&quot; and &quot;oh I decided to run an extra 5 miles for kicks&quot; to a skinny person.  Numbers are what is important here.  To stop eating for an hour or to run 3 miles in a day is considered by some fat people to be an &quot;extreme&quot; measure.  That is why numerical calorie intake and burning is what is important, not opinion based on what you personally are used to.<br>

<br>
Absolutely, 100% false.  Take a look at the back of any food container and look at the &quot;calories from sugar&quot; and &quot;calories from fat&quot; (btw sugar is a carb).  The calories you receive from fat are 9 and the calories you receive from sugar or protein is 4.  Now, to clarify, this number represents the amount of net usable energy for your body.  Fats burn over 50 percent slower from your body than do sugars.  Want some more input on it?  As a long distance runner, the proper diet for a race that is longer than 5k is to eat FATTY foods and NOT carbs.  but why is that?  Because fatty acids take longer to burn than do carbs.  Carbs &quot;burn out&quot; fast, and are usually the food for sprinters and jumpers.  Regardless, this is a moot point because whatever carbs aren't burned are turned to fat and whatever lack of carbs you have your body burns fat instead for.  <br>
<br>
Why do people continually talk about a &quot;difference&quot; between fat and carb consumption?  I mean seriously it makes ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  Your body will just convert one to the other or vice versa, based on what it needs.  Literally all there is to this is a conversion factor of 9:4  For every gram of fat you eat, its equivalent to 9/4 * 1 gram of carb you eat.<br>

Oh darn, thanks for clarifying an oh so moot point.  Proteins are made from amino acids.  Amino acids are obtained either through the body creating them or through the digestion and breakdown of proteins that you eat.  Creatine is one of those amino acids that is a product of breaking down red meat.<br>

Are you male or female?  Because 18% body fat is pretty high for a male.  Anything above 12-15% body fat for a male is considered &quot;obese&quot;.  I guess my &quot;assuming&quot; was correct.  Not that I am trying to harp on you for being fat or whatever.  Its strictly to make my point.<br>

Well, for starters runners need fat and body builders need protein.  Both can be satisfied in a diet.  But, it is worth noting that I lift in the winter and run in the summer.  I also lift in the summer, but running takes priority since thats the &quot;running season&quot;.  Lifting in the summer is strictly to maintain performance.  Going through cycles such as these really promotes strength in various areas, muscle restoration, as well as the &quot;toning/building&quot; cycle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 644<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 12:15:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> ---------------------------<br>

---------------------------<br>
<br>
better check that definition of obese - 12% body fat on a male would be slim.  <br>
<br>
The American Council of Exercise provides the following:<br>
General Body Fat Percentage Categories<br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="95%" align="center"><tr><td>Classification</td><td> Women (% fat)</td><td> Men (% fat)</td></tr><tr><td>Essential Fat</td><td> 10-12%</td><td> 2-4%</td></tr><tr><td>Athletes</td><td> 14-20%</td><td> 6-13%</td></tr><tr><td>Fitness </td><td>21-24% </td><td>14-17%</td></tr><tr><td>Acceptable </td><td>25-31%</td><td>18-25%</td></tr><tr><td>Obese </td><td>32% plus</td><td>25% plus</td></tr></table><br>
<br>
The definition of a calorie has nothing to do with how much energy your body will derive from eating the food.  It's a rough indicator of how much POTENTIAL energy the food has, but tells very little about how your body will use it.<br>
<br>
And I think what Shehb was saying was, correctly, that some of what you eat is not "retained".  Two people who both eat a whole pizza will not both increase in weight by the same amount (after a full digestion of course) - every body is different in how much of the food you eat is burned vs stored vs passed, and the factors which determine this are genetic, mental, and physical (you're quite right that a person with more muscle mass will 'burn' more calories in a day).<br>
<br>
As for the body being able to burn just about any form of food you take in equally (be it protein, fat, or carb), that's just untrue.  Yes, there are mechanisms for burning all three types, but not all mechanisms are created equal - burning carbs is by far the fastest and most efficient way to do things, where every molecule of glucose will (net) provide far more energy than a molecute of fatty acid or protein.  This is why the human body will always burn carbs FIRST.<br>
<br>
The body does not hoard every extra "calorie" it doesn't need - that's very, very false.  There is a predetermined "amount" of storage which the body will maintain, based almost solely on genetics (controlled by hormones).  Unless facing unusual circumstances (ie, an incredible overload of calories, or starvation), the body will happily burn its daily usage ("metabolism" in your terms) and release anything extra.<br>
<br>
If there is a LOT extra, it will be stored - but how fast it is stored is, again, genetically/hormonally determined.  This is why some skinny people can get fat, but very slowly and not in the 'typical' ballooning-up way; and why some other people are 'large' no matter what.  Those people's bodies store far more of the 'extra' energy taken in.<br>
<br>
You are, of course, right that if you eat less than you burn, you'll lose weight - law of conservation of matter and all that.  If you burn 2000 calories a day and eat 1000, you are 100% guaranteed to lose weight - but by no means will it be healthy (it may be, but only if those 1000 calories are the "right" calories, and if the body is burning fat for the extra energy as opposed to muscle - and even the burning of fat, over the long run, is deadly - you DID look up Diabetic Ketoacidosis, right?)<br>
<br>
Any "sensible" weight loss program will recommend a balanced diet of slightly fewer calories than are being burned, along with moderate exercise.  The exercise, for one thing, builds muscle mass, which is like a "freebie" - you will burn more calories per hour even when not exercising if you have more muscle.  The balanced diet will be sure to include protein and carbs and fats - in the proper percentages but in reduced amounts.  This ensures that all of the body's normal metabolic pathways continue to work as expected, which is the only condition where long term weight loss won't be harmful.  <br>
<br>
Genetics is not everything - in fact, its FAR from it - but to assume that all skinny people are skinny because they eat less AND/OR exercise more is very false.  Body type and genetics play a HUGE role as well - just like how its damn near impossible for some men (stick-figure types) to grow to bodybuilder proportions, no matter HOW much they eat or lift (without steroids), while other guys can build muscle very easily (but may conversely have a great deal of time getting down to a 32" waist no matter what they do short of starvation or insane exercise).<br>

<br>
I have to admit I lost specific info about ketones in particular.  Can I tell you why Carbs burn out faster than fatty acids? Certainly.  Carbs (sugar rings), when combusted, break down ring by ring.  One ring = one molecule of sugar.  These rings bust apart faster than do fatty acids because once the reaction starts, the whole ring breaks into pieces.  Fatty acids, on the other hand, break down bit by bit in a slower process.  Fatty acids are long carbon chains with hydrogens on them.  Each carbon that is removed from the chain yields energy, and it can only be removed one carbon at a time until you reach the end of the fatty acid.  Therefore, each molecule of fatty acid produces MUCH more energy than each molecule of sugar.  Now, in terms of weight (grams), fatty acids are much more dense than are sugars due to the physical structure of each.  Fatty acids are linear, and compact with carbons while sugar rings have a hollow center which sucks up space, thus making it less dense.  Per atom, a fatty acid has more energy stored because each carbon represents energy and the carbon ratio per molecult in fatty acids is much higher than that in sugar rings.<br>
<br>
The ATP cycle:  Haven't studied this since high school, but I'll do my best (I'm assuming you already know and are just being an ass anyways).  ATP, the molecule that directly transfers energy.  Each time energy is released from it, it breaks down into ADP and then AMP (?).  The break down is due to a loss in a phosphate group.  The phosphate group is a necessary component for causing contraction in muscle cells along the lining of the cell (?).  Thus, phosphate groups are needed.  When ATP breaks down, it has to rebuild in order to be reused again and again.  This process is a bit slower than the break down process, which is why we get exhausted when we work our bodies.  When ATP levels are too low we go into anarobic energy supply, which is less efficient but an &quot;alternative&quot; method to obtaining energy.  Unfortunately, this method rapidly produces lactic acid, which is toxic to our body, and thus we cannot continue an anaerobic workout for very long.  I forget what exactly the formulas for anarobic workouts are, but I am pretty confident, based on memory, that fats are burned in aerobic workouts and carbs/sugars are burned in anarobic workouts.<br>
<br>
So, unless you want me to dig old biology books out and write it all down scientifically word for word, you can see I know my physical health aspects.  I notice that every single person here who keeps referring to &quot;so by doing this action we are thus forcing our bodies to use this other action instead of the one action that somehow makes us fat in the first place&quot; COMPLETELY ignores the fact that EVERY person's body compensates for any stress you put it through by later re-converting chemical levels to the way they should be.  To give an example of what I mean by this:  When you do an anarobic workout (which forces muscle cells to use anarobic reactions) your body will then go into a relapse phase of reconverting every ounce of work you did back into an aerobic workout.  I.E. after you run a 100m dash (anarobic workout) your lactic acid levels may be high and you may have bi-products of anarobic workouts left in your cells, but your body IMMEDIATELY reconverts those bi-products into what they were before you ran the 100m dash (A reversal of chemical reaction) when given the chance to continue aerobic reactions.  It uses the energy produced by the aerobic reactions to backtrack those reactions.  Its what scientists call a &quot;buffer system&quot; that allows the body to compensate after stressful changes in chemical levels throughout your body.  Why does everyone ignore this process? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 476<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 1:45:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anything that is ever said about &quot;I know a skinny person who eats a ton and a fat person who eats a little, therefore you can't be right&quot; is just pulling a crock of crap outta their mouths.

We have a family friend.  <br>
Woman, 4'11'', has never weighed more than 95 lbs.  The amount of food this girl eats scares the crap out of me.  I am 6'1'' 200 lbs and I KNOW she eats way more than I do, by a long shot and she does not excercize any more than I do.  (And before you ask how I know, She stayed with us for a year, so she could finish HS at our local school when here family moved right before her SR year)<br>
<br>
Genetics do play a big role in body type.  Diet and excercize can counteract that tendency, but it is easier for some people to do so than others.  This is not just related to overall WT. either.  There is a reason Kenyen's have a lot of long distance runners and Eastern Europe has a lot of power lifters and not the opposite.<br>

<br>
 I use to be a runner in highschool (long time ago).  I was too skinny.  The most I weighed was 72lbs till my senior year in high school and I didn't have enough body fat to have a period.  I use to have to sit in the nurses office in the morning as they gave me breakfast to prove I didn't having a eating disorder.  The very opposite was true I out ate most men.  I of course thought all fat people were just lazy and my god if I could eat that much how much do they have to be eating?<br>
<br>
 Then puberity kicked in (intro to the hormones).  I was still slim but not over skinny, didn't have to diet to much worked out because it was habit.... still thought fat = lazy.  Then comes my first kid (100lb uncontrollable, well alot of it anyway, weight gain).  I was still under 30 so within 6 months of having her I lost most of the weight.  (The old starvation diets and working out till I fell down worked).  But more hormones and I really had to start watching what I eat the days of eating all I wanted were long gone.  Then comes the 2nd child (oops over 30 now).  100lbs weight gain.  I Did manage to lose 80lbs of it but then OMG starvation diets NOT working excericse NOT working.  Turns out I had a tumor that was effecting my overies (hormones) and another surgery.  Recover from that or so I think.  Start living off slim-fast and running 3-5miles, stair master, sit-ups.... Guess what I GAIN weight and not the good kind.  The Dr. tells me I have thrown my body into survival mode and I will not lose weight untill I quit dieting.  I'm finally in the mode of losing again and almost back to where I started with the second child.. Thank you mini'meals.  <br>
<br>
 Ok.. I've bored enough of you, the point is I don't give a shit what the scientific names are or what some quack fresh out of college came up with on his disertation.... I care about what works.  I have tried damn near everything thing under the sun for many different body types.  I ate the one meal a day.  I've eaten once every 2 days or 3.  I've excercised like a fiend.  I've tried diet pills of all sorts.  The best way is Mini-Meals (good food of course) and excercise.  It doesn't work as fast as say starvation or adkins but it won't back fire on you either.  BTW that was a real Dr. recommended diet (not someone trying to sell a book). <br>

<br>
And oh yeah, like I said: I'm 6'1 and 125 lbs and have been that way basically for years now.  I eat about 3,000 calories a day, usually in one sitting.  I rarely, if ever get hungry.  One time I forced myself to stomach ~5,000 calories a day for 2 weeks for a whopping 3 pound gain.  I feel fine though.  especially since I started taking herb supplements.  Might be a placebo effect, but it really doesn't matter as long as I feel good.<br>

No, that shows that you still don't know crap (since you admitted to it) and that I do (since 7% is where a male should want to be, to be as healthy as possible).<br>
<br>
I have still yet to see someone mention how their body's metabolism can somehow intake more calories than it burns and NOT gain weight.  Just so you know, its a SCIENTIFIC AND PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY.  Keep in mind that any *noticeable* difference in metabolism between two people based strictly on their bodies' way it burns energy is going to increase their body temperature a lot.  I don't recall seeing a single person here yet mention having an abnormally high or low body temperature.  I once had a friend whose normal body temperature was 103 degrees, but I haven't seen him in years.  The energy MUST go somewhere ya know.  Even if you try to claim &quot;well our bodies can cool themselves ya know&quot; type of comment, a cooling system only functions AFTER the energy is created and thus body temperature will be some amount higher over time since its constantly producing the heat to replace the extra heat loss.  Man you guys, play with physics before coming up with theories, myths, or assuming that other peoples' theories must be right because they are a doctor or a *something, input here*.<br>
<br>
Am I stubborn? Heck yea I am.  All these theories that break the laws of physics have a hard time of making it into my book of beliefs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 881<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/03 9:41:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dr Atkins</span><hr size=1> &gt;how their body's metabolism can somehow intake more calories than it burns and NOT gain weight. <br>

Second, I believe people have already stated that the absorbtion and retention of energy from food consumed is not a universal constant.  Thus it is possible that a person eating a big mac only obtains 50% of the calories consumed and the rest is expelled as waste.<br>

Third, no one has said that it is possible to intake more than you burn and still lose weight.<br>
