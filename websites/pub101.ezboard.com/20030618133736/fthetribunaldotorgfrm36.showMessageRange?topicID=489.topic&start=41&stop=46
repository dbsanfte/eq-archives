Goverment tends to run late, Most of the time we are a year or two behind magor happenings in the &quot;real world&quot;.<br>
<br>
And did I in my ENTIRE post say we had inadiquite funding? No what I said was that we were gutted, We had a perfect amount of funds to pay for the Anemic staff we were left with.<br>
<br>
What did happen was simmiliar to a heart atack, Even on the skeletion team Clinton left us with we can run for a good long while, However eventually things start breaking down Loegan, The money stops flowing, And the nation has a slight heart atack. Much like is happening now.<br>
<br>
What Clinton did do was create a surplus off of Liquidizing agencies that could NOT be liquidated, This in the future lead to things that should not have happened (hello corporate scandels!).<br>
<br>
Do you really think we did not know about Enron Loegan, Do you think we did not want to audit them. I will give you 2 guesses who Neurdered us in that dept, And Its not bush!<br>

God loegan what a piss poor defense, Saying its not his fault just because it did not happen on his watch, When it was being PLANNED ON HIS WATCH, And he had 8  years to deal with it since the first trade tower bombing.

<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
When the Republicans seized control of Congress in 1994, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his followers forced the president to accept balanced budgets, which were even more beneficial. <br>
<br>
Mr Clinton had wanted to finance his social programmes by busting the budget. Even so, a recent poll of American historians ranked him in the middle range of the country's 42 presidents, but fifth in terms of his economic management. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
That's from the BBC. I was researching when the republicans gained control of the house and senate since any budget would have to be passed by republicans after that time.<br>
<br>
If you believe this, than maybe you should place at least a portion of the blame on the republican controlled congress, hmmm?<br>
<br>
Either way, I stand by my boy and his performance during his 8 years and you can try to lay the economic woes of the current administration on him if you like, but I would gladly hand the reigns back to Clinton anyday and I am sure we would be 10 times better off than we are now just due to public confidence. This market has no confidence in our curretn administration and that's half the problem in and of itself.<br>

Ok, this sounds reasonable. But much like cutting military spending too much (which Clinton did imo, as did his predecessor Bush Sr), you run the risk of it blowing up during your term - especially when you are a two term president.<br>
<br>
I find it hard to believe that he would knowingly allow the government to slowly starve to death. If he was only concerned with his terms, than maybe, but I refuse to believe that was case. As I have stated before, I believe 100% that Clinton was the real deal and did care about people.<br>

But those were laws that congress had to pass. If they were that bad, WTF did congress let it through? I find it hard to believe that a republican controlled congress would just let Clinton destroy the government. They had it in for him way too much for that, as was evidenced when they allowed Starr to go far beyond the scope of his investigation of Whitewater (ir Monica Lewinsky).<br>

That's a hard pill to swallow. I will have to do some research on that one. I am not saying you are lying, but it would be very disappointing to find out he knowingly allowed that type of collapse.<br>

Well, now we agree on something -almost-. The muzzling of the CIA was demanded by the public after revelations of the unsavory charcters they had dealt with (such as in Haiti). Unfortunatly the public didn't realize that to get info on assholes, you have to deal with assholes. <br>
<br>
While I agree that contributed to 9/11, it was much more related to evidence being ignored.<br>
<br>
Despite that fact, 9/11 happened 9 months into Bush's watch and Clinton left a security brief which specifically named OBL and a plan to hit a target in the US. Bush chose to ignore it - probably out of his hate for Clinton (rivalry goes back to Clinton's sound beating of pappy in '92&quot;.<br>
<br>
But, I blame neither Clinton nor Bush for 9/11. I blame the uninformed indifference of the American public and spineless senators who didn't stand up to the public when the CIA witch hunt was taking place. <p><br>

Clinton couldn't deal with it the way he wanted. The public wouldn't let him.<br>
<br>
Do you know how many years people have come before congress warning that we were far to lax in airport/airline security? The public would hear nothing of it and the airlines wouldn't either. People would not be inconvenienced with longer lines and extra security checks. The American public just doesn't give a shit until something happens.<br>
<br>
Well, on 9/11 something did happen and that's why Bush can do what Clinton couldn't. Al-Qaeda could have hit embassies and Ships forever before the public would would care, but 9/11 hit home and that's what gave Bush the power to finally act. Had 9/11 happened on Clinton's watch, he would have been able to go after al-Qaeda full force as well.<br>
<br>
If you want to blame 9/11 on anyone, blame it on the public, because until we get hit upside the head with a 2x4, we won't put up with anything that might delay us for even 5 minutes. <p><br>

Absolutly, They should have been more supportive of each other rather then the Pissing conest that went on during the time.<br>

This is a matter of Opinion, Perhaps Clinton did not know of the effects, Perhaps he had information from toher sources which he trusted more.<br>

Congress let them through because it would have crushed the Goverment fighting with Clinton any longer, Now I am not giving congress a clean slate by any means. But when you have two people who just wont budge one of them has to break.<br>

Congress got thier little admendments that they wanted, And clinton got his. Both parties should have been smacked for what they did.<br>

Sheb posted it elsewhere but I will tell you that you will probably not find anything other then statistical reports.<br>
<br>
The laws would not have allowed Clinton to stop the Dot.Com fraud, However the IRS could have.<br>
<br>
Much like organized crime, When you need something to go away you always go after them for Taxes :P, Everyone who has money cheats a little on thier taxes. Before the &quot;kinder&quot; gentler IRS we used these little cheats to kind of strong arm companies who were screwing people.<br>
<br>
However that all changed with a few laws, The most important of which was making revenue agents responsible personally for Harrassment. Now this was good for the little guy because the IRS screws up sometimes and it can cause hell to small buisnesses, However for large companies that have teams of lawyers it was a god send.<br>
<br>
Many Agents were scared to go after bigger corps because they would have gotten eaten alive by thier lawyers, We asked time and time again for this to be rescinded, it never was. During these years the Collection Revenue for the IRS went down 27%.<br>
<br>
It is my Belief that Clinton Ignored us (as well as congress) because they did not want the Dot.Com bubble getting blown up.<br>

The public and even politians are commonly giving their opinions on subjects that they are unable to see the greater picture.  Remember that island off of Puerto Rico that the Navy was using as a practice bombing cite?  We had thousands upon thousands of politicians and civilians demanding that the bombing to stop.  They wanted the Navy to just leave that island completely alone.  <br>
<br>
Well, Clinton and then Bush both agreed, and halted use of that island.  Unfortunately, none of these fist waving protesters understood the entire situation.  You see there is a huge naval base on the main island that the Navy used to support the bomb range.  The units there were largely there to support the naval personel that flowed through the base on training manuevers involving bomb runs on the island. <br>
<br>
Well, without the training site on that island, the base is no longer needed.  So the navy tried to pull all their personel out of the base.  Well, now you're pulling millions upon millions of dollars out of the local economy since they can no longer milk the soldiers that move through that base.  Oh you can't take the tit away from the town!!!!  They will starve and blow away!!  So now you have the same civilians crying for the government to keep the base fully active.  You have some of the same politicians (the local ones) crying a river yet again.  Then when you look to all the outside politicians, like Hillary, and Al Sharpton.  Well shit, they have no comment.<br>
<br>
LOL<br>
<br>
Now when Bush runs for relection, this is one of the &quot;Hispanic&quot; political hot topics that is going to be used against him.  So now he and other members of congress, will likely try to keep that base up and running, just to get the votes.  A base, that the Navy doesn't even want!  Then you will have others, like many of us here (including myself) complaining that the military wastes money.  LOL<br>
