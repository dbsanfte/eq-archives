From everything I've heard about it *some* people may be born gay, but it's a pretty damn sweeping generalization to say that that's how it is with everyone.<br>
<br>
And as far as being offended about the word 'gay' being used in guildchat, if I were your GL I'd tell you that since guilds are run democratically, rules on what's considered acceptable in guildchat are dictated by the wishes of the majority and the majority will not bend to fit the wants and needs of the minority. If you're gay, you are the minority and if you want to push your gay point of view on the vast majority that is not gay, then you can fucking pack sand. And until theres a dictatorship run by a gay person that's the way it will be anywhere in the world, so welcome yourself to Planet Earth and shut your unenlightened, unintelligent mouth.<br>
<br>
Actually on second though, there is somewhere you could go where you'd probably be listened to. Ever been to the middle east? Homosexuality is theoretically punishable by death in some Muslim cultures, but regardless of that there is so much open gayness there it's almost funny. Men only though mind you, if women were you'd never see it and if you did they'd probably be stoned to death the next day. My guess is that it's because they hold women in such low esteem and men in such high esteem that they'd rather be with a man than a woman. That's just conjecture on my part but I don't see any other reason why you can't look in any direction of the compass without seeing two guys about ready to dry hump in a parking lot.<br>
<br>
So to wrap up- Suck on, Asspirate! I normally don't hate you or even dislike you. What I dislike is a few trying to push their beliefs on and affect the actions of the many, and shitting bricks when they don't get a positive response. Like you! Before you do that, you're just gay which is fine. After you do that, you're a faggot asspirate trying to turn your problem into everyone's problem. It's not everyones problem, its yours. I've had friends that were gay and you know what? I could call them fag to their face and they'd laugh about it because they had a life other than just &quot;being gay&quot; and could recognize and see the humor in the irony. Whining about it in guildchat is a great sign of having no life other than your sexuality, which is about as unenlightened and stupid as you can get. So next time one of those &quot;You're oppressing me!&quot; whines starts to bubble out the porthole of your not-so-trusty turdhamper, think again.<br>

<br>
Well, according to the numbers I read somewhere, homosexuals account for 10% of the population at any given point in time throughout history. I can't remember where I read that, but I do remember it struck me as a reliable source at the time, so take it for what's it worth.<br>
<br>
However, a number of gay men and women actually live the life of a heterosexual prior to going 'full gay' and a good number of those have children. Some gay men and lesbian women have sex with each other for the express purpose of producing a child for a either the man couple of the woman couple.<br>
<br>
The point being, if nature had indeed intended homosexuality to be a population check (which I highly doubt), that has been and continues to be bypassed.<br>
<br>
I still don't see where all the hate comes from. If gays are indeed born that way, then obviously there is a gene at fault. Do we hate albinos? Red heads? People with green eyes? People that are colorblind? Or any one of a thousand other minorities that have nothing to do with us?<br>
<br>
I still don't see why anyone cares if two men want to get it on anymore than we care if one man prefers Hustler or Playboy. As long as he isn't bugging me, like running around the bar in a thong screaming &quot;I'm gay and I am proud and love to take it up the poop chute!&quot;, I don't see how it effects me.<br>
<br>
Am I gonna laugh at gays? You bet. I am not going to laugh at two men who live together and happen to hold hands in the mall while shopping, but I will laugh my ass off at some flamer running around in a pink shorts and and a flowered tank top and sticking his tongue down some guys throat in public.<br>
<br>
There's nothing funny about 'normal' homosexuals who live 'normal' lives like the rest of us, except that they happen to have a same sex partner. It's the flamers who act like idiots and insist on making a spectacle of themselves that deseve to be laughed at, just like a straight person who acts like an idiot deserves to be laughed at.<br>
<br>
Being gay should not (and does not) mean acting like a flaming idiot.<br>
<br>
Will I tease people about liking it up the ass or being a homo? You bet. I tease people about having a small dick or bing a retard too. I don't hate small dick men or retards just because I joke about it, and I don't hate gays either.<br>
<br>
The problem is, I see some definate homophobia in this thread... the type that is not just teasing for the sake of teasing. I admit that the last few threads were screaming for just that type of response (pasting gay erotica is just begging to stir up shit), but it's kinda sad to see how little it takes to incite hatred with some people.<br>
<br>
Ahh well, wouldn't be America if ya didn't have a percentage of people that hated some group for no other reason than being different I guess. <p><br>

<br>
Oct, my point is this - if you are born with a trait that isn't beneficial to survival of the species, than it is an abberation, not the norm.<br>
<br>
People do things every day that aren't beneficial to the species, but that is a choice that they make. When one is born with a trait that isn't beneficial to survival, than it is defect.<br>
<br>
If a man is born that can't eat meat, is it a defect? Or one that can't eat plants? In the case of humans, yes, because we evolved to eat what whatever was availible to us. It is part of what helped our species to survive since we could eat plants when no meat was availible. It may not matter today in the age of supermarkets, but it did 1 million years ago.<br>
<br>
A man being born who has no attraction to women is contradictory to survival of the species, thus it must be a defect. Like not being able to eat meat, it may not matter much today, but it sure as hell would have when we were just starting out as a species. Unless of course you can show me a theory where a certain percentage is born this way so they would not mate and simply serve the pack by protecting the breeders or something like that.<br>
<br>
Basic evolution - desired traits are bred in while defects die out.  Of course survival isn't the issue today that it was 1 million years ago. Humans have evolved to the point where we bypass <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> most</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the evolutionary process (medicines and procedures to save kids with life threatening birth defects for example), but that still doesn't mean that it isn't a defect.<br>
<br>
I am not saying that homosexuals should be looked at as inferior, anymore than I think people who are nightblind or left handed should be looked at that way. Our species is more than able to survive with a large percentage not reproducing. But to say it's natural means that there must be some benefit to having a percentage of the species be homosexual. I have no idea what that benefit would have been.  <p><br>

If you read it again you would notice that my diatribe is towards people with minority views that expect that the vast majority of people, who do not think the same way they do, will alllll change how they act for the sake of the person with the problem. When you live a minority lifestyle or have minority views the onus is on *you* to fit your lifestyle and views into your life. Noone else will do it for you and expecting them to is selfish and unrealistic. Being part of a minority is a harder path than being part of the majority, deal with it. <br>

On the other hand though, it's obvious which camp you fall into. How did you get that title again? lol<br>

<br>
There is a difference between expecting special treatment and expecting equal treatment. My posts were moved or deleted while others with similiar subject matter were allowed to remain.<br>
<br>
I may have gotten a title from that incident, but this board got a reputation from it. I can change my title anytime I want with a simple request, but the flame board is still under the effects of that fiasco after all this time.<br>
<br>
I find it kinda funny that you are taking a shot at me on something I can say &quot;I told you so&quot; on. But hey, whatever floats your boat. <p><br>
