<br>
Nowadays, you can be LFG 30-40 minutes, with 6-7 or more people in your immediate vicinity ALSO LFG. . . and still nobody will group up.  (a note: this is in KC and Velks)<br>
<br>
Observation 1: People SEEM to want the &quot;perfect&quot; group, and if you don't meet their gage of perfect.  Hence, everyone wants a 'chanter and a cleric. <br>
<br>
Observation 2: The social atmosphere of EQ seems to be changing.  It used to be QUITE social all-around, but now it seems to be congregating into cliques of one sort or another.<br>
Yeah, I have my EQ buddies too, who I'd group with more but they've gone past me (I took a sabbatical from EQ).  My wife has pretty much left the game, because she played for the social side as well as the adventure.  And it seems to be ebbing, IMHO.  Your mileage, of course, may vary. . . <br>

We all know what to think of promises from Verant, but in recent interviews, they have commented on that. Their response in paraphrase, is since PoP will not be an advancement in the visual qualites of EQ (they are adding a new spell particle effect engine, but that's it) they are more then anything, focusing on the content in this expansion. One of the things they are working on is bringing back the enjoyment of being able to pick a random group of adventurers and do stuff that can be quite enjoying. They even said they planned on making &quot;raid like encounters&quot; that can be handled by a single group. I have some ideas as to how they might accomplish that, but my guess is as good as anyone's.<br>

<br>
As far as the topic of your post... yes, I recall when pickup groups were more common.  They still are to a certain degree.<br>
<br>
I believe that part of the problem, however, stems from the fact that a lot of folks (myself included) find it difficult to trust random strangers with our virtual lives... especially in places like Karnors and Velks where anyone with the brainpower of a wilted cauliflower can and does level up.  Nearly every time I go there, I wind up wishing I hadn't... so I usually don't any more.<br>
<br>
What I will do is gather what friends are available at the time, and then fill out the group with people who have a good rep and/or are part of a guild I trust... its not a guarantee of excellence in playing skill, but it usually turns out a lot better than /shout enchanter LFG!!  in Velketors.  Do that, and you wind up in the safehall with 2 level 52 paladins, a druid, and a monk who thinks see invis is for sissies. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

You have fucktards like Morannan and Romy and Loveseeker just to name a few that can spoil the exp and fun of an entire group.<br>
When I am plying my cleric I am picky about the groups I join because I am interested in positive exp and with the rising number of idiots out there you want to be sure you are in a group with people that can handle their characters properly.<br>
There was a time when I had respect for all High Level characters and they all deserved the respect. Now many of them have gimped their way up or been powerleveled up and really have no clue as to the role they should play in a group.<br>

They eventually became packed because people started leveling up.  Finding a group could take a very long time sometimes because everything was camped.  Mid-Level zones at this time were not that bad.  There were a good number of them, and they all usually had a decent amount of people, but not so many people that there were long lists for camps (AFTER the rubicite was removed of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  This usually meant finding groups in these zones didnt take that much time.<br>
<br>
An expansion then came out for various reasons.  The level cap being raised and new zones relieved some of the pressure on the previous two high level XP zones.  Now one of the problems is a lot of new mid-level zones were added that were safer and just as good xp as the previous mid-level dungeons.  This caused the old mid-level dungeons to lose some populations.  They werent empty now, but sometimes getting a group could now be hard because the zone wasnt full so there arent as many groups that may potentially need more members, and there arent enough people LFG at the zone to go form a group.  The outdoor safe XP scene also caused some players to have no idea how to correctly play their class when they get to the higher levels and have to start grouping in dungeons.  Eventually lots of players started getting to high levels and the two new high level dungeons started getting overloaded again.<br>
<br>
Along comes another expansion.  Another highlevel xp dungeon was eventually added which was enough to keep all the high level xp dungeons at a decent capacity.  Remember leveling stopped at 60 because there was no AA yet and no new level cap to aim for, so while more and more people continue to enter the level range for the high level dungeon, more and more people also reach the point where they dont need to visit these dungeons anymore.  A lot of raiding content and faction work needed to be done also kept a nice deal of people who would be xping in these dungeons away from them at any given time.  The old world mid-level zones were basically killed by the addition of the few new mid-level zones.  No LOIO/OT/DL like zones were added, but they still draw some people away.  Old world XP dungeons are now BYOG or solo, in other words, dead.  High level XP zones are getting a lil crowded again because most of the hardcore people are 60, so most of the current batch of people fighting in the dungeons dont level as fast because they dont have as much play time, which means more people are entering the high level XP game than are leaving it.<br>
<br>
Now another expansion comes out.  VI knows that they need more high level XP zones because of the addition of AAXP.  The Grey/Maidens Eye/Fungus Grove in their initial states were too good and drew too much away from the old XP places.  They were nerfed, which was needed (I know that VI only nerfed them because the XP was too good only, not because the other zones were very low on people, but the nerfs did help the second problem also), but they were nerfed too much.  VI should have kept one of those zones in a state that it could be one of the big high level XP zones.  Fungus grove probably would have been the best for this because of it's huge capacity.  With all the people there finding a group never took long and there was almost always room for another group if enough people zoned in to form one.  The spawntime nerf cut the amount of XP groups it could support by more than 50%, which basicly made it BYOG or solo.  Seb also goes low on the group count sometimes because AE groups are there a lot of the time which can clean out 3 single non ae group camps.  It far outta the way, so running there with the chance that it could be a long time before they get into a group isnt apealing.  So now almost all of the high level XP zones do not have enough people to make finding a group something that will happen quick most of the time, and velks is now so crowded that finding a group can be very hard because it is almost always well over what it can support even  late at night.  This is why in almost every high level XP zone now, finding a group by going LFG and waiting can take a while, causing more people to just solo or form groups with their 'cliques' and going to a BYOG zone.  With even more midlevel zones added in this expansion, spreading the people out even more, a lot of older mid level zones are now dead, even some outdoor ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, this could have been prevent if VI though a little bit into the future when making expansions.  The goal here is to minimize the barely used zones that are made.<br>
<br>
Kunark should have only added one or two more zones for the SolB/LGuk level range.  Even now people there would still be a decent amount of people fighting in solb/lguk.  One outdoor midlevel zone and one dungeon mid level zone THAT ARENT BETTER XP AND SAFER THAN OLD WORLD MIDLEVEL DUNGEONS.  The out door zone will most likely be safer, so the xp should not be as good.  3ish full XP zones shoulda been added for 51  stuff.  1 or 2 BYOG type zones for people who dont like the packed environment.  The rest should have been raiding content.  2-3 group zones (which can be used as full raid zones for guilds at the naggy level) with full raid bosses at the end, and even a few full raid zones.  Any zone with the same level range as an old world zone should be dropping similar loot to the loot dropping in the similar old world zones.  This would keep the risk vs reward in the xp zones equal so the old world zones are abandoned.  The newer weapons and armor should all have been mostly coming from the multi group/raid places and a few pieces from the 51  dungeons.  This would have increased the life of kunark a great deal.<br>
<br>
Velious was pretty good.  Lots of raid stuff, and not many xp zones.  1 midlevel xp zone/1 solb level zone MAX would have been perfect had kunark been done right.  The few BYOG XP places are cool as they are, and the 1 high level XP zone added was enough.<br>
<br>
Luclin should have had no midlevel/solb/lguk level zones.  2 full high level XP zones might have been good to help handle the new AA skill people.  2 may have even been too many if kunark had had 2-3 with velious' one.  One or 2 more BYOG zones, and the rest high level raid content.<br>
<br>
