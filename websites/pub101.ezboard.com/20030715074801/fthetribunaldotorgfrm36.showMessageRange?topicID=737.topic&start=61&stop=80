Once again, I have to point out that its only preferral to not use the Earth as the physical center.  The fact that equations cannot be created by man to make a perfect formula for it being the center of the referance frame does not mean it does not exist; it means that humans are not intelligent enough to come up with those formulas.  Nice try at tooting your own horn.  Also, the formulas that are used if the sun is the center referance frame are NOT absolute neither.  They are estimates.  They happen to be more useful estimates.  It does not make the sun the only center of the universe (nor any other matter).  Technically this isn't even a &quot;Bible Beater&quot; issue.  Its strictly a scientific debate, and really doesn't belong here.<br>

<br>
What do ya mean? (I'm reading the question wrong or something, can you rephrase it)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The &quot;much is lost in translation argument&quot;, isn't too valid, a lot of scholarship has occured on this topic and the oldest existant manuscripts date to within a century of the new testament era. If you research it, we should be able to agree that we have a reliable copy of the Gospels and the letters of Paul. Therefore, one can reach the conclusion that the contradictions are inherent in the original document, and are were not introduced by translation. With that in mind, how do we explain the contradictions, we explain via the oral tradition. The stories related in the Gospels were not written down until many years after they took place. The contradictions were set down then. Do the contradictions invalidate God's message and Word?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I dunno who wrote that (not me), but its definitely irrelevant, and here is why:  Contradictions and error in translation/interpretation are two different things.  When we talk about &quot;contradictions&quot; we are talking about supposed contradictions if we use those original texts...those are what we are debating on.  When talking about &quot;translation errors&quot; or &quot;misinterpretation&quot; we are talking about reading what was written incorrectly (i.e. it doesn't necessarily have to be a contradiction to read it wrong).  When you pose &quot;contradictions&quot;, I answer by finding all possible *correct* interpretations and seeing if any can resolve that contradiction.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Count, Paul is not the writer of Acts. Acts was written by the same author as one of the Gospels (Offhand I forget which but it was Mattew's, Luke's or Mark's.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Yes, I am terribly sorry.  It was Luke, not Paul.  I was in a rush to get to Chicago for a trip.  I got home at 3:30 and had to leave at 4:30, unpacked, having to shower, and making phone calls.  Sorry about that.<br>

Now you're just going to make stuff up and pass it off as harmonizing the contradictions because &quot;it could be possible&quot;? That's not how it works.

I'm sorry, I gave evidence AND reason to support them.  I'm not trying to wiggle off any stake.  I never changed what I said in the beginning as to what my intentions were of doing.  My intentions were, always have been, to create a possible way that something is not a contradiction, which therefore destroys the proof of it being a contradiction (i.e. only a matter of opinion and choice of the beholder).  The fact that you are unwilling to accept this (which was clearly stated in the beginning, at the other forum) only shows that you have been beaten.<br>

<br>
<br>
Once again, where do you get this special insight into some hidden meaning behind these texts? What's your evidence that &quot;in this specific case they are synonymous&quot;? Just because you want it to be that way?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I got this &quot;special insight&quot; from the definitions of the two words, reward and wage.  Both are given after you complete an act.  One (wages) implies earning, while the other implies freely given as a result but not necessarily (but possibly) deserved.  The wages of sin is death.  That means your spirit WILL die if you commit a sin and God is a just God (a Christian claim).  That doesn't mean you will physically die as soon as you commit a sin.  Instead, the term &quot;reward&quot; is used in this case to represent how his act was one that obtained a reward of physical death.  It most certainly earned him (wages) spiritual death, but as for physical death, it was an added bonus (reward).  Using the phrase &quot;the wages of sin is death&quot; helps create an image of why God caused Judas' physical death to happen after a terrible sin.<br>

<br>
Not an educator yet.  Thats my last year of school, which is after this coming year.  As for historian, I've got one (?) class left to complete all the necessaries and graduate, so pretty darn close.  As for Bible Scholar, I study the Bible a lot yes, but I have not taken university-type classes at a good Christian school yet (yes, its necessary to go to a good Christian school because they are the only ones who are truly motivated to learn the Bible correctly).  As for the sarcasim of this post, I'm sorry, it just doesn't really get to me, ya know?<br>

No, the game of there possibly are and aren't *can* be played, but that is not our game.  *Our* game is that you said you proved there are contradictions while I said *possibly there aren't*.  You therefore say &quot;its not possible that there aren't&quot; and not &quot;its possible there are contradictions&quot;.  I never said that it wasn't possible to create contradictions (see previous posts on 'what your motivation for this argument is').

It may take a long time and a lot of effort to figure out how exactly they aren't, but its doable. This concept of the Bible being contradictory is ALSO crushable by the whole process I gave in my previous post. However, if your motive/goal is to prove that the Bible has contradictions in it...of course you are going to find them and further more wish to ignore any option of that being resolved. Its a matter of what your motive is. If you desire to resolve what seem to be contradictions, you can find ways, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ways that aren't just made-up with a little ignorance.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&quot; --<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Countic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
Not only did you say there are NO CONTRADICTIONS, you also say these &quot;apparent&quot; contradictions can be solved without making a bunch of assumptions and spin doctoring JUST LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I gave all that is necessary, your refusal to admit that you comprehende it does not cause my loss. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the verse:<br>
<br>
18 (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. <br>
<br>
19 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <br>
<br>
<br>
You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>insist</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> his reward was his death and NOT the silver.  The field was purchased, that's what the verse says.  The field was a real place, because that's where Judas died and the people in Jerusalem subsequently named the field &quot;Field of Blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The verse says he purchased the field WITH HIS REWARD.  You do not buy things with death.  If his reward was his death then HOW DID HE BUY THE FIELD?<br>
<br>
<br>
You also STILL have no provided any evidence that support your suppositions.  You say you have, been when asked to quote where you refuse to do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You still have two obstacles to overcome:<br>
<br>
1) Explain what Judas bought the field with if he didn't buy it with his reward, like the verse says.<br>
2) Provide evidence to support your claims.<br>
<br>
<br>
You refusal to do both will be accepted as your concession of the argument at hand. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A> at: 6/22/03 9:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 372<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/22/03 12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Countic - Bible Contradictions</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not only did you say there are NO CONTRADICTIONS, you also say these &quot;apparent&quot; contradictions can be solved without making a bunch of assumptions and spin doctoring JUST LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I guess &quot;spin doctoring&quot; means to use definitions of words in ways that are appropriate then.  I make sure to understand all possible meanings of words and phrases, and when I make them known its considered spin doctoring, ok thanks for letting me know that you are impossible.<br>

<br>
Gosh darn it man!  He bought it with his act of betraying Jesus!  Alright, let me *hopefully* get ya to understand this time.  Take a look at the word &quot;with&quot; can mean with me for a second.  &quot;with&quot; can mean to be an exchange, yes, but it also can mean to be included upon.  When it says he purchased the field with his reward, its very possible to mean (if looking at JUST this sentence) with the 30 silver pieces, with his death, OR to mean that the field was the place which would be included upon his death....i.e. where he died.  It doesn't have to mean he purchased it with his death nor the money.  It could mean the act of betraying Jesus &quot;purchased&quot; his death, and where it was to take place at.  Got it now?<br>

The evidence is in the definitions of all the words and phrases, the possibilities for them to be interpretted.  THAT is the evidence.  Since I'm not trying to proof that it HAS to be seen that way, but only that it CAN be seen that way, and that you are the one trying to PROVE that it CANNOT be possible to see it that way...the burden of proof is on your shoulders, not mine.  You have to prove how it cannot be seen that way.  If you are willing to accept the solutions as *possible* then there is no need for you to prove anything, and that also creates a *pass* of agreement on the subject, because that is all I am trying to do, thus we would be in agreement.<br>

If another definition fits, it can be placed into the sentence with the new interpretation as well.  In THIS particular case, your example does not make sense (typos??).  The definitions of headlong, and of how &quot;with&quot; can be used are acceptable and make sense with both sentence structure and the context of the situation.<br>

However, when you down that path, you very quickly reach the point of implausibility.  Sure, many things are *possible*, but not very likely.  It's a hell of a lot more likely that there ARE contradictions in the Bible, because regardless that folks like to believe the words are divine, they are not.  They were written by men, and written by men about which we really KNOW very little.  They were also bound into a collective works many, many years after they were written and were not written AS a collective works.<br>
<br>
Believe what you like, but I think Count is the first christian of MANY, that I have ever encountered who believes that the Bible is contradiction-free.  Pretty much every christian I have ever discussed these type of things will admit that there are inexplicable inconsistencies in the Bible and that they have no idea what the answer is, but they feel that one day it will all be explained.

Gee, it's not tooting your own horn when it's such a simple concept as trying to correct someone who was off on a geocentric tangent.  However, as much as you would like the earth to be a viable rotation point, it just can't obey simple mechanics (until you toss conservative theorems out).<br>
(btw, shenbahn:  I looked in my old mechanics notes, and I couldn't find a name; however, there was a blurb from the teacher saying that an inductive proof showed that non-physical corrections were needed for geocentricity, and the sum didn't converge until an infinite limit was taken.)<br>
You are right, however, in that the sun, being a star with a big lever arm, is not a good center either.  However, the first and second derivatives of motion are so small that the sun makes a decent approximation to being stationary, until our math and science catches up with the size of the universe. <br>

And you are probably one of the people that believes that statistic Wolvar gave that 80+% of the U.S. is Christian too, right?<br>
<br>

<br>
That is different than contradictions, ironically.  If it looks inconsistent, that doesn't mean its an all out objection.  I also believe in this idea that there are just some things in the Bible that I don't really grasp, no matter how hard I try.  It doesn't mean that it must be wrong.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;evidence&quot; for my argument, here are some definitions of &quot;headlong&quot; and &quot;with&quot; for you.  Then, I will place them into the sentence, just like you asked Hazzie.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>with    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (wth, wth)<br>

<br>
Notice that in these 19 entries (from dictionary.com, hopefully that floats your boat) <br>
one refers to the ability of &quot;with&quot; to mean purchasing/recieving.  Notice that of the 19 entries, 7 of them are used to represent &quot;in conjunction to&quot; or &quot;in addition to&quot;.  Obviously this form is more dominant than the latter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>headlong    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (hdlng, -lng)<br>

<br>
Notice two of the definitions mean head-first.  The other 5 mean uncontrollably, hasty, fast, clean, sheer, etc.  <br>

There is &quot;The Evidence: Part I&quot;, happy?<br>
<br>
The Evidence: Part II<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>18 (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Converted:<br>
<br>
In conjunction with the reward (physical death) he got for his wickedness, he also obtained a field; there he fell fast, hastily, and with a clean cut. his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.<br>
<br>
Alternate way:<br>
<br>
In conjunction with the reward (physical death) he got for his wickedness, he obtained the place of his death, a field; there he made a rash decision (to commit suicide for feeling the guilt of betraying Jesus).  his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.<br>
<br>
Both of those ways are completely compliant with the original text.  The only difference is the parathesis to specify, which should be read as sidenotes.  The other difference (that you are most certainly going to try and destroy) is where i said &quot;the place of his death, a field&quot;.  However, since it is a true statement, and only an extension/rewording of exactly what was said to make the sentence structure fit, there is no problem in doing so.<br>
<br>
I still haven't heard any reply from you about my alternate argument yet either...can you even come up with one?  In case you forgot, it was the argument that *if* indeed Peter was wrong, it would have been wrong of Luke to correct what Peter had said, when he wrote Acts.  Therefore its still true if Luke wrote it down word for word, and an error of Peter in speech.  Divinely inspired scripture is written, speech was never declared divine, therefore it can work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 714<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/03 2:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/tsukasa.jpg width=50 height=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Countic - Bible Contradictions</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In conjunction with the reward (physical death) he got for his wickedness, he also obtained a field; there he fell fast, hastily, and with a clean cut. his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is not acceptable until you show me where you're getting the &quot;with a clean cut&quot; from.<br>

<br>
I can accept that interpretation, even though &quot;in conjunction with&quot; is still an unsupported supposition, and even though you have transposed parts of the verse so that is not in the same chronological order as the original.  But unfortunately, the contradictions between Matthew and Acts are still not harmonized.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew says Judas hung himself.<br>
Acts says his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.<br>
<br>
Matthew says the Priests bought/obtained the field.<br>
Acts says, Judas bought/obtained the field.<br>
<br>
Matthew says the field is obtained <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>after</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Judas's death.<br>
