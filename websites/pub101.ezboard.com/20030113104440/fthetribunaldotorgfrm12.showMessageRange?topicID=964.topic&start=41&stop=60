Yeah he doesnt get your humor man, you need to make fun of gay people for him to laugh, or make some racist jokes but make sure you tell him you have a friend of that race because that makes it okay....See Loegan would be rolling in laughter at a Klu Klux Klan Rally where is his backwards thinking fits right in.

He is too sophisticated for fart and dick jokes, but he jumps right in with gay bashing and racism ( because he has gay friends and friends of different races ), so please curb your humor to tailor to him.<br>

That is just the opposite of what you flamed me for before LMAO<br>
<br>
I said that it was ok to make fun of gays because sexual PREFERENCE is a choice. It is not alright to make fun of race, because race is not a choice.<br>
<br>
See, I have fun laughing at the choices people make. I see no entertainment in jokes about something that a person had no choice in.<br>
<br>
It's funny when a guy who just got burned on the stove sticks his hand on it again because he is drunk. He made a choice. It's not funny when someone holds a guys hand on the stove cause he's pissed at em.<br>
<br>
It's funny when a guy rolls down a hill in a barrel and fucks himself up. He made a choice. It's not funny if someone forces him into the barrel and pushes him down the hill.<br>
<br>
It's funny when you see a homo prancing around in a thong and tank top at a gay parade. He made a choice. It's not funny to see a black man  forced  to march around dressed the same way by KKK members. He had no choice.<br>
<br>
Now I'll say it again, laughing at gays does not mean I support discrimination or physical attacks. Live and let live. But I do have the right to laugh at their behaviour and I do.<br>
<br>
Would I pick on a gay guy who feels threatened and hates it? No (at least not to his face).<br>
<br>
Will I make gay jokes with my gay friends who can handle it and make breeder jokes about me? Damn straight I will. <p><br>

<br>
He will surely ask something along the lines of &quot;Is it my job to amuse you on this board?&quot; to which my response will be: &quot;Your job is to do whatever I tell you to do, bitch.&quot; followed by someone more level-headed (Elche, Bacris types - also boring but at least somewhat witty at times) adding &quot;He's out of his element here.  He belongs on the reality and general forums because his posts are not appropriate for the type of content this forum was created for.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, he still won't get it, and he'll just post something else that would bore the shit out of a rock, and then Wolvar will jump in and back him up on it (after wacking it to some gay porn.) <p><br>

It was his choice to take  his martyrdom to AIM, and EVERQUEST, and E-MAILS, and YAHOO MESSANGER, and ICQ, and the LOCAL NEWS, and even a letter to DEAR ABBY. It was his choice to create a new messageboard and post on all the guild boards about a NEW TRIBUNAL community. (It was, however, our choice not to expend the considerable amount of time and energy envolved in a single mouse click to get there.) It was his choice to return here with his massive ego intact.<br>
It was Loegans choice to prove he is nothing more than a flip flopping egomaniac that can turn a perfectly good woman into a lesbian. And since this was all his choice then by his own code of standards we are all perfectly within our Loegan given rights to make fun of him for being the self righteous penis that he is.<br>
Yes Loegan, I appreciate your lies when you say that you never intended for your board to take the place of this one. I appreciate your lies about how your board just offered an additional place to air ones views and opinions without the fear of moderation. You never intended that. You lie everytime you state that. The proof is in the posts you left on the guild message board. A NEW TRIBUNAL COMMUNITY. Not an addition but a brand new place for everyone to come. You failed miserably.

<br>
Hmmm so Loegan, explain to me why it is wrong to make fun of someone's race, other then them not being able to make a choice about it ( Michael Jackson is the exception, he is the whitest black man ever ). Why because it helps fuels hatred and seperation. Your jokes arent as benine as you believe them to be, they do hurt people, they may not hurt your friends who know you are joking, but they dont stay there, you think no one else hears your words, that you are overheard at a bar, or even worse, maybe you do make one of your &quot;gay&quot; friends feel ackward. My older brother is fat, really fat, does him making the choice to be fat make it okay to make fun of him, to joke about his weight. It sure doesnt make him feel all peachy keen inside, even though I am his brother and I love him, its still insesitive and hurtful. It also gives open season for someone to pick up the reigns of my joke about his weight and keep it going, berating him, since I didnt see any problem making fun of him, how in good conscience can I tell others not to make fun of him?<br>
<br>
See that is the rub Loegan. You dont see the reprecusations of your bigotry and hatred, you claim you can make fun of people for choices, but unless you can prove to me and the world that you know Homosexuality is a choice, then you really should shut up and stop with your wicked and hateful jokes. How egotisical you believe you know that homosexuality is a choice, that you know better then millions of people who believe otherwise. Choice or not though, it still leads to hate crimes and gay bashing.<br>

How brave of you, how very noble and honorable you are Loegan, all your speeches about honor and loyalty and you admit to such a petty act of making fun of people behind their backs. More so, what I dont understand, if you are so sure that homosexuality is a choice and you are sure it is like making fun of a guy burning his hand, then why dont you make fun of him to his face? Because you are a coward? Perhaps, but I think it is because you know its wrong and you know you would get your ass kicked if you actually showed how much of a backwards thinking moron you are. *sarcasim*You know so well that sexuality is a choice, then stand up to these gay people and pick on them, you are brave enough to make fun of people behind their backs, why arent you brave and confident enough to do it to their face if you are right...? Doesnt really make alot of sense to me.<br>

Do you do a joke check everytime? Do you say the joke then gauge their reaction, and their breeder jokes about you, are they said after your joke or before? Now more so, do you check everyone in the room if your joke made them uncomfortable. See what you dont understand is your words carry, your way of thinking carries and can even change, from saying sexuality is a choice and okay for critiscim, to sexuality is a sin and open for murder or attack since they dont fit in....I dont really see how you can be so blind to this. For educated man, you sure show a lack of that education.<br>

Maybe he was proud about being himself, and strong enough to finally stop pretending who he wasnt to be who he was, see it wasnt a choice perhaps, the choice was to stay in the closet, avoiding assholes like you with your weird sense of humor, perhaps he no longer wanted to make the choice to hide, he is being who he is and that isnt really a choice, now is it. Unless you are telling me you choose to be yourself, or are you simpily yourself? You speak alot about sexuality being a choice, but being true to one self isnt real a choice, its a driving force, and his self was all about dancing in a thong and a tank top. You claim to live and let live, but you dont, you actually interfer with someone else's life with your jokes, breeding an atmosphere of hate, its so sad you are blind to see it.<br>

<br>
For the same reason it is ok to jump down an employees throat when they are negligent and cost you money, but it is not alright to jump down their throat if the market bottoms out and you lose money because of something they had no control over.<br>
<br>
For the same reason it's alright to jump on your kid for wrecking the car because he drank and drove, when it is not alright to jump all over because an old lady ran a red a light and drove in fron of him.<br>
<br>
The same reason you can despise a man who beats his wife and injures her, but it makes no sense to hate him when he couldn't push her out of the way of falling ice coming off the roof.<br>
<br>
Choices are things we have control over and thus are open to ridicule. If we believe in the choices we make then we should be ready to face the opposition of those who make different choices.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> My older brother is fat, really fat, does him making the choice to be fat make it okay to make fun of him, to joke about his weight. It sure doesnt make him feel all peachy keen inside, even though I am his brother and I love him, its still insesitive and hurtful. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Depends. If you make a fat joke and he is rattled by it, then you have to make the choice if you want to back off or not. Personally, I make fat jokes. I am a skinny mofo (6'2 and I weigh 145lbs). I get skinny jokes made all the time. If it gets to the point where it gets on my nerves, I tell them to back off, and I hope they have the balls to do the same. Either way, even if they don't back off, I am not going to go home and cry over it, anymore than I go home and cry over things said to me on the boards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> See that is the rub Loegan.

<br>
That is your opinion and I do respect that. Just like I respect people of the opinion that Eddy Murphy is offensive. That does not mean I have to mold my behaviour to your beliefs though. Respect is not the same as compliance.<br>

Again, this is your opinion and I am comfortable with that. I see a distinction where you don't, but your reasoning is honest and sincere. I don't mind having someone call me on shit as long as they are legit, which I believe you are in this case.<br>
<br>

<br>
I back off because I am not malicious. If I was the asshole you like to think I am, I would only go at them harder when I saw it was getting at them... that would be the perfect opportunity to go in for the kill. Believe me, if a rapist started getting rattled when I razzed them, there would be no backing off, I would try to get inside that mother fuckers head and scar him emotionally. But I have no such hatred of gays, so I back off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Do you do a joke check everytime? Do you say the joke then gauge their reaction</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Pretty much, yes. When a gay friend of mine razzes me and I say &quot;shut up you fucking cum guzzler&quot;,or he points out a woman he thinks I should chase and I say &quot;like I am going take advice from a guy who gets horny over Chipendale models&quot; ... if he suddenly said back off or showed signs of getting uptight, yes I would back off. It doesn't take alot of insight to see if someone is getting uptight.<br>
<br>

<br>
Good for him! And if he is so proud of who he is then my gay humor will run off him like water off a ducks back.<br>
<br>
Any man who prnaces around in a thong and tank top better fuckin be able to take some ribbing. If he is &quot;proud&quot; enough to look like an idiot, he should be secure enough to not care what I think about it.<br>

Is it cool to tell chinese jokes when you're sitting at a table right next to a chinese family?  Not really, DM is right about the fact that you should take into consideration the people around you as well as your direct audience.  Is it right to tell an offensive joke on the Flameboard?  Fuck yeah, If you come here to read the flames or participate in them you're guilty of enjoying someone else's stupidity, misfortune, fucked up online love affairs gone wrong, misery, etc... Don't bitch because the table turns from time to time.  If you don't like potentially offensive humor, then WTF are you even reading this forum?<br>
