The point of this thread is not that Legendary gimped their way into North ToV (general server consensus on this) or that they suck so bad they couldn't kill Aaryonar with 67 (proven fact).  <br>
<br>
 The WHOLE POINT OF THIS THREAD:  WHY DID CONNOVAR *LEAD* LEGENDARY INTO GIMPING INTO NTOV WHEN THEY KNEW THEY COULD NOT KILL AARYONAR?  Connovar is silent;  all we hear from anonymous Legendary gimps is 'You trained us, so we have the right to go into North ToV and gimp some shit.'  We hear nothing from the man in charge.  NOTHING.  <br>
<br>
You can't blame the guild members.   They go where told to go, kill when told to kill.  There is not one of us in any ToV capable guild that has not thought 'Dammit, the guild is raiding again.  I don't want to go.'  Sometimes you go, sometimes you just can't drive yourself to go to the raid.  When the guild leader determines what your raid is going to be, you don't really have much say in it.  <br>
<br>
They are only as strong as their leadership; and that's looking pretty fucking weak.  9 months ago they killed Tormax.  They still haven't killed Aaryonar.   Transcended first killed Vindicator 6 months ago.  We killed Roy a month ago?  Two months ago?  We killed Yelinak our first attempt, and have never failed to put that lizard on his face.  Three days before Connovar heard the call of the Sirensong, they failed twice against Yelinak, who is no where near Roy's difficulty.  They failed on Wednesday to kill Roy with 67 people;  Transcended's first kill was 39.  Our guild is not even a year old;  Legendary has been around since I started playing.  All the advantages are with Legendary.  Legendary is even better equipped than Trans;   they were doing Halls of Testing pickup groups during the days we were wiping to the first two mobs in those very same halls.  <br>
<br>
And all of your crying about Linkdeaths and 'we'll get him next time' is pointless.  You have had FAR MORE TIME TO KILL ROY THAN WE HAVE!  YOU JUST NEVER DID!  You'd rather go and kill Cazic Thule, or Innoruuk, than push yourself to your limits.  Transcended always pushes itself to the limits.  We used to go and die to Vindicator about once a week, with around 19 people, just to get better at it, so we could learn enough to put him down.  We die to stuff in Luclin all the time.  We go for harder mobs, than farm the easy stuff, when a choice is given to us.  <br>
<br>
Why?  <br>
<br>
Because the harder fight makes us a better guild.  It makes us Un-Legendary.  It shows us where our weak points are, and makes us work on them, or we spend the night doing cr, and fighting back to the same damn mob.  I hate Thinkness at times for doing this, but I understand why we do it.  This is why we can survive Flurry drake adds.  This is why we don't lose 25 people out of 84 to a single flurry drake. Anyone who has been guilded with me knows I bitch and rant about anything people do that is wrong.  THIS IS WHY I DO IT.  Many of my guildmates do not like me, because I never stop complaining during raids when people do stupid stuff, like creeping and attacking early.  But with our inferior on paper force, we go out and conquer shit that Legendary can't.  That's skill, training, and superior leadership.<br>
<br>
This is why we can kill Roy, and Connovar gets a poem and 5k worth of coffins for a present.<br>
<br>
You think that comps and E/V left Ntov because it's too HARD?  They left because they know that staying there will only lead them to stagnation.  It's the same reason guilds stop farming the Halls of Testing. <br>
<br>
You know, maybe my earlier analogy to Nixon is right in more than one way.  Maybe Connovar should retire, and Legendary should get a new guild leader.  Because Wednesday was definitely a Watergate level shaming. <br>
<br>
I don't expect Connovar to reply on the flameboard.  I do expect the weasel to make some sort of statement SOMEWHERE that the Tribunal Community can access about the accusations made against his ass.  From what has been posted here, he has lied to his guild.  That's a serious accusation.  I cannot remember when Think has ever lied to Transcended.  He and I have had situations where our in game friendship has been stressed, and we have had our disagreements over things.  But he and Wildien have put together a damn good guild.  And we're only getting better.<br>
<br>
To my guildmates who read this: Don't let this go to your heads.  Yall still act like 14 year olds during high school recess at times.  I'm still gonna yell at ya in guild chat if you screw up during raids.  And I expect you to do the same to me.  I'm definitely not a snow white angel perfect in every attribute, as anyone who has read this thread can attest. <br>
<br>
My goal for this thread was to prove beyond a doubt that Legendary lacked the skill to get into North ToV under their own power, that they deliberately went there knowing that the dragons were up and with the intent of killing them, and to shame them into wasting their time just as they wasted our time.  To find out that Connovar supposedly lied to his guildmembers was a shock.  And it's just icing on the cake that Connovar is utterly silent about all these accusations.  That's as condeming as him coming out and saying,&quot;Ok, yes, we went for them because they were up and it was a weekend when we had enough people to maybe get in North and kill some shit.  Fuck you.&quot;   And to my friend in Legendary that is probably eating heat because of those logs, let me know if you need a new home.<br>
<br>
Damn.  This is a Thinkness length thread. <br>
<br>
PS As far as Blargen, I noticed that when I told aallure to get the fuck off my thread, blargen showed up, just as clueless.  Coincidence?  Oh well. I'm sure Arleanna will hammer him after seeing his spamathon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uariarsagittar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ariar Sagittar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/02 11:32:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=996.topic&index=458>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LEGENDARY AND A BUNCH OF FAGS WHO JUMP GUILDS</span><hr size=1> The only reason Legendary hasn't killed Aary is that we only had 2 attempts at the dragon because of that stupid rotation!  Yeah, that's right 2 attempts.<br>
<br>
first 50%<br>
second 5%<br>
<br>
How many attempts did it take EV, Comp, AN, RNG, SI, or Trans before they killed Aary?<br>
<br>
Who wants to bet that the next time we are in NTOV, permitting the peeps in the rotation allows us (stupid rotation), that we kill it?<br>
<br>
To me all this rotation bullshit, and this post is to keep Legendary out of NTOV.  Kinda reminds me way back when when their was a Planes rotation.  What really makes me laugh are the peeps who were against the rotation system at that time, are now all for it, because it suits their needs.<br>
<br>
Give us a fair shot, and it will die, that I can guarantee.  And in time we will kill it, and all the dragons in NTOV on the same day beating your best record for clearing it.<br>
<br>
We have the great peeps, and great strats.  Those saying otherwise are just lying to themselves.  We know what we are capable of doing.<br>
<br>
I mean you can keep saying oh there was 92 Lego that wiped out in NTOV, all you want, we know it's not true, and your guildmates know it wasn't true.  Guess what, keep lying to your guildmates or other guilds, it will help us in the end.  You may end up losing your elite members in the process.<br>
<br>
We were told, Legendary can't kill Tormax, Cazic Thule, or Yelinak... well guess what those mobs are so easy to us now that we kill them with little or no deaths, and in record time.<br>
<br>
Fear Legendary, you have reason to!<br>
You have re-awaken the sleeping giant.  Thanks<br>

I think I saw all through the thread Transcended, and RNG telling you that you can have a turn if you just ask.  If its something of &quot;Why should we ask?!&quot; then you're on your own.  Just don't forget that this is a game of reputation.  Its NEVER worth it to screw people over or out of their hard work.  Stop talking about it, stop bickering about it, just do the right thing and say &quot;You're right, we attempted to break the rotation, but we'd like to be a part of the rotation, so could we get a chance at Aary again?&quot;  Unless you want the zone to go FFA, which is honestly the worst thing that could happen.  When you DO clear ToV alone for the first time, you will understand why.  Till then, don't say that the zone should be FFA. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
I think most of the posts in the last two pages is about getting some sort of response out of Connovar, and honestly I don't really care.<br>
<br>
But this whole chest thumping thing with one side accusing the other side of sucking, and the other side comes back stating that they do not, in fact, suck, is getting repeatetive.<br>
<br>
I don't think anybody has ever stopped Legendary from trying Aary, most only ask they stop trying when the guild up for rotation shows up. In fact RNG actually gave Legendary 24 hours to try, before this whole fiasco. In addition to this, I'm sure Legendary can muster enough people to try Aary after every patch before the current rotation guilds get off work, so the opportunities there. You can even talk the rotation guilds to set aside a day or two for you to try.<br>
<br>
All you had to do is ask.<br>
<br>
What's with this whole conspiracy theory of keeping Legendary out of NToV anyway? Did you see the same thing with AN when AN killed Aary but wasn't on rotation? In the end, all guilds who were able to kill Aary agreed that a rotation is the least painful thing for all of us, clearing flurries ain't hard, but it certainly ain't fun either.<br>
<br>
So, if a guild can kill Aary, it'd be welcomed into the rotation, unless they actually like clearing flurries for a dragon or two, because let's face it, everything except Vyemm will die within 24 hours of spawn. Probably even Vyemm if RNG or SI decided to go.<br>
<br>
In the end, all you need to do is talk to the current rotation guilds, and any one can give you 24 hours to try Aary if you let them know your intentions.<br>

Tell Conno to show some common courtesy (and sense) and ask ANY of the guilds in the current rotation when the next open slot is.  I can't imagint that it would be more than a couple of weeks, which, considering the respawn time, isn't long at all.  Believe me, for an official raid on a new level of mob difficulty, all the notice you can get is a good thing--some of your people will need last minute equipment.<br>
<br>
In answer to your question on Roy, I think it took us 3 tries (dead on 3rd, I mean).  Not positive about that number, but I seem to recall that it was the third attempt.  Can't help you on the other guilds.<br>
<br>
In a way, you're actually right.  This is a post to keep Legendary out of NToV--if you don't kill Aary, stay the hell out of NToV and don't steal loot.  It's a good rule of thumb.  If you DO kill Aary, welcome to the rotation!<br>
<br>
It's that simple.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to hear we've re-awakened the sleeping gnat.  Now if we can just jump-start it's sense of honor, honesty, or courtesy, things will be much nicer all around.<br>
