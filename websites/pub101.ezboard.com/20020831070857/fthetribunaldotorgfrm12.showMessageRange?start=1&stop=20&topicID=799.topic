<br>
I am fucking sick of all this PnP shit that has been floating around. It is like people are all of a sudden feeling that it is some sort of good thing. PnP is for losers.<br>
<br>
I was once Kill Stolen and then the assholes tried to invoke PnP on me. They were 2 grief players that lots of people had problems with. So I can easily sympathize.<br>
<br>
And that is why she is going on the list. Not because she just a fag who used PnP, but rather because she kill stole from you, then used PnP to try and cover her ass. Along with the fact that she used an exploit to kill your mobs is another good reason.<br>
<br>
Also, good job to the whole zone for constantly talking about the flameboard <p><BR>

What is the difference between invoking the PNP rules and Invoking the FCFS rule?<br>
Essentially it is the same goddamn thing. A total lack of respect for your fellow players.<br>
So its acceptable for an entire guild to jump another guild in a zone because they aren't in the rotation bla la bla bla but it isnt acceptable for a single player to jump a single player????<br>
<br>
This is pretty fucking hypocritical and you only have to open your eyes to see the blatant hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have always respected the camps and spawns of others and will continue to do so. I do, however, sit and chuckle at alot of the two-faced comments I see posted here. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

<br>
Guild rotations, scheduling, etc., was general made and agreed upon by the players. Sure, many times the offending party isn't involved in the compact, which is why the conflict arises. But, in general, it's a player-made, generally accepted arrangement.<br>
<br>
The PnP, on the other hand, was a lame, gimpish set of useless rules shoved down our collective throats because VI was too lazy in general to recognize and correct the actual problems. The same people that call the PnP into play are oftentimes the people that are the reason for which a PnP had to be made. Nobody ever agreed to the PnP, and it's simply a dipshit's way out of having to get up and find their own fucking camp.<br>
<br>
And, btw, Shareece did violate the PnP by attacking an engaged mob to begin with, so her calling it into play afterward and trying to give it some kind of validity fucks her over as much as anyone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=799.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=799.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=799.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=799.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=799.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=799.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=799.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
