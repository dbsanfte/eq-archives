You've got a few important things in there, but some I still have to dispute.  I won't disagree on the child care, health care, etc.. but they're all interlinked.  I work at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, our motto is &quot;To Improve the Health and Healthcare of all Americans.&quot; so I can understand the importance there.  I don't think he had anything to do with it though, I think it was Hilary.  I definately disagree with the foreign policy for the reasons explained by Caledhon in his post.  I will also disagree with you on the economy.  Even if you don't believe in the Reagen policy, you can't possibly think it would be possible to screw up the economy with the internet/PC boom of the 90's.  You wouldn't be able to screw up the economy if you tried in that era.  As much as you like peace and environment, without a military, we will be destroyed, and the world really would go into total chaos.  And I don't consider that an opinion. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

I have had 3 base closures in my state that I am aware of and only one had any negative impact that I can see. As to the other two, one was a communication station which was automated and still performs as before. The other was a long range bomber base which was easily consolidated into another.<br>
<br>
The one that I am not sure on is the recent NSGA (Naval Security Group Activity) base closure. NSGA performs many duties including communicating with our subs in secure code. However, Washington seems to think this bases duties can be consolidated with another and I don't know enough about it to say one way or the other.<br>
<br>
Clinton's plan was to make a smaller, yet more powerful military. Why use 5 tanks to do the job if you can use 1 advanced tank? Why keep 5 bases open to do the job that one can do?<br>
<br>
[edit] - I should also note that one of the reasons we had so many bases is because of the threat of a large scale nuclear attack. It's harder to take out a military that has many bases, though maintaining many bases is inefficient in many ways, both logistically and economically.<br>
<br>
Now that the threat of nuclear strikes is more on the level of a single strike attack it is not necessary to spread our forces out amongst a large number of bases.<br>
<br>
I think all of us can agree that in the post cold war era, we don't need the same size military as we did during the cold war. Of course, I am not saying the cuts didn't go too deep... peace can lull anyone into a false sense of security and the public did want a balanced budget which Clinton delivered.<br>
<br>
So I think we have some common ground here, it's just the numbers we might disagree on. <p><br>

Clinton balanced the budget which helped the stock market which improves the economy overall. While I agree 100% that Clinton had a good economic enviroment to work within, I think it is a disservice to imply he just took a hands off approach and rode the wave. IMO he took advanatge of the situation and used it to balance the budget (which is not an easy thing even in the best of climates) and maximized the benefits. <p><br>

<br>
Because one advanced tank can't be in two places at the same time.  How about 3 or 4 advanced tanks instead of 5 old ones?  Right now, if we were to be somehow involved in a two front war, which is far from impossible, we would not be able to field the forces necessary.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clinton balanced the budget which helped the stock market which improves the economy overall.&quot;<br>
<br>
And how did he balance the budget, mon ami?  By raising taxes and cutting the military, among other things.  *chuckle*<br>
<br>
There are some things I think Clinton did right... NAFTA (which also helped the economy - you have an excellent point there which you failed to mention) and welfare reform are two good examples.  But these, and other good decisions he made, simply do not outweigh the bad, imo.  Hell, even if he had been a genious and implemented the greatest policies every known to man, the simple fact that he lied under oath is enough to throw him into the political dumpster of my mind, so to speak.  The whole Lewinsky affair etc. leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I could have gotten over it if he had just come clean about it.  But to lie, under oath, to every American citizen?  The President!?  Whether it was his private business or not makes not an iota of difference, because what matters is his perjury.  The rest is just sad window dressing.  It wouldn't have mattered if the President had been caught breaking one of those ridiculous blue laws like &quot;Thou shalt not fart on the left side of the street in Waxahachi Wisconsin after noon but before the ducks walk the streets.&quot;  If he lied under oath about it, I'd still be just as pissed.<br>

I am afraid that you won't find many presidents that will meet your standards then. Politics is a dirty game and if you rise to the level of president it is almost 100% certain that you have bent or broke some rules along the way imo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> But to lie, under oath, to every American citizen?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The polls showed it wasn't the American citizens who wanted to know - It was congress. A majority of the public felt that it was none of our business and wanted the whole thing dropped. And let's not forget what the original mission of the Independent Counsel was and that the Lewinsky matter had nothing what-so-ever to do with that.<br>
<br>
So while you may believe that what Clinton did was shameful, I would contend that there is plenty of shame to go around when it comes to the handling of that whole mess. <p><br>

Loegan....Even defending Clinton you have to admit he did not just trim the fat...He screwed the military up really really bad. Bush has spent the last year piecing it back together and its still only a shadow of its former self. Some cut backs could have been made yes, However he nearly killed it.<br>
<br>
He had no right as the commander and chief to do some of the things he did....Like it or not he did sell secrets to china..Even if they were out of date missile specs they were still far more advanced then china had. Also the naval war ship that was hit by the dingy with bombs on it was horrible. You have no right sending men and women into a dangerous place without the ability to defend themselves. Say what you like about him but he was the worst military leader this country could have had.<br>

You could quote me from the &quot;The President Should Have Known&quot; thread, and it will look like I'm completely contradicting myself.  The difference, to me, is the motivation... Clinton lied under oath to save his own pathetic hide, not for the good of the nation or anyone but himself.  That is what I find disgusting.  Besides, even you ought to be able to admit that if he had just come clean about it, apologized, and said &quot;Lets move on.&quot;, then the majority of the public as well as Congress would have had nothing to go on.  You can't impeach someone for adultery... perjury is another matter, though.<br>
<br>
&quot;A majority of the public felt that it was none of our business and wanted the whole thing dropped.&quot;<br>
<br>
The majority of the public are unbelievably ignorant.  Call me elitist, but I know for a fact that it is amazingly easy to go through high school and even college without having a single clue how the government is run, or any of the principles behind it.  A lot of people do it... and then go vote when Politician X, Y or Z gnaws on their heartstrings enough.  9/10ths of politics is playing on the emotions of ignorant sheep.<br>
<br>
Solovey has an excellent point, btw... you will never hear it, because it is forbidden for any military officer in uniform to criticize their leaders publically.  But walk up to one on the street and ask their opinion, and I can all but guarantee that they will have harsh words about Mr. Clinton.  At least that's been the general opinion of every officer I've ever met... my father is an officer, but he was assigned to largely off-base posts for the last fifteen years, so when I was living with my parents I didn't get much chance to interact with any enlisted. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

Bush Sr. was the one who started the drawdown.  It started right after the Gulf War.  Yes the cuts continued but that REPUBLICAN majority in congress he faced for most of his office didn't put up much an argument.<br>
<br>
Also as to what Clinton did or did not do militarily.  All you seem to forget how much flak he took for evrey damn military action he took.  There was not the public support that is critical to do any more.  If Clinton had tried to actually go to war over the first WTC bombing there would have been dman near a revolt.<br>
<br>
We don't NEED a huge military like we had before and we can no longer afford it.  It IS too small but it also needs to be fundamentally changed.  We don't use a whole hell of a lot of tanks in Afganistan.  What we face is a lot of small brushfire and &quot;special ops&quot; type missions.  It needs to be a far more mobile and flexible force.   We do need a small core of a traditional army however but no where near what we have.<br>

No, Clinton wasn't perfect. Bush won't be either. And years form now, it won't really matter too much.

Does anyone consider this an an indictment of democracy?  The key question is did any of these winners get elected?  Sadly, I suspect the answer is most likely.<br>
<br>
Wasn't it John F. Kennedy who said, &quot;The ignorance of one voter impairs the security of all.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for William J. Clinton being the &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; of our generation.  The similarities are striking:<br>
<br>
One was the youngest man elected president.<br>
The other was the youngest president impeached.<br>
<br>
One dodged bullets in World War II.<br>
The other dodged Vietnam.<br>
<br>
One's words are quoted and taught in our schools, e.g., &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other's words are also quoted and discussed, e.g., Bartlett's Familiar Quotations includes three Clintonisms in its latest edition: &quot;I...didn't inhale&quot;; &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky&quot;; and &quot;it depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.&quot;<br>
<br>
One was assassinated, according to some, by a right wing conspiracy.<br>
The other's reputation was assassinated, according to his wife, by a right wing conspiracy.<br>
<br>
One spent tense moments in his office avoiding nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br>
The other spent tense moments in his office avoiding leaving incriminating DNA on a Cuban cigar.<br>
<br>
Two deeply flawed individuals.  One was a hell of a man.  The other was a hell of a politician.<br>

I'm sure he can stand up for himself without other conservatives rallying round and calling me pushy.<br>
<br>
During the Clinton administration, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation earned the suspicion of conservatives by helping to fund some healthcare reforms attributed to Hilary Clinton (note that Jaeron attributes healthcare reforms to Hilary above).<br>
<br>
It is therefore interesting to find someone with Jaeron's far-right views working for the RWJF during the second Bush administration.<br>
<br>
In a previous thread, Jaeron said the USA was not a democracy. I wonder if he meant it was an oligarchy, governed according to who has influence over money? Both sides of politics like to stack the odds in their favour on things like large funding bodies, and the RWJF would have to be a target now.<br>
<br>
So now that I've mentioned it, he can deny working in policy and place his start date during Bill's term in office.<br>
<br>
Anyway, being a hardcore EQ player he's probably just someone working in computers at the RWJF. But the combination of his views and his employer have gotta make you wonder. <p><br><br>
