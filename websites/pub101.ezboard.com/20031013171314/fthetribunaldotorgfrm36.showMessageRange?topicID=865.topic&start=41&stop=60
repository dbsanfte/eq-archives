I would hate to have to &quot;repeat myself&quot;.<br>
<br>
Destroying the original and making a copy results in a single physical copy of the intellectual property.  So the owner of the original copy could sue you for &quot;theft&quot; but the copyright owner should have no problem with this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course data is intellectual property, it's the primary reason FOR our intellectual property laws.  Rig's example is one way to defeat these laws, a loophole if you will.  However, modifying copyrighted information typically must be explicity allowed for in the licensing.  I doubt that the courts would agree that modifying a minor portion of the intellectual property would render a copyright null and void.  Unless you want to discuss reverse engineering?<br>
<br>
I think it's also quite obvious that copyright enfringement doesn't apply to &quot;playing things in your mind&quot;.  Try and be a little more silly would ya?<br>
<br>
As for conditions of stealing and not stealing, as I said, they are dependant upon the issues I stated.  The exact copyright licensing, the method of obtaining the copy and the use for the copy.  Copyright licensing varies quite widely and I don't see how to put it more explicit than that.  Perhaps you could suggest a scenario where something is considered illegal and you think it should be legal and that would be more productive.   <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1540<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 7:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> Reverse engineering is an important part of this in general, especially regarding software, but doesn't really have anything to do with music, since half the bands out there don't even claim to be original anyway.  I cringe every time I hear a few measures from a Mozart sonata or something stitched into the middle of some hoarse rocker's song, but when you buy the CD, you're paying for the performance, not the music being played itself.  That's why people can sell performances of Mozart, which is otherwise public domain.<br>
<br>
I'm not a lawyer, so I can't comment on our copyright laws.  I do think that the RIAA has got itself stuck in a major rut, and is steaming full ahead to someplace it doesn't really want to go.

Why not?  What is the difference between memorizing a song and keeping it my mind and downloading a song and keeping it in my computer?  In both instances the song exists in the &quot;ether&quot;.  Is the location of the song the only thing that matters?<br>

No, data is not the primary reason for intellectual property laws.  Intellectual property laws were created to protect <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ideas</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> such as Mickey Mouse, or an original poem, or research results, etc.  This way if you create something like Mickey Mouse and somebody comes along and claims it as their own, or uses it in a public forum without giving you credit, or sells it for profit then you can sue them.  Intellectual property also used to pass relatively quickly into public domain.  Until the DMCA that is.<br>

I guess we have no idea what the primary reason for intellectual property laws were but I would say that data is definitely the reason for the huge upsurgance of these disputes.  <br>
<br>
If you take a technical schematic of an existing copyrighted device, then you are not reverse engineering it.  You are stealing it.  Reverse engineering requires that your development be done in a vacuum with only conceptual ideas as the goal of your development work.  No technical details allowed.  Do you remember the huge Compaq/IBM lawsuit?<br>
<br>
My suggestion that you stick to scenarios where you feel something should be legal when it isn't was based on your disagreement with my response to your across-the-board question of what is and isn't legal.  It's a complicated subject and can't be cut-and-dried defined as you initially requested. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1541<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 8:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> &quot;Say I go to a store and take down a technical schematic of an RCA television.

<br>
If that schematic is copyrighted and you just grabbed it and didn't pay, yes.  Now, you probably wouldn't be prosecuted - at this point your situation is similar to those who just download a few songs.  If you started building lots of televisions to sell or even just give away to friends, however, you'd better expect to have RCA breathing down your neck with a lawsuit.  The situation isn't really comparable to music, though, except theoretically. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3920<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 9:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> I don't think so int he case of television as it would seem that the patent ran out long ago. Now if the TV had some special technology (I think Sony Trinitron had some new tech that is still patented) then you could certainly be prosecuted.<br>
<br>
As to subtracting a few bits from a song, maybe technically you have a loophole, but you know as well as I do that it is stealing. If a watch a movie and then convert to book form, isn't it still stealing? If I hear another persons idea for a product and then produce that product, isn't it still stealing even though they may not have patented the idea?<br>
<br>
You can thwart the intention of a law by using loopholes and technicalities, but in the end you have to admit, even if only to yourself, that you know it is stealing... at least if you agree that artists should be paid for performance. If you feel that all music is free once created, then you won't consider pirating stealing, but I think that is wrongheaded myself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigadoondemortis>Rigadoon deMortis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 9:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Interesting point Rig, however in order to modify it for re-distribution, (assuming that's legal) I would think you would need to purchase it first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What I'm really asking here is, at what point do you identify a copyright violation.  It's a series of 0's and 1's with the potential to play as an MP3.  <br>
<br>
Let's assume I didn't rip a song, but instead wrote a program that created very long series of 0's and 1's.  Eventually one of them would match.  If I publish all of my lists of 1's and 0's, could I possibly be violating a copyright?<br>

1) they would ask for recess and send the snippets to engineers to find the matches<br>
<br>
2) hiding behind technicalities is not going to do anything else than buying you time<br>
<br>
It's the content that matters, not the medium. Did you &quot;use&quot; that content without paying for its licence ? If so : you infringed a copyright. Playing back music without a licence is an infringement, whether you use an abbacus or quantum spin laser phased holotrons. From a pure legal standpoint, the RIAA is perfectly within its rights. The technology works both ways : you can pirate much more easily mp3s on the net, but just the same, the RIAA is trying to use the very same technology to track you down. Where i disagree is the heavy handed approach they are taking and the attacks on privacy that they are waging in the name of profit. I do not pirate MP3s : why should my rights be infringed by the fat cats of the RIAA ? At least i think they dropped some of the weirder fantasies they had right after 9/11.<br>

EDIT: Forgot to mention, and I think it's already been stated that copyright licensing protects the USE of copyrighted information.  Which is why whether something being legal or not depends on it's useage.  Can you write cocacola on a piece of paper? yes, but you can't slap it on a product and sell it.  By the same token, you can write 0's and 1's till you are blue in the face, but if you play them in mp3 format without being licensed to do so, you are breaking the law.<br>

When they tried to outlaw routers and about half of the internet infrastructure. They also came up with a few brilliant ideas such as trying to come up with infected MP3s that would broadcast information from your computer, or the &quot;Paladium&quot; Intel project. Most of those ideas are right up there in the privacy rights section. In other words : if i am innocent of piracy, why should i pay the price of having my rights restricted so that the RIAA can go ahead with their looney schemes ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2376<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 10:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=52>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> Well I would probably agree with you if any of those &quot;loony schemes&quot; ever got legalized or implemented. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1209<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> Well hey : it's not for lack of trying... you have any idea how much $$$ they spent trying to lobby this ? <br>

Larg and Wolvar: Personal attacks do not an argument make.

Your metaphysical babbling is irrelavent.  What is relavent (and the ONLY thing relavent in this case) is whether the copy is in a tangible form or not.  In the case of a song stuck in your mind, it may seem very tangible to you but I assure you, the rest of the world does not consider it tangible.<br>
<br>
In the case of a song stored on a harddrive, that harddrive is a tangible medium and the copy is in a tangible form, therefore the latter is in violation of copyright laws.<br>

Irrelavent again.<br>
If the material is copyrighted, the right to copy it or create derivative works from it is reserved for only the author.  That means, by scribbling it down on paper, you're reproducing the material in a tangible form and therefore it's in violation of copyright.<br>
<br>
Again, going back to your metaphysical nonsense, if you memorized that schematic and *never* write it down in any form whatsoever (whether it be on paper or on a computer harddrive), you are not in violation of reproducing a copyrighted material.<br>
<br>
However, the moment you create something from the schematic you've memorized, you're in violation of creating derivative works from copyrighted material.<br>
<br>
