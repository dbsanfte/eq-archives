When you say the name Tesla to anyone in the power generation industry you are invoking the name of the god of electricity. I'm sure when people in the medical field discuss your oxygen theory quack they do so with their tongue firmly in their cheek. <br>
<br>
Next time find someone that people in the field actualy don't know and respect if you want to make that argument stick. Steinmetz would be a better choice. Not much better, but it would sound less stupid then infering Tesla is not well known. <br>
<br>
Hint: just because someone wasn't in your 8th grade science book does not make them less repected in their field of study. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Kittenslayer</a><BR>

I was just about to go off on his serpentine moon path post. You saved me some typing. Although you might want to educate him on why it does resemble a sine wave over time. Not that it will do any good. He'll just bombard us with the theories of the famous and well respected astronomer Ptolemy to prove his argument. Maybe he'll say Ptolemy was just misunderstood like Tesla was!

I don't have time (as I'm about to leave for work) to rebut everything right now, but just a few quick points.<br>
<br>
One, learn to read holdan.  Warburg did win 2 nobel prizes, one in 1931 and one in 1945.  Apparently when I said he was not allowed to collect the 2nd one because of the year, the fact his name was warburg and the fact he was german, you couldn't figure that out.  Sorry for the riddle...but it concerns a man named Hitler. Look that up. Next.<br>
<br>
Every statistic I have down there is true.  I wondered why you were so quick to dismiss them but your little slip of 'we have a saying in the medical field' told me...chill dude, I'd be pissed if I learned everything I do is harmful and could be avoided too.

Well, that's all I have time to respond to for now cause I gotta leave, but 2 other quick points.  Arleanna, I was just calling out Tesla because he isn't taught in schools,  isn't  mentioned in the Smithsonian, hell you ask adults who the greatest inventor is and how many do you think will say Tesla?  The guy has something like over 7000 patents. Hell, he invented the electric ignition for cars, do you think the autmobile industry knows him? In his field he's a god? Well yeah, I should hope so.  Understand that in medicine however, everything they know is taught by pharmaceuticals.  Pharmas don't teach prevention.  Anyways, I brought that up as an example to bakamon because sure as hell HE hasn't heard of him.<br>
<br>
As for the moon thing, hey like I said my physics teacher explained it all, I probably didn't do it right.  Physics was never my strongpoint.  I will do myself a favor though and get a fucking astrophysics book though, because I don't know enough about it.

Marijuana's a plant...it grows, you pick it, dry it, pack it up and burn it.  Mushrooms are fungus.  And I'm sure I can argue the word 'abuse' too.<br>

Intrigued - if he's gonna start chemo he might find weed helps with the pain.  Otherwise, I believe smoking weed helps prevent you from getting Parkinson's disease (which is a total lack of dopamine, which thc helps to stimulate).  Of course, once again, that's another thread entirely.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Ladmo -- I don't have any plants.  I wish I did but the risk is too great.  I could rape and murder someone and be out of jail in shorter time than if I had plants growing in my house.  Until that little discrepancy is addressed I go on paying top dollar to buy from some mediary.  Damn CIA price gougers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubakamon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakamon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 11:59:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Thank you very much Holdan for presenting the information needed to wreck this house of cards.  As happened here, most zealots build their case on selective logic and semi related information.  Their subject is one that people Want to believe and will believe even in the face of growing proof otherwise.  When one or two select pieces are proven false, mis-represented, or just pure lies, then the whole farbication must fail.  I had neither the time or resources to dig as you did.  Thanks again.<br>

The printed word can be a powerful thing.  A published study may be a flawed and biased gathering of information, or it may be a golden piece of work leading to marvelous things.  A study presented in the AMA Journel may be reasonable, logical, and apprear completely viable, but I'm betting there will be a number of other studies on record having different or completely opposite findings.  There might even be stuides that would provide the information needed to mate Ladmo with a rare form of Arkansas razorback that would produce a hairless swine capable of drinking cheap bourbon, that would smell good, and that would write complete sentences with capatilization and punctuation.  Now there's a Real project for a pot smoking, sroom eating researcher to take on.<br>

One other point D you can maybe explain to me.  Saying your &quot;product&quot; (what ever you want to call it), will prevent cancer.   Is'nt what you are saying absolutely unprovable?   You can feed 10k volunteers your product and 10k others instructed to never trouch your product, and after 5 or 10 or 20 years measure what every you want.  It is will be absolutely impossible to prove our product Prevented anything.  Pure chance or luck may have prevented it; or your own makeup; or green ju ju bees.  You Can state that the volunteers using your product had more or less incidents of something, but you cant prove your product was the actor.  It might even be the covering on your product, or the filler used in making it, or even the 1% animal parts allowed by law.  It might just be that cockroach legs prevent cancer!   <p><BR><center><img src=http://bakamon.freeservers.com/mysig/Bakasig.jpg width=400 height=150><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulargthemiserable.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 12:47:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Ladmo's golden if cockroach parts cause cancer.<br>

Arleanna, I've never crunched the numbers, but I thought the oscillation about the mean distance from the earth to the moon was more of a superposition of sine waves due to the varying gravitational forces in time as 9 stellar bodies and a shitload of satellite bodies around said 9 stellar bodies orbit a large star.  Though, to first order approximation, you really only see 1 due to the three-body interaction of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun (because to first order, those are the large-scale gravitational forces that affect the moon).  The other stuff is minor because the gravitational force between them goes as mM/(r*r)  (mass of one body times mass of the other divided by the square of the distance between the two center of masses).  Hurray for science, now back to my conjecturing on fluid dynamics in a foam at work. <p>Jaggedspine Infinitelysad, Phalanx<BR>60 Barbarian Shaman, The Tribunal<BR><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97215>My Stuff</a><BR><img src=http://www.umr.edu/~clloyd/Sig.bmp><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 605<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 1:30:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Dygitalis leaves are great for salads :) add some Yew berries for extra flavor.
