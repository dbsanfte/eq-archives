Sure this forum is a bunch of bullshit.  We all do it for our own entertainment.<br>
<br>
But what I am talking about is flaming with heart.  Sure, sometimes I just make up shit to be funny, we all do.  But when I make fun of Camthan for being gay, or you for turning your ex-wife lesbo with your small impotent dick, or Aatlaar being a deadbeat jobless goth freak that mooches off his girlfriend, or Octracula for being the saddest dork I have ever had the displeasure of coming accross, or Xanta for being a fat psycho cyber slut, or Darkmask being pitifully sad and lonely for cyber relationships, or Bowynn for being a sucker for fat thief chicks in wheelchairs, etc, I really mean it.  I really enjoy exploiting their weeknesses.<br>
<br>
But by calling me Fag or &quot;Estefag&quot;, that means nothing to me.  It doesn't hurt, it doesn't cut deep.  The only thing it does is show that the poster has not an ounce of brainpower to think of something worth saying.  And just because I know Xavre in real life, am I supposed to think &quot;Xavre's in jail!&quot; is a flame against me?  No, it would be a flame against Xavre, but really it's just a dumb, redundant thing to say.  <br>
<br>
Taking this forum seriously is not the issue.  What I am pissed about is the lack of real flaming that goes on here.  Flaming comes in 2 forms: 1)  Being honestly hateful, spiteful, or angry at someone, or 2) Just fucking with someone, but in a funny, witty, original way - I.E. not the same stupid shit over and over to fill space on the boards.  <br>

You make quite an impressive arguement for you own ignorance.  Just because I refuse to follow some linguistic rules made up by some jackasses years ago, I'm stupid?  The primary function of language is communication, as long as people understand the intent of my posts/speech my presentation is irrelevent.  <br>
<br>
To proclaim yourself more intelligent than me simply because you can follow an obscure set of rules, that are relatively unecessary, makes me pity your obvious lack of anything remotely resembling an original or intelligent thought. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> &quot;Yeah, bards are reaching the point where being &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; really means &quot;good at a couple things and sucking at the rest&quot;&quot; - Absor </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

First off, me being gay isn't one of my weaknesses. Secondly, any post you have made hasn't had an effect me or my life one bit. I, like most people here, come to vent, and have fun. You are the one trying to make it all personal. We don't give a flying fuck. I know god damn well that Aatlaar isn't affected by any of the weak pathetic wastes of bandwidth you call flames. Loegan isn't THAT upset that his wife left him for a woman, since he gets hot lesbian action out of it. Xanta isn't affected by you calling her names, Bowynn couldn't care less about this board, his relationship with Razzine, and anything you think is gonna eat at him. <br>
<br>
You're assuming that all of us are as affected in real life by these things as you are. Unfortunately for you that assumption is wrong. <br>

Has anyone ever used the &quot;You all know I own you but you just won't admit it&quot; flame more than Estevan? I really think not.<br>
<br>
Seriously, dude, you're obviously cracking. The repeated pwnage is getting to you, and it totally shows. Jesus, this might be the most pathetic, attentionwhoring, admission of utter pussiness thread I have ever seen on the FB. It's that bad- I mean, it's like watching the poor fucker just unravel. He's toast.<br>
<br>
And, once again, you couldnt get through a single entire flame without bringing me up.

<br>
Are you under the impression that this is the Olympics or something like that? This is a forum for release and recreational bullshit. To try and drum this up to be anything more then meaningless is extremely pathetic and only gives further insight into your opinion of the flameboard, not ours.<br>
<br>
You speak of knowing everyone's tells and how you would walk away with all the money when it is you who is so transparent. Since the day you started flapping your gums on this board you were on E/V's cock. I made a few posts mentioning it because I found it so humorous how much Xavre and you were trying to &quot;subtlety&quot; amuse the older kids so that you might be considered cool enough to be brought into their clique. Your joining that guild was very predictable. What was even more amusing was your instant addition to any conversation on any board about the present end game encounters in Everquest. Your awe of the new content you were seeing was very apparent and also amusing because it gave insight towards the real person you were, allot of talk..very little walk.<br>
<br>
Lastly, coming here and attempting to lord your victory over Aatlaar's head shows me only one thing; that in your real life, your personal victories are so few or so small and inconsistent that it is a necessary outlet for you to come here and do what you do so that your mind does not stray to darker thoughts that involve pills and guns and razor blades.<br>
<br>
I'd pity you, but that would take half an emotion to do. So I just look at you like one of those poor caged animals at the zoo, thinking it would be nice if I could do something to make your life better, but realize my daughter would not be able to laugh at you then and so I walk off, quickly turning my thoughts to something else.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=206250"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fazzarya Ayrazzaf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arcanist<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.solinvictus.org/eq/">Sol Invictus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dumai01>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Messiah of the Flameboard</span><br>  Posts: 400<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/11/02 7:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I like my new sig</span><hr size=1> &quot;I was really good friends with Bowynn for a while, and I know he never takes any of this shit seriously.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong.  Bowynn hates me because of things said on this board.<br>
<br>
As for estevan, you were not the first to go against the popular tide of the board, that was me.<br>
<br>
You were not the first to hit below the belt on this board, that was me too.  And I am better at it.<br>
<br>
While more people find you distasteful, i'm confident that i elicit far stronger emotions--especially from people like Bowynn, Loegan, DM, etc.<br>
