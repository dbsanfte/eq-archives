<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> E/V Clears Plane of Growth <br>
<br>
The Elitists and Vagrants stormed through the densely populated expanse of the Plane of Growth, laying waste to all of the extraplanar denizens. This arduous effort, cuminating in the flawless execution of our Chain Remedy healing technique, resulted in the death of The Mother of All. We owe it all to Ganndor's Manarobe!<br>
<br>
Earlier in the evening, the Avatar of War coughed up a pair of barabarian masks and a bow, and some gnome entrails <br>
<br>
No zonelines were trained in the making of this film</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Like it wasnt obvious enough its sarcastic, the new updater even put a mention to Ganndor's manarobe in the same paragraph, so it could be even easier to make a link with the Revolution-RNG story.<br>
<br>
I know that clearing PoG is frustrating and boring at best (especially if it took you 36 hours?!?), and to lose against the uber mob you were looking for isnt much for the rejoicing either, but geez, if you cant see the sarcasm in this news you are a retard. That was a fucking joke. What should we do the next time? Add a &quot;The next lines are meant to be a joke!&quot; then go on with the news update? Or, wait, humor isnt allowed on the websites of this server because our number of retards not able to get the jokes is too high? <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://pages.infinit.net/kerosene/sigfinal.JPG"></CENTER>

As I'm sure everyone reading this knows, Legendary spent over 12 hours yesterday in the Plane of Growth to get our first attempt at Tunare.<br>
<br>
We got our attempt, and we put her down to 25% on our first ever try. Unfortunately that was the best try of the night, and we called it after 2 more unsuccessful tries. It was one hell of a learning experience and left us with little doubt as to our capabilities.<br>
<br>
For everyone who wants to, read evguild.org, where their updater, whoever he/she is this time, decides to take a jab at us and provoke us into flaming by claiming that THEY cleared PoG. This is a take-off of the big argument that occurred when RNG wrote on their site that they had &quot;Cleaned out VP&quot; when Revolution had in fact killed the first however many mobs.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for an angry response, you can have it. Fuck you. If that is what you're looking for there it is. I'm just disappointed because of the total lack of respect shown, and I'd like to hope that this is an error of the same ilk made in the previous website confusion, and that their updater was simply misinformed - but I'm pretty sure that's not the case. <br>
<br>
I guess I take a lot of things for granted, and some people might call me naive, but I would expect better from anyone. That's all I'm going to say about it, though some of my guildmates may have some other things to say....<br>
<br>
On a better note, I took a lot of screenshots in PoG yesterday for use in today's update. Sorry to all that the update had to be interrupted.<br>

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, you are seriously upset about this. You really want credit for clearing the plane real bad. At this point I dont know who cleared it, SI says they did, Legendary says they did. Talk among yourselves and figure it out. And it wasnt written to provoke you to anger or to flame, but to make you laugh, apparently some of you are very sensitive and lack any sense of humor.<br>

If we were taking a jab at you, you would know, but we didnt really care who cleared the plane as it was empty, thus the joke about us clearing all of the mobs there and praising Ganndor's Mana Robe.<br>

We werent looking for an angry reponse, thanks, ~ la~ LOL friend. What kind of respect would you like though? a metion on the web page, thanks to Legendary and SI??

  Congratulatons Serpento, you can read something you heard on the boards, assume it is fact (because this is the flameboard, everything is true right?), then repeat it like you actually have a fucking clue what you are talking about. Why don't you get some better intel before you make yourself look like an even bigger idiot. <br>
<br>
  Secondly while it is extremely amusing to see some of you children bickering over the most trivial of issues, it does get old fast. Hopkins I dont know what the hell you were smoking when you made that post, it really didnt make much sense. I am hoping you are just trying to save face by continuing to defend it and you are not actually that stupid.<br>
<br>
  Lastly, for those of you that feel the need to belittle other guilds for what they can or can not do, all I can say is this: If it really helps you feel like more of a man to talk down to other players in a game that has zero bearing on real life then I wont take that away from you, you must need it pretty badly from what I have seen. Some of you seem to be missing the big truth that it is a game and we all pay our 12.95 per month to play. No person has the right to tell any other person what they can and can not attempt/kill within the bounds of the policies set forth by Verant.<br>

I saw about, because some people brought twinks on other computers to loot armor.<br>
<br>
For killing the bitch guardians we had 28 people, we did try her with 28 peeps, but we failed because Mojak sucks and she despawned, so we had people log, as it was hitting about 1am in the morning. We had planned to take the night off that night, but the guild was restless and saw SI wasnt farming PoG and decided to give it a go later then we usually start raids.<br>
<br>
    For the people that stayed, she was back in her tree waiting for me to aggro her and spawn her again, so we gathered what we had left and went after her, I believe we tried her four times that night. So we did try her with more, but it was about 18 people we had for the second and third try that got her down to 30% and then she literally kicked our ass all over the plane. I dont know how many we had for out last try but I know we sucked on the last one but we did try something out that proved not to work at all.<br>
<br>
Sorry I dont exact statistics for you, seeing as you depend on them so much, I am sure you have records of all your kills. Now that I have answered your questions, can you answer mine, what did SI clear, how long did each mob take to kill, what was the number of hits on each mob by each player, what way was the sun facing, how many of your guild was wearing blue when doing this, how many epics where in hands of people who didnt swing them, what is the average speed of a north african swallow.<br>

   Gumor - &quot;we dont belittle other guilds for they can or can not do&quot;<br>
<br>
I am not going to waste my time looking through the boards for all the instances where your guildmates have done just that (and wasting your time by posting them here), because anybody who reads these boards knows exactly what I am talking about. <br>
<br>
About the NTOV issue, I am not going to express an opinion either way.. but let me just say this.. it was up, we do not acknowledge the rotation, you do not own the zone therefore can not tell us what we can and can not do there (within the bounds of the rules set forth by VI), we were there first and had the numbers, your guildmate trained us at the zone in, then your guild moved into position while we were rezing.<br>
<br>
 My advice is to grow up, stop acting like children, go do something else and come back another day.<br>

I strive to improve my living conditions by hoarding gold, food, and sometimes keys and potions. I love adventure, fighting, and particularly winning - especially when there's a prize at stake. I occasionally get lost inside buildings and can't find the exit. I need food badly. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

<br>
We had about 10 people CoH'ed into Aary hall already while Legendary was still at zone in.  Connovar was slick enough to  come to Aary hall and try to train us with chickenshits.  But he ended up dying cause he wasnt slick enough to realize that we are still not KoS to CoV.  So he stood by the firepot in Aary CoH spot while half a dozen chickenshits bent him over as we laughed at him.<br>
<br>
So guess what, you werent there first.  We were removed from Aary hall because people said stupid shit in /ooc and we got banned from ToV for 24 hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, how can you say you had the numbers when you are wiping out with 90 (if Chutoi's info is correct and I have no reason to doubt him) people?  Are you talking about capable numbers?  Then wouldnt that be like around 200 people for Legendary?  Cause hell, we had 10 people in Aary hall and we were ready to clear chickenshits and we've been clearing through North with about 35-45 people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/userpento.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serpento</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guildwar Supporter aka <BR> Has a Freakin Pair.</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/02 10:57:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Step fourth ass fuck from Legendary!</span><hr size=1> Kalstadus..plainly put you don't need anyone to belittle you..you assholes do it all on your own.<br>
<br>
So if I am wrong..tell me how many clerics you had for your wipe out on Yelinak? <br>
<br>
So you say you don't acknowledge a rotation..why is it then that Legendary was going to have there shot on Aary soon but you couldn't wait one week?<br>
<br>
Now you say you don't acknowledge a rotation..that's good..cause you dumb asses just fucked yourselves over.If EV/Comps can agree to rotations and stick to them it seems to me that anyone with a logical thought would do the same..it is a benefit because then you know you can count on getting the zone.So enlighten me Kalstadus with your infinite line of bullshit. <p><p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=144235"><B>Serpento Ky`Shen</B></A>60 Grandmaster<p>

<br>
Due to the sheer volume of encounters and loot dropped this may take a few days to compile. Your patience, as ever, is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Should you ever feel that any member of Legendary has acted against the policies of the game, please feel free to use the petition system. Legendary in no way condones behaviour which flouts the policies set down by Verant (tm), and in-game customer services representatives will act quickly to deal with all who violate such policies if conclusive evidence is produced, as was demonstrated recently.<br>
<br>
Safe travels to you.<br>
