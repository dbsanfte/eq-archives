<br>
Which is one of the big reasons we shouldn't be there. This fighting a war with kids gloves is costing the lives of our troops, yet we weren't attacked and shouldn't be there, so we have to play this out like police instead of soldiers.<br>
<br>
During a war, we should never protect enemy civilians at the cost of troops lives. That is why fighting a war for anything other than self defense (or defense of an ally or a country who requests help) is bullshit. It changes the rules and those changes are not beneficial to our troops.<br>

I'm saying that because I'm sick and tired of the United States trying to play Mr. nice guy and getting screwed in the end.<br>
<br>
A maintenance crew comes in behind the front line, gets caught by civilians posing as mercenaries(or so that's what I heard) and then they are tortured and executed.<br>
<br>
Next we have iraqi troops pretending to surrender then opening fire on our troops.<br>
<br>
The order should go out to all coalition ground forces to shoot first and ask questions later.<br>

A civilian can pick up a gun and use it just as easily as a soldier.<br>

<br>
I am a Active Duty Marine with over 7 years of service, I don't like to see people I know die or get shot.  We have been around the world together and now they are dieing while I am stuck behind in the mainland waiting for orders.  <br>
<br>
You need to realize that warfare is not a game, I don't care if your a soldier in uniform or a civilian in a robe, if your holding a gun in my direction I will shoot until either your dead or I'm out of ammo.  <br>
<br>
Personnaly from what I have seen, I do not feel this war is warranted for the reasons mentioned by my Commander and Chief.  We as Marines have no choice but to do our duty as we have sworn to do, even if we do not agree.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with degraging people based upon race, creed, sex, or nationality.  If you do something wrong then I will judge you accordingly.  It is hard to teach the younger Marines that you can't just kick out &quot;every&quot; Muslim in the country because of their religion.  America is founded on Liberty for all and Equality reguardless of your background.<br>
<br>
I was at the Pentagon when it was hit, I helped the wounded and pulled the dead from the ruble.  I was at the National Cathedral when President Bush spoke days later.  I was in New York on September 18th and saw what was left of the towers with my own eyes.  I have stood post in hostile countries and have seen people die to land mines and gunshots.  For many of you, it is on TV and not a reality, someday one of your friends or family members will die in a car accident or violent crime, then maybe you will begin to understand what we as the Military endure more often then most think.<br>
<br>
The reason we don't invade North Korea is not because of China, but rather there is no monitary gain by doing so.  If you have never looked at at Topographical map of North Korea, you might want to look at it.  The area around Injun River (Along the DMZ De-Militrized Zone) is such that you can not use most modern equipment because you can not manuver.  We would have to resort back to 12th Century tatics using combination of Infantry and light mounted Calvery supported by Artillery and Close Air Support.  The North Korean's know this and use the terrain to their advantage.<br>
<br>
We would not use Nucluar missles based upon the idea that there are to many automated missle systems throughout the world wired to fired at any sign of ignition by what they deem as a hostile country.  <br>
<br>
China has a Large Army, Navy, Air Force and they have the dedication of over 1billion people, We as Americans could never invade and take full control of the whole country ourselves, there is just to much land and to many people.  On the same note, China could never invade America and control the whole country by its self either because they would have to get past Canada, Mexico and Japan because it is economicly better to have the US for allies then it is to have China and even though none of the other countries posses a large enough military to pose a signifcant threat to China by themselves, combined Arms would prevail on domstic soil.<br>
<br>
Many of you think War is a Joke, to some of us it is a grim reality, you should have seen the look on my wifes face when we had to make out my will and put my financial matters in order.  She knows that my 6 month old son may have to grow up without me should I get orders.  That is the reality of War.  We are not faceless nor heartless, we all have lives we leave behind when we are called to duty.<br>

MY SON IS GOING TO WAR - A Personal Perspective<br>
<br>
By Frank Schaeffer<br>
<br>
John called to say it was official. &quot;I'm going Dad.&quot; &quot;How do you feel about<br>
it?&quot; I asked. &quot;A little nervous,&quot; John answered.<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago that was how my wife, Genie, and I got the news that our son<br>
John would be deployed to the Middle East. We have been dreading this<br>
moment, glad that up till now John was posted to bases in South Carolina,<br>
Arizona, Florida and Maryland. Young Marines crave adventure We Marine<br>
parents pray for boredom. This has been an unsettling winter of deep snow<br>
and rumors of war. Iraq? Korea? Afghanistan? Genie is quieter than usual. I<br>
snap at her over small things. The ground feels brittle under my feet. John<br>
is going to war.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the most precious objects in our home are three little wire<br>
figurines John made. They sit on my computer monitor. One is a man with a<br>
quill pen. The second is a reader holding a book. The third is a warrior<br>
with shield and sword. John fashioned these figures from the wire fasteners<br>
that held the corks in place on three champagne bottles. We drank the<br>
champagne at his twenty-first birthday party a year ago. Wehad the party --<br>
several months after his actual birthday -- when John could get home from<br>
his base for a brief leave. Sitting at our kitchen table John twisted the<br>
wire with his strong beautiful hands. Then he tossed the little figures over<br>
to me with a casual &quot;Here Dad, these are for you.&quot; The three small<br>
sculptures sum up John for me: poet, student and warrior.<br>
<br>
In 1999, John was the only senior graduating from the Waring School in<br>
Beverly Massachusetts (an exclusive private high school), to consider<br>
military service. My friends were sending their sons and daughters to top<br>
colleges. My two older children did the expected: Georgetown and New York<br>
University. I write novels for a living. I never served in the military. Our<br>
kind: white, higher education-worshipping denizens of the North Shore (north<br>
of Boston, that is) do not enlist. Before my son joined my attitude toward<br>
the military could have been summed up by an editorial cartoon recently<br>
published by the New York Times (January 18, 2003). It was of a mock<br>
recruiting poster. The slogan ran: &quot;OUT OF WORK? UNDEREDUCATED? NO HEALTH<br>
PLAN? JOIN THE ARMY &amp; SEE IRAQ.&quot; No doubt to the Times this represented an<br>
ironic comment on the policies of the Administration. To me, as the father<br>
of a young Marine, it spoke unintended volumes about the condescending<br>
attitude that many of us -- especially we of the &quot;sixties generation&quot; --<br>
harbor toward military service.<br>
<br>
Post 9-11, I doubt the Times would print a cartoon saying: &quot;OUT OF WORK?<br>
UNDEREDUCATED? JOIN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT &amp; DIE SAVING STRANGERS.&quot; But the<br>
Times felt free to stereotype those in the military. Perhaps this is because<br>
for most members of our chattering classes, no face of a beloved child leaps<br>
to mind when they think about who defends us.<br>
<br>
It took my youngest son joining the Marines to teach me that it is not some<br>
abstraction called the &quot;US military&quot; that protects us. It is our children.<br>
Twenty-two brief years ago, Corporal John Schaeffer weighed ten pounds,<br>
three ounces at birth. His damp little head smelled sweet as he nestled in<br>
the crook of my arm. The nurse let me hold him while Genie slept. From time<br>
to time I pressed my ear against John's chest to listen to his heartbeat. He<br>
grew into a gifted poet, athlete, and loyal friend.<br>
<br>
John could have gone to any college in the country. So could many of his<br>
brother Marines. My son's Marine brothers are drawn from all economic<br>
classes and all races. They work in a multicultural meritocracy that puts<br>
our best colleges to shame when it comes to equal opportunity and<br>
integration, let alone resolve and unselfish purpose. These days most<br>
enlisted Marines come from lower middle class homes. Some joined because<br>
they sought opportunities and education. Others carry on long family<br>
traditions of service. Many are poor and white. Many are African-American or<br>
Hispanic. I never hear about the color or class of my son's current roommate<br>
at any posting in the fleet. I am only told that such and such a Marine is<br>
&quot;an awesome Marine&quot; or that he is not.<br>
<br>
Whatever their backgrounds, my son's brother Marines survived excruciatingly<br>
rigorous boot camp training because they believe that the defense of our<br>
country is worth sacrificing for. In boot camp many underwent a profound<br>
change in attitude that put them at odds with the naval-gazing values of the<br>
&quot;me generation.&quot; Post boot camp, my son's brother Marines' idea of<br>
self-esteem is that the Marine standing next to them is more important than<br>
they are. Their idea of reality is that there are some very bad people in<br>
the world who hate our country and who must be stopped before they kill us.<br>
They are prepared to lay down their lives for their fellow Marines and for<br>
their country, even for strangers who belittle the military.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere in my book (Keeping Faith, A Father-Son Story About Love and the<br>
United States Marine Corps), I have written about my journey from being a<br>
reluctant Marine recruit's dad to becoming the proud parent of one of our<br>
defenders. In response, I have received an astounding number of humbling and<br>
passionately supportive letters and e-mails, over a five hundred in the last<br>
three months, mostly from other parents of military personnel.<br>
<br>
Barbara S. spoke for many when she wrote to me, &quot;When my son joined the<br>
Marines I was stuck somewhere between devastation and shock. Now I am so<br>
proud of him.&quot; Jan B. said of her Marine officer daughter, &quot;When she gave me<br>
the recruiting pamphlets all those years ago, I tried every tack to try and<br>
talk her out of her choice. I thought Marines would be anti-intellectual,<br>
sexist automatons... I was shamefully wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
General James L. Jones (Commandant of the United States Marine Corps,<br>
recently appointed chief of NATO) analyzed the reaction of the affluent and<br>
educated parents who find a child's unexpected choice to serve hard to<br>
countenance. He wrote to me that &quot;there has been a 'disconnect' between the<br>
men and women who defend our nation and those who are the beneficiaries of<br>
that service.&quot; After reading Keeping Faith former President George Bush<br>
wrote to me: &quot;Even after 9-11 there are many who look down on our men and<br>
women who serve... This is a cultural arrogance.&quot;<br>
<br>
One letter was from Linda C. the stepmother of Corporal Matthew Commons.<br>
&quot;Matt was an Army Airborne Ranger,&quot; Linda wrote. &quot;He was on the helicopter<br>
that was shot down during an attempt to rescue Navy Seal Neil Roberts [in<br>
Afghanistan]. We are devastated and heartbroken but we are also incredibly<br>
proud of him. There is a saying, that for those who have fought for it,<br>
freedom has a flavor the protected will never know. Having lost a beloved<br>
son we have given the best we have to offer. For us freedom tastes<br>
bittersweet, but it is also strongly laced with gratitude.&quot;<br>
<br>
In sharp contrast to the parents of military service men and women who have<br>
been writing to me, there are a number of Americans who will not even allow<br>
their children's high schools to give their names and addresses to<br>
recruiters. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, schools are required to give<br>
the names, phone numbers and addresses of graduating students to military<br>
recruiters unless parents request their children be omitted from the<br>
program. Some parents apparently find the fact that<br>
their children might be asked to consider serving their country unbearably<br>
onerous even though their children may refuse not only the phone call but,<br>
of course, are under no obligation to join.<br>
<br>
A New York Times article (Uncle Sam Wants Student Lists, and Schools Fret,<br>
January 29, 2003), quoted Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New<br>
York Civil Liberties Union, as saying, &quot;Students have a right to not be<br>
bothered by aggressive military recruiters.&quot; In San Francisco's Contra Costa<br>
County, the article reported that school officials were looking for creative<br>
ways to thwart the law. Speaking of the requirement that his students hear a<br>
pitch from a recruiter, a Contra Costa board member was quoted as saying,<br>
&quot;It's a dangerous precedent.&quot;<br>
<br>
The parents who do not want their children disturbed by a recruiter's phone<br>
call might benefit from the soul searching I was forced to undertake. They<br>
might ask themselves why they expect other parents' sons and daughters to<br>
protect them when they are not willing to let their children even consider<br>
serving their country.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some parents have accepted the caricature of the military as a place<br>
for the &quot;undereducated.&quot; Maybe, like me, they are understandably afraid for<br>
their child's safety. I doubt that they are all principled pacifists. My<br>
guess is that many are snobs who do not relish the prospect of explaining to<br>
friends that their child is in the military when those same friends are<br>
itching to tell them about how their kid just got into Yale.<br>
<br>
Not long ago I saw nothing wrong with the fact that little was asked of me<br>
or mine when it came to defense. I suffered from a case of cultural<br>
arrogance. It is this type of arrogance that has led to a &quot;disconnect&quot;<br>
between the men and women who defend our nation and those who are the<br>
biggest beneficiaries of that service. This class, money and<br>
education-driven disconnect between members of the new American plutocracy<br>
and the class of people who usually serve in our military is<br>
truly the &quot;dangerous precedent,&quot; not a law that merely asks parents to allow<br>
their child to at least consider serving their country.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was this disconnect that prompted the editorial cartoonist who<br>
drew the &quot;Undereducated? Join the Army&quot; jibe to forget that the job of our<br>
military is to implement the political will of a free people and that if a<br>
citizen (or newspaper) wants to question some military action then the<br>
honorable thing to do is to take the matter up with our elected<br>
representatives, not to mock the men and women who are willing to protect<br>
the rest of us.<br>
<br>
The Times recently printed a long and prominently placed article about Joey<br>
Goodwin, son of the well-known historian and commentator Doris Kearns<br>
Goodwin. According to the piece, Joey not only graduated from Harvard but<br>
joined the Army. (February 18, 2003, To Child of Vietnam War Dissenters,<br>
Recent Call to Arms Rang True) This fact struck the newspaper of record as<br>
so unusual -- a Harvard graduate from a prominent liberal family joins the<br>
Army! -- that it merited a long story wherein the bemused writer tried to<br>
fathom how and why such an extraordinary thing could happen.<br>
<br>
The fact that Joey's service was deemed newsworthy makes a far more telling<br>
point than did the story. During World War II if the Times had chronicled<br>
the lives of every child from a connected, powerful, wealthy, or educated<br>
family who volunteered for service they would have had no room for anything<br>
else in the paper. The real story, and one our media has yet to meaningfully<br>
address, is why it is that since the Vietnam War ended a certain class of<br>
Americans feel themselves and their children<br>
exempted from contributing their fair share -- proportionate to their<br>
numbers -- to the defense of our country. The wall of commemoration at<br>
Harvard University provides a visual reminder of how our elite has lost it's<br>
appetite for service. There are many names of war dead from WW I and WW II,<br>
a few from the Korean conflict and almost none from Vietnam and none at all<br>
since then.<br>
<br>
These days who is prepared to defend America matters. Three thousand<br>
Americans were murdered on 9-11. The rabid enemies of liberal democracy,<br>
freedom and civility would rejoice at liquidating every American man, woman,<br>
and child. There is nothing to &quot;negotiate&quot; with our current crop of crazed<br>
adversaries except the time and place of our deaths or theirs.<br>
<br>
As the world's sole superpower we will, for the foreseeable future, draw the<br>
fire of all opponents of order and freedom. We stand in their way. The<br>
political will of our citizens backed up by our military is the only<br>
guarantor of order in the world today. Everyone knows this and many -- like<br>
the French -- resent it.<br>
<br>
What is our elite's excuse for continuing to embrace the spirit of the 1970s<br>
college military deferments? We are now in the age of the all-volunteer<br>
military. The Vietnam War is over. Why is the same class of persons who bore<br>
the brunt of that war mostly still bearing the brunt of service today? Why<br>
is the same class of persons who ducked service in the 1960s and 1970s still<br>
ducking service today? What is the &quot;moral issue&quot; now that prevents our<br>
elites from doing their share or encouraging their children to do so?<br>
<br>
For those who say the &quot;support our troops&quot; while opposing the war in Iraq I<br>
have several questions: Have you ever encouraged your child to join the<br>
military that you say you respect so much? Have you ever thought of joining<br>
yourself since you have such &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;support&quot; for our men and women<br>
in uniform? If not, why not? Are you a dedicated and principled pacifist? I<br>
respect that view. But if you're not a pacifist I'd find it easier to take<br>
your views against the war in Iraq more seriously if you had a kid in the<br>
military.<br>
<br>
To get a sense of just how frivolous some folks are when it comes to all<br>
things military consider this quote from an article in the New York Times<br>
(Move to War Leaves Some Feeling Alienated March 20, 2003). Speaking of the<br>
fact that many Californians are alienated from support for the war and our<br>
military the paper states: &quot;During some lunchtime chatter there has been a<br>
longing for President Clinton, a Hollywood favorite, who, the reasoning<br>
goes, would never have allowed a war to<br>
play havoc with Oscar night, one of the state's most hallowed traditions.&quot;<br>
<br>
If my son, Joey Goodwin, Jan's daughter, Barbara's son, Corporal Matthew<br>
Commons, and tens of thousands of other young men and women were<br>
&quot;undereducated&quot; when they signed up to protect us it was only in one<br>
subject: cynicism. It seems to me that the cynicism -- typical of someone<br>
that worries more about Oscar night than out troop's welfare -- that colors<br>
the attitude of many members of our Hollywood, intellectual, business and<br>
media elite toward military service is a far greater threat to our country<br>
than an unwelcome phone call from a recruiter.<br>
<br>
Shared sacrifice is the lifeblood of a free society. Those who believe that<br>
their children should be perpetually exempted from service to our country by<br>
some sort of divine right should ask themselves some hard questions.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the views of some of the younger members of our privileged elite are<br>
changing regardless of their parent's attitudes. Recruiters are making some<br>
modest gains in recruiting from the Ivy League since 9-11. Colonel Warren<br>
Foersch, a Commanding Officer in charge of the large United States Marines<br>
recruiting northeast district wrote told me that in 2004 the military will<br>
commission about twenty officers from the Ivy League. This is the highest<br>
number in years. It still strikes me as very low. This is no surprise as our<br>
colleges continue to be hotbeds of antimilitary bias.<br>
<br>
My Marine son tells me that he does not want to depend for his life on<br>
someone who is not willingly standing next to him in battle. He is therefore<br>
against the draft. Maybe he's right. If the dearth of volunteers from our<br>
elites is not to be resolved by the reintroduction of the draft then the<br>
situation will have to change because of a sense of shame. I learned that<br>
lesson. Now when I think about who watches over us while we sleep, a beloved<br>
face leaps to mind. As I look at the boot camp graduation photograph of John<br>
sitting on the mantle my emotion is strongly laced with gratitude. My son<br>
has connected me to my country. I envy my son's dedication and the<br>
brotherhood he shares with his fellow Marines. I admire his big heartedness<br>
born of service. I am grateful for my association, through him, with the<br>
best people I have ever met. When I see anyone in uniform that young man or<br>
woman is my son and daughter His or her father and mother is my brother and<br>
sister. John takes my heart into battle with him. I am frightened, sad and<br>
proud. I am proud of my son and proud of my country.<br>

<br>
Thank you for posting that piece by Frank Schaeffer.  It was really very touching and a refreshing viewpoint which most don't think to consider.  I passed it along to one of my best friends who is serving in the Navy aboard the US Kitty-Hawk.<br>
<br>
I probably fit into the &quot;snob&quot; category being that I have often wished he would quit the Navy and lead a &quot;safe &amp; normal&quot; life.  I'm very proud of the fact though that he is instead choosing to make a long career out Navy life, going back to school for his degree and wanting to join Special Ops as an officer.  That article really shed some light on my unsupportive thinking and helped me see how unbecoming the American Snob attitude is.<br>

With respect, that is patently false.  There is nothing unpatriotic about criticising the Administration that got us into a war that appears to be bogging down and achieving nothing in the short term and will likely only finish after massive loss of life.<br>

Anyone that says you cannot criticise an Administration that, through its actions, threatens the health, wealth and security of the nation through incompetence and bungling, however well meaning, is the one that is not a patriot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2849<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/03 7:19 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: run for your lives sand niggers, its your turn to die.</span><hr size=1> Actually, those who are saying it is unpatriotic need to open their modern history books.
