-Telemakhos<br>
<br>
I remember going on *one* raid with legendary. Telk. The zerg was so evident even then that I withdrew my application. I also had a problem with a number of people in the guild. The guildchat was so fucking disorganized, it went hand in hand with what Zierain said about people shouting orders that weren't even in command.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeadiin, The only person who has fucked themselves is you, mate.<br>
Good luck getting new friends now everyone knows how you screwed over one you had. Personally, I wouldnt trust you to sit the right way round on a toilet. Hope you enjoyed the manaburn by the way. I was laughing so much I nearly pissed myself.&quot;<br>
-Jonlee<br>
<br>
Yeah, I have no frnds, Jonlee. Will you be my frnd? =x<br>
<br>
Oh, the manaburn was funny as hell, I agree. I was in the bazaar arena fooling around with about 20 other people when Phluff (a friend of my fyi... oh shit, thats right I have no friends!) MB'd me. For the next 5 minutes it got even funnier for me, as mongoloids from Legendary sent me &quot;How'd you like that MB? LOL&quot; tells. You guys sure get kicks out of little things =x I got MB'd in pvp... wow. I didn't lose xp... I didn't get trained... I didn't get kicked or refused from a group... oh man, I'm gonna go cry now cuz that manaburn hurt my feelings =*(<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a minute it took 12 hours for Transexuals to kill Aary on Sunday ? And you say you belong in NTOV?? Hahaha. Lot's of luck clearing NTOV in one day.&quot;<br>
-Ariar<br>
<br>
Yeah, it took us 12 hours to kill ikat/eashen/aary/fesh. We fucked around for a little, and pulled Ikat/eashen differently, instead of pulling to ZI like we usually do. Yez, we belong in NToV. Know why? heres a hint: it starts with &quot;A&quot; and ends with &quot;r&quot; Are you really to the point that you have NOTHING else to argue than how long it took us on our first day? Dude, GIVE IT A FUCKING REST. You lost this argument. and like Flassh said, exactly how many dragons did you kill in 12 hours you were there on Sunday? Lessee... one.... two... wiped on fish... left... wowowowowowowowow. I count TWO. Aary is harder than both Dagarn + Kriez + Fish combined.  WTFG Hypocrite. I'll pull a Challia and bet you 1kpp that we clear 5+ NToV mobs on our first day next rotation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zierain Quote - I was in my 50's, not my 40's.<br>
<br>
So that means it took you 9 months to gain 5 levels or so, haha what a fuckin dumbass&quot;<br>
-Zelutun<br>
<br>
Zel... all I gotta say is awesome... you're the new Iron Chef of the flameboard. You know how long he quit the game? I didn't think so, so stfu and go back to practicing your DL chain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maraclaire, listen young lady, if it takes you 12 hours to kill those 4 mobs that's pathetic. So I will still wish you lot's of luck killing all the NTOV mob in one day. You will need it.&quot;<br>
-Ariar (again)<br>
<br>
Hahahahahahaha. I remember a Lego raid not too long ago where Lego wiped MULTIPLE times to Ikatiar, and it got too late to go kill Eashen. We appreciated that btw- Leetelf LOVED his new arms and Cronis really liked that cloak.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sure someday Trans will be able to kill them in one day; although, they might want to keep all their members, I mean they only have 20 to 30 show up at raids, nice guild pride there, you can't afford to loose to many more, you know.&quot;<br>
-Ariar (and again)<br>
<br>
Hey fuckwad. Listen to everyone and give it up. You started out sounding intelligent, now you're just banging your head on the keyboard in frustration, trying to find ANY angle to make your guild not seem so bad. Here's a newsflash. It ain't working. We have maybe 80 members max. of those 80, I'd say about 60 are considered active. we have anywhere from 30-50 show up at raids. <br>
<br>
We kill the same shit you guys wipe on with DOUBLE our numbers. I've never heard of someone flaming how few people it takes to kill a mob. Dude, I guarentee if you see us raiding, 95% of the Trans online are there. and if they're not, they've told an officer why. <br>
<br>
How many people does Legendary have guilded? Just a rough estimate. 200? 250? How many of those are active? I'll guess and say 100-150. How many people are on your raids? Legendary claims 67 was the max you had in North. thats 44 to 67 % raid attendance. As I said earlier we have anywhere from 30-50 show up, out of 60 active members. that's 50 to 83 % raid attendance. What was that about guild pride? moron.<br>
<br>
&quot;I bet a year from now you will still see post like E/V sucks, or Companions sucks, or SI sucks, or Legendary sucks, or AN... err RNG... umm nobody hates RNG or AN, but you get the idea.&quot;<br>
-Ariar (and yet AGAIN)<br>
<br>
I'll take that bet. Trans isn't even a year old and has surpassed the so-called achievements of Legendary. In another year, unless Legendary gets new leadership, they're still gonna be farming CT while Trans is working on/has killed Emp, and is in full swing in PoP. <p><HR>

Keep spending your time wisely, as opposed to wasting it by killing dragons, and dying to Aaryonar! *cheer* <p><hr>

You know, I was playing a twink in Crushbone the other day. Obviously I started by killing the two cents at the entrance, then proceeded to clear the area by the two bridges. Well pretty soon I was full up with belts so I had to go to the bank.<br>
<br>
So I get back, and would you believe it but somone had snuck in, taking advantage of the fact that the cents at the entrance were down, and was killing the much easier orc pawns.<br>
<br>
Well, as you can imagine I was furious. I told them I had killed the cents at the entrance and thus reserved the entire zone to kill at my leisure, but they just laughed.<br>

Our pullers spent a while trying to figure out if it was still possible, because if it is, then it does save us time.  Finally we said fuck it and just killed eashen near his spawn point.  Just to give you an idea on how long our pullers were messing with eashen, 15 minutes after we were ready to pull eashen I leave for a hockey game.  I come back 3 hours later and we are just about ready to pull eashen in the normal spot.  So Im guessing ~2.5 hours were spent trying to figure out eashen before the leaders decided to just coh to aary hall and kill him there.  Why did we wait so long to just kill eashen the normal way? I dont know.  A few people (me included) were saying we should just kill him normally from the start, but again, if our pullers had figured it out, it woulda saved us time in the future.  Were not going to be spending that much time on ika/eashen normally, so we will get to the dragons earlier in the night, while we have more time left, and a stronger force on (by the time we got to lord fesh a lot had logged off).<br>

How the fuck does someone wipe to Ikatiar...hes like as easy as vindi.<br>

<br>
And I dont really see why some people are saying aary is super duper hard.  He is harder than most of the other dragons in ntov, but he is just a long fight, and your screwed if the AE hits the wrong people.  If his AE actually did damage, it would be a different story.  I actually think Lady N (i believe thats the one), is harder than aary, but that might just be because we got an add or 2. <p><center>

We were simply not really putting forth any real effort, i.e. basically just there for faction.  <br>

The Guild founder and the Guild leader has always been Thinkness.  Militan joined shortly after Trans was formed (very shortly, like a few days) and left about a month later to go play on one of the Zeks.  Not sure if he transferred his char to Zek or started a new one - at any rate, the person that played Militan hasn't been with Trans since July of 2001.<br>
