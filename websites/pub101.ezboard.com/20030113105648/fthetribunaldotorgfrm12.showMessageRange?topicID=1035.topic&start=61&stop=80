Most guilds will not drastically improve their abilities in a short time, and with 2 guilds in the upper tier and many in the 2nd, the 2nd tier guilds have no where to get the gear now, and if all advance in gear at about the same level, none will have a way to advance more then the other, keeping them in the same ability range <p><div align="center"><i>Play to win.

So unless E/V or Comps are wasting Emporer as I type this the amount of time they are going to have in a zone where the uber mobs are the same diffculty as the Emporer is very small and a very <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> small</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> percentage of them might have 1 or 2 VT loots. Sure VP loot helped in Vellious, but E/V had been clearing VP for MONTHS before Vellious was released. At best they will have a few weeks to explore VT before PoP.<br>
<br>
So then PoP gets released and all of the guilds who decided VT was to much of a timesink are going to go full speed ahead into the new expansion while Comps or E/V or both will be stupid not to stay in VT since they put so much ongodly time into it.<br>
<br>
Now you have 3 possible scenario's.<br>
1: You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NEED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> VT loot to get anywhere in PoP of signifigance and so PoP remains deserted while E/V, and comps farm VT and everyone else tries to key up for Emporer. VT guilds get to the &quot;end game&quot; in PoP first.<br>
<br>
2: You can get the gear you need in PoP to get to the PoP endgame. VT guilds farm VT, while non-VT guilds farm lesser PoP for the right gear. Following Verants tradition of making new expansions have better stuff... the non-VT guilds will have a slight advantage over the VT guilds. Depending on who is done farming first this could put the non VT guilds at the end game first.<br>
<br>
3: Prior expansions gear means nothing in PoP and we all start at point 0. E/V and comps will probably get to end game first due to their hard core rading nature compared to the rest. If the up the Level cap we all know levels are MUCH MUCH greater then gear and E/V has ALWAYS had the advantage with members who really desire to level fast.<br>
<br>
No matter what happens, it will be interesting to see. <p><pr><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=206250 "><b>Fazzarya Ayrazzaf</b></A><br>Sorceress<br><A HREF="http://www.chinhole.net/eq/">Sol Invictus</A></pr></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatetofinnoruuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matet of Innoruuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/2/02 12:08:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> talks all day.... dont say a damn thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 827<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/2/02 2:26:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> Velious was pretty much a strong #2 Fazz...<br>

Hell, in a couple days of POG clearing you could nail down more armor than months of Trak / VS killings, and catch up extremely quickly.<br>
<br>
As far as gear providing a major advantage coming from VT?  Perhaps.  Although I honestly feel it's like arguing primal makes or breaks a fight.  It doesn't.  You still need the proper tactics to win.   If you consistantly get something to 10% health and fail... the gear is the problem.  If you wipe consistantly at 15% more or health you could probably do better by improving or modifying tactics.<br>
<br>
The major advantage Ssra / VT guilds will have in PoP is familiarity with procedures for different types of encounters, not gear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhakekwisigoth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hakek Wisigoth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/vindi/icon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/2/02 3:17:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.multimania.com/vindi0/HakLPresized.jpg HEIGHT=169 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> They lied to us about snow frogs!

I dont think you ansolutely needed to have primal to do Ntov last year.  But N-ToV is basically an armor farm, the weapons out of there (non-vulak weapons) are basically pure shit for the most part, even prior ot Luclin.  The weapon farm counterpart was ST.  Since after such a massive increase in player power in regards to armor in North, you couldnt very well have people keep using epics and wavecrashers or willsappers as the Velious end game weaponry.<br>
<br>
This is where the ST key &quot;camp&quot; differs from the luclin key camps.  ST wasn't the Velious end game.  You weren't forced to farm ST keys to see the end game (North), unlike Luclin where everything is locked behind a 10+ piece key quest with completely assinine drop rates.  Shit, I think VT key quest looks easy compared to the Inner acrylia keys.  If I recall correctly, you need to do basically 6 ring wars in Grimling Forest for ONE key.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ironically, Transcended MT was using epics to taunt Aaryonar at our first kill.  Come to think of it, I think most Transcended MT's still use warrior epic/SBoZ as primary taunt weapons.  And I can still remember Mojak's post from many months ago when he said that you couldn't do North with warrior epics... <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131483>Merton Rtehsuq</a><BR>

( extra 500 hp helps on a late CH, but really the late CH shoulda never occurred )  But largely is unnecessary for an encounter ( barring having decent resists ).  Some AA abilites scream out usefullness though.  AE Taunt and Manaburn both radically change the game and how one sets up their tactics.  ( for specific encounters that is )  In the end what prevented RNG from breaking NToV open before March of this year?  Was it that we didnt farm enough primal?  Nope we only had prolly 10 primal when we killed Aary.  Not enough armor before? We were done raiding HoT since prolly November.  Not enough Doze loot? That Fubar quest scheme yielded only like 10 quest items for us.<br>
<br>
<br>
No what prevented us from going was our collective levels.  As a whole RNG members dont play as much as EV or Comps.  So many of us were not lvl 60.  A Lvl 60 warrior in PoG armor is worth twice as much as a lvl 55 warrior in VT loot.  RNG waited for our guild as a whole to finish the long slow process of lvling.  When most of us had finished that we knew we were ready to switch.  A bunch of lvl 55-57 melee arent gonna do much to Aary but add lag, lvl 60 melees rip him to shreds, relatively.<br>
<br>
<br>
PoP will not be about the guild with most VT loot.  It will be about the guild with the most lvl 65 or 70's.  Whatever the new cap is going to be.  This of course assumes that power will continue to increase in leaps and bounds as from a lvl 50 to a lvl 60.  Given this circumstance I do continue to give the advantage to EV and Comps, since their players have all generally lvl'ed faster than the other guilds on the server.  This alone after a short time will dictate who does what in PoP.  Wanna try to kill Solusek Ro?  Well guess what his AE is so large that only a lvl 70 could hope to get CH'ed in time, or his resists are so high only a lvl 70 could hope to land their nukes.<br>

<br>
I believe on our first trip, we had 0 primal.<br>
<br>
Main tank was using a pair of warrior epics.<br>
<br>
And our first successful run was post change where HP were increased across the board (which did make fights a bit easier, but only served to make aaryonar that much harder as he did not get &quot;rooted&quot; like many others).<br>
<br>
I'll say it again.  Gear is not the deciding factor in most fights.  Tactics are.  (that and the number of clerics where velious is concerned, or the number of wizards where luclin is concerned.)  Anyone find it funny that it's like that?  Old EQ before any expansions was failry balanced on the large encounters.  The one king class there that sticks in my mind was enchanters.  The more the merrier.   Kunark hit, and wizards were king.   Velious hit and warrior / cleric / rogues were king.  Now Luclin hits and again the balance shifts to casters.<br>
<br>
I'm curious if the balance will be done right in PoP.  What class will get the ability or spell to make them twice as useful as the next most useful class? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uchutoi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chutoi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/3/02 11:42:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> Pardon my n00bness, but has it been confirmed that PoP will have a level increase?

Try several months, you dumb bitch. We spent months in the planes during initial release, months in VP during Kunark, and months in ST and NToV during Velious.

If you look a wee bit closer at the piece of shit on your head you will realize it was not from me shitting on your guild, as any person with some semblance of reading comprehension can plainly see, but in fact from your very own anus having had your head so far up your ass while you typed that reply.<br>
<br>
Not once did I belittle your guild, I just said that (pay attention here, don't want you to get thrown) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IF</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you OR Companions (Oh god someone else got SHAT UPON!)don't kill the Emporer soon then you won't spend much time in VT prior to Planes of Power's release because (careful, here comes another curve....hold on you can do it!) it will be released as soon as Verant can possibly push it live. Now, since Livlongti pointed out that E/V killed the Emporer then I have no problem at all conceding that chances of you spending a good amount of time in VT has just increased allot. <br>

<br>
No, it hasn't been confirmed. Hints have been given in the past few months that would suggest a level increase, which could be anything from level 62 to 100 or whatever, but chances are it will be something very different from what you would expect. Nothing more than rumors for now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uskeeja.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skeeja</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/4/02 9:46:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> Quite frankly RNG probably will never see VT, unless the key quest is made easier, because most of us just don't have the commitment it takes to get that key.<br>
<br>
POP will almost certainly not have a level increase, and also, won't require anything from any previous expansion.  After all that would require you to buy it, and Verant, whether you believe it or not, is a company that doesn't want to piss off people.  People would get very pissed off if they were forced to buy a previous expansion they didn't have to get into another...no I feel that won't happen.<br>
<br>
Just look at the 3 previous expansions...none of them required you to have any previous one to explore fully the new one...I feel PoP will be the same way.<br>
<br>
Also, the overcrowding could be eased very easily if VI wanted to, without any server splits.  The simplest, and easiest way is to simply halve the spawn times of all mobs.  Think of it...there's probably 10 times (or more) level 55+ people on this server as there was when Velious was released...10 times the competition, but the spawn rate hasn't changed.  If NtoV was up every 3 days instead of every 7...if Tormax popped twice a week, if Luclin crap popped more often, or dropped keys more easy, it would go a LONG way to easing the overcrowding.<br>
<br>
If ST was reset, that would ease it some too...make the Sleeper so you could re-entomb him somehow so other guilds could do him, would help as well.  Finish the promised revamp of VP so more guilds will go there more often would spread us out to.  RNG has been VP cabable since January at least, but we've only did about 5 raids there.  And only once did we clear every mob.  Not because we can't...but because most of us feel VP is too difficult for the reward, and the fact that you cannot leave without going thru extreme measures is a turnoff too.<br>
