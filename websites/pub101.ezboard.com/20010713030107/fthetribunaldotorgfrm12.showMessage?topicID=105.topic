/bitch on<br>
I'm very tired and worried about the influx of complete strangers(and that's what most of us are to each other, even after we've grouped together, been in the same guild, whatever), who think we should give a shit in the first place.<br>
Now, I'm obviously not talking about people who know each other outside this game, or people we have chosen to deal with outside the game in personal ways(i.e. people we'd call friends outside the game) I'm talking about all the closet psychos who will either whine /ooc or on message boards such as this or even in guildsay about how sucky their life is or what-have-you. Call me callus. *shrug* I know that some folks I deal with in the game go out of their way to talk to folks and try to be problem solvers. Right on, I say. I ain't one of  them. As a matter of fact, the shit makes me uncomfortable. I don't like airing my own dirty laundry, and I certainly don't want strangers singling me out to tell me, well a goddamned thing about their personal life. I give a shit....erm nope.<br>
*shrug*<br>
And all this public airing of personal, well anything, by either the persons it's about or any other shcmuck in a pissy mood is disturbing and scary. <br>
/bitch off<br>
Am I the only person here to think that?<br>
I'd like to hope not. <p><center><img src=http://users.ev1.net/~axisbold/telly/forest.gif width=450><br>

perhaps i should have said what i had to say in e-mail to Bowynn..<br>
I spoke only addressing my personal interaction with the woman because from what I see she is STILL doing the same things she's always done.<br>
You think I enjoyed airing personal things that made me look foolish?<br>
I did what i did because I know her all too well. it's easy to come on and make accusations, much more difficult to admit that you were taken in as well.<br>
Whether Bowynn believes it or anyone else does, doesn't matter at this point.<br>
Tooky, you're right, he has no choice, to believe what I said leads to madness if he loves her. I did the exact same thing when I did and others attacked her. I had no choice, if I accepted what they said, I would have had to think long and hard about exactly who i got involved with. No one wants to believe they could love someone with so little regard for others. Works the same for anyone you love, brother, child etc. i don't blame Bowynn for attacking me or being upset because I did this in public. I DO take exception to the fact he took lies from someone else and played them off as if they were facts that he witnessed himself. I only spoke of things I had personal knowledge of, he didn't.<br>
I wish I'd had the wisdom to allow him to screw up on his own rather than alienating him.<br>
Believe as you wish whether I speak truth or not, as I told Bowynn in an e-mail, find me one person in this game who will call me a liar. You won't find one. Then take a quick look back at the posts and start counting how many spoke of her as one. I hope that gives some pause for thought. I'm done here as well on this subject. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ueondil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eondil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/8/01 12:06:44 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.twinkies.com/images/lasso.gif height=185 width=133></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, I give a shit.</span><hr size=1> I have a small penis and it burns when i pee <p><center><img src=http://liquid2k.com./surefoot/3make1.jpg><br><font size = 4><font color=red>Schexay Rogue of<br></font><font size=5>Minions of Mischief</font></center></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwickednessthrashmetal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WiCkEdNeSs ThRaShMeTaL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/8/01 1:11:22 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/wickedness/skulltrumpet.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, I give a shit.</span><hr size=1> There will always be people out there that will talk to anyone that even gives the appearance of listening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uguddyearplaysureblimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guddyear Playsureblimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Good Times</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/8/01 4:34:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, I give a shit.</span><hr size=1> I can understand people airing concern when their friends have been affected and are tired of seeing person after person get screwed over.<br>

I feel sorry for you, especially if you feel that discussing personal RL things/issues is &quot;disturbing&quot;.  While it's true that some dirty laundry is pretty fuckin' filthy for public view, having a problem with the concept, especially a large enough problem with it to complain publicaaly, is what  I would consider disturbing.

<br>
Well, Sarhea happens to be part of a silent majority.  You know, the ones that you ask about the latest drama-queen antics, and they reply, &quot;Yeah, I really just don't pay attention to that stuff.  I ignore it because it doesn't affect me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now understandably, you think its normal because you place yourself in the position where anybody who doesn't really care about your problems is labeled as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;non-caring&quot;, when actually, they just share Sarhea's opinion (i.e. they really don't care about what you're saying).<br>
<br>
I share the sentiment that people in your guild are strangers.  There are a few instances where I see guildmates that know each other already IRL, and obviously they're gonna care about each other.  But the rest of us?...  We're just out for a fun time, a chance at some decent loot, and a few people to share the good times with.<br>

it's really fucking simple - if you're one and someone else is the other, RESPECT THEIR FUCKING PREFERENCE.  I randomly bitch about RL, or randomly just say &quot;My dog just ran into a wall&quot; (true story btw, he actually ran INTO a wall) and some people laugh with me or talk about it... most times i never get in detail for trying to respect the first classification of people and will take it to tells if i actually feel like discussing things.<br>
