<br>
Arsianna was not justifying what happened. I was involved in the thread and he flew off the handle at me as well, so I know of what I speak here. What I was doing was saying how US policy <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> set the stage for</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and maybe even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> seeded</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> acts like 9/11. I understood that to be Arsianna's point as well.<br>
<br>
I said then as I do now, you treat a country like shit and think just because they don't have an army that there will be no repercussions, you are wrong. A country/people/civilization will fight back with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> whatever</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> means they have. They won't sit back and say &quot;gee whiz, we have no tanks so I guess we just let them ass fuck us&quot;. They say, we have no tanks, so we will fight with bombs. We have no missiles so we will fight with commercial airliners.<br>
<br>
I am not now, nor was I then saying the reasons they had for attacking us justified the action. I do feel still as I did then that our policies, our arrogance and our indifference has invited acts such as 9/11.<br>
<br>
It's like if your brother went around mouthing off to people and then one day a guy beats the shit out of him and busts his nose. You can say that your brothers mouthing off caused his injuries without saying the guy who beat him up was justified or that your brother deserved the level of retaliation he got. <br>

And I do not feel the need to log all communication.  Anything sent to me in e-mail is kept, except for junk mail.  Anything sent to me in regular U.S. mail is kept, except for junk mail.  Anything in EQ is logged.   Anything in ICQ is logged by default.<br>

<br>
There is a reason I will not discuss this &quot;argument&quot; here.  It is the general philosophy of this flameboard to attack the arguer and not the argument.  Darkmask is one of the biggest culprits of this practice and takes this practice *everywhere*, not just the flame board.  He cannot separate the way people behave on this board from the way people behave on other boards.<br>
<br>
As for attacking the arguer instead of the argument, look at how he handled the original argument of this thread.  He disagreed with Rynnia so rather than attack the argument, he pulls a bunch of lies out of his ass that no one's ever heard before about Rynnia corroborating with VI to catch ebayers.  I know all the Rynnia ebay stories and have never heard that one.  Without shame, Darkmask whips it out, knowing he cannot prove anything.  But you see, the damage has been done.<br>
<br>
With Darkmask, a logical philisophical argument is all about mudslinging.  He does his best &quot;damage&quot; that way because he is not equipped to write or argue at a level where he can have a healthy debatel (at least he has not displayed that he can if such is not the case).<br>
<br>
In this thread, I put out a &quot;one line zinger&quot; (as he calls it) because, actually, I was trying to warn the person that Darkmask might fly off the handle at such a comment as he did at myself, and Loegan (and another person I've seen on this thread who I won't mention unless he chooses to involve himself in this) and others.  &quot;Fuck you and the horses you rode in on,&quot;  &quot;bitch&quot; &quot;whore&quot; etc etc are all things he called me, a supposed friend at the time, because he didn't like my opinion. <br>
<br>
Sure, Darkmask offered to take it to email with me, but not before spewing out a bunch of stuff about the incident (90% of which was wrong, btw) hoping to discredit me in some way before saying &quot;hey, lets take it to email.&quot;  Can you see why I don't trust him to argue such an  issue?  In a very thread where he is discussing keeping information private, he shoots off a bastardized version of some personal details about my life that I chose only to reveal to trusted guildmates.  Some of those details are painful (and some are ones he threw back in my face when I brought them up in the first place).<br>
<br>
Darkmask is the king of taking posts, breaking them up into quotes and &quot;re interpreting&quot; what you were trying to say through his own filter of anger and hatred.  He can make it sound as if you are saying nearly the exact opposite of what you actually said while calling you a bitch and saying fuck you, etc etc.  <br>
<br>
That's fine for the flameboard, but I don't play that game and I won't, now matter how hard he tries to provoke me.  And all of his posts beyond the first one or two have been all about provoking me into arguing this.  I am not afraid of my opinions and I feel I do argue rather well.  But I do not want Darkmask putting words in my mouth with his famous technique of &quot;quote&quot; and then 3 paragraphs of &quot;So what you are saying is... Well you suck you bitch...&quot;<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that Darkmask will take his very infamous technique and apply it to the bit that I have written here.  &quot;Quote&quot; blah blah blah, bitch, &quot;Quote&quot; blah blah blah, whore.  He'll turn my 6 or so paragraphs into a dissertation all while calling me every name he can think of.  Sure, I called him swine, but hey, he's acting like a swine.<br>
<br>
I could sit here and attack his personal life and give all the personal details about his life that I know (such as they are), but I won't because I'm a better person than he is.  He will pull anything out of his aresenal without asking himself first if he *should* do it because for him, &quot;winning&quot; and argument is the most important thing at all costs.  <br>
<br>
All of you who consider him a friend, consider yourselves warned.  He will turn on you if he doesn't like an opinion you have and he will attempt to eviscerate you to make his argument seem more valid.  He will go after tender portions of you that have nothing to do with the opinion and show no mercy all in the name of &quot;winning an argument.&quot;  He will use everything he knows about you against you because for him, reality and this flameboard are one in the same.<br>
<br>
I've said pretty much everything I've wanted to here.  I won't come back and post again.  I'm not interested in Darkmask's reply to this.  I'm not interested in more shouts of &quot;coward&quot;, etc.   I don't much have a taste for the flameboard although in the past certain threads have caught my interest.  I leave you all to your mudslinging.<br>

<br>
This is the part I have trouble with, that I dont see where you make the connection. The people in these countries arent the terrorists, its where they come from. Arsi was defending the people of her country/background asking not blindy slind racists remarks about them, but it when you say, that the conditions over there made it possible. I dont agree, I see that as justification for the terrorists, who, are not all of the people in the middle east. The terrorists have a different agenda, because if what you say is the cause, then why arent more of the people from these countries planning attacks. The terrorists are inhuman pieces of shit like I said and should be hunted down and killed, but to include the people in the middle east who want nothing but to try to carve out a niche in the world for themselves is not right. <br>
<br>
The explaination you give sweeps away the fact that terrorists were acting independently from the people who didnt do these acts.<br>
<br>
Let me try to focus in on this for you. People in the ghetto live in terrible conditions, are raised around drugs and watch lets say, italians push drugs into the community. Now if some of the people living in this community decide to commit a crime you shouldnt try to explain it way because of the community they were raised. People have a choice and I believe people know a difference between right and wrong. There are good people in that community who even though the conditions dont see murder or acts of violence as a solution. <br>
<br>
I dont think murder of innocents can be justified. These terrorists are without conscience, they commited a crime that is not explainable or justifiable. I dont agree with the idea of explaining what happening by pointing out the conditions, not all the people who live under these conditions will commit acts of terrorism. Something was wrong with those people ( the terrorists ), and it wasnt just upbringing. Maybe I am purist and I believe we all have a basic understanding of right and wrong, but that is where I am coming from.<br>
<br>
I can see where the confusion stemmed. Its like you saw 9/11 as an equation where you could fill in the variables that made the soultion possible. You wanted to explain the whys and hows of how this might of come to be. I dont think there is really is an explaination that makes sense. It doesnt make me right, and you wrong, or me wrong and you right. We just see it differently. Through a dialouge though maybe I now understand a little better how you see it.<br>
<br>
It might be short sighted of me to not try to diagnose this event and explain the variables which made it possible. To me, I refuse to accept any explaination which helps to justify the attack, it demeans the people who lost their life to me. Its like saying, oh they had a hard life, so it was okay for them murder innocent people, I dont buy that. I do see however that is wasnt what you were saying, you just wanted to fill in the blanks to look at from analytical standpoint, though that wasnt very clear when we first discussed this and it seemed like you were trying to justify the attacks.

I was thinking about that earlier actually about how far off subject we have gotten about this post, and personally, I was looking at from the standpoint that Rynnia was actually moving off the subject, continuely wanting to go deeper and deeper. I say this is A, and Rynnia wants to to explain A by discussing B through P. I personally dont feel I derailed it. I actually was the one the making the arguement though and it seemed to me, that Rynnia wanted to examine every detail of my post to dispute it.<br>

<br>
It's like how we used Osama Bin Laden to fight the USSR in Afghansistan when it fit our purposes, but then fucked them over on oil deals.<br>
<br>
The hate for the US did not materialize out of nowhere. We kick around smaller nations as much as we help other smaller nations. We are like Jekyl and Hyde... your best friend and your worst enemy all rolled into one. US policy is far from consistant to all but a few select nations and in our arrogance we even kick those friends in the teeth at times.<br>
<br>
Iraqi citizens look at us screaming about terrorism and then we support Pakistan and Isreal. Now you can say that tanks and missiles make their intrusions military actions, but to a Palistinian it is just as much terrorism as 9/11 was to us. If your daughter is killed in her house by a soldier firing through the wall, is it any better or more humane than her dying in an office building by a passenger jet? Is that family any less devistated?<br>

<br>
I don't like the Taliban or Bin Laden. I hate everything they stand for. But just because they are wrong in my eyes doesn't mean they don't see me in just as bad a light. Do you honestly believe that if you were brought up in Afghanistan or Iraq your whole life that you would see things like you do here? If the US fucked you over, would you be hesitant to fight them? You would fight for your country just as they feel they are. I can respect their loyalty even if I don't respect what they are loyal to.<br>
<br>
Loyalty is like honesty. The results of being honest or loyal can be negative depending on the situation, but the traits themselves are always to be respected.<br>
<br>
Now you can say that how they view us is their problem, but after 9/11, I think it should be obvious that how others view us is very much our problem... and if we don't address it we are in for more of the same imo.<br>
<br>
All we really need to do is to clean up our foreign policy, be consistant and not fuck with people for cash. We do those few things and I bet alot of the animosity against us will fade with time. <p><br>

For once i agree with Loegon on foreign policy.  We need to consistently kick the living shit out of anyone who messes with us.<br>
<br>
&quot;He pulls a knife on you-  you pull a gun.<br>
He sends one of yours to the hospital- <br>
you send one of his to the morgue.&quot;<br>

<br>
There is more truth in that statement than you realize Dumai. The time to fix these messes is before they attack, not after. The best example is 9/11. Once those planes hit, there was no turning back. Even if the Taliban was right in their cause (which they weren't of course), we still could not avoid retaliation. To do so would have invited every nation with a beef to negotiate by attack.<br>
<br>
But, if we had the forsight to head of these situations consistantly, before attacks occured, then it's a win/win situation.<br>

It might also surprise you to learn that I agree with this 100%. Just because I don't want the US to fuck with people for money and cause unneccessary animosity, does not mean that I don't support the defense of my country 100%.<br>
