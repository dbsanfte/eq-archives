That day in TOV might have not happened if a different person was runing the show my Guildleader has alwas said he doesn't like you many of the officers don't like you. Anything to make your EQ life hard I have a feeling he would do.  Like I said Rynnia if you had the balls to give legendary a do or die chance for 2 days I think they would beat Roy. But again know that you are boss of the Rotation of last years uber guilds you are getting a ego a bit too big for me. O and if Lilwee did make that offer i didn't see it.

<br>
well, the people that asked me if i was coming back asked before i made that post the other day.  and i've told everyone that's asked the same answer:  nope, no SI or any other guild for me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No rolling like it used to be (wtf was the rationale behind that?) </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
no fucking idea, that was the stupidest shit i ever saw.  yeah lets have everyone roll because its &quot;fair,&quot; so the guild ends up with people that show up to one raid a month winning rare / hard to get items and other people who raid every single day for the guild wearing leftovers that would have rotted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the biggest headache is getting people to ask for things they want, rather than too many people asking for things and being greedy.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
that has a lot to do with not randoming for everything.  you know as well as i do that when the loot system was random-all, everyone wanted a piece of anything they could get their grubby mitts on.  far more people would just roll on stuff than will send you tells that they want something.  <br>

people don't give you enough credit rynnia.  see unlike hopkins you're an intelligent person and figured that out.  you're right, i don't give a shit.  yes it really is a game.  i'm having more fun not giving a shit than i ever had when i did give a shit.  oh no, i hurt someone's feelings, oh no i have to save face.  fuck that.  people that take this game and especially this flame board seriously have issues they need to deal with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrozzer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/15/02 11:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legos and Roy?

<br>
Ok, so maybe it doesnt /cackle, im just making this stuff up,  bahahaahahhahahhahahaha but anyway...<br>
<br>
I dont claim to know everything, but here was my take on it, for what its worth..: <br>
<br>
RNG didnt &quot;have&quot; to clear PoG for Comps.  We chose too in a trade off.  You see, we made a mistake and went in early, (patch-screwup) before the EV rotation like agreed.  In other words, we were in there on Comps rotation, much like Legendary was in Transcended's rotation when they were offered a fair shot in a later guilds turn (ours).   Instead of leaving NtoV that night after we found out we were accidentally early, we made a compromise so we could stay in and try.  Therefore, didnt have to wait a week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
So what?  We killed Roy early, people in the guild who wanted a PoG raid anyway were overjoyed, and we pulled it off respectfully.   Everyones happy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   No training, no ooc smack-talking, no flameboarding, no GM petitioning to get the other guild kicked out'ing...   guess we missed out huh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;giggles&gt;<br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> I read every post in this long long long thread (well several of them) . During that time I have kept my mouth shut as it seemed little point in saying anything. But here goes ...<br>
<br>
When legos all that time ago entered into NTOV we actually went to kill flurries in preparation for an &quot;official&quot; shot at Aary. While we were preping to enter into NTOV we were trained by some transcended members. Or at least that is how it appeared to 99% of us that were there and certainly what some members of Trans admitted to and were /petition and /reported for and so lead to GMs ordering Trans to leave the zone for 24hours. <br>
<br>
Legendary then did decide to fuck Trans. Was it right ? It felt like it at the time. Would I personally do it again ? No<br>
<br>
This is one Legendary member that will not be going to NTOV to kill named dragons until after we have killed Aary. When should we have a go at Aary ? When we have talked to the guilds currently in the rotation and given a CLEAR shot at him and a reasonable time slot opening to do this. By a clear shot I dont mean with 30 - 60 of another guild sat at the zone in adding to the lag and waiting for us to wipe and storm in front of us.<br>
<br>
The time has coem to put this one to bed and sort it out like adults. The rotation IMHO is the only way NTOV can be<br>

<br>
Are you kidding me?  We will never get a clear shot.<br>
<br>
These peeps are so interrested in keeping us out of the rotation that they will find every fucking reason to keep us out.<br>
<br>
I am sure discussion are ongoing between guild leaders to allow us a fair chance at Roy, if not since most in this thread believe we are jackass', maybe it's time we start acting like jackass'.<br>
<br>
LOL, Legendary has probably outgrown NTOV (My guess AN has), maybe we shouldn't even bother with the fucking zone, do what EV and Comps do, and visit zone if we need to.<br>

Ariar, discussions are NOT ongoing.  That's largely because none of your piece of shit officers have had the common courtesy to send a tell to a rotation guild.  If they do, it's when the other guild is already gathering for their run on NToV.  HOW HARD IS IT TO SEND A TELL 3 DAYS IN ADVANCE?!?  Want to do something useful, Ariar? *snorts*  Remind one of your raid leaders to send a tell to Lilwee or Rynnia TONIGHT, since that would be a few days in advance of an Aary spawn.<br>
<br>
Time to START acting like jackasses?  Hello?  Here's news!  You have been acting like total jackasses from the get-go.  Maybe you could change gears and try a bit of courtesy.<br>
<br>
And just for the record, you cannot 'outgrow' a zone unless you can 'do' the zone.  You've already tried the l33t &quot;visit zone if we need to&quot; strategy and failed miserably.<br>

It has happened last 3 spawns until a rotation guild has come in for their raid and walked over you.  That is the whole point.  Are you on shrooms?  LSD?  Some kind of reality altering drug?!?  Something is SERIOUSLY messed up in your head if you think you have been respecting a rotation so far, or doing just about anything that shows courtesy or respect.  <br>

<br>
I was gonna say this is a lie, as I personally saw this happen once, and it's fairly well documented on this board that Lego tried Aary on RNG's turn one time.  I seem to remember something about trains... /shrug.<br>
<br>
But then I read the key word &quot;kill&quot; so that, after all, this is a true statement.  Of course I'm sure you would have killed Aary if you had wanted to, and these little encounters you seem to be having are just &quot;practice&quot; against Aary for your real try.
