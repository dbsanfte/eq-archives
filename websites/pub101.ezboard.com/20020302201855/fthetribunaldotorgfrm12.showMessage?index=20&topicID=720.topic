<br>
It takes a level 50 almost *zip* time to recover lost experience. Experience loss is much more of an annoyance at the mid levels.<br>
<br>
Camelot is getting a heck of a lot more content added. In the next couple months, there's going to be housing added. Already there has been dragons(swooping dragons! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) added, epic zones, in the next 6 or so weeks there will be extra low level RVR zones added, so you don't have to get up to level 40 to enjoy that aspect of the game. Rogue classes have finally been fixed, though that's arguable I suppose.<br>
<br>
DAoC is picking up speed again a bit now... I'd say go ahead and try it, and even those that have quit it because of lack of content or whatever... go ahead and renew your account in 3 months. It's finally getting out of beta stage.<br>

Fairly extensive RvR and PvE experience.  Midgard only, though.<br>
<br>
Here's a list of pros and cons to Dark Age of Camelot:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pros </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
- Every class can solo for experience.  Not all can solo *well* or even get *good* experience soloing, but it is in theory possible, for EVERY class.<br>
<br>
- Quest system.. The low to mid level quests are very well thought out and give extremely good rewards for the level of the questor.  Quests are very easy to complete.  All class specific &quot;epic&quot; quests (meaning quests that start at level 1 and last till level 50 - when the system is complete) can be done *SOLO* and net very good items.  For example, the healer &quot;epic weapon&quot; is better for the class than almost all other higher level items that healers can get.  Plus you can choose if you want a 1h hammer, 2h hammer or staff.  Also, there are many &quot;one time drop&quot; items that count as quests.  For example, you kill a named goblin and he drops a +5 strength ring for you, one time.  You can't get it again on that character.  This prevents farming named spawns for rare items, and allows anyone who is appropriate level to get the item.  <br>
<br>
- Monster encounters involve more than fighting higher level mobs with more hit points and damage output.  There's &quot;Bring a Friend&quot; monsters, scout monsters, and more advanced AI.  For example, if a mob is &quot;pulled&quot; and &quot;brings a friend&quot; (or two), the friends usually don't go for tank / melee types first - they attack weaker caster, archer and healer targets.  This isn't advanced ueber AI or anything, but I prefer it to EQ.  Yes, there's certainly the upgrade mobs that hit for more and have more hit points, but the differences in the encounters as players get higher level are more complex than that.<br>
<br>
- Item level system.  Discourages twinking (ha!) to a degree.  More importantly, balances twinks against other &quot;normal&quot; characters - so you don't have a twink that overshadows other lower level characters so much that only twinks are desired for groups.  Yes they have an edge, but there's an abundance of level-appropriate gear that is fairly easy for anyone to obtain from level 1-50.<br>
<br>
- Realm vs. Realm as an end game is a refreshing change from EQ.  Players have much better AI than monsters ;).  There are new &quot;epic&quot; zones, that have extremely high level monsters, and high level loot, but I don't see that as the &quot;end game,&quot; more like a means to an end - get more levels, more equipment.<br>
<br>
- Variety in classes.  In Midgard, at least, there's a variety in each of the classes.  Meaning that you could have two characters that are the same class and have completely different abilities.  There's a lot more individuality than there was in EverQuest.  A Shaman (Midgard secondary priest class) can be a better healer than a Healer (Midgard primary priest class).  One healer might be extremely good at buffing other characters and poor at healing and another might be extremely good at healing and poor at buffing.    One warrior might be extremely offense capable and deal a lot of damage (high weapon skill) or extremely defensive (high parry/shield skills).  Basically, classes aren't cookie cutters in DAoC like they are in EQ.<br>
<br>
- Spells are received by leveling or specializing in the spell line.  You don't have to camp your high level spells to get them, its automatic.  There's no spellbook, no limit on which spells you can have &quot;ready&quot; to cast at a given time.  Just open the spell list, make a hotkey for the spells and you're set.  <br>
<br>
- Buffs don't have to be recast every hour.  There's &quot;concentration&quot; buffs that are cast once and last until the target or caster zone or die.  <br>
<br>
- No zoning.  &quot;Zones&quot; are linked regions like in EQ, but the game doesn't have to reload each zone every time you change regions.  Only when entering or exiting cities, dungeons and enemy realms will a character &quot;zone.&quot;  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THE GAME IS INCOMPLETE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  There are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> severe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> balance problems between the classes, various aspects of Realm vs Realm, there's very few quests and one-time drops over level 35 (they are abundant level 1-25, then start thinning out after that).  <br>
<br>
- There's no public chat channel outside of cities/towns/keeps.  This makes it difficult to form groups and leaves out a lot of the social aspect to &quot;massively multiplayer online game.&quot;  <br>
<br>
- Monsters look the same.  There's relatively few models for monsters, so there's a lot that look the same.  I'm as sick of werewolves in DAoC as i was of frogloks in EQ.<br>
<br>
- Realm vs Realm is very unbalanced and prone to the most whining by bitchy gimps on message boards.  The realm of midgard was very strong, and healers were a good strong class.  Now, Midgard is getting owned completely by Albion and Hibernia because healers faced a HUGE nerf to their pacification line.  Several classes have faced extremely heavy nerfs because of the whining about those classes to Mythic.  There's more problems with realm vs realm than I care to post here...<br>
<br>
- Specialization is locked - once you choose a spec and spend the points, you're stuck with it.  If you made a mistake, tough shit, you can't change it.  That means all those healers that had pacification nerfed cant go back and change their skills.<br>
<br>
- Only 16 concentration buffs can be cast.  There's a concentration &quot;pool&quot; but a 16 buff limit.  I can cast 16 high level buffs and still have half my conc bar left.... er...<br>
<br>
I've got a lot more to say about DAoC, good and bad, but I'll leave it at that, for now.  I hope that answers your inquiry Loegan.<br>
<br>
For the record, I'm still playing DAoC, and I do enjoy it more than EQ.  Realm vs Realm, despite the problems, is a lot more fun for the &quot;end game&quot; than pharming phat lewts. <p><p>

Talamay's write-up is pretty accurate, and I am too tired right now to do my own, so there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My main is level 39 now, and now that stuff is actually blue to orange to me out in the PVP frontiers, I'm enjoying that aspect of it more. <br>
<br>
Honestly, I miss only the people of EQ/Tribunal..a lot...but not the game itself at all. <p><br><br><img src="http://www.brightdsl.net/~mdrnhl/aruthsig.gif" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucarydeconnla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cary de Connla</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/14/02 1:18:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is DAoC worth a try?</span><hr size=1> lvl 35 druid<br>

<br>
<br>
It really depends on what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for a less demanding mmorpg, DAOC is ideal.   You can log on for an hour or 10 hours, doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
EQ is a level treadmill, too.<br>
<br>
A lot of people who talk about redundancy and it being quiet are also people who obviously power leveled.. If you take time to meet people, attend events and socialize, participate in RvR, it breaks up the monotony of the treadmill.<br>
<br>
Talamay hit on some good points.<br>
<br>
Sure there's no twinking and you do need to update your stuff regularly.. but it's not really that much of a concern.  If you play harder than most (quest, dungeon crawl, etc) You're going to have better equipment.  So, there is a leg up if you want it. (i horribly twink my mentalist--twinking isn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> exactly dead</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.  EQ  really seems to revolve around loot, where i meet people who play DAOC and their ideals revolve around strats, Fun and Adventure.   The big thing to do is RvR raids, stealing keep, relics etc.  No_loot_drops off of your opponent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  So, the people who are attracted to it seem a bit more mature.  <br>
<br>
Ahhhh!  Do you know how refreshing it is to walk away from an RvR raid with no one squabbling over loot?  No, you don't.  It's really something you would begin to appreciate. <br>
<br>
I really enjoy the ai on mobs... Talamay covered that well<br>
<br>
Yes, you're limited to 16 buffs.. as a druid, i find this annoying.. i'd LOVE to buff my melee more.  <br>
*However*  You're not spending half your time recasting buffs.  Once they're on, they stay until they log or zone out of the dungeon.  It's a small price to pay.  Also.. i have bards and wardens, in the group, who can cast my baseline buffs.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Over all, i'm just happy not to get bugged constantly for buffs.  It makes a difference.. and allows you to relax and play for a change. <br>
<br>
Like Milos was saying.  I miss some of my friends from EQ... but not EQ itself.  <br>
<br>
DAoC can be a source of relaxing pleasure or you can powerlevel and fight in huge RvR battles till your legs fall off.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I play on roleplay servers... so the level of maturity i'm talking about will be substantially less, if you pick a regular server.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it worth a Try?   Yes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The biggest things lacking are class balancing and high end content. Both of which are being worked on and are getting better. Dragons/Epic Zones have been added, no dragon has been killed yet. They are adding housing soon and a epic dungeon. The epic dungeon will be owned by one realm through RvR combat. The interesting part is that Midgard may own it and then lose it. If your in there when you lose it and the other realm comes in, could be some interesting battles. <br>
<br>
One word of advice, if you thought the Wineplay boards were a sewer of trolls and flames, stay away from the vault network boards. 1/2 of them don't play and are fanboys from other games, the other half are people who want everything their way or nothing at all. You hear all these posts about quiting yet they are still there. Guild message boards are a much better forum of information and opinion.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for something different for a change, give it a try.  <p><center> Rygor Shadowfists <br>
