Aatlaar, Crush has said on multiple occassions what the Elitists were founded for and what their goals were.  He's even gone so far as to explain what the name of your guild means.  Dunno how you can think that being number 1 isn't/wasn't a goal or a claim of your guild. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>

Personally, I think it is to be the best.  I was tired of being in hate and running from the Maestro in fear.<br>
<br>
Actually, ever since I saw E/V outside of Guk having a meeting (wayyyyyyy long time ago) and they gave me fine steel, I wanted to join.  I saw Vizz and Dail kiting dorfs at the docks in BB, and hell, they gave me ringmail!  That was the shit man!<br>
<br>
I played a paladin to 54 and asked if I could join.  They said nope, so I started over as a monk.  <br>
<br>
When I finally got into E/V, we were raiding chardok that night.  I was like, level 52, and the main puller.  It was crazy ass shit, I died so many times.<br>
<br>
But anyway, I'm sort of rambling.  I think people join big guilds like E/V to do and experience new things they otherwise couldn't with their smaller guilds.  I mean sure;  hate and fear are great, but that's all there WAS back then for smaller guilds (around when kunark was a few months old).  Whether it be Chardok Royals, or WW, or TOV, or DN, or ST, it was all new and incredibly fun.<br>
<br>
TOV the first time through was the most fun in EQ i've ever had I think.  Especially when we pulled Vyemm to a huge ass open room and got tossed all over the fuckin place. <p>Flassh Draconis</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujaeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/02 11:34:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Dyran:  Ahhh.. okay.

Anyone who thinks that people who join EV just do it for the loot are as sadly misinformed as someone who actualy <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> join EV for loot. Those people get disappointed fast and move to the Legends server.<br>
<br>
It's true, in EV you will see the very best items in the entire game. But you will see them go to people who have consistantly helped and been there for a year or more. It takes alot of time and effort to be considered for the good stuff. Our looting policy penalizes people who don't show.<br>
<br>
Sorry to dispell another myth of EV. Wow, we probably are alot like your little guild huh? Ecept we have the people and the power to do the stuff other guilds only dream of. About the worst you can say about someone who joins EV instead of sticking with their old going no where, disorganized, or just plain sucking guild, is this: they want to see more of EQ so bad they are willing to leave thier old friends.<br>
<br>
But hey, if you think about it. Do you have any friends from high school that are pumping gas while you are making the bucks in the computer industry? Why didn't you stick around with your gas pumping friends and work on the corner with your name on your shirt? Or yeah, because they don't have the time or initiative to suceed in what you want, so you parted ways. It doesn't make them bad people, or you a bad person, you're just different in your goals. But you can still call them up every once in a while and go out for a drink. So get over it Xav, you've got gas to pump.<br>
<br>
My apologies to all the gas pumping low initiative people out there. I didn't mean to compare you to a cry baby like Xav. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

The fact that this entire argument is fucking pointless<br>
EV kills lots of shit, and do a damn good job of it. Even if, for the sake of argument, it was evident that they WERE number 2, that wouldn't change the fact that they do a damn good job.<br>
Hell, I have respect for a guild just if it can last as long as EV has without breaking down at somepoint.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Revo- I've had the pleasure of hanging out with many a Revo member, and just about every single one of them was exceptionally cool. Yeah, they can't kill the shit that E/V can. So fucking what? I sure as hell don't care, seeing as to how I have a few pretty good friends in the guild. I know they pride themselves on a family-like atmosphere, and even from a mere one fear raid with them I can attest to the fact that that atmosphere really does exist.<br>
<br>
As for the manna robe in question? If the rules don't say he has to give it back, then that's what they say. I, for one, am with Loegan here in that the loot that is awarded to you is *yours*. If you hadn't earned it, it should never have been handed to you in the first place. Of course, some guild leaders think differently, which is why they *specify* otherwise.<br>
<br>
If revo did have a rule that he had to give it back, then Ganndor has an obligation to give it back and E/V has an obligation to make sure that he does. Otherwise both E/V and Ganndor come out looking pretty damn classless.<br>
As it is, this has just turned into an entirely subjective one opinion vs. another pissing match that obviously isn't going anywhere. <p><center><img src=http://www.casiesplace.com/cntchoc.jpg></center>

<br>
An old friend in E/V send me a tell the next day ganndor left guild, while they were in PoG.  Asking why ganndor left.  i told her at the time, that he has differences with certain individuals in the guild.  Then i proceed to back up his character and value to a guild.  Ganndor is a good person, he shows up a lot, and knows his job, would be a benefit to any guild that wants him, if he's seeking entrance.  I stand by my testiments.  <br>
<br>
Ganndor's problem is that he sometimes overreact to situations.  He's not a greedy individual, passed on lots of loot, looked after fellow members.  He has a serious problem with a member in the guild, and left because of it.  <br>
<br>
Xav and I are old friends of Ganndor.  We saw him grew up, got him into Dies, and he followed us to Revo.  Now to the overreacted part.  Ganndor left a guild he loves so much due to differences with certain individual.  Perhaps he wishes people to focus on the reason of his leaving, vs the consequences.  Ganndor was approached about the robe before this whole shannigan started.  He over react to this, as seeing that people is painting him as nothing but a loot whore.  <br>
<br>
No one is going to make ganndor give back that robe. Not E/V, not Xav, not Mojak.  He has to do it out of his own conscience and accord.  Robe was passed him from a revo wizard when he left the guild.  The robe should be passed on to another revo wizard when Gann left.  <br>
<br>
With regard to changing the the charter, not everything is about you gann.  This is about keeping the guild strong.  How would anyone know a month ago that Ganndor was leaving?<br>
<br>
That's all i gotta say about the stem of this whole thread.<br>

<br>
Sorry to all those defending me in my absence here.<br>
<br>
Here is my post that i responded to these acusations with on E/V's board. This is all i have to say about it and will be my first and last post on this subject.<br>
<br>
Xav, im not going into this anymore. I fought with and for this guild for over 2 years. I attended about 98% of the large raids i was online for. I NEVER missed anything you asked me to attend and never gave less than 100% to Revolution. I was by far one of the strongest members in Revolution.<br>
<br>
All ive done you take and slap me in the face with it. I sent you tells and discused things with you and the coleader about me leaving. Due to the ways YOU and ALL of your PERSONAL friends (the officers of Revo) had treated me i had in my mind no choice but to leave the guild. I persoanaly helped kill Trak over 20+ times. I missed two trak kills that Revo has ever had. Out of All this i got a robe and a tooth. Yet you say i was GIVEN the robe, not earned, given. <br>
<br>
You and your friends treated me like crap and drove me to leave. Now you want the gear that even you said i above all others earned. Not going to happen Xav, im 27, married with 2 girls (9 and 10). I know right from wrong, and you even asking me for ANYTHING back is wrong. You can have your robe back, give me the countless hours i gave you and a portion of ALL the loot that revo obtained from mobs i helped kill and we will call it even. <br>
<br>
I am a man of pricipal, I am very sorry that this kind of garbage is on your board E/V. But i will not give what is rightfully mine away because it makes things easier on me. However i can see that this is not something that EV should be having to deal with. Xav, I will leave EV and go solo and hang out with the new players before you bend me to your will. So you can continue to bash me and or fill EVs board up with garbage till they take it out on me and cause me to leave or remove me if that makes you happy. But you and your friends will see nothing more from me than the 2+ years i already gave you.<br>

When I recall the funnest times I ever had in Everquest, those times are up in the top 10.<br>
<br>
I know most dont know who &quot;The Coven&quot; or &quot;Emperium&quot; even are, yet I know some in Revolution do, because they are a part of them as well.  I left when Emperium was joining with other guilds to make Revolution, not because I was a loot whore, or I wanted to be a facist that could blurt around that I was better than anyone else, I wanted to see dragons, and I wanted to kill things that I only heard about in web pages, and talk in OOC.<br>
<br>
Im dead certain that I had a few items from my previous guilds that I could of traded away, but I didnt.  I didnt ask if anyone wanted the things I accumulated, and I was never asked to give anything up.  These are the same people that are in the woodwork of Revolution now, and unless things have durastically changed, I cant imagine the preasure to give up items that one has earned has changed, until the outlook of someone joining another guild that is less than favorable makes the situation different somehow.<br>
<br>
I have nothing but respect for those that duke it out, and work with their friends, and my only regret is that I couldnt have both worlds at the same time.  I wanted more out of EQ, so I left my circle of old EQ friends to join a new guild, and yes, I've made new friends with the so called &quot;evil&quot; people of EV, who I used to both admire and despise.  Yes, at one time I didnt like the idea of EV, I will admit.  But in the end, people are people, only seperated by an opinion of status.<br>
<br>
Bla bla bla, The Vicar has blabbered on again.  Just stop yelling at eachother about meaningless crap, because when it all comes down to it, its not the loot that kills mobs, its the people.<br>

<br>
It was not in Revos charter to return items when i signed up over two years ago. The charter was changed a month ago to include this section and i never saw or heard anyone mention the said changes until about a week ago.<br>
<br>
P.S. I was at the raid the robe dropped at and was awarded it, it was not passed to me it was given to me. I remeber it in guild chat as being &quot;Gratz Ganndor on your mana robe&quot;. Not &quot;Gratz Ganndor on your loaner robe&quot;<br>

Your claims that Ganndor is a thief, that EV is somehow a once great but now fallen uberguild, or that EV is desperate for members have not panned out. All that's let is to shout April Fools! and hope that some people will think you are really not as clueless as you've appeared.<br>
<br>
As I said back on page one, this is all a desperate cry for attention by a wannabe uber guild leader. Poor thing. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

<br>
Sad too, cause most of your other points were legit, but it always ends with trying to intimidate people into shutting up by rubbing their face in your accomplishments.<br>
<br>
Xav made a mistake. He came at EV for something that was between Revo and Ganndor. I agree it's not EVs place to enforce Revos rules. No way that EV can know what the true facts are, what agreements were made and what agreements were broken. Hell, for all they know Revo could have sold him the robe. It's not their job to get to the bottom of it.<br>
<br>
But I can say that blaming every conflict on people being jealous of your uberness is getting old. As wrong as Xav was, blaming what he did on jealousy is just pure arrogance. Did it ever occur to you that maybe... just maybe, he felt he had a legit gripe?<br>
<br>
Please, enough of the &quot;we are gods and all you peons are just jealous&quot; routine. It was irritating enough when I was in EV, but now that I too am one of the peons it's just plain insulting. <p><br>
