Read this article and see what you think...now that the 9/11 fervent feelings have somewhat died down a bit.  Oh, and I'm prepared for the ensuing backlash of flames, but nonetheless doesn't change the fact that I agree with the writer:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  The first anniversary of 9/11.  Oh the tragedy! Oh the humanity! But, mostly, oh the heroes!  Those brave men and women who gave their lives as they rushed to the scene.<br>
<br>
Did anyone in all of the flag-waving, goose-bumped hysteria ever click on their minds long enough to ask themselves this simple question:  What were the rescue workers <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> supposed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to do when they got the call -- join Seinfeld for coffee?  Oh, but they gave their lives, you say.  In the &quot;volunteering&quot; sense, they gave nothing.  They are trained to respond to calls the way Pavlov's dogs slobbered to a bell.<br>
<br>
Now, don't misunderstand.  They are important members of the community. (And so are trash collectors) I couldn't go to sleep at night without them, knowing that they're down at the station eating junk food and reminiscing about how cool they were at the deli that day, strutting across the parking lot and looking out of the corners of their eyes to see if people were noticing the Hero in their presence.<br>
<br>
The rescue workers did not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> give</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> their lives.  They may have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> risked</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> their lives.  But they chose that line of work.  And, again, what option did they have?  By contrast, take the Polish priest Maximillian Kolbe.  Imprisoned at Auschwitz, he volunteered to exchange his life for that of a young father who was due to be executed.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> That</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, folks, is a hero.<br>
<br>
America's reaction to 9/11 shows how pathetic and spoiled we are.  A couple of buildings fall down and the nation goes berserk.  Civil liberties are violated and the feds are looking through backpacks at the damned post office.  This has become a nation of wimps, including those other heroes who tried but failed to subdue a few hostile Arabs brandishing...ha ha -- box cutters!<br>
<br>
Since more American died that week as a result of cigarettes, what I will be mourning each 9/11 is that the firefighting heroes aren't authorized to turn their hoses on those.<br>

They did their jobs, and they did them pretty fucking spectacularly. They were caught as off guard as the rest of America. Nobody expected this. <br>
The fire fighters in the second tower by and large went in fucking *expecting* to die.

Very talented journalist. Here's what he had to say in an article entitled: &quot;Americans: love the U.S. secretly&quot;<br>
 <br>
<br>
&quot;I thought I exhausted all of my resources in the &quot;opinions&quot; department and said all I needed to say over the last two years. When issues gnaw at my conscience, I try to ignore it – and I have, for the most part. Then yesterday morning I woke up only to find that misinformed, naysaying misanthropes still exist and for some odd reason, they still get media attention. <br>
<br>
No, I'm not suggesting that Phil Donohue is a fool; I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> telling</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you that he is a fool, but it's not his shenanigans that make my blood boil. He poses no threat to me. I know one day soon he'll move down to Cuba with all of the rest of his communist buddies so he can oppress the less-fortunate masses and listen to Jefferson Airplane. I'm breaking my silence on behalf of another godless, cognac-sucking pessimist. <br>
<br>
I want to have it out with Norman Mailer. Who, you ask, is Norman Mailer? Well, in this weekend's London Sunday Times, he joined Hillary Clinton, Phil Donohue and philosophy professors nationwide in the march to propagate a hatred of America. <br>
<br>
Before I shred Mailer to pieces, it's important that I give my spin on his theories that I actually understand. Mailer's 8,000 word diatribe condemned the patriotic fervor running rampant in the United States, citing &quot;there's just too much anger here, too much ruptured vanity, too much shock, too much identity crisis,&quot; and &quot;worst of all, too much patriotism.&quot; <br>
<br>
With a heavy heart, I agree with this portion of Mailer's ranting. At this point after Sept. 11, America needs to return to how things used to be, before a group of rich, fundamentalist lunatics sent 19 other lunatics up into commercial airlines as messengers of hate. Sadly, America has not returned to our normal state of mind. Americans (aside from most New England politicians) always loved America, but now most Americans love America and they can't exactly put their finger on why. That, my friends, is &quot;too much anger&quot; and &quot;too much patriotism.&quot; <br>
<br>
However, Americans cannot be condemned for how they feel. Even a year later the United States is still shocked – and for a perfectly legitimate reason. We watched 3,000 people die live on television one sunny Tuesday morning; that spawned our &quot;ruptured vanity&quot; and started our &quot;identity crisis.&quot; America was the invincible big brother who always got picked first in neighborhood football games; even that big brother choked back tears when he fell and scraped his knee. This past year, we've been sitting out a few plays to nurse our wounds. <br>
<br>
What kills Mailer is the fact that once we heal, we'll get picked first again. But we have to listen to liberal crybabies like Mailer and heed his warning: don't get cocky, don't get too full of ourselves. Otherwise, we'll fall into the trap Mailer set for us, where &quot;culturally, emotionally America is growing more loutish, arrogant and vain.&quot; If we return to normal, the rest of the world, like Mailer, won't laugh at us behind our backs when we kneel at the graves of our lost brothers and sisters. <br>
<br>
It's okay to hate terrorists; it's fundamentally wrong to hate someone because he or she looks like a terrorist. Mailer hates Americans across the board, but remember, he's in the right, we're in the wrong. If you want to be like Norman Mailer and think like Norman Mailer, group everyone together without bias and condemn them for something you don't understand. If someone questions you, just say you voted for Clinton and you think George W. Bush is too stupid to run the country. You'll be on CNN in no time.&quot;<br>

So while I agree with this guy saying that the rescue workers of 9/11 risked their lives, instead of &quot;gave&quot; their lives to the cause, I also beleive that risk is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> exactly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what made them heroes that day.

These rescue workers weren't dogs, and it might be their jobs to save people, but they are in no way &quot;conditioned&quot; to do it. <br>
<br>
They are trained to do it, and they consciously chose to risk their lives to do their job. They could have just as easily refused to have done it, so comparing them to Pavlov's dogs is not only un-analogous, but it's also a degradation to their effort, and an insult to their memory.<br>

Just because you choose a profession in which you risk your life doesn't make it any less glorifying, in fact, it makes it more so.  Rescue workers don't get paid ridiculous amounts of money for the risks they take, yet they still prefer the possession and the risk associated with it.  They aren't necessarily any moreso heroes than every other time they rush into burning buildings, to save lives, by choice, but my no means does the fact that they chose their possession make them less heroic.<br>
Let's allude omg~:<br>
Beowulf, an epic hero, he &quot;chose&quot; to risk his life on several occasions.  Why?  To save lives.  Was he paid for it?  You betcha, very well in fact.  Doesn't that make it a sort of profession for him?  There is still honor associated with it, even though its a job, and that may have been his main driving interest in his decisions, or perhaps it was the wage, but regardless, he's still a hero, isn't he? <p><hr>

<br>
What puzzles me is why someone would choose this guy's words to get across to others what they themselves think, and would say that they &quot;agree&quot; with him. He's an idiot. Your posting of this particular piece actually makes me weary of your intentions, given the place in which you chose to post this and the lack of much of your own commentary on the subject. I think the main thing here is &quot;they are not heroes&quot;. Post a true article if you must use others' words to get your views known, by someone that actually knows a thing or two about what really makes a hero and can use a more educated argument than &quot;this guy took the place of this other guy that was gonna be executed, now that's a hero!!~!&quot;. Or, don't post anything at all, cause it seems to me most of us are pretty tired of arguing this subject a full year later and the majority of those that are currently going on and on and on and on about it are moronic ranters that just want their name in the local paper's opinion section.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaandaie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aandaie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/14/02 4:54:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.thisismycool.com/aandaie/imagesP/55ans.jpg height=48 width=48></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ya know, I gotta agree with this</span><hr size=1> <br>
I don't think that was very well written but I get the intent.<br>
It was those people's jobs, they did their job. Some of their jobs are kind of heroic to begin with so in a way they were already heroic by definition. I don't think a building falling on someone doing their job makes them a &quot;hero&quot; though, in and of itself. Most people did not even seem to think that either building would fall. I mean.. some of them went back to WORK. Me, if I was in any building in the area, would have been a few blocks away shortly after the first plane hit. No one would be call me a hero but I'd be here still.<br>
<br>
The whole &quot;hero&quot; label thing is kind of moot though. One person's hero is another person's infidel or terrorist. They are someone who died in this one tragedy on 9/11.<br>
<br>
As far as the hijackings you have to remember that they were just that, hijackings. The asumption of a passenger would be that the plane was being hijacked to GO SOMEWHERE, not into the side of a building at full throttle. That last plane that crashed had people on it who figured out what was happening after talking to outsiders on their cell phones but the first planes had no warning. They could have been going to Bermuda for all they knew. <br>
<br>
At THIS point I doubt if its going to be as easy for someone to hijack things, passenger's will be under the assumption that they will die anyway. That gives the passenger a lot more freedom to make a choice.<br>
<br>
This happened a year ago though. We dealt with it then. I'm hoping dealing with it again doesn't happen every subsequent 9/11. Its over. <p><center><BR>

After the first one fell, I'd have to assume that some people got a general idea as to what might happen to the other one. <p><center><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/P6020/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P6020CustomImage0091544.gif></center>
