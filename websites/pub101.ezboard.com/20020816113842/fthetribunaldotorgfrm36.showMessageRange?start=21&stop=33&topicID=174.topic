<br>
First off, I have never seen you criticize anything BUT the American government and American policies. And you have to admit, quoting people like Chomsky, someone with extreme anti-American views (i.e. The twin towers are America's fault), would lead one to believe that your not to fond of America. Personally, I have a lot of issues with American policy, but they are mostly domestic (i.e. high taxes, bad laws, ext.). I do not think that America has bad foreign policies, except maybe in the fact that we give too much money to so many countries, and most of them take that money, then spit in our face, so to speak. It's not that you critisize S., it is the fact that you seem to demonize America. If this is not your intention, then you should read your posts and try and detrermine if it comes out that way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;your chain of reasoning is flawed and therefore you cannot state as a valid argument that Grozzer hates America. In other words : your &quot;simple deductive&quot; logic does not hold water because it's not simple deductive logic that you are applying, but bad rhetoric and misleading semantics. Nothing more - nothing less. It doesnt prevent you to force on everyone your opinion that Grozzer hates America, but you cannot force a logical proof of it on anyyone just yet. Do you now get the difference between valid and true conclusions ?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My chain of reasoning would be flawed, I conceed, if Chomsky were not so anti-American. He is, but you say he isn't. Again, I say, I go by what the man writes. You go by, well, I don't even know. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It just so happens that it was economically very convenient convenient to claim independance, as Britain was outlawing slavery at the time...&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a perfect example of how you state your opinions. You present them as fact, when they are not. The above statement says &quot;America wanted it's freedom from Britian becuase Britian wanted to outlaw slavery&quot;. This is what I call anti-American spin, that you put on everything. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Now if you believe that this system is just as perfect and peachy as the capitalist one, then you are mistaken.

I don't understand what you are saying here. What system? Nothing is perfect, never said it was. It's just the best.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;&gt;Chomsky hating America is not subjective<br>

<br>
So, when a man devotes a lot of his life to spewing out as much crazy anti-American propaganda as Chomsky does, we cannot assume that he hates America? Ok, whatever you want to believe. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;&gt;You refused to acknowledge Dumai's many links to what people think of Chomsky<br>
<br>
Correct I have not replied to Dumai's post. Mostly because half of the links are one liner extracts taken out of context by an organisation whose candid goal is to &quot;debunk all the liberal propaganda&quot; (verbatim). Out of the list, I have flagged two links that actually seem to contain facts and quotes that apparently highlight inconsistencies in Chomsky's arguments.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Alan Dershowitz is out to debunk liberals? You truly believe that?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The rest are editorials containing mostly ad-hominem attacks, which I am dismissing. Why ? First : the text I presented was an editorial. An editorial is not news, it is an analysis of the news. And to jump ahead and save you the quoting, when I criticized the Sun, I should have been more precise in targetting the quality of the Sun's editorials (my wording is actually rather specific there too if you care to check). This is of course subjective and your opinion on the subject may differ. The reason I think the Sun's editorial are cheap is because they tend to present very simplistic arguments based on distorted facts and more often blatantly wrong logic. I also think they tend to advocate a very xenophobic attitude and publish material that will increase their sales by flattering public opinion rather than rigorous journalistic inquiry. Then again : how often have you read an edition of the Sun in the morning while riding the Tube ?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Exactly, you dismiss it because of the source. You have your reasons for not likeing or believing the source, but that is basically why you dismissed it. Based on past experiences or beliefs about the sources, you dismiss it. That goes to the whole section that followed this.<br>
<br>
Actually, I do not have any more time to go through this.<br>
<br>
Let's just agree to disagree and leave it at that...<br>

What I object to is this kind of crap, Kellianne.<br>
<br>
America is its land and its people. Its people are diverse, and hold a variety of opinions.<br>
<br>
America is therefore NOT defined by what is done in the name of America by the Bush regime. Those are transient things that pass by in the history of America, and its land and people remain.<br>
<br>
You are making the same misrepresentation as the Bush regime is trying to sell to Americans. That anyone who questions a president whose best friends are corrupt billionaires handing billions to the arms industry and creating a war, is somehow a supporter of terrorism ... &quot;if you're not for us, you're against us&quot; ... but who is &quot;us&quot;? It's not America, it's the Republicans.<br>
<br>
I hope the days of investigating people for &quot;un-American activities&quot; are over. Americans have respect for a diversity of opinion. I have faith that conservative forces will not be allowed to run amok as they have in the past. <p><br><br>

If you really want to win this debate, you'll have to prove that Chomsky is Anti-American.  You can't state something as a fact, without first proving it as fact.  It's obvious that this claim is being challenged.  Answer the challenge, and your logic chain will hold water.<br>

All those links that Dumai posted are excellent pieces that proves why Chomsky hates America. S. refuses to read them, or dismisses them offhand. I could not do a better job then David Horowitz does in the 2nd piece, when he goes into full detail of how Chomsky misrepresents facts by taking them out of historical context and leaving out out factual events that were taking place at the time. I feel the argument with S. has become futile because he will not acknowledge what is there. <br>
Here was the link:<br>

Bush is the president. As was Clinton at one point, and many others. Yes, they speak for their parties on an individual basis, but, being Presidents, they also speak for Americans, as a whole. I did not agree with most of Clinton's policies, but he was my president. And, like it or not, he spoke for me, as an American. I did not say you couldn't constantly bash America, I just stated that you did. <br>
<br>
You also misinterpet Bush. His either your with us or against us speech is directly aimed at fighting the terrorist regimes throughout the world, and I am hard pressed to believe that you want to side with the terroists. Bush is not creating a war, the terrorists are. Bush did not bomb the twin towers, the terrorists did. Are you angry that he wants to fight back? Most Americans agree that we should. It was the single largest attack on American soil by aggresor in the history of this country. Are we supposed to just sit idly by? Or, should we just get the terrorist group that did this, and let the others roam free until they do it to us? I live right near there. I saw the destruction. I was part of the chaos. I pray that you never in your lifetime, Grozzer, have to deal with something like that. Even if I know it would wake you up.<br>

Are you referring here to McCarthy and the communist hunts of the 50's here? I agree, I don't want a return to that. This whole paragraph though is unfounded with regards to Bush.

Kell, just to clearify and not get to propogandist.  The Twin Towers attack was the single largest attack on American soil by aggresor in &quot;modern&quot; times.  Many wars were faught on American soil after the creation of the country.  Thousands of people dying, isn't a unique event upon American soil.<br>

I am plenty woken up, thanks. I am 32 years old and I have crossed 21 countries overland, including some of the poorest places on earth. I have been welcomed into people's dirt-floor homes, attacked by gypsies, crossed continents alone by bicycle, bus and train, and lived for months at a time in a tent. I have had high-paid jobs and luxuriated in five-star hotels, and I have been on unemployment benefits without a place to live.<br>
<br>
I have witnessed how the blinkered greed and ignorance of a few powerful people causes immense pressure and hardship and cultural devastation for the majority. And I have seen it all packaged up in self-perpetuating lies and distortions.<br>
<br>
I have seen the fire and hate in the eyes of the Moslem extremist rallying hungry Indonesians at election time in Sumatra. And I have seen the obese Western consumer waddling to Wal-Mart.<br>
<br>
I have struggled to take it all in. I have also watched terrorists fly passenger jets into the World Trade Centre live on CNN, and watched the repercussions on countries I know well.<br>

My worldview is complex. And I have looked more than just my fellow citizens in the eye. Have you? Could you? Or are they just the mass, anonymous, fictional enemy, the &quot;towel-heads&quot; that die meaningless deaths to US bombs? <p><br><br>

<br>
Thats all well and good Grozz, but this is an internet forum, and you can claim all the life experiences as you want to lend credibility to your statements, but it is impossible to prove. I can say I am the King of France, but it doesn't mean much. I am not saying I don't believe you, but this diatribe of what you did in your life, and therefore you know the &quot;real&quot; truth is really not appropriate in an internet forum setting. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I have witnessed how the blinkered greed and ignorance of a few powerful people causes immense pressure and hardship and cultural devastation for the majority. And I have seen it all packaged up in self-perpetuating lies and distortions.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Other than the &quot;I have seen the world&quot; statement, this particulair paragraph is laced with generalizations and I don't really know what you are trying to say. That people around the world are oppressed by their governments? Yes, that is true. I don't know where this comes into play though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I have seen the fire and hate in the eyes of the Moslem extremist rallying hungry Indonesians at election time in Sumatra. And I have seen the obese Western consumer waddling to Wal-Mart.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The third reference to your experienced self. Again, this means nothing in an ineternet forum. This paragraph though, gives insight onto how you view the world. More specifically, the last sentence. Another example of you &quot;demonizing&quot; the western world, and the Wal Mart example, America specifically. Are you trying to say here that Americans are fat with wealth while the rest of the world is starving? See, everything you say is so cryptic, it's hard to decipher. Is it America's fault that they give aid to these countries and their oppresive leaders horde the aid, and starve their own people? What do you propose happen? You love to bash everything, but your solutions are non-existant.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I have struggled to take it all in. I have also watched terrorists fly passenger jets into the World Trade Centre live on CNN, and watched the repercussions on countries I know well.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What do you mean by the repercussions on countries you know well? Again, crypic. Are you referring to the US chasing down the Taliban in Afghanistan? Are you trying to say we should have done nothing? I asked this before of you and you did not answer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;My worldview is complex. And I have looked more than just my fellow citizens in the eye. Have you? Could you?

<br>
Yes, your worldview is very complex, and complexing. Your cryptic writings often criticize, but give no solutions or answers. Again, asking me what I have done with my life, and stating how experienced you are. Do you get that there is no way to prove this in an internet forum setting? The best though is the last line. It really gives insight in to how YOU actually think of people. Calling them towel heads I am sure would be extremely offensive to any muslim or arab person. I never did that, or even alluded to it. You did. They die meaningless deaths to US bombs? What do you mean by this? Again, that the US, attacked by a hostile enemy should do nothing? <br>
<br>
--------<br>
Also, I want to comment on the fact that you do not know the difference between the word regime and administration. That stinks of dishonesty. You seem to have an extremely good grasp of the English language, and to make such a claim appears to be an outright lie and backtracking. A person who claims to be as worldly as yourself should know the implications of using the word &quot;regime&quot; to describe any government. <br>

It's somewhat cryptic, yes, but not entirely.<br>
<br>
When he wrote:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
mass, anonymous, fictional enemy, the &quot;towel-heads&quot; <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The way he wrote it, it was sarcastic, and tongue in cheek.  He was describing, how we would describe such people, not how he personally describes them.<br>
<br>
Thing is Gozz, your apparent grasp on the world, is a twisted one.  The only time I've heard the words &quot;Towel-Head&quot; is from the news media harping on racism, comedians trying to get a laugh, and foreigners trying to demonize Americans as racist.  It isn't a common or even uncommon reference made to Muslims or Arabs.  At least in my middle class, suburban life.  Most commonly, we'd refer to terrorists as &quot;those pieces of shit terrorists&quot;. =)  Arabs, we just call Arabs, or we'd refer to specifically what country we are discussing.<br>
