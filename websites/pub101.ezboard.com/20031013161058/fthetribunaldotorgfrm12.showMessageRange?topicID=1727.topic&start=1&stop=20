might as well be one. Yeh, this is very long. So don't read it if you don't want to. I don't give a fuck, I had fun writing it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After spending almost a year in the guild, I can definitely say that Elimelech's old flameboard post about RNG was almost dead nuts on.<br>
<br>
Actually, it's much worse now. RNG has lost a ton of people during the last six months, and with the departure of good leaders like Broshan and Seleucus, the asshats have taken control and turned the guild into a dysfunctional circus. <br>
<br>
A couple of months ago, the elders (or at least the three that didn't run off to play Shadowbane) named Glaux as Guild Leader...a shitty SK who had just returned to the game after being gone since before PoP was released. I guess they couldn't find anyone more out of touch with the guild/game to lead RNG. Glaux, just as I predicted, turned out to be the worst GL that the guild has ever had. That fat dumbfuck didn't even know what flag mobs needed to be killed to get us to the elemental planes. He didn't have the first fucking clue what he was doing, and tried to cover that up with corpspeak bullshit about forming committees for this and that. You'd be amazed how many of RNG's sheep were suckered by his big words. Immediately following a week when RNG got first kills for Bertox and Saryn on prior momentum, Glaux seized the opportunity to post a poll asking for votes to remain the guild's GL. There were 117 yes and 8 no votes. Even making his RL friends and yes men into officers couldn't save him in the end tho. I finally decided to end that farce a few weeks ago...I stuck my neck out and clobbered him like a baby seal in guildchat, and he ran off with his tail between his legs and retired the next day. Fucking pussy.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, Revenge and Grimshadows both set their sights on the GL spot. Revenge is that same wigger you flameboard pansies have come to know and love, but a fake kinder gentler version lately, as he's been hoping to get an elder or GL position. I hear that after I removed myself last night, that nasty motherfucker had the nerve to talk in guildchat about my poor attitude?! LMFAO! Whatever. Grimshadows is some redneck twat that came from God knows where. I don't think anyone even knew he was in RNG until the remaining officers decided that anyone would be a better GL than Revenge.<br>
<br>
As RNG's new GL, Grimshadows comes with a super size bonus...a wife named Lulamila, who also happens to be RNG's Guild Counselor. Lula is the Hillary Clinton of RNG in every way. She has Grim by the nuts and runs around calling people &quot;hun&quot; and &quot;sis&quot; and stuff, while stepping on those who don't kiss her ass. You all know the type. As RNG's Guild Counselor (btw, wtf?!) Lula is supposed to be the person people vent to when they have problem, but anytime I saw anyone voice a concern, her standard answer was &quot;stfu and quit bitching&quot; LOLOL Grims also put that piece of shit wife of his on the new Raid Council he formed, despite the fact that she doesn't know squat about the game and she's that one druid every guild has who is absolutely worthless at raids. I hope she at least returned the favor by putting some lube on her strap on before she rode his ass that night. <br>
<br>
Hahhh...as I write this, I just remembered that someone mentioned a long time ago that Lula's father is Bafoemet. Wow, that fucking explains a lot. They're both drama queens, mentally unstable, and habitual liars. After making a fool of her dad for several months in a previous guild alliance, no wonder that silly trailer trash cumbucket princess was gunning for me from my very first day in RNG. That all makes sense now.<br>
<br>
There really isn't much to say about Grims. Like I said, I don't even think anyone in RNG knew he existed before this. He certainly isn't starting well. Judging by the decisions and posts he's made since becoming GL, I'm fully confident he will suck as GL and take RNG to new lows. He's trying to come off as a hardass, but he's a weak puppy and anyone can see that from a mile away.  <br>
<br>
Skeeja is RNG's First Officer..I think. He's rarely been seen the last couple months. Skeeja is horrified of any type of competition or confrontation. You can tell he got his ass kicked regularly as a kid. He's scared of his own shadow. If your guild ever runs into RNG on the way to a contested target, have no worries...Skeeja will back down and let you have it, even if RNG is there in force. <br>
<br>
As you all now know, Skeeja likes teh cock. A couple weeks ago, he came out to the guild in some long whiny post on the RNG board. It was hilarious. I see he's also posted to the flameboard now, to let the entire server know he likes to have other men stick their throbbing dicks up his pooper. Maybe he's trolling for new boyfriends, since his old one dumped him after 14 years together.<br>
<br>
Skeeja is also one of RNG's worst speech police. The second a thread on the RNG board goes negative, that jackass runs over and locks it. Yeh, let's just pretend everything is rosy, that'll fix everything. You fucking foreskin nibbler. If I ever wanted to punch anyone in the face in RNG, it was Skeeja, just for being such a god damn woman. Oh, and never believe a word that comes out of his smegma covered lips...other than locking threads, his next favorite hobby is changing rules on the fly during raids and stuff. I hated grouping with Skeeja at raids, cuz that bastard never even tries to heal his people, and he has really stanky dick breath.<br>
<br>
The Circle of Elders are representatives from each class...except SKs. I don't take shit and I don't kiss ass and I always tell it like it is, so there was no way those pussies were going to make me the SK elder. The CoE does have a few good people...like Matame, Transvaal, and Skoalis...but they can't hold back the tidal wave of stupidity pushing against them. The CoE also has some world class morons, like Ferriswolf, Yidaien, Terranine, Bdan (WOOF WOOF from Elimelech's post), and that ridiculously clueless twat Aeaolena, the Guild Recruiter. When half the guild left for Shadowbane and things were looking bad, Aeaolena's answer to RNG's problems was &quot;Log in and tell three people something you like about them&quot;. No, I am not kidding!!! She still thinks EQ is a roleplaying game too. hahaha<br>
<br>
Most of the other RNG elders are MIA. Seeing a pattern here yet? Yes you are, because the new SK elder was finally named last week. His name is Tirith. You can't congratulate him tho, cuz he's not playing EQ atm. He will be gone for at least a month, moving overseas. Yes, despite MIA elders being one of the guild's biggest problems for the last half year, Grimshadows is now naming elders he knows in advance will be MIA. LOL<br>

You can't blame all of RNG's problems on the elders tho. The guild has a bunch of fucked up members too:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Naeamian</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Other than Croneus, If the Trib ever had a useless player who rode the coattails of a guild to greatness and then talked like he was part of it, that would be Naeamian. This punk was barely in RNG for a week before he started squawking on the Trib flameboard like he was an old school badass. Pay him no attention, he's a nobody in RNG. He and Skeeja like to clog up guild chat with endless predictions of what the top guilds on the server are doing or will be doing in the near future. They are your very own fucking fanbois. If you're wearing an EV, Comps, or SI tag, please take a moment to sign some autographs for those two the next time you pass thru PoTranq. Thanks!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Horza</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, or as we referred to him, HoHorza. For months and months this living shitstain whined constantly about the guild's slow progress on PoP flags, then leeched flags for his alt bard instead of helping everyone else get theirs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bdan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - WOOF WOOF who let the dogs out? /eyeroll Was gone from EQ for months, but when Glaux needed a yes man for druid elder he suddenly popped back out of nowhere. The other druids laugh at him behind his back because they have absolutely no reason to respect him, except that Glaux named him before he left.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Beirrin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - just a really really bad druid...which automatically entitles him to a free lifetime membership in the RNG &quot;family&quot; club.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nosforatu</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - The only time this stoonad ever shows up is about an hour before RNG will be hitting Aten. I think he spends the rest of his time hanging out at the local YMCA, licking the floor around the toilets and helping little boys put on their swimsuits.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Elailya</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is the guild's cyber/phone whore...I think everyone in RNG was dewing her. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tip:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If you're an officer or the GL, she'll let you cut in line in front of the grunts. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bonus tip:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> She'll also let you phone fuck her in the ass if you let her use your EZboard account to read the CoE board. Grats Gwarr! /golfclap<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raksul</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - One of RNG's shittier clerics, this guy apparently forgot to buy his heal spells. Annoying little boy, and a loot whore.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nostrum</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Do everyone a favor...stfu and join EV already, you sad little wannabe.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fayle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Part of the Elailya Cyber Slut Club, and a whiner of epic proportions. Along with Fayle come other douche monkies like Kainnin and Celestes. These are just some of the &quot;family&quot; players, who's main job is holding up the rest of the guild's progression and being offended when someone says a dirty or unkind word in guild chat. After wiping to HoHb yard trash for the umpteenth time, Groobash tells the guild, ';tell Stromm.Podaman Can you come kill Mith Marr for us please?' heheh Apparently they're *still* mad about that. hahaha<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Blondine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - holy shit where do I start with this one??? Really bad enchanter who thinks she's really good, but that doesn't even begin to describe it. She constantly ignores raid leader's instructions. When she fucks up, she invariably blames it on the communication difficulties of being French. Someone told me Blondine is really a man, who is the 'woman' in a homo marriage. /shrug<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Faloorn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is the guild's mez break baby. His wailing during raids got so bad that I used to break his mezzes intentionally for fun, just to listen to him blow his top and hopefully burst a vein in his forehead and drop dead at his keyboard.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Yidaien</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - this guy is one of those cowardly punks who waits to get in on arguments until things are safe and settled down, then hops in, mixes things up again with snide little remarks, then hops out again claiming innocence and misunderstanding. Likes to point fingers at other people for doing the exact same shit he does. He's a pathetic little piece of shit as a man, the server's worst enchanter next to Romy, and is RNG's chanter elder only because Glaux knew he was such a spineless yes man and figured it would feel good when he asked questions and Yid nodded his head up and down while sucking on his fat ogre cock.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The entire RNG mage crew</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a bunch of fucking divas from top to bottom. No, I don't care how much dps your pet does, just CoH me bitch, and gimme a rod when yer done too. Oh wait, the RNG mages only CoH every half hour because you can't be bothered to DO YOUR FUCKING JOB. Maybe I'll split tank a mob once every half hour too. /eyeroll<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Terranine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a bossy little cumgargler who like to yell at people during raids as if he was the raid leader. Unfortunately, RNG has a ton of those. There could be 15 people yelling instructions at raids, even probies. Terra is also one of those typical leeches who leaves the game for months, then returns and demands everyone else backflag them immediately.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mindee</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - a mangina unlike any other on the server. He's Scottish or some shit, and you know how stupid American women get moist over foreign accents. I thought he was cool when he joined, but turned out to be a pushy jerk in the end.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kharsis and Shavo</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - RNG is so desperate for people, they're apparently taking Legendary's rejects now. Shavo is a mouthy ranger wannabe tank...and judging by his spelling, Kharsis apparently dropped out of 6th grade to play EQ full time. Hey Legos, how much you want for the Swedes?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fedila</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - mostly plays Shadowbane now, but comes back occasionally to loot stuff like Aten's neck. I guess that's better than hanging out at the Y with Nosforatu tho.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Uzsuper</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - big RNG bitcher, but always quick to suggest that other people leave the guild when they bitch about something. He wants to snowball manchowder with Nostrum. I know...because I was the lucky recipient of a mistell from Uz saying so. Blech.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ferriswolf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Currently the elder for the pallies and SKs. Pretends to be nice but is really a motherfucking snake. Beware this guy if you're a knight and want to join RNG, he is not to be trusted under any circumstances. He knows the only reason he's elder is cuz some long lost GL promoted him, not cuz he knows his class or the game or cuz he is a good elder, so he gets pretty pissy when his troops try to have his elder title stripped...both times. Ask Muulee about him if you want to hear more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Glasgoss</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - from my first day in the guild, EVERY single thing I ever saw this guy say started with either &quot;I need...&quot; or &quot;I want...&quot; or &quot;Anybody have...&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tatania and Yukino</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - RNG's worst paladins by far. I was repeatedly astounded by the game related stupidity these two displayed. Both absolutely worthless, couldn't even be relied on to do something simple like tank mez during an Emp fight. Perhaps the worst two players of any class I have ever encountered in game. I can't believe that's the Yukino of old...she must be Ebayed. Tatania is incredibly stupid and just a bad player all around, but RNG puts up with her cuz she does the guild web site. The two of them couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag, even if they both had LoH up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Avocet</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - another closet fag mangina, who briefly had a taste of the good life when Glaux made him an officer, and still thinkin he's somebody who's opinion matters now that he's been sent back at the kiddie table. You still got a lil of Glaux's crusty love juice on your chin Avo. Shut your fucking pie hole. No one cares to hear your worthless comments on what the guild should/shouldn't do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Canopus, Fentres, Kiern, Razuul, Shavo, Tarran</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - all shitty rangers. In trying so hard to prove that they don't suck, all they've done is prove that they do. They're all little trouble makers, kinda like Yid, they toss in little jabs here and there and then run away little girls. Wreniis and Transvaal are RNGs only good rangers. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Boinshar</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - This RL fatass doesn't even play anymore, but stops by the RNG board to unload his holier-than-thou advice kinda like a seagull flying by and dropping its shit on the guild's shoulder. Learned everything he knows about the game on Safehouse, but pretends to have superior understanding of the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The warriors</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Xtad and Tothh and Noraa take most of the beatings because Lilwee is too busy swirling his tongue around Elailya's battered and bruised browneye to be any use at raids, and always blames it on lag. Hey Lilwee, while you're down there licking her ass, how does Gwarr's cum taste? Cronon shows up once in a while to loot the best stuff and complain a bit, then disappears for a month or so...again and again and again. The rest of the warriors are a bunch of typical 1100ac 6500hp losers who can't hold agro for shit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fanwene</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is still a recruit wizard, but looking good as she over agros and runs from mobs like a noob with all the melees chasing her trying to peel the mob off her. Clearly Ebayed, but she'll fit right in with the other recent Ebay suck recruits like Darkax, Tumbarancho, Guatauva, Keyos, and Rimidal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Zenaida</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - RNG's grandma. I can't tell you the number of raids we have had to stop to rescue this stupid old bitch's corpse from wierd places. Even tho we finished farming shards six months ago, she still gets on nightly and mewls like a kitten in guildchat begging for shard help. Chronic mez breaker - apparently has never learned to make an /assist button.<br>

RNG as the server knew it...a strong proud successful guild...is officially dead. They've gone from competing with the best guilds on this server, to being passed by guilds like Legendary and Dark Virtue. (Yes, DV was kicking RNG's ass in PoP until they left the server) RNG's lead over Legos was enormous - we were at Emp while Legos were still fighting over Kael scraps with Transcended, but that lead is long gone. Looks like DA will be passing RNG soon as well. <br>
<br>
Morale sucks inside RNG. No one wants to log on, except the probies and recently accepted members, and a few old die hards and addicts. Even when people do log on, the guild sits scattered as xp groups, paralyzed because no one wants to leave their precious BoT groups unless there are 75 RNG online, and at least a dozen clerics and ten warriors. The guild has a two hour raid window...if they can get anything going, it's only between 10pm and 12am EST. RNG is so desperate for people that they're taking just about anyone who applies now. You can't replace good smart raiders with just any old warm bodies tho. You can't replace your best tank or two with a twice as many 6000hp raid buffed warrior recruits, none of which can last a single round with many mobs amd can't hold agro for shit. You can't replace your lost clerics with new ones that don't even know what a CH chain is and have half the mana pool and barely any AAs and spend their time making Magelo backgrounds instead of playing. You can't boost your numbers for the RZ script by taking along ~30 probies and pre-probies, many of which have never even been on raids harder than Vindi and can't/won't pay attention or follow directions.<br>
<br>
RNG was a fine guild when I joined, but has been run into the ground by the &quot;family&quot; players...people like Aeaolena, Lulamila, Fayle, Beirrin, Zenaida, and Fatemah. In RNGspeak, &quot;family&quot; means Speech and Progression Police. They exist simply to ruin everyone else's fun. There's no &quot;family&quot; about it...they're simply control freaks who think they have the right to tell other people what to do, how to act, and what to say or not say. 90% of the current probies fit the same mold, so things are only gonna get worse from here.<br>
<br>
Those of you currently in the elemental planes have nothing to fear from RNG. They ain't gonna be joining you there for a lonnnnnnng time, if ever. I'm sure some guilds are killing RZtW with ~60 people but it ain't gonna be RNG, not with half of them being probies and guests. RNG is like 2 out of 10 against the RZ script bros, and have never even seen the fake RZ yet. They've been doing it to &quot;learn something new&quot; about the event every day. Well, you can send a kindergartner to do the CEO's job and he's sure gonna learn something new every day, but he ain't never gonna get the fucking job done. Tonight, after wiping to AD, they called a RZ raid, and seemed surprised when half the people online didn't come to the raid. If I thought we had even 1% chance of winning I would show, but RZ is way out of RNG's league now. If I wanted a guaranteed ass beating, I could run nekkid thru VT and get the same results and have more fun and get it over with quicker. You may not like what I think/said about it, but with half the guild not showing up, I'm obviously not the only one who feels that way. I'm the only one with the balls to say so tho. I guess that makes me a mean asshole. I guess it would be better to just log off quietly like a chickenshit with the rest of them, right?<br>
<br>
It's a shame cuz there are really some decent people left, but in time they will all see the light too. Denial only lasts so long, and the truth fucking hurts. Even Oath recently quit in disgust. Those few good people still in RNG continue to rot there and wallow in the slow spiraling descent, not cuz it's the best guild on the server, but because there is no place else for them to go. Most don't play enough to join EV, Comps and Legos raid at different hours, SI can only take so many people, and no one with two brain cells would want to hang out nightly with the bunch of scumbags in DA and their 14 year old Trans rejects. (Hey Brinuur, better hold on tight to that DA tag...you've run out of guilds to join, you dickless little scumbag)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fun Fact of the Day 1</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: RNG has no guild plat bank. Yes, that's right...despite *everything* droppable at raids being looted by elders, one of the oldest and (until recently) most successful guilds on the server doesn't have a pot to piss in. Elders like Daemonn, Boinshar, Tamura, Fixin, Ferriswolf, Humneo, and Menic have ripped the guild off blind to twink alts, pay for trade skills, and Ebay for cash. This continues, despite me finally bringing it up months ago when I asked where all the Bertox droppables poofed to. Of course I didn't get a straight answer. When Xtad recently asked to use some guild plat to buy a couple copies of BSS for the pallies, some elders conveniently ignored him, while others tried to swerve him. Go team!<br>
<br>
Last week, I watched Daemonn loot a rune from Jiva in SolRo and gate as we were wiping to his adds. (Yeh, RNG is wiping a lot lately) If I hadn't mentioned the rune to another officer a couple days ago, you can bet Daemonn's bazaar mule would soon be selling whatever he turned it in for. That's typical of everything these creeps are looting at the raids.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fun Fact of the Day 2</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: RNG is in quiet discussions with Tovok to absorb Shining Path. Actually, they just want to absorb SP's best people. Screw the rest of SP...who cares?<br>
<br>
I could go on and on and on, but this post is more than long enough. One of two things is now going to happen. Either the RNG Speech Police will prohibit (&quot;strongly suggest&quot; in RNGspeak) anyone from the guild posting to this thread...or the usual suspects from the RNG peanut gallery will come here and deny stuff and spew some nasty shit about me and say I left because they wouldn't make me an elder or some other stupid shit, but that's fine cuz you don't have to believe me. You can ask people like Xinben, Brdayar, Tarlor, Muulee, Countic, Kannon, etc etc etc. <br>
<br>
Either way, I win. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Fuck you RNG. You are dismissed.<br>

You have to wonder why Groobash would go through the trouble of writing out 3 separate posts to attack the guild that he was in for a year.  I'll let people make their own conclusions about that.  But we all know that the first thing you do when you leave your guild angry is to go post anything you can think of on the Trib flameboard, because it makes you look good.<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure what the point of this post was, except to just to vent some teen angst.  People leave guilds all the time over arguements about what the guild should be doing and how, but Groobash does a very good job here of showing why people may have had problems with him.<br>
<br>
Groobash, I'd wish you luck in your next guild, but I can't imagine any of them wanting the insecure, angry mess that you present yourself as here.  At one point we had considered you for the SK elder position, but we can all pretty much see why you didn't get it.<br>
<br>
Anways, I've got to run.  I'm still trying to bazaar all this leet Bertox loot.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.masterninja.com/toys/drink/drink-random.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Menic Stargazer</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Archon<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Elder Cleric for the Royal Norrathian Guard<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">The Tribunal<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=haderan>Haderan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:FgPJaO-SxAEC:forum.mm2c.com/images/smiles/icon_thumbsup.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/12/03 10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1727.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:8sdhH111iK8C:www.the-dead-zone.com/pics/biohazard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ughh</span><hr size=1> QUICK SOMEONE CALL WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN, GROOBASH IS DEEP THROAT!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blazexxhelbinder>BlazexxHelbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/12/03 10:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1727.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ughh</span><hr size=1> That was some good shit Groobash it made me laugh. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://&lt;center&gt;&lt;imc src=&quot;http://web.ecomplanet.com/P8712/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P8712CustomImage0043135.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinerinxanimalavenger>Sinerinx AnimalAvenger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/12/03 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1727.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/ethangotway/FuzzeeDollGif.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ughh</span><hr size=1> 4,072 words.
