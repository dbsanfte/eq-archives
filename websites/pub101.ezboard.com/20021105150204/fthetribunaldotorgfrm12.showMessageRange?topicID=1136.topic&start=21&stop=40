<br>
what, are you giving me advice now?  I'm really not interested in what atrophied bit of genitalia you have between your chair-ass shaped thighs.  You certainly seem fixated on mine, however.<br>
<br>
I'll go ahead and fill you in now, so you don't go getting your feelings hurt.  I'm entirely heterosexual.  I like women. (&quot;har har, you mean you like guys right, har har har!!&quot;  I'll save you the effort on your shriveled little turnip of a brain)<br>
<br>
So, if you're working yourself up to making a pass at me, take my advice and give Xavre a call instead.  Also, I know ladmo is pretty putrid, but he honestly seems to like you, and who knows?  Maybe you could have a wonderful life together. <p><CENTER>

You are dissing on loegan cause he's a druid. Well way to join the fucking bandwagon moron. <br>
<br>
Not only is that completly fucking odvious its gotta be the OLDEST fucking &quot;dis&quot; in EQ history. <br>
You come around here with your one line bullshit comments and expect what? someone to actually give a shit about what you have to say? BWAHAHAHA<br>
<br>
Anywho, I spent too much time on this one. <br>
<br>
but I'll say this one last thing. You name the time you want to see how useless/shitty Druids are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Iadas_Mistwalker/fullsize/iadas2.jpg>
