<br>
&quot;Bah! So ready ta leave, are ya?&quot;, the dwarf sniffs. &quot;Some kinda patience ye have, then. What, goblins got yer tongue and ye wish ta get it back?&quot;.<br>
<br>
He raises his hand to the bartender and raises two fingers - the bartender nods and hands him two dwarven jacks full of Brell's Holy Ale - and he hands one to the person looking for Winyoung, and takes a deep swill of the ale and blows some foam from his beard before he speaks again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take some time. Winyoung may not be 'ere right now, but I'm sure she be about somewheres. There's other's of us around now - I be Karthanon, a mid-seasoned dwarven warrior. My niece Kinmerya be abouts somewheres - a cleric. If ya want ta argue philosophy while yer waiting, I'm sure ya can argue knots with Gnostik, our local sage of th'Tears. Or maybe show us yer martial prowess 'gainst Kogbender th'Ogre, who might be hidin' in the shadows here or there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Karthanon glances back at the corner of the guildhall, where a wolfish tail twitches and then disappears out of sight, and scowls. &quot;Or, if yer not so lucky, you can get in a food fight with Salvia and her ilk...&quot;<br>
<br>
He gestures back at the table and the ale the man holds bemused in his hands. &quot;Get back over dere, drink that up, and then have a few more. Maybe once ya get yer fill and some some good food ye'll not be so impatient - there's times and place fer dat, dontcha know, and meetin' new friends and comrades in arms be not a time fer it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Karthanon scratches his beard, and then takes another gulp from his ale. &quot;'Though I ain't seen Winyoung around fer a while, except mayber fer a few seconds in th'Bazaar...&quot;<br>

As Ralstaan fineshes his tale the ogre pauses and takes a pitcher of ale .. pasing his stein compleetly to down it in one great gulp then refocuses himself on the barbarian*<br>

He looks at the rest of the on-lookers and makes out quiet elven whispers and dwarven grunts.  His hand still resting on his hilt he reaches for the Holy Ale and nods at the stout dwarven warrior, who by now has had three ales up in the count.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Before you go Kog&quot;, Ralstaan speaks in between a gulp.  &quot;I could never make out whether eating with an ogre makes makes a man hungrier or lose his appetite.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ralstaan looks around again and begins to make out a small hint of noise.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As to Gnostik I have nothing to offer by way of talk of religion, though the more of these Holy Ales I drink I may begin to take interest in the priesthood.  To Salvia I look forward to a food fight with you, so long as I get the ogre on my side.  To Karth you seem busy enough as is, what with that fine looking neice of yours to protect.  And to Winyoung.............well that is my business.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior stands and for the first time slacks from his grip and walks to Kogbender.  He lands a hand on the massive shoulder, not hard enough to cause dent or grimace, but hard enough to let him know that when he takes him up on his offer to hunt he will come prepared to fight.  <br>
Ralstaan makes his way to the wing of sleeping quarters and looks at each great door.  After the fourth door he comes to a room with a familiar flower hanging from it.  He remembers with a smile and quietly begins to press against the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Barbarian fool.  Winyoung is a lady.  And if I have strength in me that is how she will stay.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior picks up his pack and makes his way to the farthest room, at the farthest end of the hall.<br>
<br>
<br>
ooc hehe doh I hope I didn't sound too impatient.  All in rp, Ralstaan hates being in the center of a room.

Once the portal solidifies, a Carmine robed High Elf steps through.  Moving quickly without a backwards glance Ssolaria strides into the guild hall.<br>
<br>
Heading to an empty table Ssolaria drops several bags of gems, opals, peridots, perls, and other less precious stones fill the tables, a veritable king's ransom.  Going through her packs Ssolaria removes a black bag that seems to radiate a tangible aura, malevolence and stronger emotions seem to emanate frome the little bag, darkness where the other bags seem to reflect all the colors of the rainbow from faceted faces of the gems.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dangit I hate going to Neriak, but that is the only place I can get the Soulstones that let us travel to the plane of Hate.  My agent there charges me a small fortune for each one of these and she has the nerve to charge me a &quot;service charge&quot; on top of the princely sum I pay for the stones.  oh well, we will make it back and then some I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking notice of the other Tears in the guild hall she looks up and sees a strong fierce looking barbarian warrior.  Walking up to the new Warrior and Kogbender she approaches them warily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is this Koggie?  A new guildmate mayhap?&quot;  Ssolaria says with a sly look in her eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you are here to join us, then you must be marked as only the strong can survive a marking by Veeshan.  That is very good.  I need some strong warriors.  What do you think Kogbender can this pup stand up to the Maestro?  Think he has the fiber to head the attack on an Ashenbone Drake or 2?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would see if you are indeed worthy of the title of Protector of our sweet sister Winyoung.  Come to the home of Innoruk with us tomorrow, if you are man enough!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kogbender I know you can deal with the yard trash easily enough in Hate, lets welcome our newest member with a party in innoruks's music hall.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;GNOSTIK!  Where are you?&quot;  Ssolaria looks around for the stout defender of Brell's faith.  &quot;You signed up to join us, please extend the invitation to our allies in the Gathering please, I still have a million things to do to get ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sorceress sees her lover snoozing in her accostomed chair by the fire.  Poor dear she needs her rest, we will go and hunt Sunday I think.  off to Kaesoria to talk to Xalgoz agian.  Miserable shade that he is.<br>
<br>
&quot;On the morrow I will be back.  Meet us in Greater Feydark by the wizard spires.&quot;  Ssolaria says as she rushes off to her rooms and then running through a gate to the Emerald Jungle.<br>
