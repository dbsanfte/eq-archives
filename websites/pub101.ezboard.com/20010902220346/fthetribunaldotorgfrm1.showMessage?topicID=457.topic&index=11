<br>
Anyhow, he was promoted though I forget to what dept.<br>
<br>
Valshire went to the Dev Team and was working on pathing, though he might be in another area now. He was a cool GM, though I must say Nocnivin was an excellent replacement. The Tribunal has been very lucky in who we have had for GMs. <p><br>

Of course, the shit I got back was a canned response, saying nope the warning stands, and if yous got a problem with that, talk to the head GM...

<br>
I deal with them as people because that's what they are. If you want to use the police analogy, than it works like this - if the only contact you have with policemen involves breaking the law or being involved somehow in a legal matter, then you are going to always see them as policemen. Those of us who have contact with them on a casual basis will see them as people who happen to work as a policeman.<br>
<br>
WTF would you want the name Natural anyway? I think maybe you were looking for a fight to begin with maybe? <p><br>

I petitioned after having a 'pirate cartographer' trained on me at my bind spot beside FV bank. I was sitting afk awaiting a rez (was told it would be 40-45 minutes) and it agro'd on me for a nice a death-loop. I went from 49 to 46 before coming back to /q and got no help at all from the GM despite the fact that the moron who trained me already had a warning for a similar offence and a guide witnessed the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Valshire was always helpful when I was in deep shit and happy to just stand &amp; chat with anyone if he wasn't too busy. The dealing's I've had with Noc, whilst not always what I wanted, were fair, she explained her point of view well and I could see she wanted to help more in some circumstances but was constrained by VI's rules. All in all, Trib has been fortunate with GM's  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Worst one was When Kreese bum rushed and suicided his pearl on Ragefire after getting us trained with FGs. I get from Nocniven&quot;he handed it in first even tho Revolution killed him, its still his heart&quot; .. I hear thats changed now since this happened to me. I hear its now if you have sufficient force, as opposed to suiciding and then getting your forces there.<br>
<br>
Most hilarious was i flamed Kreese in EW one day....said something to the effect &quot;If he were any dumber he would need to be watered twice a week&quot; <br>
<br>
Guide shows up in Velkts.. I just chit chat with her and send her to these boards....never heard from her since <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I petitioned, got a response 2 hours later from a guide who i reexplained my situation to then was told it would get passed up to a gm when he gets on in 4 more hours (at this time i was unaware of the actual times that the Gm's are online, god i feel sorry for the Euro's ).  Well that night i recieved no resonse so I repetitioned the next day, and about 3 hours later got my response from nocniven. I explained the disappearance of the weapon and thankfully had used it recently so it was easy for him to track and recreate me another one.  He was very nice the whole time and i was very pleased.  <br>
The next time was when a friend of mine was attempting one of the last parts of his monk epic.  We were doing the turn in to the skeleton in the dreadlands with the robe and two pipes. well silly us we thought it was still share questable since about half the monks who have done their epic have shared this part.  So we charm the skeleton (who is kos to everyone) turn in his robe while kegovis turned in the two pipes.  well, apparently it wasnt our day because the skeley stood there then proceeded to go after the chanter a minute or two later who had charmed him.  Nothing.   so we petitioned and had a guide (dont remember his name but he was about as dumb as a bag of hammers) proceed to tell us that there is nothing that can be done and that perhaps it was an issue with faction.  guess that must be number one on the list of excuses, because when we finally got a Gm on (and it wasnt nocniven)  we got the same response and the &quot;sorry friend there is nothing i can do&quot;.  we politely explained to the man that the mob was charmed so faction should not have been an issue and that this part has been sharequested before by many people.  well, that did no good.  So next night we repetition and get the same song and dance about faction till we get ahold of nocniven. As usual he was very cordial and polite when we explained the process we followed to us. He basically told us that he would not be able to return any of the lost items , even the robe, and that share questing is not supposed to work and when it does its really just a lucky fluke (riiiiiggggghhht).  Anyhow after we cleaned ourselves up and found some mouthwash,  we pretty much said thanks for the response and went on our way.<br>
sucked that this happened to my boy, and we are currently trying to regain his pawduster and betrayer pipes for him, this time making sure that HE is the one who loots them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
So I dunno, seemed like at the very least his robe of the lost circle could have been returned, and the lame &quot;have you looked into the faction&quot; excuse on an undead mob that hates everyone was really a pisser.  I guess they do the best they can , but would have been nice if they were a little less ambiguous when you speak to them.<br>
