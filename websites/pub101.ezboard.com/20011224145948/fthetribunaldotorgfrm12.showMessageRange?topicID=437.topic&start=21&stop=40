Do you really think that VI would start paying CS reps if they couldn't get volunteers?<br>
<br>
The past 3 years have given us many examples of times when guides have been short of staff, and VI has *not* hired any, merely let the CS Reps stay understaffed.  They remain vastly understaffed to this day.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Remember:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> We're not talking about paid, professional customer service.  We're talking about players who are trying to fill a gap that VI left.

Civil Service and EzBoard Moderator analogies. THose are so right on with commercial companies. You have completely changed my mind. At first that wonderful charity analogy of Jas’s was totally making me think we shouldn’t expect decent CS from a multi-billion dollor company like Sony since they hire volunteers, but you have totally hit the nail on the head with your don’t back talk to cops speech.<br>
<br>
Oh, and that part about how people who get mad about poor customer service must be idiots who shop at Nordstrom. That was amazing! Another way to look at it is that people who do not shop at Nordstrom must like bad customer service. I mean, there is an amazing amount of logic flowing through you right now.<br>
<br>
Arnon, good point about the cursing. Yes you are totally right. A person doesn’t have to take it if someone calls them names or tells them to go fuck themselves. If Cogs had just /petitioned “go fuck yourself” and bitched them out to no end, I would have been with you on this. But this did piss me off. Because the person knew he was irritated and didn’t try &amp; understand his anger, but rather tried to argue with him.<br>
<br>
Instead of saying, that he was sorry for what was going on &amp; trying to empathize with him, he pulled the, “Don’t threaten me with your little ultimatums buddy, because I gots the power.” Yeah, that would probably piss me off enough to tell them to fuck off since I too am not addicted tot he game anymore. <p><BR>

<br>
Plus, when you do an in-zone /who, guides show up as * GM *<br>
<br>
They should have been called Volunteers from the beginning, and not labled GM on /who. Maybe then the GM staff and guide staff wouldn't have become so crappy from player abuse.<br>
<br>
Or maybe they would have anyway, but it's insanely annoying that every time someone says 'I'm in tells with a gm', they mean guide. <p><center><font size=2><font color=ashen><a href=http://www.geocities.com/pren_tribunal/pren.txt><u>Pren, Human Master</u></a> on The Tribunal Server

<br>
1) Guides ARE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES.<br>
<br>
How did I come to this conclusion?  We are customers of Verant.  Word here is &quot;Customers.&quot;  Guides work for Verant, yes they do, admit it or not.  They enjoy the free account and the power that comes with being a guide in exchange for DOING WORK FOR VERANT.  Downplay that power if you wish but it's a shitload more power than *I* have as a player.<br>
<br>
Guides REPRESENT Verant, because they work for them.  We are Verant's Customers...<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE.<br>
---------<br>
<br>
k, now that we've handled that:<br>
<br>
2) I have never in two years of playing EQ EVER got help from a Guide/GM.  I can't remember all of the times but i'll list a few:<br>
<br>
- Was in Oasis long ago when the server crashed while a shaman and I were fighting crocs.  Server came up and I was dead bound near the zone to EFreeport from Nro.  I was petitioning for a rezz when an invisible/undertheworld Dorn attacked me.  I could not target him or anything to defend myself and died trying to get to the zone.  When the CSR answered my petition an hour later all I got was a Zap back to my corpse in Oasis, NO XP for either corpse.<br>
<br>
- Unrest way long ago I ran into the house saw nasty shit, tried to run out, and the door would not open.  My lag meter looked fine, I could mess with my inventory, cast, anything else but the fucking FRONT DOOR would not move.  I got destroyed. <br>
<br>
I petitioned.  The guide told me it was probably a locked door that needed a key.  Um... it's the FRONT DOOR ASSHOLE.  I told him so very politely.  He then told me I was lagging.  I just shook my head and said Whatever.<br>
<br>
- Camping the Priest of Najena in Unrest for my Mystic Cloak, this enchanter and ranger come and try to force us away from the camp.  We pretty much ignore them, as we have group wolf form on so we were non-kos.  The dickhead ranger starts casting SoW on us which overwrote Wolfform and got us immediately attacked forcing us to run for the zone.<br>
<br>
He did this again and again and again.  We petitioned.  The Guide who showed up was a friend of thiers.  I knew i was fucked immediatly.<br>
<br>
He tells me &quot;They claim this was thier camp first.&quot;  To which I responded truthfully &quot;We've been here for 45 minutes, no one in all that time has been here except us.&quot;<br>
<br>
So he says he'll watch.  They proceed to nuke the piss out of every placeholder when it pops.  I send him a tell and say &quot;See what I mean?&quot; and he tells me &quot;Well, you did take thier camp&quot; to which I responded &quot;What the crap are you talking about?&quot;  and he says &quot;they say they were here first&quot;  <br>
<br>
I said &quot;Well, they're lying&quot;<br>
He said &quot;How do I know that?&quot;<br>
I said &quot;Listen.  I'm tired, I'm cranky, and these people are screwing with me.  You JUST SAID TO ME &quot;Well, you did take thier camp&quot; and I'll be damned if I'm gonna take that shit from you.  You don't have a clue what you are doing here, all you know is those people kissed your ass for being a Guide one time and you liked it and now I'm getting screwed because of your inflated ego.&quot;<br>
He said &quot;Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.  Maybe I'll just shut the spawn off completely.  Would you like that?&quot;<br>
I said &quot;You know what?  I try to play this game... I really do.  I don't camp things because I can't stand sitting there for so long.  I respect other players and I don't cause trouble... yet the one time I decide something is worth camping for a bit, I STILL GET SCREWED.  Can you understand that?&quot;<br>
He says &quot;I understand your frustration, but it was their camp first&quot;<br>
I said &quot;Eat me, I'm leaving&quot;<br>
<br>
And that was that.<br>
<br>
- In Karnors Castle I fell through the floor running up the steps to some room.  I know for a fact there was no trap floor there.  I fell straight through into some kind of well then got out and started looking for an exit and got ganked by undead all around.  I petitioned and Eldarion or something like that answered my petition.  <br>
<br>
She checked the area out for TWO FUCKING HOURS, CONFIRMED that there was a glitch in the geometry that dropped me, and promptly told me &quot;too bad, so sorry, I can't move a corpse that you could potentially get yourself&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Even when it's a bug?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's 2am!  How am I supposed to get my corpse out of there?  I have 1 hour left to get a rezz and I still have to find a Corpse summoner?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry&quot;<br>
<br>
So, I told my guild, and a certain paladin got pissed and messaged the Guide himself and she told him that I fell off the steps, calling me a liar, after she had JUST TOLD ME she confirmed it was a problem with the geometry.  So, of course my guild HAS to think I'm ommiting details or making something up because this dickhead called me a liar.<br>
<br>
Well thanks to a SK from Vags and a Cleric from AN who just happened to be on, I got summoned and rezzed at nearly 3am.  But I've never forgotten that the CS staff of Verant is totally fucking useless.<br>
<br>
- I farmed Hate for Vampire Essence for my Epic 23 days in ONE MONTH (not to mention the two months before where I had been there quite a bit) and finally got it on a Saturday morning where I had been in hate for 31 hours straight.  I was nearly unconscious but very very happy.  The server crashes.  We all log to chat and make plans to log on and go hand my stuff in to get my Snake.  We log on as soon as they tell us the server is back up.  I notice I have rezz effects on... weird.  I also notice i'm near where we kiled the Magi earlier and my stomache sinks.<br>
<br>
I checked my inventory... no vampire essence.  I freak and petition.. They rolled everything back a half hour.  Even though Nocniven was very nice and sweet about it, I was again told &quot;Nothing we can do&quot; and maybe it was a more difficult situation.. but goddamn, you have a customer of TWO YEARS who has caused no trouble (cept for one dumbass suspension will explain later) who is diligently playing this game and who has busted ass.  If it were my customer I'd do anything I could within reason to help them.<br>
<br>
In this case that would involve replacing the item.<br>
<br>
- My ONE suspension.. the only time I've ever been in any trouble in this game.  Some of you might recall.  I did a joke GM shout (which involved Kool-aid and lollipops for everyone, obviously a joke) in Kaesora while helping a friend get a tooth for his HS key.  I was petitioned by this dickhead who was mad at me about something else.  Due to this petition I was Suspended for a week, but told I might be permanently banned.  I had NO previous petitions against me, no previous suspensions, and no warnings, yet they were looking into BANNING me?<br>
<br>
Yeah, thanks CS!<br>
<br>
My apologies to Domomai, Kezzy, and Noc who really are good people.  It's the others who make you look bad.  It's the others who make the game suck. <p><CENTER>

2) They ARE Verant's shortcomings.  They are for the majority low self esteem Little Caeser's with a powertrip who are usually in a pissed off mood just waiting for someone to piss them off.  They are lazy fucks who do as little as possible.  They don't do what they can, they do the MINIMUM.  There are a few exceptions, of course.  Kezzy is one of the nicest most helpful people around.  Dom is just flat out nice and fun to be around.  But for the most part I've met ignorant/lazy assholes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;These people are TRYING to help out&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
No.. Actually they aren't.  Some few are, but those are pretty reakin rare.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;to blame the people who are NOT DOING WHAT THEY WANT but rather, what they have to.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Not true.  They do what they want quite a bit of the time, such as talking like uneducated morons, or directly conflicting with what another guide says, or hanging out and shooting the shit with people, or calling someone a liar, or calling someone a cheater, or maybe Summoning you to ask you a stupid question in the middle fo a raid, or giving you a warning for telling them they are misinformed about something, or maybe just downright threatening a player... because they can.  <br>
<br>
They don't HAVE TO DO any of that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Trust me it sucks to have your hands bound by rules&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Enough to lash out like the examples above.<br>

<br>
That doesn't excuse rudeness, ignorance, and hostility from the guides.  That doesn't excuse threats, abuse, and mistreatment from them.  That doesn't excuse the aggravation, lose of HOURS of my life, and sheer apathy due to a bad attitude that most of the guides and GMs I have come in contact to have displayed. <p><CENTER>

The guide program is entirely seperate from the Verant powers that be.  The guides put in their own time, with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> effectively</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> no compensation, and do what they can on their own within the extremely strict rules that Verant gives them.  They are not permitted by Verant to move outside of the rules whatsoever under punishment of losing their position.  Perhaps instead of saying that they're not afilliated with Verant, I should have said these things you hate so much about the guides are the not what the guides do, but what the system does.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) They ARE Verant's shortcomings.

Do you think you behave as rationally when you are upset as when you are not?  A guide has to deal with hundreds of upset people every night, this takes immesurable patience, so I do not doubt that sometimes they get a bit testy, it is to be expected.  Perhaps not what we want, but this is, again, not a professional.<br>
<br>
What <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> power</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do you think they have?  The power to... erm... not do what you want them to?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> When most of the time what you want them to is outside the rules</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Guides have little to no power.

Guides can summon a corpse and rezz it if it is do to a verifyable bug.  This I know for a fact.  However, I was denied this.<br>

What here was not done for me that was not allowed?  What did I ask of a guide that could not be provided?  I don't understand this &quot;Hands are tied&quot; thing.  I don't understand why some of these cases seem to be PARTICULARLY aimed at pissing a customer off.  <br>
---<br>
<br>
Oh, and none of these rules excuses plain out stupidity.<br>
<br>
Here's one recently I forgot that just put the icing on me retiring:<br>
<br>
I was doing a quest in Stone Brunt.  I needed to kill two titan spirit animals and turn thier skins in for a pair of pants.  I did and I got the Pants.  He wants two more different pelts, I got them I got the Cloak.<br>
<br>
Now he says to me: &quot;'I believe I have uncovered a process with which to harness the mystical properties of the scales of the snake titan so that they can be fashioned into a powerful robe. If you bring me the ancient snake skin and some platinum thread I am sure there will be enough material to craft multiple robes and I shall reward you with one for your assistance.&quot;<br>
<br>
He specifically says <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ROBE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Well, I turn those items in and he gives me the same cloak as the pelts gave me.<br>
<br>
I petition and 12 hours later I get an answer from a floater (GM not assigned to a particular server) who says he'll check it out.  About 2 hours later he tells me &quot;Yep, that's the reward&quot; to which i nicely reply &quot;I understand that, but it is not the reward he said he would give me.  This is the reward for the pelts he asks for&quot; so he says &quot;Gonna test that&quot;<br>
<br>
An hour later he says to me &quot;Well, that seems to be the quest reward&quot; to which I WANTED to say NO FUCKING SHIT DUMBASS! but to which I replied &quot;I know that, but I want my robe.  I worked hard for it and got the parts for it.  I already have the cloak and was promised a Robe&quot; to which he replied &quot;but these are the quest rewards&quot; to which I reply &quot;Well, it's messed up, can you give me my robe?&quot; to which this piece of shit says &quot;I cannot reveal any more about this quest&quot;  I say &quot;huh?  What are you talking about&quot; and he says &quot;I have said all I can.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I said &quot;Dude.. I did the quest, I just want the appropriate reward that the NPC said I would get.  The reward is obviously messed up.  Just give me what the NPC was supposed to give me and everything's fine&quot;<br>
<br>
He says &quot;I am not allowed to tell you any more about this quest.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I said &quot;Fine.. what can I do?  You are mistaken on this and will not even talk further with me.  I wasted 6 hours out here hunting that Snake.. what should that matter to you?  What do you care?&quot;<br>
<br>
He says &quot;I am not mistaken on this&quot;<br>
<br>
I say &quot;yes.. you are, but does it really matter?  I'm done...  you can go back to NOT helping people&quot;<br>

<br>
While I will freely admit that GMs make mistakes, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MANY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of them have far less EQ experience than you or I, you must look at two key points.<br>
<br>
1)  People lie.<br>
<br>
This statement may seem very straightforward and obvious, however... In your examples, it seems to be left out.  You frequently expect a GM or guide to be able to take your word for what happens.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that people lie, and the fact that only full GMs have the ability to do the research necessary to find out the information (and in many instances they cannot even do that, such as your untimely rollback) the GMs cannot just take your word for what happens, they are not allowed to act without justification.<br>
<br>
While a guide is always capable of summoning your corpse, capable of leaving a message on their message board for a GM to reemburse your item, they are not always justified in doing so.  Lag is not a bug.  A corpse which landed near a geometry bug may not have gotten there due to the bug.  An item which is lost may simply be a player trying to scam a GM (it is attempted)  There are rules in place which govern what they can and cannot do.<br>
<br>
While you may not understand why these rules are there, the GMs may not understand why they are there as well, yet they have no choice in the matter, they must abide by them.<br>
<br>
In your last example, you were clearly upset, you had been working long and hard on an item, and you did not get it.  You called in a guide and he was unable to help you, and you became upset with him.<br>
<br>
A GM cannot simply give out items, the quest was broken, that is the responsibility of the administration of Verant to deterine what is broken about the quest and to fix it.  You became angry because the GM was not willing to break the rules and give you something that you may not have earned. (as far as he knew, the quest reward was appropriate for the items turned in, it was merely the text that was broken)<br>
<br>
He was *unable* to assist you, not unwilling.  He did what he could within the boundries.  While I have the advantage of knowing the rules, surely you can see how a player could take advantage of a liberal system, or a mistyped quest.<br>
<br>
Sir Lucan Dlere tells you, 'to get your [curse of innorruuk] please hand me 3 deathfist pawn scalps'  (do you really think that a GM would give you a curse of innorruk just because Sir Lucan said he would?) <p><IMG SRC="http://users.starpower.net/dmoser/images/Kaldayr.jpg" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukaldayrmalabranche.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaldayr Malabranche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/1/01 1:36:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> grrrr...<br>

<br>
I think Bowynn and everyone else can tell that much, the problem is that the GM simply implied that he had done the quest wrong, that there was some mysterious step he was missing. hence, &quot;I cannot tell you anything more about the quest&quot;  Where the GM should have simply said &quot;The quest IS messed up, I'm sorry and will forward this to the bug crew so that they can either fix the reward or the quest NPCs text to something more appropriate&quot;<br>
<br>
See the difference?  First case, the GM is basically saying YOU dumbass, you just fucked up the quest and didn't do it right, although not exactly saying that so you're left in doubt.  Hell, even if he did do the quest wrong, a simple &quot;You got the correct reward for what you handed in, there's more to it that I can't reveal to you, in order for you to get the robe you seek&quot;  That would at least be clear and to the point, although in this case I think utterly wrong, which is not unusual at all.<br>
<br>
Now the second example I gave is providing Customer Service and staying within the guidelines.  You're not handing out quest rewards, but you are at least admitting the mistake and being clear and forthright with the customer about it and your intentions to see to it that the mistake is fixed.<br>
<br>
A GM/Guide doesn't have to kiss your ass and hug you everytime you do something assinine, but they shouldn't be rubbing it in your face saying, &quot; Neener, Neener&quot; either.  Basic CS is that you are courteous at ALL times, it doesn't fucking matter if the customer gets irate and starts telling you to go fuck yourself.  Paid directly, or compensated by free playing time, you signed up to be a CSR, do the job right or quit. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9151">Sciek Spellbottler</a><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;You frequently expect a GM or guide to be able to take your word for what happens.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
You are putting words in my mouth.  I got upset with him after he became Belligerant and intentionally Unwilling to do anything that might require some &quot;service&quot; from him.  If i treated one of my customers like that I'd be stomped by my management.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;A GM cannot simply give out items, the quest was broken, that is the responsibility of the administration of Verant to deterine what is broken about the quest and to fix it.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Actually a GM CAN give out the proper item.  It's been done before and will be done again.  I've witnessed it.  It is the responsibility of the GM and thier service staff (Guides) to ensure that the players are not screwed out of thier stuff by a buggy game.  They can't fix the bug but the can damn sure help the person screwed by it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;You became angry because the GM was not willing to break the rules and give you something that you may not have earned.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
No, I became angry because he was too damn lazy to put his sandwich and coffee aside for a few minutes and actually help. He would have been breaking NO rules.  Me questing that snake skin was verifiable.  Had he told me to wait a few days while he or someone else researched it I would have been satisfied.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;as far as he knew, the quest reward was appropriate for the items turned in, it was merely the text that was bro</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->[/i]<br>
<br>
Actually, I found out shortly after that this is a known problem and that the cloak IS the WRONG reward.  Was he stupid?  Uninformed?   Or just lazy?   I don't know, I don't care.  I pay $10 a month to play a game.  I don't pay $10 a month to deal with an unhelpful asshole.<br>
<br>
You don't agree with me that he was being belligerant?  Honestly?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;He was *unable* to assist you, not unwilling.  He did what he could within the boundries.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
False.  He was unwilling to pursue it.  He was completely able to help me.<br>
<br>
Look.  I work for a computer manufacturer.  When someone needs a system replaced I have to tell them to talk to technical support first to trouble shoot it.  Those are the rules I have to work within.  <br>
<br>
If the client told me he had talked to tech support and I told him &quot;I can't talk to you anymore about this&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;but I need my system working&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't talk to you anymore about this&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;are you even lsitening to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't talk to you anymore about this&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;FUCK YOU!&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you seriously telling me that that client is out of line?<br>
<br>
Or how about this?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry your modem doesn't work, Mr. Customer, but I am not responsible for what the engineers do, so bye bye&quot;<br>
<br>
Or how about this?<br>
<br>
&quot;My modem isn't working&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm... Have you connected the video cable?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;huh?  The modem, not the monitor&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to connect the video cable&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you delusional?  It's my MODEM, the thing that dials out, not my video card or my monitor.  The modem does nto connect to the Video cable!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't help you any further&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't help you any further&quot;<br>

I have worked in CS for about 10 years now, and  I also train new employees in customer service.<br>
<br>
I have worked for General Electric, IBM and AT&amp;T. <br>
<br>
If a customer would have called in and talked to me in that manner, he would have been placed on hold for some nice,calming music, or transfered to the Espanol help line.<br>
<br>
Seriously though, I love Cogs. He makes me laugh with his witty posts. I do not agree with the way he approached the situation. I have not had pleasant dealings with guides/gms, but I try to treat each situation on a case by case basis. <br>
<br>
Customer Service is NOT only there to make a customer happy. Yes, we can resolve issues, and correct problems or just explain if you have questions. We do not deserve abuse. Hence, the reason they are called guides and not Customer Service Reps.<br>
<br>
You may despise AT&amp;T or IBM may have sent you a fucked up E-Machine, but all because I am a representative of the company does not give you the right to verbally abuse me.<br>
<br>
I just wonder if Cogito put himself in that guide's position? Would you have dealt with yourself differently than the guide, if you had to handle the treatment you dished out?<br>
<br>
It is one thing to be initially mad, it is another to continue the abusive language after given plenty of time to vent.<br>
<br>
Normally, I will allow the customer to vent, and let them know I will look into the situation. If they cuss, fine, they are angry. If they cuss AT ME, I give one warning, advising I will hang up if they continue the language. Then hasta la bye bye dickwad.<br>
<br>
It's hard to really compare the guides with regular CS, because they are not paid. Their powers are limited. This is a unique situation. This is their world. We might pay to play, but they have policies they adhere to. It sucks, but thems the rules.<br>
<br>
Cogs, I am so sorry about this, and I hope you don't take my reply as a slight against you. I am sure you were fed up, but I think you went overboard. /hug /hug /hug <p><center><font face=Times New Roman"><font size="4"><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdaeja>Daeja's Views</a><br>

<br>
I agree Muse that $10 a month isn't worth it, but if it was the best job in the world $10 a month wouldn't be worth it. Volunteer work will almost always mean lower caliber service <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> overall</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, though there will of course be some great guides here and there.<br>
<br>
Guides who play the game alot are a good thing. They bring a player perspective to CS and help bridge the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> us vs. them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gap. I enjoyed being a guide except for having my hands tied in certain situations that could be helped, but policy prohibited it.<br>
<br>
The main thing is knowing how to navigate the system and be aware of what is and isn't allowed. Armed with that knowledge, most players can get the service they need, even if they have to bypass certain CS levels to get it.<br>

<br>
EXACTLY the same thing I did.<br>
<br>
I mean, I didn't call the ability to play if they say &quot;goddammit, I'm always getting disconnected whenever it fucking rains outside...&quot;. I ignored it, he's bitching about the situation, kosher-- I would to. OTOH, if he said &quot;whenever it rains your fucking service goes apeshit and I CANT FUCKING GET THROUGH TO YOU WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM ASSHOLES?&quot; That's another scenario and he's headed towards the delete pile...<br>
<br>
The fact is, Verant should fire all guides and replace them with paid and hopefully trained customer service representatives. I'm sorry, Bowynn, but a guide is a volunteer, not a CSR. There's a difference, both in quality, and in corporate responsibility.<br>
<br>
If it hadn't been for UO, I doubt they would have made guides. I think that they just would have gone on with shit for staffing in the CSR department and we'd be bitching about CSRs right now. But that's Verants responsibility -- they pay the CSRs. What they're trying to do with the guides is to filter out the first level of user idiocy before it gets to their paid employees -- nice goal, but the system is so fucking broken it's not funny.<br>
<br>
I don't expect customer service from a guide -- I expect to have to escalate the situation to a GM because guides are the first line nametakers who don't have a clue. They can summon me when I get stuck (freeport, thanks Blaaze), or my corpses, when they're in walls (happened twice), and that's about all I trust them for. 'Course, at this point, if the corpse was in a wall, I'd log off until I could get an SK/necro out there just because it'd get done faster than dealing with VI.<br>
<br>
The whole issue with CS is just fucked at VI. They as a company care nothing about CS in general from any aspect, be it in game improvements / changes / balances or from an administrative role.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
Only time and DAoC will change things ... if it's even possible at this point.<br>
