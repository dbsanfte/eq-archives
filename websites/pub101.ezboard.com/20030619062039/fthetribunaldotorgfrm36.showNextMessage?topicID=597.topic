Sky News was showing a section of Baghdad without coalition tank and troop presence(least none that I could see) with Iraqis acting pretty happy. Sky News has also been walking up to random residents to see what they think of what's happened. I saw more than one person react with emotion with a mixture of laughter and crying. One of BBC's correspondents was speaking with a shakey vioice himself. And then of course there's the video that's been shown on most of the major networks now with Iraqis gathering around Saddam statues and beating on it among other things, Iraqis hugging troops, much emotion being shown all around and a lot of overall acceptance of what's happened.<br>
<br>
I think it's time to accept that many of the Iraqis are quite happy with what's taking place. There's still a lot of &quot;Get out you American invaders&quot; types but they seem to be a dying breed. Yet again the pessimistic horrors of millions of Iraqis despising our actions predicted by the anti war crowd are proving underwhelming. The &quot;Iraqis won't accept us, we are invaders to them, Saddam is a dictator but he is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>their</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dictator!&quot; comments are becoming more and more irrelevant everyday.<br>

That's one major hurdle crossed; it is going to be *very* telling what they do at this juncture.  Blair seems to be pushing for an Iraq-run government with UN intervention; I can't imagine Bush is looking for the same, but IMHO its the best way to handle this.  Let France eat some of the cost of rebuilding, but let the US keep the 'spoils' of war, as it were, for itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

Keep the UN well away from Iraq - for now<br>
Simon Jenkins<br>
<br>
United Nations, stay out of Iraq. Leave it alone. It is being conquered by America and Britain and conquest is followed by either anarchy or military rule. Since the latter is preferable, a clear line of governing command must be installed, with a policing force at its disposal. Realpolitik demands that the Anglo-American coalition now take full responsibility for what it has unleashed. It must restore order and reconstruct this wretched country. The spoils of war must become the toils of peace.<br>
<br>
As of last night, the military phase of the Iraqi adventure appeared to be coming to an end. Some thought that victory would be quicker, others thought that it would be slower. Nobody can be sorry that quicker won. Nobody could wish Saddam Hussein anything but dead. Western soldiers have done their job with the same brutal efficiency against lesser forces that once made the Roman legions unbeatable. But soldiering is straightforward. Now the politics begins.<br>
<br>
Jack Kingston, an American congressman, spoke yesterday for many in his country when he laughed the UN out of court. It should “stick to cocktail parties and international gallivanting”, he said, “and worry first about rebuilding itself”. Americans had gone to war and won the right to determine the peace.<br>
<br>
Let them. For all the emollient words of George Bush in Northern Ireland yesterday, those clearly deciding Washington’s policy on Iraq hate the UN. They find it indecisive and wimpish. For six months, spin doctors have hurled at it the Big Lie, that the UN never grasped the nettle of Saddam Hussein. They ignore the fact that the UN did exactly what America and Britain told it to do, sanctioning and impoverishing Iraq in pursuit of their chosen policy of containment. At no point until the end did the Security Council deny Washington anything, even when most of its members rightly thought that bombing and sanctions were counterproductive to toppling Saddam. For Washington to accuse the UN of not grasping this nettle is outrageous.<br>
<br>
Now that America and Britain have grasped it, they had better hold on to it. As Mr Kingston waves his Tomahawk over his head and cries, “Get lost, world”, the world should retreat. Iraq will need ruling with a rod of iron. It will be a place awash with revenge squads, Sunni-Shia rivalry and gangsters fighting over reconstruction largesse. Such confederations need a strong central authority with armies to hold them together. Saddam and his Baathists were that. The coalition has destroyed such authority. It is inconceivable that it can be replaced in three months.<br>
<br>
The most dangerous talk at present is British ministers pledging “Iraq to be run by Iraqis”. That is what happened in 1991 and it was a recipe for mayhem. Baath fascism will not die with Saddam, any more than the Taleban’s ejection from Kabul meant the end of al-Qaeda (so we are told).<br>
<br>
There is no responsible alternative to long-term American governorship of Iraq. The Baath party is the only political entity on the ground. It ran government, police, utilities, even education. It cannot be entrusted with a return to formal power. Hundreds of people would die in their beds. Yet if coalition leaders talk of leaving in the foresee- able future, no sane Iraqi will put his head above the political parapet.<br>
<br>
Much abuse has been hurled at Donald Rumsfeld’s plan for the military government of Iraq under a retired general, Jay Garner, and exiles headed by Ahmad Chalabi. The prospect of Mr Chalabi heading anything appals British and American diplomats, including publicly the entire State Department. The latter’s slate of nominees for senior posts in the new regime was vetoed by Mr Rumsfeld as too liberal and replaced by Pentagon right-wingers. Such is Mr Rumsfeld’s power. Even General Garner is said to oppose Mr Chalabi. He might repeat Wellington’s remark on being sent a list of crony-generals by the War Office: “I hope they terrify the enemy as much as they terrify me.”<br>
<br>
The structure of this new regime, with American soldiers and civilians governing Iraq alongside each other, is eerily similar to that established in 18th-century India by an earlier precursor of empire, the British East India Company. Nor do I envy these men. Like those previous sons of empire, some may not return home alive.<br>
<br>
What matters at present is not which personalities run Iraq but who “owns” the settlement. It must be owned by America, and especially by Mr Bush and Mr Rumsfeld personally. Whatever consultative body is suggested by Mr Bush to appease Mr Blair and Clare Short, the new Iraq will be a Pentagon colony. Only if that is clearly understood will Washington find it hard to walk away, as it walked away from Afghanistan, Beirut and Somalia after likewise promising to stay. Mr Rumsfeld must rule Iraq, staff it, finance it and police it, especially if he means to use it as a springboard against Syria and Iran. Above all he must defend it against the hysteria of Arab states desperate to avenge their present humiliation. This victory against terrorism may yet give that word a new dimension.<br>
<br>
If I were the UN I would wait. I would not move a muscle. I would expect America to assert its conquest and apply victor’s justice to the vanquished. Washington has already rejected any recourse to the International Criminal Court. I would expect America to seize the oil wells and direct their revenue to American construction companies. There will be trouble between Kurds and Turks: I would expect America to sort it out. I would expect car bombs and vendettas and warlords and want no part of it. I would expect America and Britain to harvest what they have sown. I would do this because I cannot stop it and because any interference by the UN risks diluting the responsibility now clearly lying with Mr Bush and Mr Blair. Legitimacy is not at issue. These men have made Iraq theirs by right of conquest, not law.<br>
<br>
They will need the UN in time. There is a limit to what any country can do to police the world on its own. Iraq is said to require £13 billion a year for ten years. Even now a UN decision is required to lift sanctions, or American firms rebuilding Iraq will be trading illegally. There needs to be UN approval for World Bank guarantees to be forthcoming. America will need a UN resolution to change the oil-for-food regime, whereby the UN has been feeding 40 per cent of the Iraqi people. Someone will have to decide what happens to the oil revenue, since the UN using it for food will clash with claims of American building contractors and Iraq’s many international creditors, including France and Russia. If General Garner starts shipping oil to which he has no legal title, foreign courts might declare it the product of theft and banditry.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, British taxpayers might also have claimed reparation for the £3 billion they have spent pre-empting the “imminent and catastrophic threat” that Mr Blair told us Iraq posed to Britain. If this threat was real, sovereign compensation should be payable from Iraq’s oil. If it was not real, who then should pay? War is never this tidy, but the new world order desires closure, as in Yugoslavia. The path to peace across the whole Middle East is now in thrall to American arms. In time that hegemony will seek legitimacy. It will seek it from the UN because it has the only legitimacy in town.<br>
<br>
I have little doubt that America, so quick to go to war, will tire of peace when Saddam is gone and something else seizes the television screen. It tired of Afghanistan, even without Osama bin Laden being caught. In the Middle East its one commitment is to Israel, and that will not change, vastly complicating its rule of Iraq.<br>
<br>
As occupation turns sour, Washington will see the UN as it did in 1991, not as a problem but as a solution, a dump truck on to which can be loaded the disposable refuse of military adventurism. Someone must guarantee Iraq’s internal security when it starts to bore the Americans, or Iraqis will kill each other again.<br>
<br>
Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, should bide his time. He should say nothing and do nothing. He should sit in his office and let the used-car salesmen of empire come to him. They will offer him an old banger of a country, careless owner, badly dented. What would he need to take it off their hands? Then he can name his price.<br>

<br>
So this Jenkins guy, he thinks the UN is stil valuable for helping Iraq obtain peace and a decent government?  Can you say Mogadishu Mogadishu Mogadishu Mogadishu Mogadishu?  The UN was the direct result of civilians killed and starved from a ruling dictatorship because UN and US forces were not allowed to engage in combat those who mass murdered and stole.  Yea, the UN does a GREAT job of spreading peace....by allowing evil to reign.<br>
<br>
As for his opinion of this whole attempt being worthless because Iraq will still end up fighting between factions anyways:  So what he is saying is we shouldn't even try and hope for a better Iraq?  He is saying we shouldn't at least give them the opportunity?  Sounds pretty pessimistic, not to mention not very nice to condemn people to their suffering. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3048<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/9/03 10:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraqis Praise Bush and the U.S.</span><hr size=1> Well, on this occasion I have to agree with the right wingers.

<br>
But I also agree with the article in that we have bit off a alot to chew on this one. I am not going to predict how it turns out as there are just too many variables yet that we don't have values for, but I don't have much doubt it's going to be alot tougher than most have imagined. But just like I believe the Israel/Palestinian conflict can be resolved with the right approach, I believe the internal conflicts of Iraq can be resolved.<br>

It's going to cost though, so I hope the US public is as gung-ho to finish the job as they were to start it. <p><br><br><br>

Chalabi is a good guy in my book.  He seems to care about Iraq over just about everything, which has made him unpopular with a lot of people, including the CIA.  Which is somewhat understandable, since the CIA cares about the U.S. over everything else.  I think Chalabi would make a great leader of Iraq, at any rate.  I don't expect Iraq to be an American puppet.  I only expect that they not throw away what we're giving them, and I don't think Chalabi would do that. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 430<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/9/03 1:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraqis Praise Bush and the U.S.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Chalabi is a good guy in my book.

The controversy over Ahmad Chalabi.<br>
<br>
By Max Singer<br>
 <br>
While much attention is paid to the consensus in Washington that Saddam Hussein must be replaced, the debate over his successor has largely been hidden. <br>
<br>
Yet the question of who would replace Saddam is a critical component of U.S. strategy, both with respect to how Saddam should be ousted and the American vision for the Middle East.<br>
<br>
The debate over who should succeed Saddam begins with Ahmad Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi opposition movement, the Iraqi National Congress (INC). People who know him well think he has the potential to be one of the great Arab leaders of this century. But there are widely divergent judgments about Chalabi among senior American policymakers and among those counted as experts on the Middle East. <br>
<br>
The State Department, Central Intelligence Agency, and the experts associated with them believe that Chalabi is a small-time opportunist and playboy trying to use his position in the INC to make something for himself. <br>
<br>
They recognize that he is intelligent and charming, but believe that he is of dubious integrity and without the qualities required for leadership and respect in the Arab world, or the strength to lead either a revolution or a new government. A prominent exception to this pattern is James Woolsey, who was the director of the CIA part of the time it was helping the INC, and does not share these negative views. <br>
<br>
But first, the undisputed facts. Chalabi is from one of the old powerful and wealthy Baghdadi families which were forced into exile when the Baath Party seized power in 1958. He studied at MIT and then earned a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1969. Rejecting opportunities at American universities, he returned to the Arab world to teach mathematics at the American University in Beirut, where he met his wife, the daughter of one of the signers of the Lebanese declaration of independence. <br>
<br>
Chalabi is a modern man of the West, who founded a successful software company in London and who understands democracy deep in his bones. What makes him truly exceptional is that he also continues to be deeply a man of the East, with the sensibilities and loyalties of his ancient Baghdad Arab and Muslim roots. Because of the family connections that still count for so much in the Middle East, he is comfortable negotiating with Sunni tribal sheikhs and Shia ayatollahs, familiar with the patterns of relationships that go back generations and form the structure of Iraqi and Arab politics. <br>
<br>
In 1978 he opened the Petra bank in Amman, Jordan, in which he invested much of his capital and which was very successful until it was seized by the Jordanian government in 1989. The State Department and the CIA often say Chalabi's bank was seized because he had improperly diverted assets, and note the Jordanian government claim that Chalabi was wanted for questioning and that the bank failed some time after it was seized. <br>
<br>
On closer examination, however, the story of Chalabi's supposed Jordanian scandal does not hold water. Those familiar with the facts say the bank was seized because Chalabi had been using its international connections to obstruct Iraq's efforts to finance its war with Iran. As a result, Saddam put pressure on Jordan's King Hussein to close the bank. This view is consistent with the official report of the Jordanian officer assigned to seize the bank, the fact that much of the money lost was Chalabi's own, that it was Crown Prince Hassan who protected Chalabi by personally driving him to the border when the bank was seized, that King Hussein held four friendly public meetings with Chalabi (the last in 199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , and that the king subsequently worked to restore Chalabi's position in Jordan. <br>
<br>
It is likely that the best-informed people at the State Department and CIA know better, and yet find it useful not to debunk the anti-Chalabi story. We must look elsewhere, then, to discern the real reason for the bureaucratic antipathy to Chalabi. <br>
<br>
After the Gulf War the CIA was trying to arrange a coup against Saddam by Iraqi generals in Saddam's inner circle. They believed that such a coup would become more likely if there were a small domestic political opposition movement which might be a reason or an excuse for the generals to remove Saddam. The CIA had already created an opposition organization called the Wifaq that they controlled and which was composed of former Iraqi military officers and former Baathist Party leaders. They recognized, however, that the Wifaq lacked political credibility and so they offered to help Chalabi create a new organization called the &quot;Iraqi National Congress.&quot; The agency thought Chalabi would create a small and tame propaganda organization that would not cause too much trouble, but Chalabi created a genuinely representative Iraqi political organization that was independent and that decided it wanted to fight to overthrow both Saddam and his whole regime. <br>
<br>
With support from the CIA and more than $10 million of his own and his family's money, Chalabi's INC created an open political opposition movement in northern Iraq from 1993-1996, operating newspapers, radio stations, and a lively political process involving Iraqis from all parts of the country. It also created a small military force that succeeded — with help from one of the Kurdish militias — in attacking and destroying two divisions of the Iraqi army. <br>
<br>
Despite later loose charges to the contrary, the money received by the INC from the U.S. was well-accounted for and spent with extraordinary efficiency, greatly impressing many Congressional visitors who came to see for themselves, and making some of the Americans brought by the CIA to work with the INC among the most loyal of Chalabi's supporters to this day. <br>
<br>
It is a mark of Chalabi's character that he has gained such a large band of volunteer advisers and supporters not only among Iraqis but also in England and the US. And despite being as fractious a group as any set of exile political figures, and quite diverse, the Iraqis who have joined the INC have continued to keep Chalabi as their clear leader despite the year-long effort of the State Department to find an alternative under the cover of &quot;broadening and unifying the opposition.&quot; <br>
<br>
Chalabi's admirers today also include leading academic experts on the Middle East who have known him well for many years, such as Fouad Ajami, a Lebanese Arab who is the author of the much-admired book The Dream Palace of the Arabs, and Bernard Lewis, probably the premier scholar of Islam in the world. A number of U.S. senators have also come to know him, including Joseph Lieberman and Trent Lott. <br>
<br>
Vice President Richard Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz all know from their personal contact with Chalabi — and their own checks of his background — that the State/CIA view of him as a small-time exile opportunist of shady character is wrong. They believe, on the contrary, that Chalabi is a man who has the character, vision, and strength needed to become an outstanding leader who can help move the Arab world away from the path of anti-American and backward-looking tyranny and toward a path of struggle toward modernity and democracy. If their assessment of him is sound, Chalabi could be the key figure in the success of President George W. Bush's new policy against terrorism, tyranny and threats of biological and nuclear war. <br>
<br>
Differences of emphasis and nuance in the judgment about key facts and personalities are natural, but the gap in understanding between State and CIA on one side and Chalabi's admirers on the other is impossibly wide. <br>
<br>
One side or the other must have the facts wrong. And the question of which group is correct about Chalabi is crucial for U.S. policy. Bush should do whatever he needs to do to decide who is right and to make a policy decision about whether the U.S. is going to support Chalabi. We cannot afford to take the chance of sacrificing such a decisively valuable potential partner out of reluctance to come to grips with an uncertainty, especially one that seems to be the product of bureaucratic enmities and Saudi fears of what would happen if a great Arab democrat came to power nearby. <br>
