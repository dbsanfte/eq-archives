<br>
Heh so basically if a guild wanted into the rotation they could ask who evers turn it was if they could attempt aary and if they succeed then they get in next time round?<br>
<br>
Sounds fair enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  lets see who's willing to give up the phatty lewt though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 592<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 11:44:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=193>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, cause I think that most everyone agrees that Aary is the gatekeeper of ToV-N and thus the true initiation.<br>
<br>
Say SI got in, it would probably take a few raids to get the experience needed to clear all of ToV-N in the 72 hour frame, so Comps and EV alternate on cleanup each time SI is up on rotation.<br>
<br>
I don't know how it would be decided whose slot they got to try Aary in, but whoever lost the Aary should be the first to get cleanup as a compensation. Should be set up so they can have a few attempts on their shot at him though.<br>
<br>
Another thing that will need to be worked out is, how long between shots should we require? Say SI had 6 attempts on their first shot, but couldn't take him (not saying they can't, but just filling out the details in case) - then shouldn't there be a minimum time requirement before a second shot? If not, than we could have guilds taking shots every repop, which would get to be a major pain in the ass real quick.<br>
<br>
So maybe say, 3 or 5 weeks min between attempts? I use odd numbers because that way it will be the other guilds Aary attempted instead of the same guild as the last attempt. Say they attempted an EV Aary, but failed. Week 1 - Comps, Week 2 - EV, Week 3 - Comps (SI allowed 2nd attempt).<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's not for me to say what to do. I just have a nasty habit of voicing my thoughts, even when they aren't needed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Don't say yer only gonna say one thing, then say a whole bunch of other stuff.<br>
<br>
&quot; You know what i think and felt about the whole situation, but sadly, i don't think my peers in EV<br>
                                           have been very good at expressing themselves on this matter, i used logic, and what most of my guild believes SI did. I see your point of view very clearly. THat is<br>
                                           one positive thing about you rynnia, your posts are very clear and directed. I thought i'd add an EV version of your post so you could also appreciate both sides of<br>
                                           the arguement.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate the other side of the argument if I felt it were valid.  I do not.  Is it valid to COH past another raid because &quot;you had it planned?&quot;   Regardless of how you do your raid, that is what happened.  I ask you, would you feel differently had SI been at the COH spot instead of the Hub area?  We were going to break in and learn NTOV from the entrance.  We were ready to go at that point.  We were assembled.  Personally I feel it makes no difference where SI was starting NTOV from.  We were ready before you.  We were jumped after we were assembled.<br>
<br>
&quot; My opinion is kept away from this board as most of my guild knows i have a good number of friends in SI. Hell, i wasn't even in EV when they were<br>
                                           dying like mad figuring out ToV N.&quot;<br>
<br>
What does this have to do with anything?<br>
<br>
&quot; I like being in EV, i'm not gonna get booted out for disagreeing with one event. &quot;<br>
<br>
And you did not disagree.  You were there.   If you are not afraid of being booted, then why remain present when you do not agree?  You showed your agreement by being there.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           You really think running up there with 60 people wasn't crazy? God the first time i ran through that hall il had a guide and managed to aggro a wyvern (thx FD). It<br>
                                           was crazy, and it was lucky you didn't aggro a lot more than just Eashen's guards, admit that please.&quot;<br>
<br>
No I will not admit that.  The wyverns were not up.  I told my guild to wait behind while I took Nosey to check.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           The only part of this situation that really upset me was that friends in SI were questioning my integrity for the situation. I had nothing to do with the decisions that<br>
                                           were made, i just follow orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
Exactly.  That is the attitude I was looking for.  &quot;i just follow orders&quot;   Everytime I hear someone say that it makes me cringe.  That argument doesn't work when yer a kid.  &quot;If he told you to jump off a cliff, would you?&quot;  And it doesn't fly right now.  Everyone is their own person and capable of making their own decisions.  &quot;i just follow orders&quot; is passing the buck, and blaming your own behavior on someone else.   Take responsibility for your own actions.  (and for others reading this, I did NOT give Leriche shit for being there.  The only comment I made regarding Leriche or anyone else was that I would be very surprised if anyone  who had left SI for EV, and spoken to me when they did, supported such actions.  Yes I was certainly surprised, but no I did not contact them in any way, shape or form)<br>
<br>
&quot; I don't agree with CoHing &quot;past&quot; you guys, but how do you differentiate cohing &quot;past&quot; you from cohing &quot;to&quot; our raid. As far as<br>
                                           everyone in EV knew, you guys didn't know the way, we had to hurry yes, but you had several wyverns etc to kill if you were going to break in with your &quot;force&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
Leriche it is stuff like this that makes me wonder what the hell you are doing here.... are you supporting SI in a roundabouts manner?  I really don't think you are but it is working out that way.  You are admitting here that you guys jumped us.  With this statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;we had to hurry yes, but you had several wyverns etc to kill if you were going to break in with your &quot;force&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
You show that you did in fact rush to get people COHed past what we were trying to break through.  We did not have the luxury of knowing where exactly you could COH to, and thus we were going to break in normally. (or at least.... normal to us  lol)<br>
<br>
&quot;You<br>
                                           must well know by now that there are 2 sides to every arguement rynnia, if you want to take your personal insults and throw them at me, fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Playing devil's advocate is a dangerous thing, especially when you make no apparent indication of it.   I know that well from dealing with these boards for so long  : P  If you read my post responding to yours indicate my confusion whether or not your post was genuine.  Were it sarcastic, etc. then I could understand it.  I still can't tell.  Seriously...<br>
<br>
&quot; Look at my post, how<br>
                                           threatening is it really?&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said it was threatening.  I found it confusing and signals from our conversation last night, and then this post today, were mixed and conflicting.<br>
<br>
&quot; If you can't see the other side of the situation and appreciate the complexity of this, then i have overestimated you as a person.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is not complex.  Not in the slightest.  My apologies if that reduces your opinion of me.  I see this as black and white.  We got jumped.<br>
<br>
I know some crackhead will chime in, but this question is for Leriche.<br>
<br>
Swap the situation.  EV doesn't have COH for some reason or another.  SI does.  EV has to fight up from the entrance.  SI uses COH to get up to Aaryonar.  EV had 55 in the zone when SI had 10 or so.  Who has the right then?<br>
<br>
Yes there are 2 sides to this, but yer playing devil's advocate in a situation where one side is clearly wrong, and that is gonna burn you. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaatlaarsolthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aatlaar Sol Thule</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>POVAR SUCKS</span><br>  Posts: 737<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 12:59:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=196>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/daemon5/Aatlaars2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> Sweet Jesus, Nosey is back in top Epic post form, god watch us all!!! <p><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4"><tr><td>

Swap the situation. EV doesn't have COH for some reason or another. SI does. EV has to fight up from the entrance. SI uses COH to get up to Aaryonar. EV had 55 in the zone when SI had 10 or so. Who has the right then?<br>

<br>
Don't say yer only gonna say one thing, then say a whole bunch of other stuff.<br>
<br>
&quot; You know what i think and felt about the whole situation, but sadly, i don't think my peers in EV<br>
have been very good at expressing themselves on this matter, i used logic, and what most of my guild believes SI did. I see your point of view very clearly. THat is<br>
one positive thing about you rynnia, your posts are very clear and directed. I thought i'd add an EV version of your post so you could also appreciate both sides of<br>
the arguement.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate the other side of the argument if I felt it were valid. I do not. Is it valid to COH past another raid because &quot;you had it planned?&quot; Regardless of how you do your raid, that is what happened. I ask you, would you feel differently had SI been at the COH spot instead of the Hub area? We were going to break in and learn NTOV from the entrance. We were ready to go at that point. We were assembled. Personally I feel it makes no difference where SI was starting NTOV from. We were ready before you. We were jumped after we were assembled.<br>
<br>
&quot; My opinion is kept away from this board as most of my guild knows i have a good number of friends in SI. Hell, i wasn't even in EV when they were<br>
dying like mad figuring out ToV N.&quot;<br>
<br>
What does this have to do with anything?<br>
<br>
&quot; I like being in EV, i'm not gonna get booted out for disagreeing with one event. &quot;<br>
<br>
And you did not disagree. You were there. If you are not afraid of being booted, then why remain present when you do not agree? You showed your agreement by being there.<br>
<br>
&quot; You really think running up there with 60 people wasn't crazy? God the first time i ran through that hall il had a guide and managed to aggro a wyvern (thx FD). It<br>
was crazy, and it was lucky you didn't aggro a lot more than just Eashen's guards, admit that please.&quot;<br>
<br>
No I will not admit that. The wyverns were not up. I told my guild to wait behind while I took Nosey to check.<br>
<br>
&quot; The only part of this situation that really upset me was that friends in SI were questioning my integrity for the situation. I had nothing to do with the decisions that<br>
were made, i just follow orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
Exactly. That is the attitude I was looking for. &quot;i just follow orders&quot; Everytime I hear someone say that it makes me cringe. That argument doesn't work when yer a kid. &quot;If he told you to jump off a cliff, would you?&quot; And it doesn't fly right now. Everyone is their own person and capable of making their own decisions. &quot;i just follow orders&quot; is passing the buck, and blaming your own behavior on someone else. Take responsibility for your own actions. (and for others reading this, I did NOT give Leriche shit for being there. The only comment I made regarding Leriche or anyone else was that I would be very surprised if anyone who had left SI for EV, and spoken to me when they did, supported such actions. Yes I was certainly surprised, but no I did not contact them in any way, shape or form)<br>
<br>
&quot; I don't agree with CoHing &quot;past&quot; you guys, but how do you differentiate cohing &quot;past&quot; you from cohing &quot;to&quot; our raid. As far as<br>
everyone in EV knew, you guys didn't know the way, we had to hurry yes, but you had several wyverns etc to kill if you were going to break in with your &quot;force&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
Leriche it is stuff like this that makes me wonder what the hell you are doing here.... are you supporting SI in a roundabouts manner? I really don't think you are but it is working out that way. You are admitting here that you guys jumped us. With this statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;we had to hurry yes, but you had several wyverns etc to kill if you were going to break in with your &quot;force&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
You show that you did in fact rush to get people COHed past what we were trying to break through. We did not have the luxury of knowing where exactly you could COH to, and thus we were going to break in normally. (or at least.... normal to us lol)<br>
<br>
&quot;You<br>
must well know by now that there are 2 sides to every arguement rynnia, if you want to take your personal insults and throw them at me, fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Playing devil's advocate is a dangerous thing, especially when you make no apparent indication of it. I know that well from dealing with these boards for so long : P If you read my post responding to yours indicate my confusion whether or not your post was genuine. Were it sarcastic, etc. then I could understand it. I still can't tell. Seriously...<br>
<br>
&quot; Look at my post, how<br>
threatening is it really?&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said it was threatening. I found it confusing and signals from our conversation last night, and then this post today, were mixed and conflicting.<br>
<br>
&quot; If you can't see the other side of the situation and appreciate the complexity of this, then i have overestimated you as a person.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is not complex. Not in the slightest. My apologies if that reduces your opinion of me. I see this as black and white. We got jumped.<br>
<br>
I know some crackhead will chime in, but this question is for Leriche.<br>
<br>
Swap the situation. EV doesn't have COH for some reason or another. SI does. EV has to fight up from the entrance. SI uses COH to get up to Aaryonar. EV had 55 in the zone when SI had 10 or so. Who has the right then?<br>
<br>
Yes there are 2 sides to this, but yer playing devil's advocate in a situation where one side is clearly wrong, and that is gonna burn you. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You are right, i am wrong.  You and your goddam quote attacking are so annoying.  You win!  Gratz, hope all the toes you stepped on pays back big dividends in the future.  Oh ya, how do you plan on talking to RNG who was getting into the rotation the right way?  I'm keeping this short so you and your goddam cut/paste button don't have to work to hard.  You are not an angel, you are not perfect, and there was a better way to do this, on your part.  <br>
<br>
BTW, personal opinion, If you had been cohing, mojak would have walked right into N. ToV and started killing a fucking dragon right in the middle of your CoH, and not waited outside for someone to show them the way in.  You were either  complacent or had a lack of knowledge, which was it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uleriche1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leriche1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.snowcrest.net/jesses/Lerichesig2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 3:21:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=208>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> Thank God Horce, someone else see's all that fucking Cutting and pasting as a waste of my time to read.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uleriche1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leriche1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.snowcrest.net/jesses/Lerichesig2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 3:43:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=209>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> Oh ya, one more thing, in all that cutting and pasting i doubt one person see's teh situation any different.

<br>
I do not want to hear that I am right and you are wrong.  I enjoy argument, for the most part.  I'd much prefer that.<br>
<br>
How do I plan on talking to RNG?  What exactly are you asking?  Talking to RNG in the past has been as simple as sending a member of RNG a tell.  I fail to see what talking to RNG has to do with any of this.  If they are getting into the rotation &quot;right away&quot; it is news to me.  What I was told today differs from that, unless I was lied to.<br>
<br>
No I am not an angel.  No I am not perfect.  I've never claimed either of those things.<br>
<br>
There was a better way to do this, you say.  What was the better way?  The fact does stand that we were present in force first.  You can argue it until you are blue in the face.  You posted confirmation of that yourself.<br>
<br>
You seem to still think that we waited at the hub for someone to show us the way in.  Your statement at the end of your post illustrates that.  If you did read my post, then you should understand what happened.  My guild followed me.  I followed nobody.<br>
<br>
If yer really interested in doing so, you mentioned you were playing Devil's Advocate.  Great.  Then please explain, from the other side, how this was all perfectly acceptable and SI was in the wrong. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://www.ebay.com>Psst...I have a lvl 18 Ranger,<br>only $800 American</a></span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 3:51:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=211>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/nosey.JPG WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=178></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> I said plenty of my own.

I didn't even know the tribunal board existed at that time!<br>
Damn jooo walk(talk)about, shitwitted lizard =P<br>
<br>
Anyways i realized that asking shining path to wait for me to get something to replace the legs with, before i returned them, was kind of unreasonable, especially from their point of view ;p<br>
<br>
I never &quot;refused&quot; to give back the legs, i didn't even think about them when i left, they'd been a part of my equipment for quite some time, i don't sit and stare at my character's inventory all day drooling on my keyboard, while having some kind of waking wet dream about my armor. maybe walkabout does though. <br>
<br>
Lejina... you have no idea what you're talking about, i gave the legs back a week or so later.<br>
<br>
Well maybe leriche gave his droppables from SI back too... i don't know, if he did the whole soandso kept guild lewts has no bearing at all i s'pose =P<br>
<br>
And also, not that it really matters, but i wasn't 'vetoed' as far as i know. after i'd been trying to join the companions for quite a while they went from dragon faction to giant faction. i thought dragon faction was the best at the time =P so i asked them to cancel my membership vote thing and went to try joining sol invictus.<br>
<br>
Erm on the issue... obviously no one is completely right here, but i agree with loegan's post, it's intelligent reading in alot of flying poo =P<br>
<br>
Walkabout is fucktarded! damn you again! i didn't want to post here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> P<br>
