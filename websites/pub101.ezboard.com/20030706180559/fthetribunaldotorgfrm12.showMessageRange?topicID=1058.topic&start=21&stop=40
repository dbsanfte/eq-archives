<br>
Are you trying to break the rotation? I am not in any guild involved in this ryn but from a purely human stand point that kind of shit will make people break your rotation. Then you will all have what you dread....FCFS NToV.......Just remember when E/V kicked SI out of ntov. You guys were fucking pissed off and were willing to do anything to get in there and prove yourselves...Even if it ment breaking the comp/ev rotation.<br>
<br>
History is a bitch and things will repeat themselves. You better look at the past to find out wich road your traveling down Ryn. <br>

If Circle of Lemmings posts they want a shot, then ya gotta let them have one, or argue for weeks on the board.   Then, of course, every one of those guilds now wants an &quot;equal say&quot; in how the rotation is setup.  XXXX wants a limit of 6 guilds in it while XXXX thinks 2 weeks a turn is good and XXXX wants infinite guilds and 24 hours to clear.<br>
<br>
It'd be ... well... a big fucking mess : )<br>
<br>
Trans / AN, the 2 additions to the current rotation setup by SI / RNG, were added without issue.  (unless something funky went on with RNG that I dunno about.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Shalita I was the one that spoke with Legendary the other day in TOV.  I was the one that said &quot;yeah go ahead and give him a shot.&quot;  I was the one that kept my guild at the zone in so ya all could have your attempt.  I also watched with bind sight.  You are not NTOV ready.   Could you kill Aaryonar ?  Maybe.   Could you then clear ALL of NTOV in 48 hours from Aaryonar spawning?  No.  You are not organized enough.  And as far as the current rotation you must be able to clear in 48 hours from Aaryonar spawning (and yes that includes contending with the broken up spawn after patches).  To do this you really need to hammer out half in one day AT LEAST and then half the other.<br>
<br>
Consider you have:<br>
<br>
Ikatiar<br>
Eashen<br>
Aaryonar<br>
Feshlak<br>
Dagarn<br>
Kreizenn<br>
Mirinella<br>
Koi<br>
Vyemm<br>
Zlexax<br>
Cekenar<br>
Sevalak<br>
Jorlleag<br>
Lady Nevederia<br>
and Approximately 15 flurry drakes.  More if you take longer than 3 hours *total* for Fesh thru Vyemm.<br>
<br>
So no.  Get a bit more organized and wait a little bit of time to ask to join the rotation.<br>
<br>
As far as the salts and skins... no you won't see them on ebay.  I got that damn urn off drusella a couple weeks back and factioning is boring as hell  : P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uchutoi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chutoi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/02 2:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: just hurry up and kill the fucker already</span><hr size=1> Shalita, I almost don't know where to start.  Did Rynnia sound like you had contacted him?  Don't think so.  I know for a fact that you didn't contact Manglodin, the SI guildleader since I was grouped with him all day.  In fact, it wasn't until we had a guildmember mention that Lego was in ToV and had a guildmotd that said you were doing west until you had enough for a shot at Arry that we had any clue you were attempting to jump the rotation again.<br>
<br>
So, yes, you're right.  It appears we can't trust the word of anything come from a Lego's mouth.  Want me to believe something?  Tell you what.  Have you shaman leader post here.  I have met him once or twice.  I'd believe him.  Better yet, why don't you have Connovar post here and see if he can offer a decent explanation for why he felt it necessary to lead his guild into a continuing debacle.  I would be heartily embarrassed were I you.  Frankly, I would have deguilded.<br>
<br>
I don't really care what your members do, but if you have enough people leaving that other guilds notice, you have problems.  Perhaps you might consider that your actions to date are NOT sitting well with all of your members.<br>
<br>
No, we did not have the time pressure you faced.  Yes, we butted heads with EV.  The first time we did not know there was a rotation.  The second time there was a misunderstanding as to when we were supposed to get the shot.  At any rate, once we were aware of the rotation, we got an agreement out of the prior rotation to let us have a shot.  We agreed that if we failed, we would wait for 2 full rotations before requesting another one.  We got 1 day for the attempt.<br>
<br>
As for stereotyping you as being always in NToV, it is not a stereotype if the guilds in the rotation are trying to CoH to the safehall for a break and Lego is there powerlevelling Roy.  IT HAS HAPPENED THE LAST 2 SPAWNS!!!  Hello!  Stereotyping my ass.  You are just being obstinately rude.  Heck, the 3rd spawn ago you didn't even bother to try to kill Aary, you just stole easy spawns.<br>
<br>
I know very well there are people behind the pixels.  I'm not very often rude or mean (I save it for jackass behavior such as the current Lego farce), and I pretty much always apologize if I am.  However, you bring up a good point.  There are people behind the pixels, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.  You preach about being nice, and yet you have the poor taste to try to screw up a social nicety that 4 other guilds have put in place to keep things going smoothly--aka the rotation.  Are the flames stinging a little?  Perhaps it's because you are collectively trying to give everyone else in the rotation the shaft, and deep down you know it.<br>
<br>
Yes, this is a game.  No, that's not a good reason to try to screw over the other 400+ people in the other 4 guilds in the rotation.  Common courtesy should bleed over into everything you do, and boy, are you missing bigtime on this one.<br>
<br>
Why are you people so resistant to the idea of playing nice?  Let me put it in capital letters for you.  Read it several times.<br>
<br>
IF YOU WOULD LIKE A SHOT AT ROY, PLEASE ASK THE GUILDS CURRENTLY IN THE ROTATION!!!!  NO ONE IS GOING TO WALK OVER YOU IF YOU HAVE THE COMMON COURTESY TO SCHEDULE A SHOT!<br>
<br>
Jebus, you people are dense.  Not to mention dishonest, irritating, rude, and, apparently completely unprepared for NToV.  Why don't you ASK for a shot, and then agree to not ask for another for 2 full rotations IF you fail.  Maybe you should ask BEFORE you try to jump another spawn.  Did Rynnia sound mad?  I'm not surprised . . . but I bet you still get your shot.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't see that as so terribly onerous.  Our guild did it.  So did RNG.  Why can't you?  It doesn't even have to be a conversation.  Type the following:<br>
<br>
/t lilwee We would like a shot at roy.  When can we schedule a run at him?<br>
<br>
Common courtesy is your friend.<br>

It's NOT a good time to ask for a shot when the guild that is up is currently at the zone and has 50 people waiting on you to hurry up and die.<br>

Legendary.  You failed Ikatiar today.  Being bound in umbral I've watched you fail to DOOMSHADE several times with raid level forces (30+), pulling him to zone and killing him using his extremely slow regen to your advantage, and Doomshade is.. um... nothing compared to NTOV stuff.  Stay outta NTOV until you refine your tactics and discipline.  You are beyond the point of &quot;proving you can do it,&quot; and honestly it's just becoming quite sad, and a nuisance to the guilds who are in the rotation.<br>

NO ONE IS GOING TO WALK OVER YOU IF YOU HAVE THE COMMON COURTESY TO SCHEDULE A SHOT! -- Chutoi
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Just want to address this. We have asked RNG for a shot previously. All we got back was &quot;clear pog for us so we can kill tunare alone&quot; and &quot; do a 10th ring war for us&quot;, then we can talk about a shot. Unfortunately the guild cannot agree to such rediculous demand for just a chance to attempt a dragon. I know RNG has done it for Comps, but that does not mean we have to do the same to get an attempt. If what you are saying above is true, then guilds should not require extra service to be performed to have a chance at a dragon. You preach about common courtesy, yet you place yourself above of everyone else and deem to own NToV and wants so called &quot;admittance fee&quot; for newer guilds to experience the place. And if you want to know who i contacted in SI, it was Casie. Your member and she both confirmed she was the raid leader. <br>
<br>
And, I was merely stating my personal perspective on the previous post, Kij. I did not preach people to be nice. Nor do I expect a warm welcome here. But i just couldn't stand lies being spread about my guild. <br>
<br>
Rynnia, you mention about the well being of the membrs of other guilds. And i understand that. But by holding back other guilds from experiencing and learning a new place, what other options do we have? You and the other guilds have a head start in NToV and gained much valuable experience and knowlege about the zone. That's what enables you to clear everything in your alloted time. Did every rotation guild clear NToV in 48 hours the first time they try north? As far as I know, Si and RNG , in the early rotation days, likes to run COMBINED north tov raid, combined tormax raid, combined tunare raid. Maybe that's the strength you possess that we do not. While our memebers have to learn everything from the start on our very own. <br>
<br>
Octracula, yes, we performed terribly today due to only having 598 clerics and 1024 warriors at raid. Normally we would have about 10,000 clerics and 250,000 to enable us Zerg Emperor Crush. Sadly today, he lives on. Maybe it is time to recruit couple hundred more clerics and warriors so we can chain rez them to offtank Dvinn. Thank you for paying very close attention to our raiding activities. We feel flattered. Maybe we can have you as a honorary guest to our next Crushbone gathering.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujasmeralia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jasmeralia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Other Evil Admin....</span><br>  Posts: 1574<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/9/02 11:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legos and Roy?
