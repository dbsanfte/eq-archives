Micheal Moore's documentary bowling for columbine is not at all biased about guns in america.  He even reaches the conculsion that it is not necessarily the over abundance of guns that causes our insanely high murder rate.  Instead he looks to other issues that may cause this within our society.  Criticizing something u have not even seen is plain stupid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is impossible to explain why you should have to give money to poor people.  It would take several months of what should be required reading for you to come up with that conclusion.  As our current educational system stands I am not surprised you have not come to the conclusion that it is in everyone's best interests to help the poor.  It is of course difficult to make people realize this, to put on the shoes of a poor man and realize how difficult it is.  That is why the government needs to step in, to provide care.  Because the rich man on the hill sure as hell wont.  The people need guidance in affairs they have no training in.  Not someone to say Ill lower your taxes,  which will make you happy, but will have tremendous detrimental effects upon the society you live in.<br>
<br>
<br>
If Social Services continue to fail, then you will end up realizing your folly, as the poor man comes into your house to rob you.  Desperation leads to desperate acts.<br>

Why did you include teachers in that group?  But that's another issue.<br>
<br>
Save for teachers, many of those are jobs that at least in the Northeast are not wanted by the hard-core welfare recipients, the ones that most who work for a living and  support a family are not willing to take on as liberal government forced charity cases.  Most welfare recipients would rather live off of my money than take those jobs, which is why many of them are largely filled with recent immigrants who - shocker - came here and learned they had to work for a living.  <br>
<br>
Truckers get paid a pretty decent wage and don't belong in that class either.  But fast-food, fruit picking, lawn mowing and janitoring - those jobs are &quot;undesirable&quot; to many of those living off of my tax money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lilum>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 3:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> I'm not saying the welfare systems we have is ideal, but I haven't heard any conservative come up with a plan besides &quot;let me keep mine&quot;.

Dumai is an asshole because apparently he would happily see children starving in the streets than pay his share of taxes.  I personally don't think children should ever be forced to pay for the mistakes of their parents.  Which brings up a funny thing most people on the right are pro-life but that only care about the kid as long as he's in the womb.  After that fuck em let em starve.

i know in the midwest a minimum wage job was decent enuff to live by.  rent on a decent, albiet a little small, apartment runs about 300$, cheap car, few utilities and yer set, even got some decent pocket change.  toss in a roomate and step up a few amenities.<br>
<br>
but to raise a family??  on minimum wage?  you shouldnt even be fucking! (heh, i know i wasnt, couldnt afford much along the lines of a date).<br>
<br>
personally i think all persons should have their &quot;tubes&quot; tied at birth. no exceptions.  then take and pass a test to have them untied.  hell its harder to get a drivers liscence than it is to get pregnant anymore.  if you cant realistically afford kids, you get denied, fuck your brains out.<br>

the ppl who have been working minimum wage jobs for 10 years and are raising a 5 year old SHOULD FUCKING KNOW BETTER. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Wow, the absolute Ignorance in that statement is astounding! Hate to tell you this chief but for the first 5 years I worked I cleaned toilets, flipped burgers, and mowed lawns! After that I fucking moved UP,And put myself through school, Eventually I became employed by old mother IRS herself. Anyone who can't move up in this country is a fucking dead beat. Hell even mcdonalds pays 8$ an hour for flipping fucking burgers.<br>
<br>
If you did not have the rich those people would not be cleaning toilets, Flipping burgers, Or mowing the lawns. Those jobs were created because somone with money MADE them. Do you think if we were all poor we would hire people to mow the fucking lawn? Do you think if we were all poor somone would open up a mcdonalds, Even tho its vastly cheeper to buy and make your own food? Do you think if it wasnt for the the middle class buying shit they dont need those factory workers would have ANY jobs?<br>

The above statement is so true. Lilum is right there shouldent be fucking children starving in the street, Because thier Parents should not FUCKING HAVE THEM.<br>
<br>
What ever happened to being worried about your child? When did children become a fucking commodity. When did people start having kids for selfish reasons? A Parent should ALWAYS think of his kids first and part of thinking of your kids is having things planned out for them, Or working extra hard to move up in the job your at....(Mcdonalds Managers make 35k-55k a year so dont fucking tell me its not possible)<br>

<br>
<br>
Something SHOULD have been done BEFORE they had those KIDS.<br>
<br>
What the fuck?  Why do I HAVE to pay for somebody else's poor planning?<br>
<br>
I know people on welfare.  They have any of a combination or ALL of the below<br>
<br>
Television<br>
They smoke<br>
They drink<br>
They buy name brands<br>
They have large long distance bills<br>
They go out to movies<br>
They go out to eat<br>
They order pizza and chinese food delivery<br>
They rent movies<br>
They have computers<br>
They have PLAYSTATION 2 or XBOX or GAMECUBE or all fucking three and usually lots of games for it.<br>
They do drugs<br>
They buy jewelry<br>
<br>
<br>
There is something wrong when someone on welfare can afford any of the above.  There is something wrong when they can afford anything more than the very BASICS of life.<br>
<br>
Milk<br>
Bread<br>
Small amounts of meat<br>
Vegetables<br>
Fruit (apples not exotic expensive shit like peaches)<br>
BASIC Transportation (1988 Toyota Camry not 1998 Nissan Pathfinder with leather and CD)<br>
BASIC Housing<br>
Heat<br>
Hot and cold water<br>
Electricity<br>
BASIC clothing ($5.99 sneakers on sale not $79.99 Nike)<br>
BASIC health care (no fucking ADD medication or sleeping pills or weight control shit ..... I'm talking you bust your leg or need an operation you get it fixed.  Got an ear infection?  Get some medicine.)<br>
<br>

A portion of my paycheck is going, every single week, to pay for him to have what I cannot afford, and that is wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1718<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 9:01 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> Damn Rynn, I am gonna move to your state if welfare people can afford all that there.

I am just using examples of what I have seen.<br>
<br>
If a person on welfare is buying cigarettes it is just as much a problem as if they were buying that Pathfinder anyways.  They shouldn't be able to afford any luxuries / entertainment or anything of a frivolous nature.  People on welfare shouldn't have PETS.<br>
<br>
Being on welfare should be as miserable as being in prison.  Just enough to get by, thus creating a mssive desire to better one's situation.<br>
<br>
If they do not wish to better their situation, then they should not be my problem.  And they ARE my problem when it is coming out of MY paycheck, and *I* now have to work overtime to keep up my standard of living I would have if welfare did not exist.<br>
<br>
<br>
Something for nothing is bullshit, and that is what welfare is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ishmialmuaddib>Ishmial Muaddib</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 11:10 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://212.212.159.252/tearaina/imagesP/Ishmial.jpg width=140 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> That's how capitalism works.

I bet it is less than 10%, but that is a guess. But if it is 10%, would getting that back really make a difference in your financial situation? Even if you were paying $50 state tax a week, is that $5 extra dollars really hurting you? Or $10? Even if it's $15 a week, that's what, one hour you work out of every 40 to help the poor?<br>
<br>
I understand the principle of it, but I think in reality welfare takes alot less of your paycheck than you think.... but I could be wrong. Maybe I can find numbers on it. <p><br>

<br>
Who are Democrats or anyone to tell people what they can and can't do with the money that they earned.<br>
<br>
It's not as if rich people didn't work for their money (with some exceptions.) They worked their asses off for it. If some people want to clean toilets instead of trying their hardest, fine, but those people who worked their butts off to get where they are shouldn't have to throw their money at the poor.<br>
<br>
I agree, sometimes the poor, the truly poverty stricken, need help. But too many people are LIVING on welfare. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http:// src=http://sayree.homestead.com/files/adolensi"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1727<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 11:38 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> No, my point is that people are acting like welfare actually hurts them financially.

<br>
It's like having a fit because a soda machine took your dollar. Yeah, you are out a dollar, but how much of an impact is it really? Is it worth the time you spend fuming over it?<br>
<br>
Maybe, just maybe there are more legitimate targets for budget cuts that would equal a greater return. <p><br>
