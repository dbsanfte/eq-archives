<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Honest question here: Is &quot;homosexual&quot; all that you are? Is that all you define yourself by? If not then why ask others to treat that aspect of you any different than any other part of who you are?<br>

<br>
To add to Terranine's response.<br>
<br>
Are you blind? Take a look around you, surf the TV, surf the web, look through some magazines. What do you see? Homosexuality is something that is presented as a an illness, as a disorder, as a sin, as something evil, something bad. With that comes fear, hatred, discrimination, all completely false. Yes i live in the suburbs and you know what? I have to hide this small part of me. Why? Lotsa ppl everywhere dont understand and dont care to understand and these unintelligent ppl much like yourself would prolly assault me in some form, statistics dont lie.  Would you get such treatment for checking out a member of the opposite sex?<br>
<br>
Similarly, what do you think and do when you hear someone is gay? You discredit that person whatever his station in life, and he becomes like a second class citizen in your eyes, if that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the big difference is this guy plays a female and flirts with guys that dont know hes gay. Then acts surprised when they get pissed. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes i flirt with a lot of people, and no i dont act suprised when they get pissed. In fact i laugh at them. They didn't &quot;have&quot; to flirt. Besides, is it really MY fault if you flirt with someone if you dont absolutely know if they are being run by a guy or girl?<br>
<br>
But Terranine answered the parade part well~ i leave that part alone.<br>

You are absolutely correct.<br>
<br>
The problem is, why do people like Terranine feel the need to obfuscate when confronted with those questions like he mentioned?<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the reason is this:<br>
<br>
Many people view homosexuality as being morally wrong, disgusting, and inappropriate behavior.<br>
<br>
Now, without getting into an extended debate over manners, it is of course possible to interact with people who do things you find wrong, disgusting, and inappropriate.  It is possible to be friends with them, talk to them, work with them.  However, when the very behavior which you find so offensive is shoved in your face brazenly, one tends to become defensive about it.  The solution, imo?  Gays do whatever the hell they want, and keep it to themselves.  When confronted with questions such as, &quot;When are you finding yourself a nice girl?&quot;, request that the topic not be discussed, or if the person is close to you and you want to let them know, talk to them privately and explain yourself.<br>
<br>
Why should this issue be treated any differently from any other behavior that is not illegal, but is repulsive to most of society?<br>
<br>
I'll tell you why... because homosexuals are trying to &quot;mainstream&quot; themselves.  At least the large organizations, lobbies, etc. are.  It's an attempt to actively change the morals and perceptions of individual people who disagree with them.  And no, its NOT like civil rights in the '60s... there is a world of difference between judging a person based on a physical characteristic such as skin color, and judging someone based on a BEHAVIOR... which is perfectly logical.<br>
<br>
As for myself... no, I'm not going to adapt my morals to fit the homosexual community's desire to mould society around themselves.  I will, on the other hand, be polite to homosexuals just like everyone else... and hopefully they will be polite enough to keep their bedroom behavior in the bedroom where it belongs, and not thrust it into my face and demand acceptance. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

I guess I'm not getting my point across.  There is nothing to understand.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I don't care</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if you're gay or not.  &quot;Gay&quot; is not who a person is.  If that is all you see yourself as then that is your problem, not mine.  I can't believe you actually have a problem with me <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> being bias.

<br>
If people have a problem with you being gay, then I would say that is their problem to deal with, not your own; however, your problem is you seem to want people to care.  You want it to be a big deal that you're attracted to people of the same sex, when it fact it doesn't mean shit.<br>

<br>
This thread started off as a dumbass mistake by a cocksucker, and turned out nicely. I really like this thread. It gets the Hohum seal of approval. I see a handful of people giving their little diplomatic answers on homosexuality, full of peace and tolerance. I am sure they feel truly brave and noble. Like they are sticking flowers in a tank. How terribly fucking sweet. But the rest of you I am proud of! Whether you agree with what you are writing or not, you are taking the unpopular view and ripping on gays. I imagine that seems like an oxymoron to some of you, but whenever we fight our natural tendency to take the safe path of political correctness, we all turn out winners. Except for the fags of course.<br>
<br>
Before I get into my rant on gays and the word gay, I just want to point out that the queer who said he was just flaming Wolvar back is a complete moron. You did not flame him back. You got all upset and tried to logically argue back. He pissed you the fuck off and your “flame” did nothing to him. So just calm down, get one of the island boys to give you a handjob and simmer the fuck down you little pink wearing fairy. We surely can’t have you wigging out like that weird kid’s father in American Beauty.<br>
<br>
You being gay does not make you special. Your inequality does not mean we owe you equality. If we feel disgust, we do not have to hide it. The fact that you were born that way does not make the fact that you like hairy male ass any more acceptable to us. All it does is make us feel less worried about turning out like a freak, you know, like you are.<br>
<br>
Homos make great comedians and philosophers. Wilde and Foucault are great faggots. They also make good waiters. They know how to make a house look great. But I do not have to want to hang out with them. You want more than acceptance, you want endorsement. In fact you demand it without compromise. Well I don’t feel like giving it too you. Because I don’t like the way you demand shit you little fucking Dorothy.<br>
<br>
You can call me a redneck bigot and all that shit. You can pawn it off on lack of intelligence, because after all, smart people embrace faggots. I could care less. You can stereotype as much as I do. I enjoy calling you a fudgepacker. I enjoy laughing about the way Jeff Garcia talks. You calling me names doesn’t hurt me, especially when I know they are not true. And I am not necessarily out to hurt you, but rather out to enjoy myself in truthful laughter.<br>
<br>
You guys have been persecuted for centuries. And I could give a rats ass. <br>

That is fine by me, just as long as they do not try to involve me and don't seek special attention in the form of parades and demonstrations (protests, you fucking pervs).<br>
<br>
For example, I work with a gay dude.  He jokes about it. It's really cool.  He doesn't prance around and say 'woe is me, I am being repressed'.  Fuck that shit.  <br>
<br>
As a side note, why do most gays have that lisp?  Is it a genetic thing, or a developmental thing?  <br>

<br>
If you think about it, youre bitching about how you dont like to be bashed about some shit that you can not control.<br>
<br>
But if you and your husband were to adopt a child do you not think that he would be bashed for having two fathers? Do you think that the other kids wouldnt make fun of him when he says &quot;I hope one of my Dads comes and picks me up!&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, I dont care what your fucking stupid reasons for having parades are, none of them make any sense.  What keeps a heterosexual male from &quot;bottling&quot; up his emotions about a woman? Do heterosexual men have parades with the theme of I TOLD A WOMAN I LIKED HER<br>

<br>
Look Hayzen, do people get persecuted for spinach, bondage, or the color green?  I think not.  Those are a world of differences.  But if it would make you happy, go ahead, have parades for them, I won't be one of those who sit back and slander the parades you have.   But if your going to do it, at least do it for pride and not to make fun of or berate Gay Pride Parades.  God forbid that we have events in our lives that bring us together, unite us.  Parades are positive things, they shouldn't even be an issue. <p><b><i><center>Terranine Horizon</i><br>60th LvL High Elf Arch Mage<br>
