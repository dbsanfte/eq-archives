<br>
-- Shawshank Redemption. Awesome. The two main characters in this movie, Morgan Freeman? and that white dude, great actors. Damn fine movie. Gues it failed cos the movie had a weird title (and the prison sex, I didn't like that shiet too much, mind). <br>
<br>
-- Starship Troopers. Goddamnit, this was a huge movie! Star Trek on crack with some Robocop humor thrown in, awesome special effects, war and violence -- and for the love of all that's holy, unisex showers -- the future has never looked so bright, and I don't give a fook if the buggers or arachnoids end up killing us all, either. Man oh man, what the HELL is wrong with people, this goddamn movie should be on top of the charts all the way. Coppola should be re-making Apocalypse Now with shower scenes. It's A Wonderful Life, fuck that -- cut that sucker up, put a shower scene in that too! I have developed a profound dislike of any science fiction movie without shower scenes, since watching this one. <br>
<br>
-- October Sky. Just go fuggen watch it man. It's moving, simply put. Then, go read the book (Rocket Boys). Awesome stuff. I'm bummed that this is so under-appreciated.<br>
<br>
LADIDA HOHUM<br>
<br>
 Fucking A I liked Starship Troopers.<br>
<br>
-Galaxy Quest. This is one of the funniest fucking movies I have ever seen. I have watched it like 15 times. I really think the characters are hillarious &amp; the dialog is very well done. <br>
<br>
VAIN GLORIOUS<br>
<br>
&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was great! Good pick  <br>
<br>
I would say &quot;Defending Your Life&quot;. Beautiful dialogue, funny, subtle, romantic - a hell of a lot of fun IF you enjoy the humor of Albert Brooks.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm really fond of &quot;Dead Again&quot;. Kenneth Brannaugh and Emma Thompson in a fairly low budget mystery thriller.<br>
<br>
&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;... was this underrated? I dunno - the reviews were fantastic but I haven't met too many people that saw it before I handed them the tape.<br>
<br>
And then there's &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot; - also well-reviewed, but little seen in the US, at least. This is a gorgeous film. Prepare for major warm fuzzies and a peaceful night of dream-filled sleep after this one.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;, I really wish they'd stuck with the original title from the Steven King short. Probably wouldn't have helped ticket sales any, though.<br>
<br>
KRAZMOS<br>
<br>
Youre definitely right about Starship Troopers, its brilliant satire. You are dead wrong about Galaxy Quest and Shawshank though... Galaxy quest got great reviews, and was always popular amongst the EQ geeky types. 4839223 people have told me Shawshank is the best movie ever... its hardly underrated. Personally, I have to say The Jackal. Everyone hated it but in reality in owned<br>

other underrated movies i liked..<br>
<br>
-Swingers (fucking money)<br>
-The Burbs<br>
-Caddyshack (maybe not underestimated, but a fav anyway)<br>
<br>
MEORAH<br>
<br>
OMG, The Burbs owned!<br>
<br>
Cogito, wtf is up with you and October Sky? You mention it in like every movie thread you make.<br>
<br>
I liked it alot. Great movie pick, but damn man... its not the Bible!<br>
<br>
From this point on, you can't put October Sky in any more movie threads, new rule. =P<br>
<br>
LADIDA HOHUM<br>
<br>
The Burbs did own! &quot;ART'S GOT A GUN!&quot; &quot;You keep a horse in the basement?&quot; I think a lot of early Tom Hanks movies before Big really rocked. Volunteers fucking ruled.<br>
<br>
PCU I loved a ton. Throwing Ground Beef on people at a Vegitarian Rally just rocks. Plus, it had George Clinton in it which gives it an extra 10 points.<br>
<br>
I ordered SLC Punk &amp; Freak Talks About Sex when I ordered Flash 5. I am pumped about those two &amp; have been checking the mail 4 times a day.<br>
<br>
The People Under The Stairs is an awesome Wes Craven movie that really not many have watched. <br>

<br>
Hmm interesting question.<br>
<br>
Henry V - the Kenneth Branaugh (sp) version<br>
This movie was acctually nominated for acouple of oscars but I dont know many people who have seen it. Unlike the older versions of this play where the English were portrayed to have a supurior advantage army wise this version shows them at a great disadvantage and thus makes you really pull for them. The St. Crispins Day speach gives me chills every time.<br>
<br>
Jabberwocky - Monty Python<br>
This film is more subtle and in some cases more over the top in its lampooning of knights. Might take a couple times to catch it all though.<br>
<br>
Time Bandits - Terry Gilliam<br>
This movie is still good after all these years. <br>
<br>
Once upon a Crime - James Belushi and several other has beens and never quite wases.<br>
Great humor in this movie, some really unexpected stuff. George Hamilton rocks playing a giglo funny stuff.<br>
<br>
RIGADOON DEMORTIS<br>
<br>
Heh I liked Waterworld.<br>
<br>

<br>
Damn, am I one of the only people in the world that hated Starship Troopers? I woulda put that one in my &quot;great book, crappy movie&quot; category if I had thought of it at the time. Seriously, read the Heinlein book, it's SO much better that you will watch the movie again and cry at how bad it is by comparison. I mean come on, the part at the end where Carmen has been impaled through the shoulder by a bug, yet she's throwing her arms around her friends and laughing like she hasn't a care in the world...ambulance anyone? One would think that shock and blood loss alone might put a damper on her high spirits. <br>
<br>
As far as underrated movies are concerned, I tend to like a lot of action flicks that never get good critical reviews. A partial list:<br>
<br>
Big Trouble in Little China. One of the BEST and funniest movies ever made. Period.<br>
<br>
Blade. Loved it. Lots of people hated it. It was a comic book, okay? <br>
<br>
The Replacement Killers. Chow-Yun Fat in a powerhouse performance, touching and cool as hell at the same time. And Mira Sorvino is just so awesome.<br>
<br>
The Fifth Element. Great music, out-there costuming (by Jean-Paul Gaultier, he of the Madonna torpedo-breast outfits), amusing performances, basically a Bruce Willis action flick in space, but funnier than usual. Critics hated it, I think they were just expecting something more serious. <br>
<br>
And some non-action films also:<br>
<br>
Erik the Viking. Tim Robbins directed by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame. And it shows. <br>
<br>
Searching for Bobby Fischer. I mentioned this in the touching movies thread. Amazing film, but hardly anyone saw it. One of the best performances by a child actor I have ever seen. <br>
<br>
Much Ado About Nothing, the Kenneth Branagh version. Okay, Keanu Reeves stinks, but at least I got to see him oiled up and gleaming, and he doesn't talk a whole lot. Everyone else was just great, as usual for Ken's Shakespeare adaptations. <br>
<br>
A Walk in the Clouds. On the flip side, Keanu Reeves actually NOT stinking, he's really very good in this movie, a sweet and romantic film set in Napa valley just after WWII. <br>
<br>
JASMERALIA<br>
<br>
Heh. Someone had to mention Snatch.<br>
<br>
A side note on this... when it came out, I was in the theaters going to see something else. It was at a Showcase Cinemas, and they have the electronic screens with the movies playing and at what times.<br>
<br>
Apparently someone had a little sense of humor. The movie above &quot;Snatch&quot; was &quot;Save the last dance&quot;. But it got truncated to &quot;Save the&quot;. So what you saw was kind of like...<br>
<br>
<br>
SAVE THE 6:30 7:50 9:00<br>
SNATCH 7:15 8:30 9:30<br>
<br>
Heh. I've seen a picture of one of the highway movie listings that was:<br>
<br>
SPY KIDS<br>
BLOW<br>
POKEMON 2<br>
<br>
<br>
Boiler room was very good. Giovanni Risci (spelling?) is a very good actor, I'm looking forward to seeing more movies with him in it.<br>
<br>
NISH UVDABRUDDERS<br>
<br>
Big Trouble in Little China OWNED!!! I will watch that movie any day it is on. Same for Tremors. <br>
<br>
Fred Ward is great! (Loved Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins, &quot;He moves like a baboon with 2 club feet!&quot; as well as Miami Blues - sick movie tho)<br>
<br>
KRAZMOS<br>
<br>
&quot;Krazmos speaks the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Excellent.<br>
<br>
And I'll return the favor by agreeing with you about Seven. It was excellent but never really got much press.<br>
<br>
You know, I was inches away from putting Tremors down myself, it was pretty popular, but its so old that nobody remembers it anymore. Damn its a great movie though. I hate the &quot;Movie suX0rz compared to the book!&quot; argument... you can say that about everything FFS, and if you look at Starship Troopers on its own its fine, even if they did butcher it. Its a really fun movie to watch.<br>
<br>
I agree 100% about the action movie comment also. The older I get, the less I like good plot Shakespere &quot;fine art&quot; crap, and the more I like shootem ups. There's no good explanation, I'm just becoming a dirty old man =( <br>
<br>
JARET FURE<br>
<br>
Lots of good stuff already. &quot;Pecker&quot; has made &quot;tea-bagging&quot; a catch-phrase in my office. Here are a couple more good ones that you might not know about.<br>
<br>
American Psycho -- This movie is freakin hilarious. The main character is clearly insane, yet that prognosis has nothing to do with him killing people. And the vapid resolution is the clincher.<br>
<br>
Kentucky Fried Movie -- Classic slapstick/parody from the Zuckers bros. before they went on to make Airplane. &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot; is the best Kung-Fu parody I've seen. It has my gratitude.<br>
<br>
OOHAY<br>

The 13th warrior was such a great movie that NO ONE I have talked to has seen. <br>
<br>
DOMINATIONCALIFORNICATION<br>
<br>
Usual Suspects.. one of the best movies of all time.<br>
<br>
The 13th Warrior.. barely 1 1/2 hours long, too dark, cannibals aren't very original. It sucked. <br>
<br>
COGITO<br>
<br>
Do you know the real story behind the 13th Warrior/Eates of the Dead? It is deeply facinating, really. It isn't as much a book, as a re-writing of an original manuscript -- ie., the story is actually true (obviously appart from the artistic and dramatic liberties taken). This tale is the first insight into the viking world, ever written by an outsider. The description of the blue tattoos, funeral pyre, the tradition of the girl having sex with the king's warriors, before letting herself be scarificed and put on the king's pyre -- and the warriors banging their shields and screaming, to cover up her screams as she is killed: brutal, barbaric and primitive acts as they are, these tales sounded as if the original author had taken a few too many liberties with his story, but he had not. Those were very accurate recollections of real events. <br>
<br>
I didn't see the movie, but I read the original manuscript, ages ago, and were really impressed by how close the book was, to the original tale. This is a very peculiar thing. <br>
<br>
There are a bunch of movies I really agree with her, excellent choices -- and even better, I've gotten some great ideas for new movies to watch. Thanks guys, excellent postings  . <br>
<br>
I'll put my Henry V dvd in and watch that speach now, I think  and hey, if you liked that movie, you might like Titus also. A FAR darker, and more evil tale -- Shakespeare's most violent play. <br>
<br>
INIYENI<br>
<br>
I thought of two more movies last night, cause I am a Christopher Walken fan.<br>
<br>
The Dead Zone<br>
The Prophecy<br>
<br>
Both great movies, one where he plays a good person with a painful and unwanted gift, the other where he plays a vengeful archangel Gabriel. Interesting stuff, and as always the man is a genius. <br>
<br>
BEBOPS<br>
<br>
I never saw the Dead Zone..i hate seeing King movies after reading the book..only good King movies Was Shawshank redemption and Green Mile. I did read Chichton's 13th Warrior (or rather Eaters of the Dead) and in his little intro it talked about how it was a Beowolf story done for modern times to make it interesting. <br>
