That statement alone goes to show how ignorant you truly are Estevan. <br>
<br>
Did you miss the whole paragraph when I said Wildien and Thinkness are best friends in RL? Kind of like you and Xavre but without the HGS. I know them both in rl too and I can tell you for a fact that Thinkness greatly appreciated all the officers that stood up and lead the guild forward. But oh wait, just because a cock sucker like you didn't see the gratitude that means it never happened. Afterall, you are above all and your word is final.<br>
<br>
Eat shit Estevan, you are fighting a losing battle. Thinkness is a very good leader and just because you and a few other dipshits wish to spew ignorant statements and use your almighty logic to think otherwise, it won't change the fact that he ( ALONG WITH THE OFFICERS ) have lead Transcended from nothing to one of the top guilds on the server. Don't demoralize a persons integrity without having all the facts, because not only does it piss people off but it also makes you seem even more stupid once you are proven wrong. Run along Estevan, nobody likes you =x <p><hr>

How do we know that they were going to roll on it? seems to me that you were the only one out of place Rim.  If i am wrong let me know but i see it as cleric and shamany rolled for it, and you jumped in, and said the others needed to roll, seems that the cleric had the idea it was NBG and reb just slipped on his roll, then you somewhat forced the issue that the others needed to roll.  I am not saying that this situation is clearly cut one way or the other, but i do think that you had a decent sized part in what happened by requesting others to roll, without asking how the loot was being decided, when the monk and rogue had not rolled.  If you think i have a biased view of the situation thats fine with me, i think it was a fault on both sides <p><b>Ikaran</b><BR>

  Just noticed your Byu crack, I'm impressed, who told you to say that?  If you could form your own opinion of anything I might respect you.  You are a little puss.   I've watched you go from I hate Merton to Merton is cool to Transcended sucks (that was about when we all left and they ripped your SS bp off ya) Who replaced that?  Oh yeah we did.  Then I leave for a while and come back and your back in Trans (which I expected, and never said much about it).  Then some more Merton sucks, Merton is cool.  Trans is cool, Trans sucks.  <br>
<br>
We we were still friends (or at least  you acted like it) but then you started on me that I was wrong for leaving.  That was my choice and I never asked you to leave nor said shit to you when you went back, as that was your choice.   I would get stupid ass tells out of the blue from you like &quot;Grats me on uberdrop_01&quot;.   Or the weekly gossip...so and so left.  Mostly I would say maybe it will be a better place for you now.  <br>
<br>
Pick a side of the fence buddy.  Grow up and form your own opinions and stick to one.  Remember the people who were actually real friends to you and accepted you as you were.  No strings attached.  <br>
<br>
Seeing Bakstabb  still makes me giggle.  (nothing against the char or the Guild as a whole, there are some great people) but I just find it so appropriate for so many members.  <br>

Heh.  Are you thinking back on one Dozekar incident??  Yeah that was a mistake to ask about that in guildchat and I admitted it. Wowo.  What other incidents do you have for me Mr. Estevan??  I also wouldn't call getting a general concensus of how some people felt about certain things deciding anything.  It's mere conversation my friend and I would think a guildleader would want to know how the guild feels about certain things. I can't talk with my guildmates?

<br>
So much wrong information.  Man your a dumbshit Estevan, but keep em coming.  I went MIA from Sept 11th 2001 just about until around I think around December.  Yeah, I was gone for a while, but thats what happens when people go MIA you know.  Yeah, the guild was going downhill and obviously I knew all this because I was camping messageboards on a labtop computer all the time because WOW I still managed the boards and by talking with Wildien.<br>
<br>
I don't see where you find room to talk about what went on with Wildien and I because quite frankly I don't think you were there that one day when Wildien and I were at Larry's Giant Subs on Baymeadows road when we talked about the guild and I asked him to step up for the guild because I couldnt be there.  You know nothing about what decisions we made that day so please stop spewing out shit.  I wanted to make Wildien GL, but he said that wasnt necessary because I would be back and he basically has access to me since we're RL friends.  I am sure lots of people remember when Wildien first tried stepping up and people were like, &quot;WTF is the lowest member of the guild doing trying to lead this guild?&quot; He was level 47 when he joined.  I remember that, but Wildien kept pushing and earned lots of respect.  Wildien and I always talked and I was even able to get on a few times during my MIA at his house to raid and say hi.  I know you remember that.  Only Wildien has room to speak on that matter.  As for not thanking Wildien publicly or not publicly, you are wrong and again don't know what the hell you are talking about.  Wildien know's whats up and whether or not you do, doesnt mean <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> shit</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to me because all that matters to me is wildien knows I'm thankful for what he did for the guild.<br>
<br>
As for our first Derakor the Vindicator kill. Yes, it was significant and a big step in our progression, but GUESS WHAT?  I was fucking there you moron.  Wow, I think I even pulled him.  I was already back to EQ before that happened.<br>

Thanks for not calling me a loot whore. Yes, you did give me a fungi and I still use it to this day.  Thank you for that.  As for me not being on a fraction of the raids a lot of you were on.................... Guess what Intrigued?  I was MIA... It's kind of hard to raid when your AWOL.  Whats up with telling me Wildien worked his ass off to keep the guild together??  WTF, you act like I don't know that and I never talk to him.  We hung out a lot and talked about the shit that was going on.  Oh and I was already back for our first Vindi kill if you would actually think and remember us rewarding you vindi's head and the boots to Terrik.  Go ahead and click on the link posted above.  <br>
<br>
If you would think some more, you will also remember leaving Trans shortly after that Vindi kill.  Remember not wanting to do Telk because of faction?  Then me making that post calling you out which you didn't like because it was so true about you? Things don't change do they??  Just like Arorot following you around and posting right after you.  It won't suprise me.<br>
<br>
You left shortly after our first Vindi kill and my return.  You have no room to talk about how I did things and how I led things because quite frankly you weren't even around to see. and I was MIA while you were around.  If I remember, Trans started to do a lot more shit soon after that first Vindi kill when others thought we'd collaspe with the loss of the BYUs.  <br>
<br>
Oh and Fuck you for insulting me when you have no clue what was going on in my RL to say I was on a drug trip. As for having no balls, I don't ever recall seeing you face to face.<br>

And you came back right around that Vindi crap.  I left because I didn't want to go on a raid late that night with work the next morning and have to repair faction when I still didn't have it back from the last kill, I didn't have the time and was expected to be on CoV faction.   I was usually the only druid if not one of two and would often bind in strange dragon places because so many in Trans were retarded and couldn't make thurg potions.  I always stayed to make sure everyone got it.  <br>
<br>
I also left because that Vindi head was thrown in my face at that point and you sat there and did nothing about it.  You questioned me on why I didn't want to go on one raid, but when others left that was fine.  You sat back after and said you said it way fine to go, yet you still questioned me. <br>
<br>
And the druggie stuff?  Well that came from your RL friend when I sat at listened to him stress out about guild stuff.  The rest came from you telling me on so many nights how you were strung out from being up 2-3 nights in a row. <br>
<br>
You wanna drag some old posts out oh perfect one?  I got them all.  Including the log from the night I left.  I also have some old screenies of our talks, long ones.  The ones where you asked me/us to help keep things going while you got your shit together.  The nights I was constantly telling you to get sleep.  The ones where you sat and told me how much I/we were needed when I wanted to take a break.  Then you turn around and talk shit, treat my daughter like shit who did nothing to any of you by banning her from the website just because I accidentally posted under her name when you knew her computer was out.  You spewed all this stuff about how I was a whiner, blah blah, yet you NEVER said anything to me while I was in the guild.   After I left I had people asking me for this and that to be returned to guild, not you, you didn't have the balls to say anything to me.    <br>

<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:13 2002] Bakstabb tells the group, 'roll for the bauble thing'<br>
<br>
Mistake or not, you can't expect people to be mind readers.  Taking the interpretation of a &quot;reasonable person&quot; (we love Contract Law) this suggests everyone should roll.<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:39 2002] **A Magic Die is rolled by Llaanara.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:39 2002] **It could have been any number from 1 to 100, but this time it turned up a 20.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:44 2002] **A Magic Die is rolled by Tauran.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:44 2002] **It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 79.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:49 2002] **A Magic Die is rolled by Rebellious.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:49 2002] **It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 76.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:53 2002] Rebellious tells the group, 'doh'<br>
<br>
Now, we could interpret this as Rebellious realising he accidentally rolled or that he lost the roll.  Open to interpretation.  Don't know about you but how often do you accidentally type &quot;/ran&quot;?  Maybe he hot keys it and pressed the button by mistake.  Happens often I'm sure.<br>
<br>
Frankly it doesn't matter.  It's not a strong argument either way given the potential to misinterpret.<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:54 2002] **A Magic Die is rolled by Lithian.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:54 2002] **It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 91.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:54 2002] Llaanara tells the group, 'woot tauran '<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:21:57 2002] Llaanara tells the group, 'lol'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:04 2002] You tell your party, '!'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:10 2002] Llaanara tells the group, 'wtg Lithian'<br>
<br>
Seems Llaanara had no problems with Rimidal rolling at this stage.  Obviously he was not the only person who thought it was a random all scenario.<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:17 2002] Rebellious tells the group, 'not even sure why I rolled, shammie cleric only'<br>
<br>
A full 24 seconds later Rebellious adds a remark about his &quot;inappropriate&quot; roll.  If it was NBG why didn't anyone say anything to Rimidal at this point?  Even with slow typing, brain and connection lag it shouldn't have taken this long.<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:28 2002] Irou tells the group, 'i win'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:31 2002] You tell your party, 'still 2 people left to roll~'<br>
<br>
One minute and 18 seconds later still no one has mentioned NBG after Rimidal makes another comment.<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:44 2002] **A Magic Die is rolled by Irou.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:44 2002] **It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 65.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:45 2002] Llaanara tells the group, 'dont lowest win?'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:45 2002] [60 Grandmaster] Irou (Human) <br>
<br>
If it's NBG then why is Irou, a Monk rolling 1min 32secs after the random call was made?<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:45 2002] Rebellious tells the group, 'mana?'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:47 2002] Irou tells the group, 'see i win'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:49 2002] Tauran tells the group, 'its clr/shm only?'<br>
<br>
Now that there's only one person who can beat Rimidal in a roll the classes who can use it sudden come up with an original idea.<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:49 2002] **A Magic Die is rolled by Bakstabb.<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:22:49 2002] **It could have been any number from 0 to 100, but this time it turned up a 44.<br>
<br>
NBG with the Rogue now rolling (1min 36secs later)?<br>
<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:23:05 2002] Irou tells the group, 'yea cleric shaman only'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:23:09 2002] You tell your party, 'dru too'<br>
[Tue Sep 10 21:23:17 2002] Irou tells the group, 'you aint no druid'<br>
<br>
Not that it's confirmed IRmidal is the winner it's itme ot play the &quot;NBG&quot; trump card.<br>
<br>
Yes, very innocent.  If a mistake was made why wasn't it called before every clown rolled?  There was ample time and opportunity.  In hindsight it may have been better to correct yourself but the fact that you didn't means you should live with the responsibility of your inaction.  Responsibility is a heavy burden for some.<br>

P.S. Yes, if you petition you can have 2 seperate characters on different accounts flagged as Guild Leader.<br>

I always random with every group i make every late night.. Anyone who has grouped with me late at nights ( lots of you out there )  we always random and there usually is no problems... when we hit seb  i usually pass on everything anyways hehe...<br>
  Now NBG can work -- it should be called at the start -- just the famous King camp and a fungi drops --its hard to tell the group that 1/2 can't roll on it if it Actually drops -- but if you all agree at the start np .. My goal every night is to get 6 names so everyone gets a trinket !!!! hehehe<br>

<br>
&quot;Just noticed your Byu crack, I'm impressed, who told you to say that?&quot; <br>
<br>
No one told me to say that, thx ^_^ I didn't wanna be associated with you any longer after I heard some rumbles, so I got out then.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you could form your own opinion of anything I might respect you. You are a little puss. I've watched you go from I hate Merton to Merton is cool to Transcended sucks (that was about when we all left and they ripped your SS bp off ya) Who replaced that? Oh yeah we did. Then I leave for a while and come back and your back in Trans (which I expected, and never said much about it). Then some more Merton sucks, Merton is cool. Trans is cool, Trans sucks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Have you ever changed your mind about something when you saw more information on the subject? Yeah, that's what I thought. Yes, I do make decisions too quickly lots of times, that's a problem I have, I admit it. I never said merton sucks. I said I disagreed with the shit he was pulling. That happens a lot. Just cuz he's a friend, doesn't mean I hate his ass. But nothing stops me from disagreeing with him, which I do often enough.<br>
<br>
Same thing for Transcended. You think when I left I cut off all communication with people in guild? I've already posted it was a mistake to leave, hell, even you said that to me~ Yeah, you guys replaced my SSBP. I was overwhelmed. I still am, and I am very thankful for it. Do I hate you now? No I don't, but I am disagreeing with you. Notice a pattern here? Contrary to what you believe, you don't have to be in agreement 100% of the time with someone to be a friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pick a side of the fence buddy. Grow up and form your own opinions and stick to one. Remember the people who were actually real friends to you and accepted you as you were. No strings attached.&quot;<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, I'm usually brash in making decisions. But when I take a bit to make my decision(s), I'm usually right. So I have frnd. Transcended is my home, and if you're gonna continue to sit here shitting on it, I'll flame you, just like I'll flame Estefag and Merton. But imagine this! I don't carry flameboard grudges over to EQ and RL! <br>
<br>
What sort of strings do my friends in Transcended attach? That I should actively raid? hrm, funny, I don't think I've ever been told I need to raid more. And either way, that's one of the two reasons I still play. Raiding, and friends. <p><HR>

I don't care if he gave Wildien a handjob in the bathroom at Larry's Giant Subs on Baymeadows road as a show of appreciation.  He wanted to come back to the guild with a king's welcome like he had never left.  <br>

I hope they don't have a reading compehension section on the G.E.D, cause you'll never pass.<br>
