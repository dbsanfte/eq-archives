<br>
Now SHUT THE FUCK UP.<br>
<br>
Thinkness goes above and beyond his call as a guild leader. So, he isn't playing Thinkness? Well good, he is probably checking spawns, scouting somewhere, talking with possible recruits, talking with members, etc...but on someone else. Merton, you know good and well that during the time of Thinkness' absence he was going through a shit load of real life stuff. Tough decision: a) straighten out my life b) play EQ. Merton, you are a cock sucker. Plain and simple. I know you worked your ass off to help out Trans in its dry period but there is no fucking excuse for you to make ignorant statements like you are doing. You were a bane to the guild's exsitance. To have possible recruits reject joinging because the fact YOU were in it is bullshit.<br>
<br>
Get off your &quot;I am a fucking god&quot; high horse logic and realize that you are a fucking moron.<br>
<br>
Same goes for you Estevan. You have no clue all what Thinkness does for the guild so just save yourself some air and shut up. Wtf am I doing, all you want is attention and here I am giving it to you. Then again, I guess you need more attention now that your ass fucking boyfriend Xavre is gone. Go give him a few more rim jobs and throw Merton into the pile and make it a hot threesome that would even make Connovar cringe with envy. Again, I am not saying that Wildien, Dooks, Anders, Kaldun, etc did not step up during Think's absence but for you to put down Thinkness like that is a slap in his face. <br>
<br>
And one more time for good measure...<br>

The Transcended skeleton closet is big enough to fill out half a dozen cemeteries.<br>
<br>
Now, I'd like you to show me where I put Thinkness down as you claim.<br>
<br>
Did he play sporadically and inconsistently?  Yep, he sure did.  Was it because of his RL stuff?  Probably.  Should he have stood up and turned over guild leadership to someone who was a consistant presence and who actually did most of the leading and organizing like Dooks?  Yeah he should have.<br>
<br>
<br>
What really surprises me is that you have absolutely zero qualms when your guild leader forces the guild's best monk to roll on the guild's primal hammer against him because he is torn with indecision...  On one hand he wants the hammer really badly, yet on the other hand, his best monk is much more deserving....    Does he pull rank or does he do the right thing?  Or does he try to squeeze in both and make it a /random thing...  <br>

That is just a plain attack on Thinkness himself, i think someone has issues with no longer being in trans.  How many raids have i seen dooks on in the past month?  LIKE 1 and i hear that it was not even him playing where as i have seen thinkness on like 5 raids in the past 2 weeks.  You are just upset because in your fucked up head you thought that thinkness should give over trans guild leader tag TO YOU! i am done here i will not argue with pieces of shit whose sole purpose is to slander others when they have no fucking business in the damn post, as Lhelith pointed out, she was not there.... i was not there, so thats not my problem, guess what merton...

I wanted officer status strictly to lead raids more efficiently and I reiterated that multiple times.  I did not want officer status to put up with crybabies, retards and the like.  We finally reached a compromise where a &quot;raid leader&quot; position would be created that I would fill, thus I would not be saddled with &quot;PR&quot; responsibilities.  We didnt iron out the exact details, but that didnt really bother me since I was still doing what I wanted (leading raids), albeit a bit handicapped.  <br>
<br>
As for kicking me out, I can put up exact logs of the night when I left.  I didn't leave because I wouldn't be given officer status, why would I?  I was already leading plenty of raids and doing what I wanted.  What thoroughly pissed me off was because my hands were tied  behind my back because the severe manpower shortage that we got hit with in the summer left the guild roster filled with dead weights, incompetents and slackers.  People who would rather flip up /anon in Fungus Grove and hide rather than go where they are told and kill whatever happens to be up.  People who would not help gear trial members because they saw it as &quot;pointless&quot;.  People who would not help each other because they saw nothing in it for them.<br>

LOL A man's success isn't measured nor is it displayed by the official position he holds.  Being tagged a leader doesn't make a leader.  If you were a true leader within your guild, being an officer wouldn't have mattered.  Of all the problems that a raid leader must face, none of them would be solved by being tagged an officer.<br>

Good times.<br>
<br>
I would’ve posted earlier, but I didn’t get a chance to. This is mainly in reply to the pieces of shit who have floated up to rag on old Thinky. Welp, this is my take on this, from the standpoint of an active member for nearly a year now.<br>
<br>
<br>
When I first joined Transcended, Thinkness was MIA due to RL. That’s not so odd, Thinkness fluctuates from time to time, but he’s usually around. Hell, most people do. As a lot of people are fond of saying, RL &gt; EQ.  Isn’t a guildleader entitled to this? Oh, and if he was so inactive, then why isn’t the guild calling for his removal as leader?<br>
<br>
Thinkness rarely takes loot. Yes, when he does, he usually takes an item off a first-kill. Lot’s of people like to do that, they don’t ask for anything, banking towards that one item they want, because they know that eventually their guild will kill the mob. I’ve gotten more loot than Thinkness, as have many others. If we were to go back, and document what items he’s gotten, the list wouldn’t be too long. WTH, let’s do it:<br>
<br>
2nd Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic.<br>
1st ST key.<br>
1st Emperor key <br>
1st Monk neck from NToV pets.<br>
Priceless Fistwraps (no point in really counting priceless, but wth).<br>
1st Primal Fistwraps.<br>
Silver Bracelet of Speed.<br>
<br>
So… let’s see… 5 items. 1 of which fucking rots 90% of the time, but it was a nice upgrade to that pos thing from UP he was using in offhand.  Yeah, really fucking greedy, considering he formed and led Transcended, and while, yes, he was inactive at a few points, he’s been there the majority of the time. I don’t think classifying him as a ‘key’ reason we have killed what we have in the time this guild has been around would be out of place.<br>
<br>
Nah, I’m not going to flame you for getting your epic and going to EV, Estefag, you were just following Xavre. I understand wanting to stick with RL friends, and, I respect that.<br>
<br>
Hi Merton. We’ve talked a lot, I know you wanted to lead raids, and you got your wish. Now lets talk about this “but since Thinkness is afraid to lose control, he refuses to turn over the control to anyone else which is understandable I guess”.<br>
<br>
I’m sure most people outside Transcended don’t know this, but Wildien and Thinkness are basically co-guildleaders. Yeah, Wildien is tagged as an officer, but they both are leaders of the guild. They get us organized, and moving, along with some of the officers. What’s the difference between having the ‘leader’ tag and the ‘officer’ tag, really? Well, Leaders can make new officers. I’ve also heard they got a few nifty guild roster command type thingys in the last patch. Cool beans. So Wildien can’t make new officers. But oh wait! He can! He’s RL friends with Think! WOWOWOWOWOWOW!<br>
<br>
Getting back to the point, Who are our officers? Welp, Anders, Tauran, Bakstabb, Ringa. YES! Thinkness is so power Hungry !$#% That’s why 3 of those officers are relatively new!!! Think, they’ve exposed your devious plan to keep control of the guild in your hands, flee!<br>
<br>
Touching on Kijiro’s point, yeah, do / all Thinkness. You prolly won’t find a match. That’s cuz hes checking spawns, or playing Buzzap, or logging on someone so they can get a rez cuz they had to log early. DAMN THAT BASTARD!<br>
<br>
I have else to say to the accusations of Thinkness being a lootwhore, or not active. In any case, its none of anyone else’s fucking business. Are you in Transcended? No? Then why the fuck do you care how active Thinkness is or how many fucking pixels he’s gotten since he FORMED the guild. Like Loegan stated in another thread, It’s a matter of pride, and Thinkness isn’t even the best equipped person in the guild.<br>
<br>
Until you join Transcended, it doesn’t affect you. And quit throwing stones, or your window bill is gonna be astronomical.<br>
<br>
&quot;He only pissed people off&quot;<br>
<br>
Damn, that reminds me of 2 other people who were once guildies... what were their names... <p><HR>

It's like Charles Manson saying,&quot;Man, John Wayne Gayce, he's a bastard.' Why the hell are you even posting here?  Do you want the Octracula Pinkerton wanna-be award?  Or are you going to waste the next 'nine months of your life' here posting?<br>
<br>
I myself am not surprised by the incident described in this thread.  Transcended started going in a direction I did not want to follow, so we parted ways.  Thinkness has been a leader more absent than not, but he still manages to get people going when he is online.  Wildien is a good leader; to me he is the real leader of Trans, despite RL interfering with his time online.  I have no comment about the rest of the guild leadership.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, here's something else scary.... my other question...<br>
<br>

So what...he won. Does this mean that Every time i group up with a trans member i can claim &quot;your level 60 and better equiped then me. Therefore according to Trans loot rules(revised version) in pickup groups I get all loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Big deal if his twinks are better equiped, that has NO DIRECT bearing on the FACT that Backdoorfuckerstabb and company disbanding and ran off with HIS RIGHTFULY WON LOOT.<br>

And now your covering your tracks, pleading innocent by giving away the loot - which im by now has probably changed hands several times and has been sold on the market. Yah whos the fucking loot whore in this story....<br>

As interesting as the Thinkness/ex-guildy topic is, I'd really like to see how Transcended is officially going to handle the earring situation.  And, yes, how they resolve this situation <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> officially reflect what practices they do/do not support since, at this point, the Guildleader, officers and half a dozen of their regular members have involved themselves.<br>
<br>
So please make a statement and then you can go back to defending each other.  Thanks.<br>
