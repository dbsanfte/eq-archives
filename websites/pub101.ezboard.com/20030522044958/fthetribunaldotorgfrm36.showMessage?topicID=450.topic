<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Clinton Warns of 21st Century</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
The US President, Bill Clinton, has told defence chiefs they are protecting America from predators of the 21st century.<br>
<br>
&quot;Those who have questioned the United States in this moment, I would argue, are only living in the moment,&quot; he told the officers at the Pentagon.<br>
<br>
&quot;They have neither remembered the past nor imagined the future.&quot;<br>
<br>
President Clinton, the Commander-in-Chief of the US army, sounded more strident and war-like than in previous speeches on the Iraq crisis.<br>
<br>
The threat the US believes President Saddam Hussein could pose to world stability is based on his past actions, Mr Clinton said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember: as a condition of the ceasefire at the end of the Gulf War, the United Nations - not the United States - demanded Iraq declare within 15 days - this is way back in 1991 - his nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;We had every good reason to insist Iraq disarmed. Saddam had built up a huge arsenal and he has used it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr Clinton described a disaster scenario if the US were to drop the pressure it is exerting on President Saddam.<br>
<br>
&quot;What if he fails to comply and we fail to act? He will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then go right on building up his arsenal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someday, someway, I guarantee you, he'll use that arsenal and I think everyone of you who has worked on this for any length of time believes this too.&quot;<br>
<br>
The president said the lesson of the 20th century was that international aggression required firm intervention.<br>
<br>
But, he said, the 21st century could see an increase in &quot;rogue states with links to drugs and terrorism&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a time of tremendous promise for America,&quot; he said. &quot;The superpower controversy has ended and on every continent more and more countries are coming to enjoy the freedoms Americans take for granted.<br>
<br>
&quot;But it is not a time free from peril, especially as a result of reckless acts by outlaw nations.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to defend our future from these predators of the 21st century. They feed on the free flow of information and technology and they will be all the more lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of nuclear weapons and the capability to use them.<br>
<br>
Mr Clinton praised the progress made by the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq but said the need for force was coming closer.<br>
<br>
If this happens, he added, its purpose would be to reduce the threat posed by Saddam Hussein to his neighbours and the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have repeated and unambiguously made our preference for a diplomatic solution. The inspection system works. It has worked in the face of lies, stonewalling and deception.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, Mr Clinton again insisted that, despite its denials, Iraq continues to have chemical and biological weapons.<br>
<br>
He said the presidential palaces at the centre of the row must be unrestrictedly opened to the inspection teams.<br>
<br>
&quot;One of these presidential sites is about the size of Washington DC. We're not talking about a few rooms here with delicate personal matters involved.&quot; <br>

Think this through a minute.<br>
<br>
What if everything you say in support of this war is correct. We go in and Saddam uses every chemical, biological and conventional weapon he has since he has nothing to lose since we backed him into a corner. Suppose this war lasts weeks, maybe months and our casualites mount to the thousands. Suppose that this prolonged war gives time for anti-American sentiment to grow in the Middle East. Everything goes to shit, the US suffers major loss of global influence and the economy goes into a tailspin from terrorist attacks at home.<br>
<br>
Was it worth it? Because this is a very plausible scenario. The biggest danger is, if terrorism starts at home as a result of this war, we are at a great disadvantage because we have so many forces deployed abroad. My states (Maine) national guard is in Afghanistan right now. Many police depts, fire depts and medical personel are in the national guard and are not home to help with the aftermath of attacks either.<br>
<br>
Now I am not saying this is what will happen, but a prudent person will weigh all possibilities against all possible outcomes.<br>
<br>
I think most of us are willing to take risks once all other alternatives are exhausted, but I don't believe we have reached that point yet. As long as Saddam is not invaded, he has something to lose and can be bargained with, even if it is a long and difficult process. The second we invade, he has NOTHING to lose and there is nothing more dangerous than man in control of country who has nothing to lose. He will unleash everything he has and God help our men if we underestimated him because of his restraint in Desert Storm. In Desert Storm he was warned if he used WMD we would kill him. This time we are going to kill him anyway, so what can we hold over his head to stop him? Killing him harder if he does? <p><br>

It should be to take him away from the country.  Although the semantics draw a fine distinction, it's an important distinction.  Once the threat is removed, by separating Saddam and his followers in charge from the existing weapons and the weapons development and acquisition processes, &quot;war&quot; is done.<br>
<br>
We won't be there to establish a colony.  And the notion of &quot;bringing&quot; democracy to a culture that has never had democracy and frankly wouldn't know what to do with a democracy if it was handed to them, would be a mistake. I don't think that it's a mistake that the US will make, although there is a lot of rhetoric floating around.<br>

Just to be a pain in the rear.<br>
<br>
Tell this to the Japanese.  They are still useing a constitution that was written by one of MacArthur's clerks and forced on them by a military occupation.  They had NO history of democracy before this either.  Germany for that matter had very little history of democracy prior to the end of WW2 (a little more than Japan if you count the 10+ years of the Weimer Republic)   <br>
<br>
Don't make assumptions about another countries ability to handle democracy.   To a certain extent it is just as arrogant to assume they can't/won't handle it.   The Iraqi people, on a whole are, on avaerage, actually pretty well educated (compared to the standards of that part of the world) and it is education more than anything that lays the groundwork for democracy.  One thing though.  We have to accept that the Iraqi's might choose people we wouldn't.  If we don't allow them to do so, we are going to be supreme hypocrits. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
I just love when people state this, over and over.  They never state how they'd determine when all steps have been exhausted.  Is there going to be some sort of bell that goes off, telling the world that the goose has been cooked long enough?<br>
<br>
At what point are all alternatives exhausted?  Who determines when each individual alternative has been exhausted?  Can an alternative become unexhausted, when it was exhausted earlier?  Do other factors play into whether we should continue exhausting an alternative?  <br>
<br>
For example, say one alternative is to send a diplomat to a country to start talks.  That nation puts the diplomat up in a hotel, but doesn't meet with him/her for 2 weeks..  Is that alternative exhausted?  If so, why?  We have plenty more weeks to wait since the world hasn't ended.<br>
<br>
This statement is purely feet dragging.  They don't seriously mean this, since they haven't given the statement serious consideration. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
