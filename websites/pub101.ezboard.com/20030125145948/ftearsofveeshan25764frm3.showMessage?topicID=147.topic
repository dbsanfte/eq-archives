Greetings Tears of Veeshan!<br>

*Ophillia smiles and continues*<br>
<br>
“First let me introduce myself, my name is Ophillia Goldenlight. I’ve been traveling Norath for 4 ½ years, and 3 years in this soul known as Ophillia.<br>
I’ve trained in the great temples of my land as a Healer &amp; Spiritualist, with only two challenging seasons to go before my elders in Felwithe honor me with title of a High Priestess. At that time I will be of the 59th season. Although I took some time off I have now returned to continue on with my life’s work. My job is to refill the Goldenlight back into the souls that have perished in order to reseal their lives so they too can continue on in their journeys.”<br>
<br>
*smiling and looking at all the faces before her, she continues to speak*<br>
<br>
“I have met up once more with my beautiful Sister Ssolaria.  She was the one who has told me of her wonderful experiences with all of you. She said you were a great union of people with warm hearts &amp; good heads on thy shoulders. I trust my sisters’ thoughts and opinions. I have even had the opportunity to battle along side some of you. Which I must say I had the up most fun &amp; I could of hugged all who were there *smiles* <br>
<br>
I am standing here before all of you today as I wish to join The Tears of Veeshan. I do not have much to offer but hard work &amp; the offer of helping others. I am not that rich or have my epic yet, but I will try to aid as many as I can while I am awake. <br>
<br>
*Ophillia bows*<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you all for allowing me to come and speak here before you today!&quot;<br>

<br>
Once inside, Crance sets his spear to the side and dusts off a seat.  &quot;Have a seat, m'lady and let us learn more of eachother.  Ye say ye haven't many riches, but will aid where ye can?  That is most generous for we don't require riches here.  We offer friendship and companionship and only hope for the same in return.  But here I am carrying on.&quot;  Crance called out for a few drink to be delivered by the bar wench.  &quot;Did Ssolaria tell ye aboot the mark she bears?  The mark we all bear?  Do ye have the same mark?  The mark of Veeshan?  Please tell us a little aboot it.  I love ta hear a good story.<br>

Ooc Please feel free to look an officer (me, Ennya, Solarianne, Salvia, Moline) up in game as would love to talk with you.<br>

<br>
Aye Ssolaria has spoke of the mark. *Ophillia takes a sip of her drink* Well let me tell you Crance when I was born, my mother led me to the guild of healers to pursue a path of light. When I asked her why me and not my other brother and sisters she said. Ophillia my dearest I love you as my own, please child do not look at me that way. You are a hard worker and wise beyond your years. Back when times were rough a young girl came to me begging me for milk and bread. Milk for her baby and there was bread for her to keep her strength. She was tall and beautiful with long red hair, her clothing was not of a peasant, they were of those of a warrior, and I believed her to be a paladin her hands were of the light. Anyways she asked if I could care for her child, as her life was marked and they soon would find her and she did not want her child to die as she hoped one day her child would find her people once more and continue on where she would surely leave off. The only thing she promised me was that I lead you to the guild of clerics once you turned of age. I agreed, tears filled my eyes as she looked upon you laying there in her lap. As she looked at you she said, Ophillia is her name please keep her safe and keep my child covered at all times, for she bears a dragon shaped mark upon her hip, if anyone should happen to see this mark she will have a bounty upon her head and killed, as they are doing to me. Who I asked, is there no way the king can help you? No, she said. The mark we bear is fight that we face from birth; there are many others like Ophillia and one day they will reign victorious in this land. I am sorry my good lady I cannot tell you more as it might endanger your very life. I have followed you and watched you for several months. I knew you could be trusted. <br>
<br>
Ophillia dear, I watched your mother leave and my heart broke. Later that night fire lite the streets there was much death, screams could be heard ….from a distance. I will never forget that night, as the screams still ego in my ears when I shut my eyes.  But now you have grown into a beautiful young lady and resemble your true mother much. I am keeping my promise to her as I am to you. I am always here for you, but you must promise me this my dear. The small mark that is upon your hip you must keep it covered always and only marry if thou chooses too one who bears the same mark or your family will ripped from you before your very eyes. Be safe my love do what is in your blood, Be one with the light walkers and do what your ascenders set out to do. I am sure one day you will know more than you and I will know of that destination that awaits you one day.<br>
<br>
Well Crance you should of seen the look upon my face as my mother or rather the wonderful lady that I thought for so many years was my mother walk away. She hugged me with tears flowing my heart broke. <br>
<br>
After many years in great studies I was able to go and do field work that is where I met Ssolaria.  We seem like so much more than friends and then after long talks that we were sisters from a long time passed family. Sure the years drove our professions in many different directions but we always came back or found each other again. Then she spoke of this new family she became a part of. She said they all bore the mark of the dragon. My goodness I almost fell off my stump when she said that.* laughing*  Well then Crance after much more talks I have decided to come and ask thee all if I too may join in what had already been laid out for me many years ago …to join my brothers and sisters who bear the same mark as I. My sister Ssolaria is wise in many ways, her heart is that of an angel’s and I trust her 100%, for I know she would never lead me into danger, it is a promise we made as friends many years ago!<br>
