We are above this type of shit as players on the Tribunal...it happens and oh well.<br>
<br>
They tried to hold the spawn by zoning 20 people into Emp chamber and when we showed up with force to kill it they engaged with 22 people.  Low and shady, but again it's what we've come to expect in spawn disputes on Tribunal. Big deal.<br>
<br>
When they were wiping they trained the Blood on us and dispelled our mezzes which is childish but again, shit happens.<br>
<br>
What pisses me off is a guide shows up, who knows nothing about the encounter, or claims he has no authority to settle the dispute, and after an hour of waiting for a GM to answer him on what to do he tells us we have to roll DA for the spawn.  <br>
<br>
By this time they have 40 some people there, while maybe not enough for Emp it's definately enough to kill Blood and respawn PH on thier time.  And Scargar says we are trying to stop them.  What a laugh.<br>
<br>
Legendary did the right thing and AE TLd outta there after the Guide and GM basically split.  Even though DA took thier shot at Blood and wiped, but not before training us and dispelling mezzes while we attempted to gain control of thier clusterfuck.  You would think even a guide hearing of this tomfoolery would tell DA to get the fuck out or get marked.  Thier ruling was to give DA another shot while 65 Legendary sat there for 2 hours waiting and DA gained forces.  So who is the DA guy who's blowing the guides?<br>
<br>
You didn't have the force to take him down and you used the dirtiest tricks you could think of to keep us from doing it.  That's something that's gonna bite you in the ass later in the game.  You will get yours in the End.  This shit happens but never happened between RNG and Legendary, or AN for that matter...we always kept it civil and within the rules.<br>
<br>
And Merton...you once again have no clue wtf you are talking about.  They trained us...therefore they pulled a Transcended...when they try to leapfrog us in VT then they will be pulling a Legendary.  Remember the days when someone trained your raid and the GMs actually kicked them out of the zone for it?  Or had you already blessed the world of Norrath by quitting by then Merton?  <br>
<br>
Ahh where are all the good GMs?  Did Rynnia get that one taken off the Tribunal too? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=serjj>Serjj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/03 12:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA And Legendary suck cock</span><hr size=1> Holy shit!!!

I remember some cheap shit you fuckers did.  NToV comes to mind.  You fucks petition a GM to get Transcended booted out of the zone because somebody jokingly said that they caused the train.  You shouldn't have been in the zone since it was Transcended's week on the rotation, but Legendary pulled some shit and got their way.  Come to think of it, I bet one of you asses probably pulled that train just so it would look like Trans trained you.<br>
<br>
Don't pull this high and mighty bullshit.  Legendary has fucked many people before and I wouldn't doubt that it will continue in one way or another.  Every guild has to fuck over another guild to progress, but how you go about it is the thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=miskal5>miskal5</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/03 12:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA And Legendary suck cock</span><hr size=1> I love these one sided discussions.  I am not here to flame Lego or think that im cleaver for using words like vaginal blood fart. I am just saying what I saw go down on the other side of the fence.  I was there from start to finish. <br>
DA and Legos were in a obvious race for the named, that shit happens in this game we all know this. Anywayz we had a force on that we belived could take out Blood and so did Legos but we got thier first its that simple.  Unfortunately we failed on blood and we had one cleric boxed and a ton of corpses in the room. We did attempt to get back up but Legendary already engaged the mob since they were waiting outside. Now I dont know why Legendary failed or whiped.  I tell you this DA didnt get a chance to &quot;break&quot; mezzes since the boxed cleric died on return and we were all running back to Ssra for a necro summon. DA doesnt act in that manner.  Most core members used to be Phalanx not Trancended. <br>
At this point a Senior Guide came and we rolled ran 250 for the spawn. Legos lost and we were given a time limit to have our try.  <br>
Now we have 56 members in the prep room for blood we open the door and their is 4 Lego members sitting in the emp room.  Apperently one of the legos eye of zomm was killed by a lego member or DA member and we wiped in prep room to AoE not knowing wtf was going on. Then and only then after a GM told lego to stay out of our way and indirectly caused us to wipe did they decide to finally Tl out. We went on to kill blood and Emp after they finally left then took out Exiled, Cursed in basement and had a good night. My question is this:<br>
After being told to stay out of the way of DA and losing the roll, why did some of your members get in our way and cause a wipe? <br>

If you try to blame that on DA, you have reached a new level of stupid.  Fact is, that eye should never have been there in the 1st place should it have? So when it was killed by a DA member, now it's magically their fault because the fucktarded wizard in Lego couldn't stop pressing his forward key? That's bullshit and and that particular incident was the fault of the wizard, not DA for killing the eye. I know it's the flameboard but don't be fucking stupid, and please, take ownership over what you as a guild(or that individual that had the eye wandering) did, and don't blame that part on DA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bagazanlfgorafk>BagazanLFGorAFK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/03 1:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DA And Legendary suck cock</span><hr size=1> Oh, and this:<br>

<br>
I wasn't implying that Legendary is above it, I was saying everyone is...it's just something that happens from time to time.  Most of us have been playing long enough that a spawn dispute doesn't throw us for such a loop.  <br>
<br>
I didn't come here to Flame DA I came here to Flame the guide for being a putz.  As for the antics involved with the spawn dispute...yes I am above that shit...I don't really give 2 shits what happened and I logged in this morning without giving it a second thought and had fun owning Tallon Zek.  Life goes on.  I harbor no ill will toward any individuals of DA but I will be on guard next time ther is a dispute for them to pull something dumb and that's where I leave it.  I'm not going to refuse to join an xp group because someone in DA is in it, I am not going to boycott Bazaar purchases from DA members, I am not going to call thier guild names and associate them with this one instance for the rest of the time they play EQ....why? Because I am above this crap.  <br>
<br>
It's a game that we all play for fun, sometimes it isn't fun.  How you treat the disputes will determine how fun it is in the future.  I'm not going to take out some sort of vendetta against thier members on a one by one basis, I am going to completely and totally forget about it.  It doesn't matter one way or another for shit any way you cut it.  It is something that happened in a damn video game YESTERDAY.  That's where it stays in my mind.<br>
<br>
Do you think anyone reading this really gives a shit?<br>
<br>
And as far as your NToV comment...it was Transcended's turn in the rotation so Legendary should not have even been in ToV?  Gimmie a break.  Some people still haven't moved past that BS.  I'd say almost half of the people who were there for that aren't even in Legendary anymore.  Some moved on to better things, some quit, some moved down a step.  Life goes on.  Living ina moment is great if the moment is great, but when it's something that's a damn shame on the part of both guilds then it's probably something you should think about just getting over.<br>
<br>
People come and flood the FB anytime something happens and it's just pathetic that whoever made this thread is probably someone from Legendary.  It's almost as embarrassing as the swedes.  While they make for a lousy public image on the boards they make 1 point: nothing you say on this board will matter 1 bit.  Blah Blah Blah...you took my spawn!  Blah Blah BLah you killed me in arena!  Blah Blah Blah French people are retarded!  You know what? Noone cares and noone ever will.<br>
<br>
The only people who alter thier image of a guild or thier treatment of it's members within a video game as the result of something they read on the Flameboard are probably people I don't really care to associate with either way.<br>

Wrong. No Gm or guide told us to leave. We left laughing at how much you have to learn and realised you needed the spawn more than we did if you didnt know the basics like agro on blood means AE in the prep room. <br>
<br>
The eye that was killed was killed by is it Filian (sp?) Hes not a member of Legendary. I do believe he is a member of DA. <br>

You're right about that, but my point was, how the fuck can you blame DA for the wipe if your stupid shit of a wizard was the one that aggro'd Blood? The person that killed the eye obviously didn't want it in camp(can you blame him?), he's not at fault for killing the eye, it all comes down to who aggro'd Blood.. and it was a Lego Wizard.

   Seriously though ( love that line ), quite honestly I have no clue about much in SSRA ( I'm one of the gimps who skipped that entire expansion ). But if 22 is not a capable force to do something... well then when the next guild moves in that can, get out of the way. Try being in one of 3 elemental guilds, you get on a sat for raids, mobs are up, 2 guilds going for the same mob and whoever has the power to take it first gets it, simple as that. <br>
   There is such a thing as class and fairness. I don't know much about lego ( do have several friends in the guild ), but in the past oh I dunno 6 months + havna really heard much bad about them. DA on the other hand... well can't say that I have heard much either way. However, I am more concerned with recent reputation then past. <br>
  In essence if you don't have the power to take a mob.. well suck it up and move on go to something different your turn will come.  <p>Baeaan<br>

You've killed Emperor once, while he is old content I don't believe Dragon Army has the strength, nor the insight, to even pull off a sound attempt on the Emperor with 22 people.

Maybe next time you should learn to work with another guild instead of immediatly pulling bullshit like this, I am sure if you offered to work with Legendary you would of gotten rifts without the hastle of making yourselves an enemy.

<br>
DA is there.<br>
<br>
Lego comes.<br>
<br>
Lego is getting ready to jump DA.<br>
<br>
DA petitions.<br>
<br>
DA decides to give it a whirl, since Lego has the reputation of being fucknut spawn jumpers (*points at Ntov*)<br>
<br>
Lego gets caught in the wipeout.<br>
<br>
Guide arrives, tells them both to roll.<br>
<br>
Lego loses.<br>
<br>
Lego wizard fucks around while DA preps.  <br>
<br>
DA kills eye, Lego wizard aggros Blood, both die.<br>
<br>
Legendary leaves. (Good move. I'm sure the guide would have been very unhappy to find out you stayed there and interfered with their attempt).<br>
<br>
And it's supposed to be Dragon Army's fault that they died the second time to a train caused by a Legendary member?<br>
<br>
Doesn't this bear a suspicious resemblance to when RNG was moving into the NToV hall while Aaryonar was playing army men with the dead Legendary there?  Wasn't there a train then over a spawn Legendary wanted?  Caused by a Legendary member screwing around?  Didn't you dumbasses learn anything then?<br>
<br>
Oh, sorry.  Half your guild is full of people who weren't playing when Lego was in NToV. No wonder you guys are clueless.<br>
<br>
If you're going to flame, Chantasha, at least TRY to make yourself look like the injured party.  Saying 'We trained them and they died, haha, they r teh n00b' doesn't really do anything except make you look bad.  If you're into that kind of thing, I'm sure there's a necro account around somewhere you can pick up for cheap, name starts with an A, I think.<br>
