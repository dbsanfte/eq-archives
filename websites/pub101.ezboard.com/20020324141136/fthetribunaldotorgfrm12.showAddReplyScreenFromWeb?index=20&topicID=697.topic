<br>
&quot;what we should do with all excess animals that would no longer be consumed&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think we would have as many of these animals if people weren't breeding them to later eat.   <br>
I'd also like to mention that although I am a vegetarian, I have nothing against eating meat.  Of course, animals are meant to be eaten.  In the wild, it keeps their population down so they don't all starve to death due to their own overpopulation.  It was a horrible miscalculation on Nature's part that allowed us to overcome our predators.<br>
I do have something against the inhumane way food animals are kept.  The fact is, in America at least, food production is big business, run by a big man who only cares about increasing his profits.  Egg chickens are kept several in a tiny cage, with their beaks sawed off so they can't peck at each other, so the legend goes.  Know how foie gras is made?  It's disgusting.  I'm all for small-time farming where the chickens run around a pen and peck to their hearts' content, and cows roam the forests, waiting to be taken out by hunters.  I don't know how happy chickens in pens really are, and people who are anti-hunting will tell you how painful it is for the creature if they don't die from the first bullet.  But an animal's death to its predators sans weapons are slow and nasty as well.  That's nature's way.<br>
The animal rights debate is not all about meat or animal testing.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.helppuppies.com/nc/">Here's</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> an interesting article about where pet store animals come from.. <br>
At the same time, of course, pet overpopulation runs rampant.<br>
I heard a story, from someone who knew someone who worked for a while at an animal shelter in St. Louis.  Obviously, this is not necessarily reliable information.  It could be all made up for all I know.  The shelter is run by a man who is obsessed with keeping their costs low.  When the time comes each week to kill the cats and dogs that have been there too long, he doesn't use an injection or a gas chamber, because those are relatively costly.  He stabs each animal in its heart, and throws it into a pile of carcasses.  If he hits the heart right it takes the creature a minute or two to die.  But if he misses as supposedly he often does, it will take more like 45 minutes.<br>
Anyway, these are all things that could be avoided and won't even keep you away from your burger  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utelkandoretelenesis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telkandore Telenesis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 392<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 5:03:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=697.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: proof</span><hr size=1> I just want to say that I live on a farm that's surrounded by cattle that are raised to be killed and eaten, and they are treated very nicely.

<br>
Some of the cattle that are intended to live a bit longer, of course, are taken out to range every year for a couple months, and they live in the same paradise conditions as the rest during the seasons.<br>

So my thoughts are, any livestock that are raised to be eaten/used, and cannot live in those nice conditions, need to be let loose.<br>

<br>
You half got my point, we wouldn't breed any of them.  The only reason to have them would  be in a zoo.  They have been domesticated and rely on people to survive.  If people aren't recieving a profit for raising them they would stop doing it.<br>
<br>
I can almost guaruntee you that your friends story is false.  There was an animal shelter operator a few years back who disposed of the animals by shooting them, but his actions were looked at by the state he was in and was made to stop.<br>
<br>
The thing that a lot of the extremists don't stop to think about is that these animals are being raised for profit.  An unhealthy animal, produces poor quality, meat, milk, and eggs.  There by reducing profit.  No rancher who wants to keep in business would raise animals in a way to be unhealthy.

<br>
That is not the case at all. Using animals for food and clothing is natural and can be done in a decent way. If the animals normal life span is 10 years, let them live 9 years then put them to death in a painless way and have your steak and leather. Certainly nothing wrong with that imo. As I said in previous posts, I love a good steak.<br>
<br>
The problem with testing is that it can't be done in a painless way in the creatures own habitat. The purpose of testing is so humans can avoid the pain, yet to do that they must inflict that very same pain on the animal. <br>
<br>
Pain is an dark reality that unfortunatly is part of our existance. The thing is, we are experiencing the pain because of bad luck or bad genes or maybe because we were dumb enough to smoke (guilty). The animal is suffering because we CHOSE to inflict that pain on them. We are directly responsible for their suffering. That is where the differnce lies.<br>
<br>
There is a very simple rule that people seem to have a problem with - treat others like you want to be treated. I apply this to animals as well. If you wouldn't want to be cannonized or have your eyes stapled open while chemicals were put in them, then don't do that to another creature. An animal may not have thumbs or be able to speak, but how did that become deciding factor on whether or not you deserve to live?<br>

It is more than animal testing that makes me hate humans (although the extreme nature of their pain certainly makes it my hot spot). There is child abuse (another example of humans targetting the defensless - why can't we just pick on stuff that can fight back anyway?), racism, pollution, abuse of the mentally ill, abuse of the elderly, abuse of women in other countries (you were born a woman so you are considered property - sweet) just to mention a few.<br>
<br>
I guess my problem (if you want to call it that) is that I can't help but put myself in the person or animals place when I hear about this stuff. What would it be like if I went through this? How would it feel?<br>
<br>
Whe you imagine the helplessness and horror that an abused child feels, how can you not get wound up? When you imagine what it is like to be caged and tortured in some lab bacause you happened to be born an animal, how can it not keep you awake at times, knowing that there are thousands of animals at any give moment suffering pain caused by us?<br>
<br>
It's not that I have extreme morals, I am just a person cursed with empathy. <p><br>

The animal that scientists force to endure pain at least, is being used to do something positive for a targeted group of individuals. But the pain you cause me is for nothing other then your self gratification. Isn't that kinda selfish?<br>

It is a well known fact that rabbits have their eyes stapled (or sewn) open to test  whether a makeup is irritating or not. Rabbit's eyes are supposedly a close match to humans. I would expect such a strong supporter of animal testing would know this - go figure. As for proof - do a fuckin web search. Such a highly advanced human should be able to handle that. I have already stated that I avoid this info as much as possible now because it fuckin bothers me. Obviously you have no such weakness, so don't be so fuckin lazy and do it for yourself. The simple fact is, even if I provided every piece of evidence you ever asked for, you have already made it clear that your status as a human renders my argument moot, so what is the point anyway?<br>

You want to know what an abused child feels? I was abused from the age of 5 to the age of 16....not sexually, just physically ( i say &quot;just&quot;, but we all know it is not &quot;just&quot; ). My mom decided to divorce my dad because he was never home (navy), so she decided to turn into the &quot;piece of shit&quot; mom we all have come to hate. Well, she re-married to a seemingly nice guy, but as soon as they had their first child together, I became the &quot;beating post&quot; if you would like to refer to me.....I was beaten on a regular basis, by regular i mean once a day (usually, but not if i could manage to stay away from the house till he went to sleep). This went on regularly from 5 yrs of age till 16. &quot;why 16?&quot; you may ask.....i was too afraid to do anything to stick up for myself in fear that he would kill my mom (yes, even though she made the decisions that put me in my situation, i still loved her) or possibly come back for me. Well, one day the same old shit began, and he began beating my mom, so i went out and double fisted him in the back of the head.....not good. He spun around after a little disbelief, and came at me full force.....what did i see but my mario lemux(sp?) pro signed hockey stick. I grabbed it and swung as hard as i could, and split it in two over his face, which opened a gash about 1/4&quot; deep and about 3&quot; long across the middle of his face (which a scar still resides BTW haha) and shattered his nose (not really shattered, just EXTREMELY messed up). The craziest thing in the world happened then.....my mom came over and checked him out to make sure he was alive still, and upon realizing he was, told me &quot;if you don't leave now, i'll call the police on you&quot;. How's that for FUCKED up? The most amazing part of this whole ordeal is, i am one of the most loving people (seriously, if my RL friends and family posted here, they would say the same) and i have actually<br>
developed a &quot;listener&quot; type attitude to anyone who has anything they need to talk about. There is a loving side to humans, despite what you think, and i would like to think of myself as one of those types. <br>

I do however agree with disease testing. If 1000 monkey's have to go to save a million people, or even one from something like aids, so be it. Just like I wouldn't accept animals being killed or tested on for unworthy causes, I certainly would never place the life of a monkey over a human.

Actually it is weird but it works like this - I don't hate humans personally, but I do hate our race as a whole. I hate it because people as a race will go along with things that people as individuals would never do. Most of the people here would quit experimenting on animals if they had to do it themselves and witnessed the suffering firsthand. Let some scientist do it in a far away plave though, and people are more complacent.<br>
<br>
Same with child abuse - few of us would stand idly by and watch a child being abused firsthand. Yet, how many of us donate to stop child abuse or get involved with kids so we can prevent it?<br>
<br>
None of us would allow chemicals dumped in our favorite fishing pond, but if it happens in a river 100 miles away - we shrug it off.<br>
<br>
We never do anything or care about anything unless it effects us directly or is easy to fix. The hard problems we ignore and go about our merry little way until it effects us personally - then we screm bloody murder.<br>
<br>
So, no - I don't hate you personally as a human. Hell I am a human (obvioulsy). But as a race I think we suck much ass for the most part. <p><br>
