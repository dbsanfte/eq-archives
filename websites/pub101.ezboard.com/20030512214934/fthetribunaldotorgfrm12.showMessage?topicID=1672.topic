<br>
What did Trie do?<br>
Here are some clues!<br>
<br>
First the setting:<br>
CT sewers, that is the hall where most groups camp Boots/Ring of Flowing Slime which drops off &quot;a swirling red mass&quot; and &quot;A Diseased Mosquito&quot; which drops Boots of the Mosquito/Mosquito Leg Earring, and some wand.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx?path=/cs001/fullsize/ct+sewers+one.jpg">www.strike9.com/file.aspx...rs+one.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Behind me is where I make my camp, there are no spawns here and nothing can possibly add while I am fighting, it's trivial.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx?path=/cs001/fullsize/ct+sewers+two.jpg">www.strike9.com/file.aspx...rs+two.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Second the story:<br>
I show up to CT and find that my friend Bakstabb/Shortbusslower is camping sewers, where I normally xp/farm also. So I invis down with my monk and log my shaman and sit and chat with him for about half an hour-forty five minutes watching him kill many oozes and the named red mass. Trie shows up and says nothing, merely observes for an hour. <br>
Bakstabb/Shortbusslower have lost c3, is nearly oom, and die to respawn after pulling the named Diseased Mosquito, as he was in the hall, where a spawn is. I log on my shaman and invis down, clearing the respawns. Shortbusslower has already run back to CT and lets me know he is going to go again and then log so I back off let him med up and go at it again(should of asked me for help bro but figured you wanted to do it on your own), but he dies again to respawn b/c hes rushed and not too focused, knowing Trie camps CT nearly every weekend with his cleric and will take the named, as I told him so. <br>
After he dies the second time I start killing the spawns to clear the way to Diseased Mosquito again. Trie logs in his cleric after I kill the first of 3 npcs that need to be cleared before DM is to be pulled, so I sent him a tell.<br>
<br>

[Sun Apr 20 04:54:24 2003] Trie tells you, 'Honestly I dont care about this discussion. I wont let petty shit like this affect me. You cannot see my generosity when OFFICALLY there is no suck thing as a camp and if you check the fair play rules if says it is to be shared (camps) so if you say you turned me down and I still let you have it, was that a bad thing on my part ? I think not'<br>

and...<br>
Pay-backs a bitch<br>
<br>
Trie never did admit it, and Jhentar was just a pussy, atleast Wrenn admitted that there is nothing they can do about it anyways.<br>
<br>
Fuck you Trie you will fucking pay, and fuck you too Jhentar for being such a goddamn pussy.<br>
<br>
Btw Bakstabb said &quot;uber&quot; b/c I gave him the loot off the named Mosquito.<br>

<br>
I remember when I came to help a friend camp Stormfeather in Iceclad last year.They had been there by themsleves for a long long time until myself and another came to hang out.Then here you come...we tell you it's camped..and you start saying how you didn't give a shit and that there was no such thing as a camped spawn and said you planned on killing it if it popped.Needless to say you gave up and ran off somewhere and left the zone.So don't go bitching about someone else doing shit you've tried to do in the past yourself.<br>
<br>
Why are you bitching anyways..you got the phat lewtz..big deal you died..it happens everyday..get over it and stop whining about it.<br>

I had this long ass post ready to go with my Log since you left a few things out but I had decided not to post it. Why ? Because this is some petty shit you are carrying on with.<br>
<br>
I only needed to read your first part to realise that you are making a mountain out of a molehill.<br>
<br>
[quote]knowing Trie camps CT nearly every weekend with his cleric and will take the named, as I told him so. [/quote]<br>
(Here you try and make me out to be a person that would KS someone just for the loot, strange since I instead decided to rezz your friend so he could have another go)<br>
<br>
Ok this made me laugh, If a GM could somehow reveal what times on the weekend and what days I log on this would shoot your thoery down right away. I have been in CT sewers 2 times alone with Myself and my cleric. The first time I spent 12 hours and right on the 12 hour I got some boots and the second time I spent 6 hours for nothing. I don't play on Sundays and my guild know this so you are full of shit by assuming this. This is what I call a Real life day, something I think you need. <br>
<br>
I rezzed your friend 3 times and let you have the named since he died to it. I'm so bad for doing that. Next time I will try not to help out complete strangers and the game will be much better right ?<br>
<br>
Go get a life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and Jhentar has nothing to do with it. What did you expect from an officer that never seen the incident?<br>
<br>
