<br>
Jamil and I have been speaking recently of a desire to acquire a new monk weapon. This weapon is known as the Fist of Horn. Thanks to the graciouness of a passing Paladin, I am already in possession of one, and I can attest to it's formidable power. <br>
<br>
In my researching of this weapon, I have concluded that it is only available on the moon in an area known as the Paludial Caverns. It is given up by The Reishicyben which actually resembles a very large mushroom or so I was told. I have recently returned from a scouting trip of the area. This area would be far to powerful for simply Jamil and I alone so we are coming to our brothers and sisters for assistance.<br>
<br>
((ooc stuff))<br>
A possible date for this would be after 2/16. The zone itself is not too horribly difficult for those above level 20. According to Allakhazam it's not heavy on the loot, but is a great area for experience. The 'shroom spawns every 90 minutes, and with the low server population we shouldn't have any difficulty ruling the entire zone. There appear to be areas suited for levels 12-25 or so. Granted that information could be wrong, it would be best to plan for 2 groups split between mid-teen and early to mid 20's of course the more the merrier, and if there are others that want to make the journey, invite them along. <br>
<br>
If by any chance, there is a mid-teen group that wants to try to tackle some of the areas earlier, please message me. I am chopping at the bit to tackle some of these Luclin zones even though it can be a bit laggy.<br>

<br>
i did not make an attempt to attack this thing until i was 31 or so.  at that point, nothing in the caverns would attack me naturally, which is just as well since there is a specific type of monster who being struck by is a bit like being hit by a mummy -- mostly inconvenient and time wasting, unless you catch a disease.  the insects are beautiful, though the larger bugs skulking around the chamber of the 'cyben make the most horrid sound when attacked.  occasionally they drop nice &quot;barbs&quot;, which throw like knives for similar damage, but with the range of throwing stars.<br>
<br>
but i'm rambling...  a reasonable team of 20ish adventurers could probably reach the giant 'shroom.  once there, holding the room would probably not be difficult -- i can't estimate the strength of the larger insects, but i can tell from having escorted someone they will attack unprovoked and come to the aid of each other.  however, near the 'shroom chamber, they are not numerous.  fighting the Reishicyben itself is apt to be more of a challenge for a 20ish group.  i was able to solo this thing at 31 (or so).  it was dark blue to me at the time, and i was compelled to mend -- and even then, it was a close battle.  this monster fights to the death.  when i was 34, it was still dark blue to me (probably at the low end).  i'm 35 now, but i haven't seen it since.<br>
<br>
it is an exciting challenge...but will require a full day's commitment given the time it takes to spawn.  but if you can gain experience from the insects, waiting isn't too bad -- the insects reappear very quickly.  <br>
<br>
in case you're wondering, of the four fists i owned, two went to a sister monk, and i still wear two.  though i'm torn, in my older age, as to whether i should keep using them.  they are weaker than my natural fists, but there are still the stat bonuses to consider...particularly the +4 strength (total).  i may part with them soon...ish...<br>

I have heard of this vile fungus before and have witnessed it's strength firsthand.  It is my opinion that it would be best to wait a bit longer as you gain more strength to assault this foe.  There are other similar though more prudent foes in the caverns that tend to carry weapons of a similar nature, if not as good of quality.<br>
<br>
(OOC: Personally I don't think taking Late teens and early 20s against Reishicyben is a good idea.  He has a confirmed level range by friends from 28 to 29.  That would mean casters would be totally ineffective against it.  It's damage mitigation would also very heavily limit your own effect upon it, as monks rely on speed, not raw damage.  A single party of mid to high 20s would likely work, but even two parties of low 20s could easily get wiped out, not to mention could suffer from adds in the area.  If the parties are a little more buffed up by then, I may add my assistance.<br>
<br>
My recommendation:  You and Jamil camp the Sensate Reishi Elder that spawns near the Shadowhaven zone line.  It has a rare drop of a Fist of Wood.  The Reishi elder is about level 16 I would say.  While the fist of wood is a slight downgrade from a fist of horn, they still work extremely well (I still use my pair at the 22nd fist so I can attest to their battle worthiness), then go back there later in your career to pick of the Fists of Horn.  Personally, asking two full groups to wait ninety minutes for a spawn each time for a single item that will only benefit one person and is not an epic component seems a little bit much, but that's just me.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to be offensive or try to stop you from doing this, but consider this before you plan your foray... and remember monks used to have to do without these pretty toys, so you can definitely survive without them.)<br>
<br>
Edit: Also I would recommend both of you if you take my advice about the Reishi, get to about level 17 or so and join or make a bandit group while you take on the reishi elder.  This is an excellent place to get experience, if a bit dangerous and gives you something to do in between the six minute or so reishi spawn.  And Eki... You're concerned about the strength?  I would keep them more for the Stamina bonus.  Strength really adds only a minimal effect, but we really tend to need our Stamina... though with that weapon's speed... maybe the bonus is counter productive *smile* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwyntercrystalbow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wynter Crystalbow</A> at: 2/1/02 10:54:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udjfang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DJFang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#660000>(2/1/02 12:47:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Moon Raid (x-post from Brothers board)</span><hr size=1> Wynter and Eki, I appreciate both of your comments immensely. I knew this would be a tough area and the spawn time long, but with the other monsters that appeared in that area, I thought it would more than compensate for the wait time with gained experience. If the 'shroom is as challenging as you both have said, then perhaps it would be more prudent to wait. I suppose my overzealouness to obtain some of these items may have gotten the better of my judgement.<br>
<br>
I have poked my head into the caverns from the Shadowhaven side, and have gone screaming like a young girl back into the saftey of the guards. Thankfully, I was alone and no one witnessed it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

When you hear the Eleusinians ripping someone to pieces, or you hear the Erinyes, then you'll know what the screams of women really portend.<br>

Women have higher pain thresholds anyway. . . . .why not scream like a boy who is being emasculated?<br>
