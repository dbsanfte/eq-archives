<br>
I have to admit, I find this a bit offensive.  Specifically the part about a hunger to know more.  Every day I read or reasearch something to try to prove myself wrong.  If science is greater than God, surely science can prove God wrong.  Every day I read more evidence to suggest one way or another on the existance of Intelligent Design, and it goes both ways.  I spend a lot of my spare time reading athiest theories and athiest research, because it would be a lot easier to not be a Christian.  I try every day to prove my beliefs wrong.  To suggest that Christians have no hunger to know more is to suggest ignorance on the part of Christians.  That is a blanket statement.  I will grant you that some Christians, and maybe a majority are ignorant.  But the same could be said about athiests.<br>
<br>
I have all the same things an athiest has on my side.<br>
<br>
The lack of a missing link in the fossil record and the world around us is suggestive of the theory that evolution does not occur by chance.  If it occured by chance or natural selection, then all around us would be evolutionary beings.  I reject the theory that evolution occurs in spurts and ends.  If humans evolved from monkeys because of natural influences, why do they not continue to evolve now?  I will grant that they possibly did evolve from Monkeys once.  But I believe that if they did it was due to Intelligent Design.<br>
<br>
There is no evidence of Athiesm.  There are no experimental results or repeatable observations that support Athiesm.  Argument, conjecture, and theory are all tools of the Theist and the Athiest alike.<br>
<br>
If you refuse to believe that God created the universe, then you have no choice but to believe that chance created the universe.  I find the possibility of the circumstances required for the Big Bang and the spontaneous generation of life to have occurred from non-living matter to be simply to slim.  My scientific mind tells me that the chances of such a thing happening are just outlandish.  Do the reasearch, based on probability, the chances of the Earth existing and creating life are approximated at 1/1(billion^8th zeros).  So I don't really find the concept of a diety that far fetched.  It seems more logical to me than rolling the dice and creating a life.<br>

<br>
It argues that the initial conditions of the universe that ultimately led to life on plant Earth could simply *not* be anything other than what they were. Written into physical laws of the universe are the initial conditions *for* those laws. Tiny changes in some of the &quot;constants&quot; which are present in our universe today (for example, if gravity was even slightly stronger, or the nuclear forces just a little weaker), there is every chance that the universe today would be nothing but charged particles of all sorts from one end to the other, even things even got that far. However, what if the initial conditions could not physically be anything than other than what they are? There is research and theories in this going on. Yes, it's fairly new, and yes it's definitely a &quot;fringe&quot; theory but that doesn't exclude it from having some bearing on the argument.<br>
<br>
The other option, the weak principle (or the strong, if I got the first one around the wrong way), is what you suggested Holdan - pure chance. And I'll agree - the human mind balks at the sheer improbability of everything happening to be just right for everything to exist as it does today. But is that a potential truth that might point to the existence of the &quot;Clock Maker&quot;, or merely something our brains are not all that well equipped to comprehend?<br>
<br>
Let me give you an example. Your average beach will have countless millions, upon millions, of grains of sand, all different in some tiny way - whether its weight, pigment, size, etc. Now, before you arrive at the beach, right down on a piece of a paper a description of a sand grain, listing all those things I just mentioned, and more. Make sure that the numbers are within reason for a grain of sand at that particular beach. Now, pick up a grain of sand at random from the beach. What are the chances that your grain of sand matches exactly what you wrote down? Pretty small yeah?<br>
<br>
Now reverse the process. Toss away your list, and pick up another grain of sand at random. Now measure all the characteristics of that grain. Then think &quot;what were the chances of me picking up a grain of sand that happened to have all the characteristics I just measured&quot;. It must have been a 1 in several *billion* chance, but you did it. You'll also realise it was the same chance as picking up a grain of sand that matched the descriptions you wrote down initially.<br>
<br>
Extended to our universe, the analogy shows that okay sure, the chance of the universe's initial conditions being *just* so to allow life to eventually evolve must have been an improbability staggeringly large - so large as to be utterly beyond comprehension. However, despite that, it obviously did happen, because otherwise *we wouldn't be here to talk about it*.<br>
<br>
Neither of the above two arguments require the existence of a creator, or intelligent director of some sort. That said, neither argument &quot;proves&quot; that one does not exist. An intelligent creator *could* have set those initial conditions just so, or nudged chance in the right direction. But there are attempts to show that an intelligent director is certainly not a requirement for the universe to exist as it does.<br>
<br>
And if the universe can exist without need for a &quot;creator&quot;, why cannot life be a result of the exact same arguments? That is, either life was an inevitable consequence from the moment the universe formed, or life got started here and there through just the right combination of conditions. Keep in mind that there are over 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, and millions of galaxies in the *observable* universe, let alone the parts of the universe from which or telescopes are not yet powerful enough to see. The telescopes and other tools we have these days are letting us find planets (gas giants, almost exclusively so far I think) around many of our nearest stars. Planets are looking more and more likely to be the rule around a star, rather than the exception. Given the extraordinary number of planets that exist within the universe, is it so impossible to believe that some managed to get just the right conditions for life? The universe bought a shit load of tickets in the lottery of life - its bound to win first division a few times at least =).<br>

<br>
I don't see how this analogy applies even in the slightest.  I grant you that we do exist so obviously something happened.  What I am arguing is the sheer improbability of such a thing occurring by chance.<br>
<br>
Let's extend your beach analogy.<br>
<br>
If I walk up to the beach and I see in the sand, the words &quot;BOBBY LOVES TAMMY&quot; scrawled across with a stick roughly the width of the lines of the lettering, I can assume one of two things -<br>
1)  That somehow the forces of the world combined just so to have the waves and wind in the area coincidentally make the sand appear to have that look to it.<br>
<br>
2)  Someone (presumably Bobby) came across and wrote that in the sand.<br>
<br>
To me, the idea of life and the universe and myself existing based solely on chance is about as preoposterous at theory 1.  When I am forced to make a decision between two different hypothesis for how something happened, I chose the one that requires the smallest leap of faith.  I myself tend to find it more plausible that the sheer complexity of the creation of the universe and of biological matter is indicative of that fact that it's NOT something that happened by chance.  Just because I can't see the guy who wrote the words in the sand doesn't mean that he was never there.  And that seems a lot more reasonable than chance.<br>
<br>
I believe in the theory you suggested - things had to be just so for the universe to exist.  However, my belief is that the physical laws that govern the universe and life around us were set by Intelligent Design.  In a car, the timing of the cylinders firing has to be exact, otherwise your engine will stop running.  Is it reasonable to assume that the timing is set by a mechanic or that the timing exists because it is what was meant for the motor?  I argue that the mechanic set the timing BECAUSE it was meant for the motor.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to convert you, and in fact, that's not my motivation for writing this.  But if you ask a question, I'm going to answer.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the chances of the universe spontaneously existing because of a mathematical formula requiring precisely the right forces at the right time is too slim to be chance.  Therefore, I agree that these constants were programmed into the nature of existance.  I simply argue that there was someone doing the programming.<br>

It was most certainly not aimed at people (religious or otherwise) who are actually able to show that they have believe as they do because of &quot;x, y and z&quot;. Maybe its wrong, but I will respect a person who can back up their position regardless of whether or not I agree with said position.<br>
<br>
I actually hate the word atheist, because I feel it is just as baseless a position as theism. I honestly cannot think of a single theory of creation, big bang, evolution, and so on that explicitly denies the existence of a creator. None of them *require* the existance of one, but that is not the same as denial. An aethist who claims that god does not exist is as much at the mercy of the challenge &quot;Okay, prove it&quot; as the theist who claims that god does exist.<br>
<br>
What I personally &quot;believe&quot; (again, I hate using the word because it almost implies accepting without proof, but it will suffice) is that there is *not* an intelligent designer or creator responsible for the universe and everything we see in it. However, that position by no means excludes the possibility of there being some sort of higher power or being. I just don't see one as necessary for the universe and life to exist. I &quot;believe&quot; as I do because I accept the evidence put forward to argue for a universe without a need for a designer. For the same reason, I am well and truly on the fence when it comes to the issue of the actual existence of a higher power - because I don't see *any* proof, either way. For that reason, I consider myself an agnostic, not an atheist.<br>

But improbable simply means that - its improbable, not impossible. Improbable, by definition, means that it *can* happen. And even scientists that believe the second theory but agree that the chances are just too remote have put forward other explanations.<br>
<br>
For example, the Big Bang/Big Crunch cycle. Every time the universe &quot;expands&quot; in the Big Bang, it eventually &quot;collapses&quot; in a Big Crunch. There are even attempts using string theory to show that a universe that was collapsing in on itself actually reaches a point where all the inward speed &quot;rebounds&quot; when everything is packed into the size of a string, thus giving you your next big bang. The theory goes that at each moment of big bang, the initial conditions are randomly chosen, and the universe expands under those conditions. Now, under this theory, there would most likely be an absolute shitload of bloody useless universes that would contain nothing more interesting than photons, but eventually, statistically speaking, you would be increasingly likely to get a universe where the conditions were right for life. This theory removes the &quot;too improbable&quot; element - it almost goes back to the &quot;inevitable&quot; argument - it just takes alot longer =).<br>
<br>
There are other theories that talk about our universe simply being one among countless universe. These ideas are based on property of quantum mechanics that *suggets* all possible states that could possibly exist, do exist, but each exists within a separate &quot;universe&quot;. Following this line of thought, it says that if even one combination of initial conditions allows life to eventually exist, then at the moment of creation, a universe for every possible combination of initial conditions is created. Therefore, life existing is again inevitable, despite the huge improbabilities involved.<br>
<br>
Now, those theories I just mentioned are waaaay out there, and frankly, full of holes you could drive a medium sized galaxy through, but that aside, it shows that are possibilities for the &quot;random&quot; element to not be an issue. Who knows, maybe one of these ideas, perhaps even one not yet raised, will actually be the right one =). I don't put alot of stock in that happening though.<br>
<br>
Honestly though, I don't buy into the random argument either. I also go with the inevitable nature of the universe. As I said in a previous post though, I accept the theories that suggest the required initial conditions do not need to be set but that they are an inevitable consequence of the nature of the universe. I'll admit that this appeals to my very strong sense of order and simplicity. I agree with the idea, that at its most fundamental level, nature, the universe, whatever you want to call it is *simple*, and its through the interactions of huge numbers of simple things, that complex things are possible (holistic ideas, complexity theories (which is what chaos theories grew up to be) and so on). So instead of needing physical laws plus initial conditions for everything to work out as it has, the laws alone are enough, because that is simpler.<br>

<br>
If this universe was NOT created or directed by a higher force, what have we really proven as far as this origin?  Why does matter exist?  Because of the laws of Nature and the Universe?  Why do these laws exist?  When was there not Matter, and when did reality begin?<br>
<br>
In the human mind the questions are all of the same key, though small details are changed.  Every theology or atheology requires at some point either an &quot;I don't know&quot; or an &quot;Um, because.&quot;  It seems uninformed to think that the God who created the universe has always existed, surely all things have a beginning.  But if the universe was NOT created, and is naturally occuring, use the laws of science regarding matter and energy to explain to me where either came from.  The problem is, you can't.  I can't explain where God came from or who made him, just as an athiest can't explain where matter came from.<br>
<br>
It's the same hole in any theology, and I don't hesitate to tell you that I don't KNOW for sure.  I BELIEVE that He has always existed, and that's the way it is.  And no, I can't say that I really fathom that belief.<br>
<br>
I never claimed that I had all of the answers, I'm just claiming that no religion or lack of religion does.<br>

Your green ideology has colored your views on success.  You have bought the anti-capitalist anti-growth propoganda of the left, and are beyond help.<br>

&quot;Au contraire, my good main, I would very much be tempted to argue that in terms of living in stable society that can exist millenia upon millenia without ever causing its own inevitable collapse, the Native Americans, Aborigines, etc. etc. were far more successful than this westernized world we all pretty much live in now. &quot;<br>

If they were so successful, why has the public chosen the western path?<br>

Without the antibiotic, the population thrives and all kinds of bacteria are reproduced.  When in the presence of this antibiotic, those without the resistance die, and those that resist the antibiotic continue to reproduce unhindered.  Pretty soon, if the bacteria continue in this environment, the whole population of bacteria will have become resistant to the antibiotic.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that bacteria do NOT reproduce/ exchange genetic material sexually, so the gene remains relatively intact (minus mutations) throughout conjugation.  Now, one or two bacteria could transform a dead, non-resistant bacterium's gene for not having antibiotic resistance, but a load of good that would do them. <p>View <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=130889>Tarj's Stuff</a> or view

The global public didn't chose it.  A group of the select few who used war and exploitation as means to their benefit, subjugated a vast majority of the world under the Western/Christian dogma/philosophy.  The fact is that the vast majority of the global public didn't chose the western path - they were beaten into submission to serve it through colonialism and conquests.<br>
<br>
Exploitation of the South America by the Portuegese and the Spanish with eventual subjugation of the local populace under a Christian banner through &quot;missionary work&quot; which amounted to nothing more than brainwashing.<br>
<br>
Exploitation of Central America by the Dutch, Spanish and Portuegese by plundering those civilizations and murdering opposition and setting up slave colonies.<br>
<br>
Exploitation of North America by French and British leads to almost a complete annihilation of the huge Native American culture.  Whatever is left of it is just remnants huddled in reservations and in poverty.<br>
<br>
Exploitation of Western coast of Africa by almost every European nation with a navy from the 1500's to 1800's that propagates centuries of slave trade and endorses the African tribes to fight amongst themselves for the sole purpose of capturing slaves to sell to the Europeans.<br>
<br>
Forcing the western lifestyle and laws upon nations after World War II (Japan) whose cultures are radically different from the Western World.<br>
<br>
Oppression of the Aborigenese in Australia.<br>
<br>
Five crusades to reclaim Jerusalem from the &quot;Infidels&quot;<br>
