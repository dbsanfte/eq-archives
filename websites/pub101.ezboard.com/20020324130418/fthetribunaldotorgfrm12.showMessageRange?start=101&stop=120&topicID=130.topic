- They got chucked out of Paradise.<br>
- The moronic idea of original sin originated from this event, but I don't know if it is really documented in the bible, or if it was an invented dogma, to enforce/justify infant baptism?<br>
- Women's childbirth would be painful. <br>
- The snake was punished, and would be forced to crawl on its belly and eat dust, heh. A bit like the folkelore stories about how the tiger got his stripes etc. Wonder how the snakes in Paradise used to get around prior to this punishment? I kinda see them going vertical and bounce around like a pogo stick, perhaps hanging out with Tigger or soemthing. <br>
- I think I'm missing something, was there some specific punishment for males, something about women always giving them a hard time or something (I know, this sounds a tad chauvenistic, but its not like the Bible would win Oprah's book club pick of the month). <br>

It merely means, I think.&quot;<br>
My quote, &quot;Cogito, despite your name, you are a fucking idiot.&quot;  applies to &quot;I think.&quot;  That name would characterize you as a thinker,  which is in contrast to a &quot;fucking idiot,&quot; therefore the use of the word &quot;despite&quot; still holds. <br>
<br>
&quot;- The bible does say, in the case of Abraham, that he did need to kill his only son, on direct order from God.&quot;<br>
Did Abraham kill his son?  No.  What God told Abraham in a test is not the same as what the bible tells us.  Ergo, I was indeed correct when i said, and i qoute myself, &quot;Nothing in the bible or christianity says you need to go out and drown your kids.&quot;  Where &quot;you&quot; is referring to a modern day christian.  <br>
<br>
You will also note that Abraham had to have known that both he and his son would walk off that mountain alive, since Isaac was to be ancestor of the savior, which would be impossible for him if he were dead, since at that point he had no children.  Would you like to try again cogito?<br>
<br>
&quot;- I think you do not fully understand the meaning of the word hypocrite. It means to pretend to hold a view or an opinion -- in particular, virtuous ones -- which one does not. A preacher giving a sermon about the evils of prostitution, yet using their services – that would be hypocrisy. Speaking up about something that one has been silent about, is not hypocrisy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hypocrisy, from dictionary.com:<br>
&quot;The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness. &quot;<br>
You profess to usually remain silent on this subject. <br>
You are not remianing silent.<br>
While it may not be the perfect example, it fits close enough.  If it does not fall directly under the first part, it does fall under falseness. <br>
<br>
&quot;- Methologically = methodologically, misspelled.&quot;<br>
I do not think you meant to use the word methodologically,  i think what you really mean is methodically.<br>
<br>
The story of Abraham and Isaac, while interesting, is most definatly not &quot;one of the most important episode of the bible,&quot; since the old testament is irrelevant, the Gospel is the important part for a Christian.<br>
<br>
So in summary, we have:<br>
1 count of a misspelled, misused word.<br>
1 count of not understanding a biblical story you used in your argument<br>
1 count of not understanding the religion which you are bashing<br>
<br>
Camthan, you missed it again.  Reread what i was replying to, and then apply my quote.  You might understand it the next time through.<br>

<br>
Heratio:<br>
&quot;Christianity today is absurd. Nothing but ceremonial nonsense(sic).<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yes, Dumai, you spelled nonsense wrong</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The average person today has no clue what they believe and why. They say they're &quot;christians&quot; just to have something to belong to. They couldn't care less about knowing what their religion actually taught, or about following the teachings, which is why so many people have a general distaste for christianity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, 16 full years of wisdom all rolled in to 1 moronic statement. Did your dad give you all these wonderfully false bits of nonesense? Oops, NM that last part. Some people may not understand every part of the bible and still be christians. The Gospel is not hard at all to understand, and that is the only part that really matters. For you to come here and tell people what the average christian believes is incredibly pretentious and incredibly ludicrous. When you get out into the world, and actually meet some Christians, your preconceptions will be shattered, if you actually open your eyes.<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What heratio said-There is a lot of ceremony in christianity that makes no sense. A lot of &quot;christians&quot; classify themselves as christians to belong. These people know near to nothing about the religion, but they preach it anyway, to belong. Did I miss anything major?<br>
<br>
What dumai said:Heratio is a doody head. You don't have to understand the whole bible to get the gist of it. Old testament means nothing, new testament means everything. You can't say anything about the average christian because you have never met one in your life. You try to be cool ripping on christians, but you are mad (crazy mad, not angry mad) Did I miss anything?<br>
<br>
What Camthan said: blah blah yada yada blah blah yada yada. But there was a point in there. For you to say Horatio can't comment about what the average christian believes is not a valid point. I have, and I am sure Horatio has, dealt with the &quot;average christian,&quot; and quite a bit at that. We know how they act, and we know the mindless drivel they spew forth. They DO claim to be christian, and classify themselves as christians to fit in, and they put down other people, and &quot;spread their faith&quot; by telling people they will go to hell, to get other people like themselves to notice them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, O Great One, how did I misinterpret that? If I did, tell me.

<br>
Dumai is correct on this one.  There is a wealth of geneological research that has been done that shows that not only Christ was an actual person who was possibly crucified roughly at 33 A.D. (The belief of whether he was divine or not shall be left to theologians, not historians) but that his bloodline actually survived the test of time and possibly became the founding bloodline of the Carolingian/Meringovian monarchy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;They are not gods, but they are no longer animals. One of the htings that eprate ourselves from animals, is that we are conscious of our selves. In fact, some significant Mormon leaders have gone as far as to state that Satan did a good deed, when he convinced Eve to eat from the tree.&quot; --Cogito<br>
<br>
Cogs, you sound like you just read Rousseau's Treatise on Inequality of Man with which I mostly agree  =P.  Humans are not just animals.  Humans are the link between the rest of corporeal matter (plants, animals, rocks, etc.) and non-corporeal matter.  I dont believe in a single god, I do believe that there is some sort of spirituality and more evolved beings than us whom might seem like gods to us.<br>

Which means that even if God existed, even if the mystery cloaked a truth, even if Zosime were right, Ivan would not admit that truth should be paid for by evil, suffering, and the death of innocents. Ivan incarnates the refusal of salvation. Faith leads to immortal life, but faith presumes the acceptance of the mystery and of evil and of resignation to injustice. The man who is prevented by the suffering of children from accepting faith will certainly not accept eternal life. Under these conditions, even if eternal life existed, Ivan would refuse it. He rejects this bargain. He would only accept grace unconditionally and that is why he makes his own conditions. Rebellion wants all or nothing. 'All the knowledge in the world is not worth a child's tears.' Ivan does not say that there is no truth. He says that if truth does exist it can only be unacceptable. Why? Because it is unjust.&quot;<br>

Bit out of context but still a nice passage...from &quot;the Rebel&quot; by Camus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udumai01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hi, I'm Brad Majors</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/27/01 5:58:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fucking Jesusfreaks</span><hr size=1> You still don't get it, do you Camthan.  I will attempt to spell it out for you.<br>
<br>
Camthan:<br>
&quot;They DO claim to be christian, and classify themselves as christians to fit in, and they put down other people.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is the part i have a problem with, which is a paraphrase of what Heratio said.  For one thing, if a person is a Christian only to fit in, then that person is not a Christian at all, ergo that person cannot be the &quot;average Christian.&quot;  <br>
<br>
According to the United States Census, 89% of the population over 18 in the united states is Christian (61% Protestant, 28% Catholic).  I sincerely doubt that 9 out of 10, (or even 4 out of 10) people you meet attempts to convert you.  And if less that 4 of 10 people is trying to force their beliefs on you, then you are wrong when you say the average christian is doing this.  Thank You, have a nice day.<br>

<br>
However, your argument about them not being christians at all was nullified by me putting quotation marks around &quot;christian&quot; and saying &quot;call themselves&quot; before christians.<br>
<br>
And, believe it or not, Camthan, I have very rarely had anyone spew their beliefs at me.  I was apart of a church that did that, therefore I was doing it.  I hate it, I have always hated it but I couldn't not (yes I know double negatives can suck my cock) do it because it clearly says in the Bible that you're supposed to do it.  I have a feeling that Dumai read my post with the wrong tone in his mind.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I probably missed some shit but I don't care.<br>

But could you please tell me where those passages are though, the bear and 40 kids, and god's bet? I'm not doubting you, I'd just like to know where it is... <br>
<br>
Merton, I've never read Rousseau, and I obviously dunno what the writer truly had in mind when writing that bit, but it does seem like a plausible metaphor. <br>
<br>
Now, I have no doubt that Jesus did exist as a person, but your claim about there being <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;...a wealth of geneological research...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not only of him being crucified, but of his bloodline surviving -- what do you base THAT on? How can there be geneological research, when there is nothing left of Christ, to compare with? Is this the rubbish out of Holy Blood, Holy Grail? I would really like to know. There is only one single mention of Jesus, outside the bible. Just one. That's like you doing a search in a newspaper archive and finding one single reference to Ghandi. <br>
<br>
Jesus wasn't unique. He was one of many who rebelled against Rome. So few seem to realize what crusifiction was: a punishment given for one specific crime: rebellion against Rome. How many Christians know that? How many Christians wonder why the hell two thieves were crucified? And how many wonder why only one of the gospels bothered mentioning those two thieves, since it was a rather significant event? Hell, none of the gospels even agree as to what Jebus said when he died, or even who found the empty grave. <br>
<br>
Didya know what the really shocking thing about the Black Sea scrolls was? That the cult who wrote it had their own Jesus. Yup! Different bunch of people, different place, and this dude used the same parables, phrases, even the Son of Man titles that Jesus used sometimes. It's a fucking franchise, you see. Like Starbucks or Chucky Cheese. Like David Koresh or Jim Jones. The jews got it right again, joo f3wls. <br>
