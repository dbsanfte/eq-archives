If they give up, Connovar wins, and he has set the precedant for the server regarding conflict resolution.  He sets an example for the rest of the server's guildleaders; proving that if you ignore a problem ( fuckup, bad call, whatever ) it will just go away.  Which we all know is a bunch of bullshit.  The only way to solve a conflict between oposing factions, religions, governments, and guilds is through all out war.  And the flameboard is the battlefield!  <br>

But if you guys wanna stand on the field sharpening your spears and waste your time waiting for him...that's your perrogative.<br>
<br>
The whole thing was just an example of 2 guilds who are very similar in power (although it's obvious that Trans THINKS they are superior), going after mostly the same mobs, and butting heads.  As well as some problems with communication between guilds.<br>
<br>
Now I ask you this...is there still a rotation?  If there is how can it peacefully maintain itself with EV or Comps able to walk in whenever they want and foul it up?  Nobody seems to have a problem with that.  <br>
<br>
Bear in mind I am NOT a spokesman for my guild...these are just my personal opinions.  But more than one guild here has probably seen that at times EV will do whatever they want reguardless...(funny how thier sabotage of our Yelinak attempt never hit the flameboard, and Estevan didn't call Connovar a chicken about that)<br>
<br>
I see alot of  people with huge fucking crosses on thier backs that should have been gone long ago.  Seems like you got yours built and ready to haul Unnone.  Try to remember, it's just a game, and sometimes things don't go the way they were planned.  When people get overly obsessed with one thing is when more mistakes happen.<br>

<br>
Yes there is a rotation, And yes, its still maintained with EV/Comps able to walk in whenever they want. This is because in the rotation, we aggreed that any guild that doesnt want to join the rotation that CAN and HAS proved they belong in NToV can/will walk in at any time. If this happens, whatever guilds turn it was gets the next week. The rotation isnt perfect, and it never will be.<br>
<br>
They dont get flamed for it because WTF would be the point? Thats just telling one guild they cant go someplace that they have already proven themselves able to do. Legendary took flak for doing what they did because they had never proved they could handle NToV (and displayed they couldnt while in there also). Prolly got more flak then you should have, but we thought you woulda been able to kill more  . instead it just ended up as slowing us down from finishing our work, and just denying us 2 dragons /shrug.<br>
<br>
EV/Comps proved (first ones in) they can do NToV, had been in a rotation for a LONG time, and have basically moved on. The threat is minor, but its still there. Nothing we can do about it. <br>

Trans went and killed him, admitteldy after him being up for only 24.<br>
<br>
Therefore...we were denied a shot at it.<br>

Not making this up...every single word of that is taken from the Thread where this was hashed over before.<br>

If there were 6 guilds in the rotation, it'd be a bitch to maintain. The fact that EV and Comps both avoid TOV is half the reason it works.<br>
<br>
So if we occasionally run in and clear as much as we feel like, noone's really pissed off-- they'd really rather have that than see us keep farming TOV on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
I think last week was the first time we've done TOV since EV and us bowed out of the rotation... which was a while ago now.<br>
