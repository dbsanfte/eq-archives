The facts do speak for themselves.  Bush and the CIA have information that we don't know and you arent willing to place some trust into figuring that it must be enough information to be sure that we need to do what we are doing eh?  Yea, good one.  It still goes to show that you put more faith in the rest of the world than in a government that has truly tried over and over to create a better world.  And why do I have to hunt you down on 5 different threads to keep you in check?<br>
<br>
Btw, do you even have a nice way to be able to disarm Iraq and make it no longer a threat other than the way Bush is handling it now?  Because France, Germany, and Russia all don't.  Seriously, they don't.  That was proven with the history that has been laid.  You can't even argue for France.  Who was it, Chile?, a country came up with a great plan for a resolution...unfortunately that will never be accepted because it places Hussein into a sure lose situation-one that is necessary of course.  If you do have a way, you should tell the president, because until you-or someone-shows another better way to do it...your view means nothing.<br>

Perfect example:  WW2 AND the Holocaust both collectively.  Nobody thought Germany would invade again, that they just wanted their dignity back.  Nobody thought that Germany was really creating genocide in mass amounts....NOT EVEN DURING THE ENTIRE WAR.  Nobody was able to verify or believe it until they saw the mass graves of actions that were already committed.  Learn from the past.  Take action pre-emptively.

Perhaps you don't know about the 20,000 American dollars awarded by Hussein to any family of a suicide bomber?  Even if you don't buy that...what makes you think a man with less power and money than Hussein is a threat to the U.S. than Hussein himself, who also hates the U.S?  As long as the U.S. prevents him from dominating the entire middle east, he won't like us.  The only thing that stops him from making a direct attack on the US is military technology and might, which can EASILY be gotten with enough time.  Germany, again, is a perfect example of that.  In 1920 the country was in complete ruin and without an army.  By 1933 they had a full army, and by 1938 an army large enough to conquer the entire world-had it been used correctly.  15 years...ruins to great empire...and Saddam could be given that amount of time.<br>

It did? Where?  /em looks around....sees no containment working.  Remember? We tried that.  Didn't work.  Inspectors got booted out.  BTW Hussein will not agree to allowing inspectors to be guarded and allowed to go where ever they please whenever they choose.  He completely rejected a &quot;serious and vigorous inspection team&quot;.  You didn't catch that?  It was one of those many many negotiation talks that went down the drain.  He won't even allow more than one surveillance plane over his country at any point in time, even though he agreed to allow any number in.  The ONLY inspections team he has allowed in was under the agreement that they were not protected, and that they were told where they could search.<br>

Actually, I can verify that your statement here is 100% false.  Russia was on the verge of collapse.  After the cold war ended we found out that Russia was indeed not nearly the threat that we thought it was.  Never during the cold war did they have any naval ships close enough to our shorelines to affect us, and only one submarine capable of launching nukes at any one time.  Now, given that one submarine of nukes woulda hurt...its not enough to destroy a country.  Russia's military force would have been annhiliated within only a few months and the country would easily have been taken over.  Thats fact...based on information about all of Russia's military might and social/economic problems.<br>

Well, your stats are horribly wrong.  Its not 2, its at least 18 or 19 (just from NATO alone) and a great many more.  But yea, you are right that it doesn't matter one wit, because it doesn't.  And yep, the US knows best.  And yep, all the rest are immoral, pacifist, irrelevant, or stupid yep...but you forgot &quot;corrupt&quot; such as France and Germany, who have alternate motives that are not &quot;good&quot; motives.<br>
<br>
As for your post of that whole email...yea tell that to the Kurds! lol!  Thats hilarious.  They are a people persecuted much like the Jews...told that they have no homeland.  Russia, Turkey, and Iraq all are to blame for killing Kurdish people. <br>
<br>
Actually, I just read further more of your post, and in it you are openly admitting to the mass murder of Kurds by Iraq...you should watch what you post for your argument!  The one thing that both sides arguing in it agree on is that there were attacks in which 100s of Kurds were killed at a time...compound the fact that they don't talk about every attack that ocurred and you get that into the 1000s very easily.<br>
<br>
Anyways, general conclusion from reading all that you posted is...the person that is pro-&quot;genocide ocurred&quot; has a much stronger argument than the interrogater who continually kept giving deceptive questions in which the responder had to correct his questions to answer them correctly.  This is a serious warning sign that the questioner is doing all he can to fish for a mistake to be given so that he can make an argument.  Your post overwhelmingly helps my argument, and hurts yours-sorry guy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 750<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/18/03 10:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=501.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's Official</span><hr size=1> &gt;you arent willing to place some trust <br>

Given the CIA track record of clusterfucks around the world in the past decades, no i won't take anything at face value. Their case was so strong that  the security council was about to vote the US resolution down, veto or not, had it not been pulled out at the last minute.<br>
<br>
&gt;you put more faith in the rest of the world than in a government that has truly tried over and over to create a better world.<br>
<br>
yep trading drugs to finance the arming of Contras made the world a better place. dropping napalm on vietnamese villagers to &quot;save them&quot; made the world a better place. this government, like any others, acts primarily in its own interests and has blood on its hands just like any other. and oh yeah... we have been waiting on Kuweit's election returns for 11 years. people are still cheering since their &quot;liberation&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;do you even have a nice way to be able to disarm Iraq and make it no longer a threat<br>
<br>
newsflash : for the last 11 years he's never -been- a threat to anyone else but his own people. hello weapons of mass distraction...<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Thats because you don't know the middle east and its history.<br>
<br>
but of course you do... thanks for making sure we noticed.<br>
<br>
&gt;and realize that he is very ready to sacrifice.<br>
<br>
huh huh. So for 20 years or so, Saddam is the best buddy the US can buy. He then once tries to grab a piece of Kuweit and now he is a maniac bent on world domination. In case you had not noticed, he has not bothered anyone in 12 years. Why would he suicide when he's sitting on the second biggest oil stockpile in the world ? He's been trying to bend over for 4 years to get the sanctions lifted. <br>
<br>
&gt;Learn from the past. Take action pre-emptively.<br>
<br>
Yeah... Iraq is the rising power in the world. The second poorest nation is going to go on a rampage with the &quot;axis of evil&quot; and subjugate the world under genocidal domination. Riiiight. You sure know how to pick a valid comparison. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;what makes you think a man with less power and money than Hussein is a threat to the U.S. than Hussein himself, who also hates the U.S?<br>
<br>
there's one thing called coherence. try it in some of your posts sometimes...<br>

&gt;As long as the U.S. prevents him from dominating the entire middle east, he won't like us.<br>
<br>
not liking you is a crime now ? <br>
<br>
&gt;The only thing that stops him from making a direct attack on the US is military technology and might, which can EASILY be gotten with enough time.<br>
<br>
well... it sure is easier when Uncle Sam does home deliveries with bonus giftwraps. in the meantime, now that he's on his own, there is this little thing called MAD that prevented the USSR and the US to get at each other's throat for 50 years. <br>
<br>
&gt;Germany, by 1933 they had a full army, and by 1938 an army large enough to conquer the entire world-had it been used correctly.<br>
<br>
SS armed with Remington rifles, panzers from Polish iron from US owned factories, funds funneled from NY through Holland... hmmm do i see a pattern here ?<br>
<br>
&gt;Seriously, we have so much information about the destruction of the Kurds that you really can't make that argument without being laughed at. <br>
<br>
i'll just point you to the fact that the Kurds have been massacred by Turkey and Iran just as happily... since no one wants of a Kurdistan sitting on top of oil fields.<br>
<br>
&gt;Inspectors got booted out<br>
<br>
Trying to rewrite history aren't we ? They weren't booted, they were pulled out by the US.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;And thats a good thing.<br>
<br>
Yeah... those people tend to get the fascist label though. but you seem to like clicking your boots, so i wouldn't want to deprive you.<br>

Well shit, someone better get out a pen.  We're gonna be adding a whole lotta names to the Axis of Evil.  Who's next?<br>

Saddam couldn't build up enough of a military to threaten anyone so long as the entire world is eyeing like a hawk, and he's constantly on the run from weapons inspectors.<br>

If he booted them out (again), swift action would be justified.  That said, this is idle talk at this point - let's just hope this ends might f'ing quickly before our travel industry finishes the collapse it started on 9/11.<br>
<br>
or do you think that the failure of our airlines and hotel industry will be a GOOD thing for this economy? (or is it just a leading indicator...)  I couldn't be more worried about my future as someone trying to eek out a nice life in the post-Bush economy... this war of his will be the catalyst to something they'll talk about later like we talk about the 10+ years of the great depression. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 443<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/18/03 11:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=501.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's Official</span><hr size=1> <br>

No?  Nievety at it again.  Did you not just read what I said?  As long as the US denies him the ability to rule an entire area (for just reasons such as not allowing his evilness to prevail on helpless subjects) he will keep the US on his enemy list.  Just because he hasnt led an actual attack on the US (which is obviously in his advantage or else he would get crushed) doesnt mean he isnt a threat.  Leave him be, let him grow strong, and see who the hell is right about whether or not he is a &quot;threat&quot;.  <br>

BUAHAHA ok.  A country that is so anti-drug and you claim they are pro-drug...yea.  The best part is you mention Vietnam, which is an area of study that I'm currently doing.  Its too bad that simply saying &quot;dropping napalm that killed people liberates them&quot; isn't nearly so simple when you take it into context of what was happening at that time.  Thats like taking a part of the Bible that says &quot;there is no god&quot; (which btw the Bible DOES say that) and placing it as an argument to say that the Bible says there is no god (if you have read the Bible, you would know that the context then goes to say something along the lines of a man is a fool if he believes there is no god).  Napalm may have killed a lot of civilians, it also dealt crushing blows to the N. Vietnamese.  Another example is to say that *had* the US bombed the death camps they would have been killing thousands and thousands of innocent lives during WW2.  Its one of the lousiest arguments you could give really.<br>

Yes, I do.  A COMPLETE history back until the tribal years (the middle east mostly consisted of tribes even when many other places of the world were civilized due to the extreme desert conditions.

Because I have such a complete knowledge of their history, religious, culture, political and all! that you can gain so much from my vast well!  <br>

<br>
Perhaps because he just lost a major war and needed time to rebuild???  Come on, quit being nieve.  You keep trying to say that he hasn't done anything because he doesn't actually want to do anything...and thats so far from the truth.  He hasn't done anything because he doesn't have the capability *yet* (keyword is YET).  The fact that each time he has had an army large enough he has attacked someone doesn't ring a bell to you that he wants to fight?<br>

That statement was completely coherent, maybe you should learn how to read instead.<br>

<br>
not liking you is a crime now ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did I say crime? no.  I gave a legitimate reason to see him as a threat.  Not liking us = leads to terrorism or other means of causing us grief.<br>

<br>
I think so...and hopefully you see the connection with Hussein's attempts to upgrade his military as well; Hence why we are preventing that now.  See a pattern here?  Why do you think he wants his oil reserves opened up?  Certainly not to help his people! BUAHAHA.  good one.  You have no evidence to show that he wants to help his people and indeed TONS of evidence to show that its exactly the opposite case.  You have to show evidence that he wants to do that before you can go assuming that he will if given the chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&gt;Inspectors got booted out<br>
<br>
Trying to rewrite history aren't we ? They weren't booted, they were pulled out by the US.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
NO NO NO they were KICKED OUT.  They were FORCED out and Clinton did nothing about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>in case you can't read : he's talking about public opinion<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No no, he did not say public opinion.  Public opinion was a different part of his argument...here it is pretty clear he meant governments in particular.  Regardless of the fact, its not worth arguing about because public opinion means nothing firstly, and secondly public opinion is split 50/50 throughout the world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So hating the US makes him a threat?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yep, when it means that he is willing to fund terrorism and even plan attacks if it were possible.  Again, it takes a little of the knowledge of their history and culture to understand what I am talking about...but of course you can't possibly conceive of someone being bent on causing other people harm just because he wants to out of hatred.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Saddam couldn't build up enough of a military to threaten anyone so long as the entire world is eyeing like a hawk<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
LOLOLOL yea, I guess that kinda takes....a little eyeing doesn't it?  You wanna be the one to sit post and watch everything that goes on until the man dies?  pffft.  I mean, we haven't even started eyeing him like a hawk yet...NOT EVEN YET!!!!  We have yet to eye him like a hawk...wanna know why?  Because he directs the inspectors, allows them to go to certain places.  They never had control!  They always had to give warnings as to where they were going, while supervised for each visit.  We have yet to even set an eye on them.<br>
<br>
Ya know, so far I haven't seen anything that shows evidence for a counter argument to what I have said.  I mean, so far its all just opinions.  Your opinion is only as strong as my opinion that French is sitting behind Hussein this very moment going &quot;pssst, you need to let up a little weaponry, give them some bait, and buy some time.  They will take those missiles like fish in a stocked pond.  If you give them those, then they will think they are making progress and we can hold out long enough to get you your nukes.&quot;  I have no evidence for it, its just my opinion, and its just as strong as anything you have shown so far.  Unfortunately for you I'm not backing my opinion, but instead stuff that has evidence and has logical prediction.  You can base your beliefs off of hope if you want.  I base mine off of previous behavior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=501.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=501.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=501.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=501.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=501.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=501.topic&index=65><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=501.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=501.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=501.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to receive email notification of replies</a><br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=501.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a><br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
