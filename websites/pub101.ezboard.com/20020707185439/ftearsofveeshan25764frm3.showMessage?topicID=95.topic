Many sounds of chatting and laughter can be heard inside.  A furred face peeks through and suveys the scene before her.  All around are many people of many races.  But Drizle spots no Vah Shir.  She hesitates a moment.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe this was a bad idea.  I could very well be mistaken.  But then again what if what the others said is true...I must ask&quot;<br>
<br>
Drizle straightens up and enters the guildhall just as a warrior of the Vah Shir should, proudly.  Several people stop their talking to look at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear,&quot; she thinks,&quot;I hope they like Vha Shir, I dont think I could take on this many poeple.&quot;<br>
<br>
   She then notices a high elf woman coming towards her, followed by another.  They carry themselves with confidence and seem to exude a power all their own. <br>
   The mark on Drizle's palm sends a sensation through her arm.  She starts a bit, until today the only thing she had felt from that blasted mark was pain.  Now it is warm and almost soothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello,&quot; says one of the High elf women,&quot; I am Solarianne, this,&quot; she gestures to the robed woman next to her,&quot;is Ennya.  Do not fear, you are among friends.  What has lead you to our guildhall this eve?&quot; she gestures to a nearby table, Drizle follows their lead and sits, wrapping her tail around to rest on her lap.<br>
<br>
Drizle eyes Solarianne and Ennya warily, but the warm pulse in her hands only gets stronger, as if the mark itself was trying to reassure her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have come seeking answers to a puzzle.  The name of your guild caused my brain to turn and think about something other than killing.  When I was born,  i had a strange mark on my palm.  The elders called it a blessing,  while their apprentices felt certain it was a curse.  <br>
   When I was still quite young, a pain began to grow in my hand.  It spread through my arm and caused me never ending misery.   <br>
          One day, while I was wandering outside of Shar Vahl, i came upon a rusty sword.  It was nothing special, but i felt compelled to pick it up, after all, someone could get hurt if they stepped on it.  The mark on my hand burned even greater when i touched it.  I started to quiver with anticipation,  all my hair was stood on end, and i felt sudden and immediate danger.  <br>
         Just then a juvenile rockhopper jumped on my back.  Normally they are kept away from the borders city , but this one had slipped in unnoticed.  <br>
         I managed to shake him off and gave him a good swat with my free paw.  He tumbled head over heels and before he could regain his footing I brought the old sword straight down upon his head.  He let out a screech and then fell silent.  Then, I noticed something..the pain in my arm had gone.  I dropped the sword and looked at the mark of my birth.  I could clearly see now that it was a tear.  It pulsed with a warm glow, and slowly, pulse by pulse the glow faded, and the pain returned.<br>
    Please tell me,&quot; Drizle said her eyes beginning to glaze over with unwarriorlike tears,&quot;do you know what this mark could mean, and if you do, how can i be rid of it.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umoline.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/02 9:15:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello, I am Drizle</span><hr size=1> Moline packs away her lute for the night..  tired and weary from the song requests that have been coming in steady all evening...

Moline gets her elven wine and goes to sit down at the table with the three who look deep into conversation<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope it's okay I sit down and talk with you all.  You look so upset I couldn't help but notice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moline sits down and listens to the story Drizle has to tell.<br>
<br>
&quot;well dear kitty it seems you have come to the right place.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moline notices the tears in Drizle's eyes clear up some.  <br>
<br>
&quot;you see Drizle we are all marked with a similar mark. &quot;  Moline shows Drizle the mark she has on her ankle.  It's somewhat faded but very distinct in it's tear shape.  &quot;I was born with mine.  It becomes very bright when dragons are near!&quot;<br>
<br>
Drizle looks at Moline's birthmark with astonishment.  &quot;so what does this all mean?&quot;, Drizzle says.<br>

<br>
Talcee looks around and sees that it is late, but that Moline, Solarianne, and Ennya are speaking with a vah shir.  As she approaches, she hears ennya say, &quot;Tell us more of your adventures Drizle.&quot;<br>

It begins to reflect her uneasiness by twitching at the tip.  She controls her composure and tries to focus her thoughts.  She gazes at the four faces turned to her in anticipation and tries to tell her story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; she begins clumsily,&quot;As I told you before, the mark on my palm gives me great pain except when I am in battle.  With a weapon in hand and an enemy in front of me, the pain subsides.  After my first kill, I decided to become a warrior for the Vah Shir.  My parents were hoping I would take the path of a Shaman or Beastlord, but were still happy I did not chose the rogue path.  I began my training and have been slaying Loda Kai bandits in my lands, as well as trying to clear out Paludral caverns of the Phlarg fiends that interrupt the smooth trading from Shadow Haven to Shar Vahl.  <br>
<br>
I have reached my 18th season as of this moment.<br>
<br>
All I can think of is when the next battle will be, and how I can stop this pain.  If this mark I have is what you say it is, it would seem then that I must vanquish this land of dragons and all who would aide them.  I have never seen one, and to tell the truth heard very very little about them.  I know they are beings of great power, but if relief from this never ending pain lies within their knowledge, or blood, then it is them I shall seek.<br>
<br>
But I must tell you something now.  When you Solarianne and you Ennya,&quot;Drizle looks at both in turn,&quot; approached me this evening the pain began to withdraw, and a different feeling has come from the mark.&quot; she looks at the others who have gathered to hear her story,&quot;I feel no pain here.&quot;   She tries to look calm and collected, but truly she is just as fascinated with them.  She has never been so close to other races.  She has seen many travelers, but this is her first close experience with sentient poeples who are not Vah Shir, or Loda Kai.<br>
<br>
She studies the faces of those around her, and with each new set of eyes her mark warms and pulses reassuringly.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Could this be my place in the universe?&quot; she thinks,&quot; I hope they will accept me as a friend.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umirahze521.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirahze521</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tears of Veeshan</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/7/02 3:52:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello, I am Drizle</span><hr size=1> Salvia sits under the table where Solarianne and Ennya are listening to the tale of a newcomer.  She begins to wonder why they chose the table she was snoozing under to sit at, but the story she hears fascinates her.  The mark on her shoulder begins to warm with each word Drizle utters.  <br>
<br>
When the tale is over she slides out from under the table and sits in front of Drizle.  The large vah shir starts at the appearance of a wolf at her feet, but Salvia nuzzles her knee and the warrior calms a bit.  <br>
<br>
Then with a look at her guildmates and another long look at this new face, Salvia throws her head back in a wild howl of acceptance and joy, she then turns to Ennya for a snack.<br>
