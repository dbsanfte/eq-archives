The true long term solution is low wage earners need to get training allowing them to get<br>
higher paying jobs.<br>

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>
<br>
Ok now lets say 100% of america gets a Bachelors in a useful subject.  Now whats the problem?  Dont you realize that there HAS to be someone who runs the counter at mcdonalds, or deliver your food, or in some way shape or form Service ( ie service industry ) the person who owns or manages the other restaruants or businesses etc.  This economy only works for the rich *if* they pay their workers poorly.<br>
<br>
<br>
The person who is working underneath the managment, the upper class, is subsidizing his lifestyle for them.  People cant just sit around writing books and playing music.  Someone has to make the cities run and make the food you eat.  Automation can only go so far.  ( at this point )<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are still in the industrial revolution.  Except now the working class has been displaced in the factories ( by increasing automation ) and has been put instead to work in the mansion to service the master.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again I go back to bowling for columbine.  A welfare mother was forced to work minimum wage while raising her 6 year old son.  She was bussed to work 3 hours every day to work in a mall.  She worked a 70 hour work week.  She could still not make ends meet and was evicted.  So she moved to her cousins house.  Who happened to keep a loaded gun in the house. And her son brought it to school and shot a classmate.  That welfare mother could not be a mother because of the near slave like working conditions forced upon her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So solution time right?  Well there are no easy solutions.  But there are some EXTREMELY common sense ideas our backwards nation needs to embrace.  Such as universal healthcare and welfare for those who need it.  The common misconceptions about welfare have no basis in reality.  The amount of money welfare costs is ludicrous compared to what we spend on defense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*Predictions*  Within 50 years the service industry will also be largely automated just as factories are now.  What the massive population currently employed in service industries will do for work is something I have no idea about.<br>

In capitalism there is always a winner and a loser - always losers I should say.  Corporations, organizations, capitalism in general all have a pyramid structure of beauracracy - there are a wealthier/powerful few at the top and the supporting lower classes at the bottom.  Saying fuck the poor is the equivalent of saying let's start a revolution - come on people, common sense. <br>
<br>
Even if you want to perpetuate your wonderful little world where your money matters and no one can tell you what to do with it, there's a problem: The poor get pissed. Desperation leads to anger leads to violence - which as much as you may try to rationalize it away, is not entirely unjustified.  <br>
<br>
Ever hear of stealing a loaf of bread for your starving family? Hell, you might even be upstanding and moral enough of a person to let your children die because you won't steal that loaf, or cheat your employer out of a little money, but come on, your son, or wife, or sister is dying: It doesn't cross your mind?  <br>
<br>
Even the goddamn middle class, which most of us belong to, generally doesn't have a clue that it's important to find ways to keep people from becoming desperate. My solution? Realize that you're a fucking citizen, not a sovereign country.  If you want to stay a citizen, of the economy or the country, do your part, or fuck off - that goes for voting too. <br>
<br>
You've got a right to not vote, but if you don't then I could care less what pathetic waste of vomitous air you belch up in an attempt at rational conversation. <br>

<br>
You can not get buy on minimum wage alone.  Trust me on this I have had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of trying in the past.  That is why some social programs are necessary.  That is why we need low cost housing, medicade/medicare, and food stamps just to name a few.<br>
<br>
The right also has a pitiful record when it comes to education.  That's to be expected though since it's easier to control people when you keep the ignorant, and uneducated.  Since the poor out number the rich by such a wide margin in this country if they ever decided to wield their power in the voting booth the rich might find themselves in trouble.  This will never happen since once you've been beaten for so long it's hard to find a reason to even try for change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dumai01>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Messiah of the Flameboard</span><br>  Posts: 324<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/02 6:08:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> Some people have hard lives.

<br>
Minimum wage jobs are for entry-level workers, they are NOT for long-term, family-supporting workers; and don't try to bring in &quot;average cost-of-living&quot; studies for high cost cities/states.  These are NOT average positions.  <br>
<br>
The basic difference between the two parties is a difference of opinion as to how to better the economy for everyone as a whole.  <br>
<br>
Republicans believe in the trickle-down theory.  They give tax breaks and incentives to big businesses and make the large companies profitable.  This drives up the stock market, allows the large companies to expand, creates more jobs and more opportunities for the workers which relates to more advancement and more money for the common joe.  They believe that although it takes longer to reach the bottom, it's better overall for everyone.<br>
<br>
Democrats prefer the &quot;trickle-up&quot; method.  They raise minimum wage and give the common joe education programs, grants etc.  They give small businesses preferential treatment and low-cost startup programs.  They believe that this will give the lower income folk more money which will allow them to spend it more and become bigger consumers.  This trickles up to the larger companies in the form of purchases of services and products which will eventually make the larger businesses more profitable to expand and create more jobs.. etc.<br>
<br>
There are pros and cons to both methods and MUCH smarter men than anyone here have argued this ad nauseum to no agreement.  Hence, two parties.  Now pick yer poison and stfu. <p><img src="http://ravlowscorpse.com/kot/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rynnia>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Custom title</span><br>  Posts: 1017<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/02 6:44:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> &quot;I can find a decent 1 room apartment for 300 a month EASY.

The fucking poor do not support shit. 80% of the taxes in this country are paid by the top 1% of the people. I think this was already said too. And that is what gets all these fucktard democrats the most.<br>
<br>
The democrats care? Gimmie a fucking break. They try and create dependency on the government to expand their voting base and keep themselves in power. That's what their little social programs are all about. Yea, they care. How fucking naive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aspammingtroll00>a spamming troll00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/02 8:43:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Dont you realize that there HAS to be someone who runs the counter at mcdonalds, or deliver your food<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yeah, they're called teenagers, high school dropouts, college students, and illegal aliens.<br>
<br>
By the way, don't dis on delivering food.  I made a lot of money in college delivering pizza (although it is murder on the car).<br>

So if I want my vote to COUNT I have to vote for someone I do not like.  And, although I have been accused of playing the part of one many times in the past (often poorly so) I do not like politicians for the most part.<br>
<br>
So why waste my time?   I agree  that someone who WANTS one or the other to win, and doesn't vote, is a problem... but someone who doesn't want EITHER to win, does the process no disservice by not voting at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/5/02 4:04:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FUCK YOU DEMOCRATS</span><hr size=1> By not voting you send the message &quot;I don't give a shit&quot;.
