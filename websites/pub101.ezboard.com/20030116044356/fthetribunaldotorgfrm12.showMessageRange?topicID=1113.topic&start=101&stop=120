Was a doctor (DO, not MD)that actually turned me onto Linus Pauling and to take a hard look at medicine after I told him I think a flu shot landed me in the hospital and nearly dying of pneumonia.  (You can discuss that amongst yourselves, but I wasn't sick for 2 years...free health van came to work and I said why not...week and 1/2 later I had ER docs telling me they're amazed I was alive because I used all 200 inhalations of my albuterol inhaler in an effort to breathe)  So I started researching flu shots, shots, then eventually medicine in general.  (by the way asthmatics, have read studies that say low magnesium levels are the oneset of acute attacks...and guess what they found out in the ER...my magnesium was low.  IV maxosulfate (sp?) helped me out.  The ER docs were puzzled as to why my levels were so low though /boggle)<br>
<br>
I'm not out against doctors and medicine on some crusade, I was on my way to being one myself.  But I think they're set up to fail, being taught they way they are.  Look in the back of almost all med books and there'll be a stamp somewhere that says 'Provided in part by a grant from (insert pharmaceutical company here).  And there is hardly any study whatsoever on prevention and/or nutrition (not talking someone who specializes in the aforementioned).<br>
<br>
I've also had family members treated so poorly we've thought of suing twice, but figured let the dead rest.  One was my grandfather, who I was very close to.  Quadruple bypass surgery, he comes through with flying colors.  He makes it through the 72 hour 'critical' period or whatever, still strong and recovering.  Doctors then decide he doesn't have to be on his high blood pressure medicine which he'd been on for 28 years.  One week later he was dead.  In fact where I live Jefferson Hospital is so notoriously bad that there was a multi-car pileup right down the street from it...they life flighted everyone to another hospital 28 miles away rather than take them to jefferson.  I know, I was in the ER waiting room at the time and talked to the paramedics (who were watching the news going 'hey there I am')<br>
<br>
Loegan was right back there somewhere in the thread, I'm not gonna search for the exact quote, but it was something about putting doctors up on a pedestal.  In reality they should be treated like any other service provider, like a mechanic, repairman, etc.  Check their work, research for yourself, know what's going on.  Oh, and don't sign their little consent form.  Make em discuss everything they're gonna do to treat you, and if they don't have the time then maybe it's not what you want.  But that's neither here nor there.<br>
<br>
Now I only have one question...what did Ladida ever want? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1203<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/28/02 4:25:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Well, when it comes to mistakes made in hospitals, there is plenty of blame to go around.<br>
<br>
The pharmacuetical companies who package many drugs in similar packaging, thus making it hard for ER/EMS staff to differentiate between them in crisis situations. This was a big problem when I was an ambulance attendent, but that situation may have improved the past couple of years.<br>
<br>
Nurses who keep sloppy records on patients charts or give sub standard care. Remember that you are much more dependent on the nurses than you are on the doctors for most of your care. The doctors make the diagnosis, but the nurses render most of the care.<br>
<br>
ERs that use regular doctors instead of specially trained ER doctors. Emergency medicine is a field in itself that differs greatly from an everyday practice. MDs without emergency medical training are like a pediatrician treating an elderly patient... they know enough to get by, but it's far from the optimal level of care.<br>
<br>
Then there are the states who pass laws that allow health insurance providers to forbid doctors from telling patients about treatments that their policies won't cover. Not only that but they severly limit coverage for diagnostic tests that can alert a patient to problems before they become critical/chronic.<br>
<br>
Add in hospitals who allow/require their doctors to work 36 or more hours at a time and I think it's safe to say that there is plenty of blame to go around.<br>

To everyone knocking dvinn, u might not agree with the theorys' he presents, but doing some of the things he suggests would be possibly the best things u could do for your body anyway.<br>
<br>
I dunno, im sure oil companies have their super car in the works, and im sure the pharmaceutical companies would try similar tactics to get more money. Im serious when i say some crazed money freak would actually try to act out mission impossible 2 sometime, people are that fucked up these days.<br>
<br>
u always hear miracle stories about people overcoming incredible odds, and using things such as chinese medicine to help them, all the while being laughed at and frowned upon by head doctors...then they get better without doctors' help.<br>
<br>
and yeah, never doubt the power of suggestion, if you believe that that new pill will help you, then maybe it will simply because you believe it will, even if the pill's contents do sweet fuck all.<br>

Dvinatsat, I was trying to find you because I was wondering if maybe you could point me towards some literature. I am coaching a high school debate team this year and the policy topic is mental health services.<br>
<br>
I was thinking of coming up with a affirmative plan based on diet but I need evidence and sources, specifically on mental illness treatment &amp; prevention based on diet. If you don't mind, ya think you could e-mail me and point me to where I could find information on the subject? ladida5000@hotmail.com<br>

I am just a young pre-med student here, so I can't claim I possess a huge plethora of knowledge on everything, but having done extensive studies in the field in the area of science, I do feel I can contribute a couple of points--<br>
<br>
1.) Dvin, Holdan, etc. I enjoyed this thread throroughly. Right or wrong, it has made me think, and that's always fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Usually.<br>
<br>
2.) I cannot subscribe to the theory that doctors are the #3 cause of death. Do accidents happen? Sure do. Does misdiagnosis occur? You bet it does. But I can not believe that a good portion of doctors maliciously choose to misdirect patients to improper treatment, for the sole purpose of &quot;repeat business.&quot; But again I only have a little experience, gained mostly from my father, an ER doc, which is not very conclusive in that area of repeat business, so to speak.<br>
<br>
3.) No one has really said anything about the possibility of it being hereditary. Holdan and Dvin, could you give some insight into that theory? Couple of options, as I see it. One is that it is genetic. Period. Not the best answer, in my opinion. Another one, the one I believe is best, is that heredity gives some people a more genetic disposition to cancer, and not taking appropriate measures to avoid it (Excercise, vitamins, etc.) are the real cause. Another option is that it is not hereditary at all, plain and simple. That covers the whole spectrum. In simpler terms, It is hereditary, or it is partially hereditary, combined with a poor lifestyle, or it is not hereditary at all. Again, I don't pretend to have the answer, just my own ideas on the subject.<br>
<br>
Anyway, great thread, and right or wrong, I enjoyed seeing some varying opinions.<br>

You want to pick a few areas, or you want everything I got.  Cause I got a lot.  I have a shitload of stuff on SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, one of the suspected causes of all the school/work place shootings), anti-depressants in general, alternative anti-depressants (SAMe, St. John's), common neurotoxins we come in everyday contact with (aspartame, fluoride etc), ADD/ADHD stuff, stuff on transcendental meditation, vitamin b complex and alzheimers, prions, I don't know, I have a lot.  If you want to narrow it down to one or two areas let me know and I'll send you everything I got...otherwise if you want it all might take me a bit to collate everything.<br>
<br>
Sayree -- good luck to you in med school...I couldn't fathom going and raising my hand every 30 seconds to argue with the professors <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As for doctors being 'malicious', like I said I bet they don't intend to at all.  But they know nothing else.  Drugs = horrible poisons, nearly all of em.  There are no 'side-effects', only effects.  It's not that they prescribe them to engender these effects so the patients come back for other meds, it's that the meds just have those consequences.  You're introducing a synthetic poison into the body when in optimal conditions (i.e. healthy lifestyle) the body needs nothing, it is self-sufficient and self-healing.  But we add this poison, so now the body must deal with both it and whatever the disease-causing agent is.  Now while this poison may weaken the agent helping the body to beat it faster, in all cases it effects something else too.  Food for thought, total retail spending on drugs last year in the US was $155 billion dollars (Lancet v.359, n.9313 6apr02 naysayers).<br>
<br>
Speaking of naysayers, here's that JAMA article that I kept beating Holdan over the head with...I don't know if he ever did find it.  But since you weren't an arrogant dick about me producing it, I'll give ya the link <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Good read for those interested in pursuing a position in the medical field.  <br>

<br>
Uh, you'll notice the date on that is july 26th 2000, and most of the author's (from Johns Hopkins no less, which is where I wanted to attend med school) references are '95 and up.  <br>
<br>
Tarj - That statement's ambiguous at best.  Is cancer hereditary?  Doubtful.  But are conditions hereditary that make the body unable to perform as it should?  Probably.  It's possible that protein enzymes that have been damaged in a parent are assimilated into the DNA info storage and then passed onto their progeny. (kids bakamon, kids)  I hate to do this for fear of more tiresome posts about my product and my anti-cancer finger rings, but I want to post something from the Human Genome Project's findings.  If you follow it, it helps you understand how enzymes can be disrupted leading to a failure in DNA.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Biological replication does include the precise duplication of DNA, but this is accomplished by the living cell, not by the DNA molecule alone. In the development of a person from a single fertilized egg, the egg cell and the multitude of succeeding cells divide in two. Each such division is preceded by a doubling of the cell's DNA; two new DNA strands are produced by attaching the necessary nucleotides (freely available in the cell), in the proper order, to each of the two DNA strands entwined in the double helix. As the single fertilized egg cell grows into an adult, the genome is replicated many billions of times, its precise sequence of three billion nucleotides retained with extraordinary fidelity.  The rate of error듮hat is, the insertion into the newly made DNA sequence of a nucleotide out of its proper order들s about one in 10 billion nucleotides. But on its own, DNA is incapable of such faithful replication; in a test-tube experiment, a DNA strand, provided with a mixture of its four constituent nucleotides, will line them up with about one in a hundred of them out of its proper place. On the other hand, when the appropriate protein enzymes are added to the test rube, the fidelity with which nucleotides are incorporated in the newly made DNA strand is greatly improved, reducing the error rate to one in 10 million. These remaining errors are finally reduced to one in 10 billion by a set of &quot;repair&quot; enzymes (also proteins) that detect and remove mismatched nucleotides from the newly synthesized DNA.<br>
<br>
Thus, in the living cell the gene's nucleotide code can be replicated faithfully only because an array of specialized proteins intervenes to prevent most of the errors등hich DNA by itself is prone to make드nd to repair the few remaining ones. Moreover, it has been known since the 1960s that the enzymes that synthesize DNA influence its nucleotide sequence. In this sense, genetic information: arises not from DNA alone but through its essential collaboration with protein enzymes드 contradiction of the central dogma's precept that inheritance is uniquely governed by the self-replication of the DNA double helix.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Human genome project made an amazing discovery -- that DNA did not create life, life created DNA.  DNA is the storage device for the enzymatic proteins which determine the nucleotides of the cell.  HGP found we had about 1/3rd the genes they thought we did, and that the cell information is actually determined by the arrangement of  variant proteins through redesigned, alternative/spliced messenger RNA. (in direct opposition to Watson and Crick's thoughts that DNA sends information from a single gene to a single protein)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I haven't delved into biogenetics too much to say whether compromised DNA (as far as enzyme production goes) is congenital, making cancer hereditary.  If it was though, I would imagine that cell mechanisms would fail right off the bat and the DNA would succumb to erroneous replications and our newborns wouldn't last weeks.  Since this isn't the case, I would wager to say no.  Whether enzyme production can be corrupted in newborns, again I'm unsure.  <br>
<br>
By the way, I hope it's clearer now how Warburg's work on 'the respiratory enzyme' and common blood energy reactions can affect the conditions under which DNA works and repairs itself.  DNA cannot operate if the 'atmosphere' under which enzymatic proteins operate is compromised and the enzymes themselves are corrupted such that they cannot perform their jobs (i.e. repair of and distribution of DNA nucleotides).  Read the HGP findings, pretty interesting how our fundamental view of DNA and life is completely wrong.  Sorta sheds new light on transgendered crops and gene splicing.  Bleh, but I digress.<br>
