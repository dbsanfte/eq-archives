Since when it their policy to delete characters only because then want a surname change.<br>
<br>
Here is the conversation:<br>
<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:03:38 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Greetings. Guide Shuminah here. How can I help you?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:04:15 2002] You told shuminah, 'Hi I wonder if it possible to have my surname capitalized? it's only two letters'<br>
Thu Nov 07 23:04:36 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'No, Im afraid not. What is your current surname ?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:04:42 2002] You told Shuminah, 'Md'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:07:10 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Im afraid that it is not possible for you to have a surname in all capitals.. Yes you may get it removed but when you do think of a new name you will have to repetition for it. Would you like for me to send your petition to the GM for removal?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:07:29 2002] You told Shuminah, 'yes please'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:08:19 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Alright then I shall do that. Do you want a new surname or would you just like your current one removed until you re-petition for it later?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:09:36 2002] You told Shuminah, 'I already know one'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:09:43 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Alright lets hear it =)'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:10:23 2002] You told Shuminah, 'Aka'medic'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:10:47 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Hmmmmmmmmmmm'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:11:06 2002] You told Shuminah, 'not good?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:11:35 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'No sorry =)'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:12:22 2002] You told Shuminah, 'Medicus?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:12:59 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Yes you may have that.'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:15 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'I will let the GM know that you would like your name changed. =)'<br>
<br>
Aha we were talking about a surname, not name. OK I continue:<br>
<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:18 2002] You told Shuminah, 'heh, thank you. still has something of medic in it'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:32 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'yes it does. I take it your a doctor./urse?'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:13:36 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Nurse*'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:14:13 2002] You told Shuminah, 'No I think it a very roleplaying name, also Hospik is Medic in dutch'<br>
[Thu Nov 07 23:14:37 2002] Shuminah tells you, 'Oh I see.. Well it is fine.. Great choice in names =)'<br>
<br>
Ok so I thought it will be taken care off. When I logged in the next morning my character had been deleted! OMG I have been screwed big time!! <br>
<br>
Anyway I have sent an email to the GM's 3 times, emailed eqmail@soe.sony.com and /petitioned about 10 times hoping a GM would help me. Had 2 guide tell they'd escalated the problem. Well after 4 days still no reply. Not even a single email.<br>
<br>
Hospik (oh wait I dont exist anymore)<br>

There were some rapid-fire patches when PoP was released so you probably missed it.<br>
<br>
The message said that they appologize if some of the new rules and policies havent been passed down to all of the guides and lower level customer service people, but that inappropriate names were not going to be getting a lot of CS time from now on.  When lead CS people get asked to change a name that is not within the guidelines, they will just delete the character and you can start fresh, if the character is below lvl 30, as customers can easily get lvl 30 in a day now.  <p><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~bnewland/sop-sig.jpg><BR>

Perhaps someone felt your name was a title as well and decided to delete your character in keeping with the new naming policy -- whatever the hell that is now being that they keep changing it.<br>
<br>
Next time you petition, suggest to the guide that responds that they write down your PID number and that you will wait patiently while they log off and check out their guide board to see exactly who made the decision and why.  There should be a full description of the original problem and final solution on the guide board in the naming issues forum.  The message will be titled Hospik (and then your PID number) and should be sorted by the week that it occured -- so last week's naming issues.<br>
<br>
Most likely they will never give you this information and the reality is that they know exactly why you had your character deleted, but they'd prefer to play innocent and not have to deal with arguing with you.  Personally, I'd do the same thing were I a guide that answered your petition.  I would be all sympathetic and pretend to be shocked your character was deleted -- completely unaware of who would do such a thing.  I would then escalate a request to have a GM speak to you and explain why it happened -- something I know would never in a lifetime happen, but by doing this I no longer am in any way responsible for the problem.<br>
<br>
However, in real life I would be laughing that it happened, wondering why you would ever want such a stupid name in the first place, and wishing you'd just STFU and make a new character with a less gay name and just play him/her.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.... (um, no actually I don't give a shit)<br>

Every time you petition something that doesn't require the guide to do something simple (like move you from a piece of texture you are stuck behind or in).  Generally when these situations are resolved the person who resolved them will respond and explain exactly what they did.<br>
<br>
Your name was Hospik Md and you weren't happy that it wasn't Hospik MD.  Obviously going for M.D. or Medical Doctor for your last name -- which is clearly a non-fantasy name (and therefore a violation of rule number 5 of the current naming policy).  Furthermore, the policy on capitalizing a second character of surnames has always been that it is only done for names like McGregor.  You then spelled out for the guide that your first name means Medic in Dutch (and therefore arguably another non-fantasy name and quite possibly a title in violation of rule number 9 of the naming policy).  <br>
<br>
If the guide you were speaking to was a Senior Guide they could change your surname on the spot.  They felt you would be a trouble-maker, so they replaced your surname with a space -- forcing you to petition to change it again, because they didn't trust you to choose one on your own at that point.  Most likely due to the conversation you had with them or possibly past problems they had had with you.  Otherwise, they would have just deleted it and let you choose a new one on your own.<br>
<br>
Following this conversation, they most likely escalated your petition to a GM and added in their comments that your first name was quite possibly a violation of the naming policy as well as your old surname.  They did this to allow the GM to make the final call.  During the three hours that petitions remain in the queue a miracle occurred and a GM somehow logged onto your server (probably an accident made while funbling for a spilled beer).  The GM happened to look at the escalated petition and you were not online, so they deleted your character without contacting you.<br>
<br>
There is most likely an entry in the guide web-site by guide Shuminah saying &quot;Hospik -- PID# -- Player wished to have his surname changed to MD from Md which is a violation of rule #5 of the naming policy, so I replaced his surname with a space and he will need to re-petition to change it to something more suitable.  Hospik is Dutch for Medic and therefore quite possibly also a violation of the naming policy.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is probably followed up by a GM's response saying something to the effect of &quot;Hospik has been deleted, being that it is a violation of the naming policy and he was under level 30.  Player was not online, so was not contacted&quot;.<br>
<br>
Any guide you speak to now either knows about this situation or could quickly find this out, however they also know two things:  1.  Explaining it to you will result in a huge argument where they as volunteers are forced to defend Verant's policies with a very real possibility that they will misrepresent the company and get in trouble for it.  2.  The GM who did this will probably never log onto your server in the next five months and even then will never respond, so feigning ignorance and escalating the petition takes the heat off of them and gets you off their backs.<br>
<br>
Maybe next time when you have a name that is possibly a violation of the naming policy you will not petition the guides to change it to an even riskier name -- thereby drawing even more attention to it.  I know that if I had a character named Fuku, I certainly wouldn't petition to have it changed to FukU.  I also wouldn't then cross-post a log of the conversation and whine to the population of 10 or more servers that I was unfairly treated when he is deleted or renamed.<br>
