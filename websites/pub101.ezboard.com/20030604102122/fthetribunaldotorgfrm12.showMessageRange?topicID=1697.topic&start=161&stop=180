You and I actually see eye to eye for once on something. What baffles me is why, given the current events that have shown just have much latitude reporters have in writing stories (little things like, making them up entirely come to mind), you continue to post them and seem to act like they are ground truth. Why are you not questioning them?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I do question them, which is why I spend so much time reading articles from this country and several others.<br>
<br>
I won't deny that papers use each others articles to create their own and of course there's AP and Rueters, but you would be surprised how different the article can be from one paper to the next. One includes many facts, one uses 10 lines and the difference can put a whole different spin on the story.<br>
<br>
The problem is, for a guy like me who wants the truth, my only resource is cable news and newspapers. There is no way I can verify their sources (especially since most like to remain anon, especially on political matters), but when you see the same story told a few different ways by different papers on different continents, but the basic facts remain the same, I think you can put a modicum of trust in it.<br>
<br>
There are also times when a source gets credibility simply for who they are or the position they held, like the man who was Head of CIA Iraq Desk. I find that politicians twist intelligence to get it to show what they want it to, while intelligence people tend to be distrustful of any info and simply take facts for what they are. They do interpretation to be sure, but I think it is far less politically motivated.<br>
<br>
I don't know any intelligence people personally (closest I know is a cryptologist for NSGA which is a whole different game - they only encrypt/decrypt the info), so my opinion is based on what I read, but I think it's a fairly justified opinion.<br>
<br>
Unless I see some credible info to the contrary, I will always think that Saddam has been the US whipping boy for years. We helped put him in power, used him to further our own agenda and then when he got too ambitious we turned on him and have been trying to take him out ever since.<br>
<br>
I am confident we created this enemy by arming Iran at the same time we armed Iraq and I am confident in the info that Saddam said he would never be played for a fool by the US again when he found out.<br>
<br>
I am also pretty confident that the stories of him gassing his own people were put out by our people to make Saddam a worse monster than he was in the publics eye, so when we did try to take him out people would forget he was our ally at one time and wouldn't question our motives.<br>
<br>
As to the US, I think we are like Jekyl and Hyde. We can do the most wonderful and constructive things in one region while totally fucking up another region for political reasons. And even how we treat the same region varies from administration to administration.<br>
<br>
I don't believe government as a whole is evil at all, far from it. I am not paranoid or subscribe to every conspiracy theory as Dante likes to imply, but I do believe that at any given time there are some self serving, power hungry, fanatical bastards in there who make bad policy and who would trade the lives of foreign citizens for their own gain. There are also those who do extreme things based on the belief it is for the greater good. Then there are those who just go with the flow of history and continue wrongs rather than fight to change policy.<br>
<br>
The reason these people can do these things is because the public as a whole isn't very well informed. People buy into spin without question unless the evening news happens to feed them one and even then is has to be a sexy issue or their short attention spans will have them flipping channels in 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
But no system is perfect and ours is a damn good one that I believe in. I don't criticize our system out of hate, but rather as a citizen who doesn't want to see our power and wealth used for the wrong goals or to see us reach our goals in the wrong ways just because people don't care enough to actually educate themselves on the issues.<br>
<br>
I may fall into some media traps from time to time, but I think it's better to be questioning and run the risk of being misinformed, rather to never question and be uninformed. And even if my arguments (or others) are wrong, if people at least research to prove me wrong (or I research to prove them wrong) then we at least know more than we did at the start.<br>

So basically, you NEVER trust and always question US Government sources, but never really question your &quot;other sources&quot; outside seeing if Wacko #1 and Wacko #2 say about the same thing?  Hey..  wait a minute... don't they ALL pretty much say, &quot;Fuck the US&quot;? <br>
<br>
Way to take ten pages to basically say, I'm a worse sheep than those patriotic guys, mostly because I never know if my sources have a fucking fact in them.  You should just start looking back at those elite historical stories and start tossing out shit about how President Eisenhower beat his slaves with a barbed whip and stuff.  Works for Merton.  No one 60 years later actually GIVES a fuck what he did, but goddamned if I can argue those l33t facts.<br>

Ok, so every elected official is qualified and doesn't lie?<br>
<br>
Reagan lied like a rug and even created a special office to put out propaganda until he got. Ever hear of Iran Contra?<br>
<br>
Wanna talk about Nixon? Whole books are written over his many lies.<br>
<br>
Clinton? (although I think his lie was justified because we had NO RIGHT to ask the question in the first place)<br>
<br>
Probably the most honest and moral president we ever had was Carter, who was also a genius and a poet... too bad he sucked at the job.<br>
<br>
As to Pelletier - he didn't lose his job - he retired. The guy is over 70 FFS.<br>
<br>
And if I don't use the newspapers to be informed what do you suggest I use? Heresay from drones like yourself? The word of the selected President accpepted as gospel? Fox news? CNN? Riiiight - no spin there.<br>
<br>
Just go on trusting in every elected official and take their stories as gospel and I will continue to  be that anti-American tapeworm who questions and demands accountablity and actually has a memory long enough to last until election day when I make a choice based on actions not impressions.<br>

<br>
I am for the rewards, not so for the penalties... at least in this one situation. Now if we had shown a clear and present danger and if the UN had completed it's inspections and they still refused to help us, then I think withdrawing support would be acceptable. Under the circumstance we went to war under though, I don't think any country can be held at fault for sitting this one out.<br>
<br>
I am no fan of the French and I think they are far too passive, but in this case I believe they were right, even is it was for the wrong reasons. When I go to war I want concrete proof such as we had in the Cuba Missile Crisis or of the atrocities being committed by Milosovich or the invasion of Kuwait. Those were situations where action was clearly warranted and when we ask US servicemen/women to put their lives on the line, I believe they deserve that clear evidence.<br>
<br>
I think pouring french wine down the gutter and renaming french fries to freedom fries is childish and makes us look like spoiled brats throwing a temper tantrum. I defiantly cringed when Rumsfeld called Germany and France &quot;Old Europe&quot; and I think this whole situation was handled terribly on the diplomatic front.<br>
<br>
I had alot of respect for Bush Sr who was able to build a solid coalition during the first Gulf War and I am sure he would have handled this Iraq situation in a far different manner (of course he was an ambassador and had 8 years experience under Reagan, so was an exceptional diplomat). Add to that the support shown after 9/11 and the help countries gave when we went after al-Qaeda and I think it's clear that the world will stand with us when we are clearly in the right.<br>
<br>
We were not clearly in the right on this one and many countries resent us because of the strong arm tactics this administration uses to get what it wants. To quote an article on the subject - &quot; talk to any country who has had dealings with the Bush administration and you'll find a one word used over and over - humiliation&quot;. And that was long before the Iraq war, so I can only imagine the pressure used trying to get countries onboard with that.<br>
<br>
Anyways, no - although there are situation where I believe removing support is appropriate, I don't believe this is one of them. If we had had clear cut evidence then I most likely would have supported it though. <p><br><br><br>

I thought you were talking about economic deals and aid, but now that I re-read the post it sounds more like you are talking about the contratcs to rebuild Iraq?<br>
<br>
If so then I agree with that 100%. This was our war and they wanted nothing to do with it (whether for right or wrong reasons), so I believe it is up to us to rebuild Iraq with whoever we want, though I think if this were pure it should be up to the Iraqis, but this isn't pure in any sense of the word.<br>
<br>
Now if you ask me if that's what's best for us in the long run, then I would have to say no. I think it is pretty important for the UN to get involved to add legitimacy and to help cover the enormous cost and huge manpower needed to keep the peace in Iraq in the coming years. But, I still can't fault the administration for not giving out any contracts to France, Russia or Germany as they were against this action.<br>
<br>
To be honest, if I was the president of another country or the leader of the UN, I wouldn't want to touch Iraq with a 10ft pole anyway. I would be of the mind that the US made this mess - let them have all the responsibility and clean it up and let them sink all the manpower in it for years to come.<br>

I guess it honestly is, because at least most of mine is accredited to a defined source.

Apparently your Pelletier was cut from a different cloth though eh?  He's the only one providing TRUE &quot;intelligence&quot; now, after he's retired.

Thanks for heading back into history to find OTHER bad men to show how the current administrations is equally evil.  Lying isn't restricted to politicians moron.  You've spouted drivel you couldn't back up with facts yourself, which makes you one too.<br>
<br>
How about using a little common sense to guide you instead of blindly following whatever the Conspiracy Theorists are spouting today?  Try reading a little of the stuff you're railing against instantly as lies, and see where that leads you.  BTW.. you don't question accountability dullard, you allow it to go unchecked for a decade and then whine like a little bitch when someone comes to make you comply.  No..  wait, that's your Hero.  You're just a slimy little Tapeworm sitting in your basement with the shutters closed and your pecker in one hand and the other at the keyboard, beating off because someone is reacting to the drivel you're writing.<br>

As to myself and Election Day, you can suck my dick.  I guarantee I put more thought into my own selections than you, because being a tinfoil wearing retard dictates that you MUST vote with the rest of your club or lose your tinfoil hat and get controlled like the rest of the world.<br>

CIA Feels Heat on Iraq Data <br>
By GREG MILLER and BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON -- Senior Bush administration officials are pressuring CIA analysts to tailor their assessments of the Iraqi threat to help build a case against Saddam Hussein, intelligence and congressional sources said.<br>
<br>
In what sources described as an escalating &quot;war,&quot; top officials at the Pentagon and elsewhere have bombarded CIA analysts with criticism and calls for revisions on such key questions as whether Iraq has ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist network, sources said.<br>
<br>
The sources stressed that CIA analysts—who are supposed to be impartial—are fighting to resist the pressure. But they said analysts are increasingly resentful of what they perceive as efforts to contaminate the intelligence process.<br>
<br>
&quot;Analysts feel more politicized and more pushed than many of them can ever remember,&quot; said an intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br>
<br>
&quot;The guys at the Pentagon shriek on issues such as the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There has been a lot of pressure to write on this constantly, and to not let it drop.&quot;<br>
<br>
The pressure has intensified in the weeks leading up to this week's debate in Congress on a resolution granting President Bush permission to pursue a military invasion of Iraq.<br>
<br>
Evidence of the differences between the agency and the White House surfaced publicly this week when CIA Director George J. Tenet sent a letter to lawmakers saying the Iraqi president is unlikely to strike the United States unless provoked.<br>
<br>
That was at odds with statements from Bush and others that Iraq poses an immediate threat. In a speech Monday in Cincinnati, Bush said the danger that Iraq poses to the United States &quot;is already significant, and it only grows worse with time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Several lawmakers voiced frustration with the way intelligence is being used in the debate on Iraq.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am concerned about the politicization of intelligence,&quot; said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who echoed complaints of other members that the administration has been selective in the intelligence it cites, overstating its case in many instances.<br>
<br>
Classified material provided recently by the CIA on Iraq's capabilities and intentions &quot;does not track some of the public statements made by senior administration officials,&quot; Feinstein said.<br>
<br>
Outside experts say they too see growing cause for concern.<br>
<br>
&quot;The intelligence officials are responding to the political leadership, not the other way around, which is how it should be,&quot; said Joseph Cirincione, a nonproliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. &quot;The politics are driving our intelligence assessments at this point.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tenet rejected assertions that the agency is being unduly influenced.<br>
<br>
&quot;The president of the United States would never tolerate anything other than our most honest judgment,&quot; Tenet said in a statement late Thursday. &quot;Our credibility and integrity are our most precious commodities. We will not let anyone tell us what conclusions to reach.<br>
<br>
&quot;Policymakers, members of Congress and others are free to push us to challenge our assertions and to ask tough, probing questions. This is healthy. But the notion that we would shape our assessments to please any one of our customers is abhorrent to the ethic by which we work and is simply untrue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unrelenting Pressure<br>
<br>
But intelligence sources say the pressure on CIA analysts has been unrelenting in recent months, much of it coming from Iraq hawks including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his top deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz.<br>
<br>
CIA officials who brief Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz on Iraq routinely return to the agency with a long list of complaints and demands for new analysis or shifts in emphasis, sources said.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a lot of unhappiness with the analysis,&quot; usually because it is seen as not hard-line enough, one intelligence official said.<br>
<br>
Another government official said CIA briefers &quot;are constantly sent back by the senior people at Defense and other places to get more, get more, get more to make their case.&quot;<br>
<br>
A senior Pentagon official rejected claims that Rumsfeld would improperly influence intelligence analysts and said they might be misinterpreting remarks meant to test their convictions. &quot;He's a guy who's constantly challenging assertions and assumptions,&quot; the official said.<br>
<br>
But White House hawks have shown a tendency for stretching the case against Iraq. Wolfowitz and others have clung to claims that Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi agent in Prague, the Czech capital, last year even though the CIA has viewed the report with deep skepticism.<br>
<br>
Rumsfeld's recent remark that the United States has &quot;bulletproof&quot; evidence of links between Al Qaeda and Hussein struck many in the intelligence community as an exaggerated assessment of the available evidence.<br>
<br>
Indeed, Tenet's letter to lawmakers this week said the agency's &quot;understanding of the relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda is evolving and is based on sources of varying reliability.&quot;<br>
<br>
Similarly, Bush said in his Cincinnati speech, &quot;We've learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases.&quot;<br>
<br>
But Tenet's letter was more equivocal, saying only that there has been &quot;reporting&quot; that such training has taken place. Unlike other passages of the letter, he did not describe the reporting as &quot;solid&quot; or &quot;credible.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sequence of events surrounding the release of the letter is seen by many on Capitol Hill as an example of how the political winds have whipped intelligence on Iraq.<br>
<br>
Tenet released the letter only after being pushed to do so by lawmakers unhappy with an earlier CIA report on Iraq that hewed closely to the White House line.<br>
<br>
When lawmakers seized on the letter in speeches against the White House case for war, Tenet quickly issued another statement asserting that &quot;there is no inconsistency&quot; between White House and agency views on Iraq danger. A day later, Tenet rejected another request from lawmakers to declassify additional material on Iraq.<br>
<br>
Tenet &quot;is in a bad position,&quot; said one congressional aide. &quot;He's under fire from the [intelligence] committees. Then he's under fire from the White House.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some agency critics note that the CIA's public statements on Iraq have evolved over the last year, escalating their assessment of the risk posed by Hussein.<br>
<br>
When Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 19, for example, the Iraqi threat was not singled out or described with particular urgency.<br>
<br>
Hussein &quot;may ... have retained the capability to deliver&quot; biological or chemical weapons &quot;using modified aircraft or other unmanned aerial vehicles,&quot; Tenet said, for example.<br>
<br>
Tenet also told the committee at the time that Baghdad has &quot;had contacts&quot; with Al Qaeda and that tactical cooperation is &quot;possible.&quot; His letter to lawmakers this week asserts &quot;senior level contacts&quot; going back a decade.<br>
<br>
A senior U.S. intelligence official said some of the changes can be attributed to new information gained from interrogations of several Al Qaeda leaders captured in Pakistan and elsewhere since spring.<br>
<br>
The official insisted that intelligence also supported Bush's widely challenged charge that Iraq is &quot;exploring ways&quot; of using drone aircraft to disperse chemical or biological agents against targets in the United States.<br>
<br>
U.N. reports confirm that Iraq has converted Czech-made L-29 trainer jets into unmanned aircraft and that it has sought to equip them with sprayers, but such planes are incapable of flying long distances.<br>
<br>
During his speech Tuesday on Iraq, Bush repeated a claim that Baghdad has attempted to import high-strength aluminum tubes &quot;for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
The claim, however, is widely disputed. A British government report last month, which reflects the judgments of British intelligence, notes that &quot;no definitive intelligence&quot; links the tubes to a nuclear program.<br>
<br>
Old Accusations<br>
<br>
Accusations that the CIA has shaded its analysis of sensitive national security issues to support administration policies are not new.<br>
<br>
Ronald Reagan and other Republicans charged that the CIA under President Carter underestimated the Soviet threat in the late 1970s, leading to creation of a separate &quot;Blue Team&quot; panel that produced a more dire analysis of the data.<br>
<br>
During the Clinton administration, hawkish Republicans charged that the intelligence community was downplaying the threat of ballistic missiles.<br>
<br>
A commission led by Rumsfeld argued that the threat was much more immediate and thus sharpened the political debate over national missile defense.<br>
<br>

Re-read the article dickhead.  You're putting ALL your trust in Greg Miller and Bob Drogin, not some CIA officials or &quot;sources&quot;.  You're saying these reporters have no reason to rake the mud, or cause controvery, right?  Tenet says the President has integrity, and wouldn't ask the CIA to do anything but give honest assessments, and you're assuming these guys are out finding the TRUE story.  Heh.<br>
<br>
Talk about blind belief.  Fucking sheep.  They MAY be right, but if this was the truth, they should be talking to these officials in an open way, exposing this Evil Regime for what it is, not hiding people too interested in keeping their jobs than in telling the truth.  If they DID expose Bush and Co. to be Evil, they'd be Media Heroes and employed till they died, making Millions in the process.. this is America.<br>
<br>
I only touched the first few paragraphs for all the anonymous sources.. too many to quote and count really.  You're really a dipshit Tapeworm.<br>

Above is a link to all the hearings at the Armed Services Commision, where Tenet supposedly spoke on the 19th of March, 2002.  Guess what?  Looks like that was a CLOSED session.  Closed.  Meaning no one inside but the commission and invited guests.  Wonder what &quot;source&quot; leaked all of Mr. Tenet's apathy?<br>

The Chezks withdrew their claim.<br>
<br>
We fought Iraq and no WMD were used against our troops and the war lasted all of 3 weeks.<br>
<br>
After almost 2 months we have found no WMD.<br>
<br>
There are still no &quot;bullet proof&quot; ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda<br>
<br>
Those aluminum tubes turned out to be most likely used for rockets, not nuclear purposes.<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like the CIA was dead on and this war only proved them right.<br>
<br>
And let me clue you into something - if you throw out every article that doesn't use names, then you won't be reading much news. As to what Tenent said... well that is because the article is balanced and shows both sides fucktard. It lends to it's credibility, it doesn't detract from it.<br>

Also, you missed a post retard.  Tenet MAY have said some of the things he was actually quoted as saying, but it was a CLOSED session.  We're getting our information second hand from a &quot;source&quot; of your reporters.  They have an AWFUL lot of sources in the Pentagon and CIA for being reporters.

Hahaha..  like we wouldn't be the one's to pay for it anyway.  We wipe virtually the entire world's collective arses with our support, and even a fucking maggot like you can't argue that .  Knowing you though, you'll sure try.<br>

<br>
1)  Did the government say they were positive there were WMDs, and that this was our reason for going to war? (on the basis that said WMDs would end up in terrorist hands)<br>
<br>
2)  Did they further this claim by saying those terrorist ties existed?<br>
<br>
3)  Has there been any evidence that the WMDs actually existed, or the terrorist ties?  Note:  &quot;this guy said so&quot; isn't evidence.. where are the wire transfers from Saddam's accounts to Osama's?<br>
<br>
4)  If the answer to #3 is &quot;no&quot;, did the government lie to us? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tamluan>Tamluan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I quit</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/03 3:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=178>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~tamluan/asskicker.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la</span><hr size=1> for chrsits sakes you armchair commandos listen up the american government spend millions each year on health care aid for people like me who were over there the last time  and was in the gen vincinity of the chamical weps that were used that alone should be reaon to go over there and smoke his asss  never mind all the political doubletalk and hearsay that loag is spouting he may have investigated these facts but he hasnt lived them come get some of the gulf war syndrome you fucking asshole and tell me if it doesnt warrant going over there and erradicating saddams reing i think some people get so cought up in poilitcal bs and chess like pawn positioning that they forget the basics right in front of them they are in direct violation of the ROE set up by the UN for any type of conflict or war in the first place loeg i respect the fact that u take the time to investigate but i think your totaly getting blinded by politcs you seen anyones children who were born with after effects of the gulf war syndrome ?? there health is riddled with problems passed down geneticaly before anyone knew there was a serious problem  i think you need to step back and look at all angles before you make a one sided &quot;educated &quot; opinion <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/03 4:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=179>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: la</span><hr size=1> 1) Government has been threatening war for some time to force compliance with the UN Sanctions, of which Saddam had the pleasure of ignoring for over a decade.<br>
<br>
2)  Promise of WMD?  Well, they said they had intelligence to indicate he still had them and still had the capability to produce such and in Powell's speech to the UN, it showed a small portion of such.  Some refuse to believe it as proof, but we have located some of the mobile Bio Units he spoke of.  I'm of the impression that there has not been enough time to scour a country two times the size of Idaho.<br>
<br>
Even if we don't, this began with a failure to comply, any way you slice it.  The one unified world power, the UN was shown to not back up its declarations and Saddam WAS shown by intelligence reports to have the FUNDS to procure weapons, and the desire to attempt to do so.<br>
<br>
3)  You don't understand.  The true issue is compliance and the fact that we weren't allowed to collect proof of such through above board means (UN Sanctioned inspection teams) and were forced to do so through our own means.  We found mobile units, but no, no smoking gun as of yet.  I think its patently ludicrous to demand it so soon after war, especially since the zone is still not totally under Alliance control.<br>
<br>
Even if a month from now, the Tapeworms come running back here to say &quot;See?  Now WMD!&quot; they're still hopelessly and witlessly missing the point.  SADDAM had the power to prevent all this, and the over 1,000,000 deaths the UN sanctions (still can't get fuckwad Loegan to acknowledge this point) resulted in.  Simple compliance would have ended it all.<br>
<br>
Why the FUCK should we, as a member Nation of the UN sit idly by while sanctions are ignored, and the threat of this monster pushing a button the SECOND he can research or buy a nuke go on?  He was ORDERED to cease production and research and show PROOF of such.  He didn't.<br>
<br>
Did the US lie?  Don't believe it, but I have no more proof that they did than the Bloodsucking Tapeworms and Cowards who've posted here have that they did.  What happened was right, because it SHOULD have been done by a responsible WORLD about a decade ago.  Period.<br>

If you are truly military, then FFS learn how to at least write at a 5th grade level before you tell people you are military so it doesn't look like we enlist a bunch of morons.<br>
<br>
Two - the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by injections given by the US military from all I have read and heard from people who work with it. I know of a person right here locally who is on full disability due to his ganglia (sp?) deteriating from it and the VA won't even pay for a PET scan because they don't want to admit guilt even though his doctor has confirmed to him it was from the injection he was REQUIRED to get. The poor fucker has his cognitive processes lock up every once in awhile and it continues to get worse and the VA still gives him the run around.<br>
<br>
Hell, I hear stories from social workers in my area of the VA still fighting cases of liability on Agent Orange. And as I told her, I think our governments priorities are total shit when we fuck over the very people who defend our nations with their lives for very little pay.<br>
<br>
If you really are military than I do respect the service you gave to our country, but FFS, use some of those government programs you are entitled to and learn how to fuckin write so people won't get eyestrain and brain cramps from reading your posts. <p><br><br><br>
