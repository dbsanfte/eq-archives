<br>
Back when the Romans were invading England (before the Picts in Sottland chased them off), the Great Tribes of North America (Huron, Iroquoi, Cherokee, etc) had annual gatherings for a great summit.  That practice is still carried on to this day, much to the dismay of the US Government.<br>
<br>
So it's safe to say North America had a government system long before England, Spain, France, Denmark, Germany, etc existed as ANY form of government.  Many of the barbarian hordes that attacked Greece and Rome settled into what's now known as Germany.  France.  England (LONG before Australia and New Zealand.  Both of which were colonized around the same time North America was.....  by SPAIN)<br>
<br>
Government was introduced to these countries mostly through Roman occupation.  It wasn't until the fall of Rome that autonomy was conferred to these &quot;countries.&quot;  Rome itself was the newcomer in Europe.  They just had the farthest reaching impact.  Much like America does today.<br>
<br>
Asia on the otherhand, is an entirely different story and was well established LONG before most of europe was even out of the diaper stage (literally)<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not going to get into the revolt and revolution bit.  We'd never be able to pin down exactly when a lot of Europe actually started, ended, started again, ad nauseam.<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the best way to continue this argument isn't basing it on government systems.   Instead, base it on cultures.  Governments change.  Cultures adapt and persist.<br>

<br>
Maraclair is as good at political science as she is at playing EQ.  Listen up you brainless twit, it has nothing to do with having a constitution.  In fact most systems of government in the world today do not have a constitution.  They do however have a system in place that determines how the nation will be governed.  When that system is thrown out and replaced with a new system, you have a new form of government and most certainly, you have a new nation.  It happens that in the United States, our system of government is defined by the Constitution, which contains within itself means for ammending it.  <br>
<br>
As for those that said the United States has no roots, ask yourself where our common law comes from?  And since you probably don't know what the fuck common law means, I'll give you a hint: It's law that comes from the courts as opposed to from the legislature.  And some of our common law dates back to long before 1776.  While you're at it, ask yourself why California was the first community property state in the US.  Or why Louisiana is the only state in the US that is not a common law based system.  <br>
<br>
If you really want to trace just how deeply our roots are, ask yourself why the booster rockets on the space shuttle are less efficient than they could be?  I'll give you another hint, the ancient Romans had something to do with this one.<br>

becuase the width of the rockets was based on the tunnels they had to be transported thru<br>
<br>
becuase the tunnels were determined by the size / width of the train tracks<br>
<br>
becuase the train tracks were a stanard width based on the some starndard horse and cart width used back in England.<br>
<br>
becuase the english used the runts in the roads (built by the romans back during occupation) as a basis for building their cart things<br>
<br>
becuase that was the width of two horses asses.<br>

as to other stuff, the idea of constitution is not as worshipped in most other countrys. From what Ive observed, to most americans the whole constitution seems prety important.<br>
<br>
the way you (you meaning americans) define a country, it sounsd like america is the oldest country in the world. Good Stuff.<br>
<br>
When working to impress us, dont go for the lenght of the consitution appraoch. To me (and most others from outside) constitutions dont mean very much. I dont even know if we have one in New Zealand. Im sure we have something withe similar meaning, but its not important. Its not taught at school. (Maraclaire may not have gone to school but that does NOT mean that we dont have good ones). We have laws. If we decide we want different laws, we get 'em changed.<br>
What you should concentrate on emphising when trying to impress us alien folk is something you do that is cool. Like your kickass military shit. All those aircraft carriers and tanks and missle helecopters and stuff. People may deny it and claim that a powerfull military force is just barbaristic, but deep down, most of us think its pretty cool, and wished we had stuff that nifty to play with.<br>
Over here we have 3 frigates (with about 6 guns total) and no Fighter Jets (they were sold to save money) If I was going to join the Army/Navy/AirForce, i would hate it to be our one. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http:// homepages.ihug.co.nz/~carpetwax/blacksig.jpg " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=boinshar>Boinshar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 234<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/03 9:34 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://frustrated.com/images/boinshar.gif height=102 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grats Legendary and Dark Virtue! =)</span><hr size=1> It all depends on how you define what is a country.<br>
<br>
If you go by the longest standing government, then you can claim that the current US government is 3 years old, and therefore the United States is 3 years old.<br>
<br>
If you go by the longest standing ever-changing constitution in accordance to peaceful change of power every 4 years as well as holding on to a tiny portion of the original ideals of the founders, while maintaining a loose set of framework for a system of government, then the US is the oldest country in the world. <br>
<br>
It just so happens if you go with this definition, the US would also be the only country in the world.<br>

Reread it again, it completely obliterated the point of your new post and I didn't even have to respond.<br>
Rome is not a city, its a papal state, which is very similar to a city-state.  A city state is very similar to a country, and would be a good argument to say that it is a country.<br>
<br>
Podaman:  &quot;No you can't. Not if you date it by when the current system of government was formed. America has the oldest uninterupted government in existence.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Yes you can, because you don't date a country by the current system of government.  I already explained that when I defined country for you in an above post.  You guys are all defining states or nations-not country.<br>
<br>
Arleanna: &quot;Count, by your definition, Peurto Rico is a country, California is a country, Czechoslavakia is still a country. Hell, me and my neighbors are our own country since we all live in the same spot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not true.  A country is a geological location under the rule of a government.  A country remains a country even if the government of that country changes.  If you really want to get technical about California is not a country because it is PART of a country, part of the U.S.  If California were to break away from the U.S. and decide to run on it own it would still be part of the &quot;country&quot; of America-or North America in specific.  Its government would have changed, but it is still the same geological location.  Puerto Rico IS a country.  Why?  Because even though it is part of the state of &quot;U.S.&quot; it is still its own seperate geological location (the defining term). Czechoslavakia is a country, the country of the slav people.  Each individual state of the U.S. has the right to retract from the federal government and become its own seperate state unbound by the federal government, and not only has the right, but also the means.  Each state is self sufficient, but they would still be part of the country of America.  <br>
<br>
&quot;But to the rest of the world a country is defined by it's state. And a state is defined by it's document outlining it's structure to the rest of the world. Usualy this document must be acknowledged by other states before they will do business with you or recognize your people's claim to any territory.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, a state is defined by its doctrine.  A country remains strictly geological.  Russia can never become the country of England because its a different spot on the map.  However, the Russian people could consider themselves Brits if they wanted to become part of the state of Brittain.  They wouldn't be English, they would be Russian, and they would be Brits.  You guys are talking about terms that are like apples and oranges, and its completely understandable considering this topic is not the easiest to figure out.<br>
<br>
&quot;So while you may have some romantic attachment to England or China or whatever as the &quot;world's oldest country&quot;, the fact is that America has them all beat. That's not to say that another country hasn't been formed that may have a better idea how do things, but America does have more experience than anyone else in peaceful self government department. It's really not a debateable issue. We're the oldest country. Get over it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oldest state yes, not country.  America also has not had the longest period of peace for itself.  Switzerland has had much longer internal peace than America (who has had only 150 years of internal peace in the sense of no civil war).  I could name plenty other states that had longer internal peace if you force me to look them up.<br>
<br>
&quot;And your arguement about the Romans was very speculative and fataly flawed. The Romans had a monarchy with a weak senate and no constitution that provided for the rights of the people. Like I said, if they had our constitution I believe they would still be kicking. Much like we will probably be in 2000 years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why was it fatally flawed?  Its not flawed, its complete logical deduction.  There is no way that a representative for each part of the empire could stay semi-permanently in Rome in order to tell Rome what needs to be done for their part because in order to know what is needed they need to be in that part-not Rome.  The travel time between parts, depending on distance, was always weeks and many times months.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;just because a country's government changes doesnt make it a new country&quot;<br>
<br>
sure it does.&quot;<br>
<br>
Typical statement of someone who doesn't know what &quot;country&quot; means.  Lets try looking information up before we post here eh?<br>
<br>
In the end, all I see from the pro-america-is-older side is that &quot;we are allowed to make changes and keep the same &quot;country&quot; but the side we are arguing against is not.&quot;  Plain and simple.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So it's safe to say North America had a government system long before England, Spain, France, Denmark, Germany, etc existed as ANY form of government. Many of the barbarian hordes that attacked Greece and Rome settled into what's now known as Germany. France. England (LONG before Australia and New Zealand. Both of which were colonized around the same time North America was..... by SPAIN)&quot;<br>
<br>
And yet you have no primary source for it, because if you did-I would have heard about it being that I am a history major.  Documents for Indian populations cease to exist, mostly because they had no form of writing (go figure).  To be a country the people have to have a general concensus to being tied to their land in agreement.  The indians were very tribal oriented, not geographical, and definitely not politically bound.  There was little system of law outside of a tribe and many indians were nomadic peoples due to the harsh winters in north america.  If they had come together and declared themselves as one people for a geological area then yes, but you gotta show documents for that.<br>

In the end, the definition of country is what matters.  For all you out there that don't know, &quot;country&quot; is a geological group of people ruled under a government and therefore recognized in the world.  It says nothing about &quot;the government has to stay the same&quot;.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ishmialmuaddib>Ishmial Muaddib</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Urkelbot</span><br>  Posts: 533<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/03 11:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grats Legendary and Dark Virtue! =)</span><hr size=1> Short and to the point.

Ok... at this point we're arguing semantics.  Yes, you are 100% correct given the way you have chosen to define country and seperate the concept of country from that of nation state. <br>
<br>
If you define a country by its boundaries, how do you handle shifting borders?  Is southern Arizona part of the country of Mexico or the US (we purchased it in the 20th century as the Gadsen Purchase).  What about Hawaii and Alaska?  It sounds like by your treatment of Puerto Rico you would say they are not part of the US either?  While boundaries in North America have remained relatively static over the last 100 years, boundaries outside North America have been relatively fluid.  Do you then date a country by its last shift in borders?  <br>
<br>
Rather than boundaries, it sounds like you are really defining a country by how long the name has existed.  In that sense, the US is indeed a very new country.<br>
<br>
As to my other questions -  Yes, the width of the space shuttle boosters is determined by the width of two horses asses - roman war horses that is.  Lucifar had it essentialy right, leaving out only that the runts in the road were made by Roman chariots whose wheels were uniformly spaced and were so designed based on the average width of the horses that pulled them. <br>
<br>
US common law comes from English common law.  When we became the United States we adopted in whole all English common law up until 1776.  And if you think that's just semantics, there's a large case that was recently resolved in California in which the marsh and tidelands provisions of English common law was invoked, and that traces itself all the way back to the Magna Carta.  Louisiana doesn't use a common law system because its legal system comes from the French Napoleonic Code... although they got it from Spain, not from France.  California was the first community property state because it's part of the Treaty of Hidalgo when we took California from Mexico.  Mexico would only surrender California to us if we adopted that law (and others). <br>

<br>
That's what I mean by fatal flaw in your logic.<br>
<br>
All the rest of your post is just you arguing semantics. That's fine, but remember this whole line of debate started because Dumai chose to offer up a statement based on the most popular definition of &quot;country&quot; used in political science, and got called an idiot by the real idiots.<br>
<br>
Dumai was right, end of that debate. <br>
<br>
[Jingo mode] Now you are free to debate how horrible the US is all you want. It doesn't affect me. I know how awesome we are and nothing any greasy foreigner says will change my opinion. My parents were the children of Prussian and German immigrants. They left because it sucked and there was no future for their families that didn't invovle raising your hand in salute to a dictator. Before my grand parents died they all said, &quot;Thank god for America&quot;. Thank god, indeed. [/jingo mode]<br>

What a lot of the Europeans (especially the British) seem to forget is that they were once in the same situation.  During the time when &quot;the sun never sets on the British Empire&quot; they too had problems with the poor (debtors prison... great idea), crime (Australia was used as a prison colony) and I am pretty sure that the rest of them thought that they were the shit too.  It comes down to who has the &quot;big stick&quot;.
