8&lt;=================================<br>
 Osama bin Laden Urges Attacks on the U.S.<br>
<br>
<br>
Following is the translated transcript of Osama bin Laden's message as aired on the al Jazeera satellite network.<br>
<br>
PURPORTED TO BE OSAMA BIN LADEN (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): In the name of Allah, the merciful and the compassionate, a message to our brothers in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Greetings, all you who believe in Allah and worship him as he deserves and do not die unless you are Muslims.<br>
<br>
We are following with great interest and utmost concern the preparations by the crusaders to occupy the capital of Islam formally (ph) and to rob the wealth of Muslims and to appoint over you an agent government that follows Washington and Tel Aviv, like all other treacherous and spy Arab governments, in preparation for the founding of the greater Israel. So may Allah help us.<br>
<br>
We wish to stress on the threshold of this war, the war of the infidels and disbelievers, which the U.S. is launching with a number of its allies and agents.<br>
<br>
First, the sincerity of intentions for the fighting should be for the sake of Allah only, no other, and not for the victory of national minorities or for the aid of the infidel regimes in all Arab countries, including Iraq. Allah Almighty said those who believe fight for the sake of Allah and those who did not believe fight for the sake of the Devil. So fight the allies of the Devil for the Devil is weak.<br>
<br>
Second, we remind that victory comes from Allah Almighty alone, and we only have to do our best through preparations and incitement and jihad. Allah Almighty said, all you who believe, if you fight for the sake of Allah he will give you victory and strengthen your feet. And we should hurry to repent to Allah from our sins, especially the biggest sins.<br>
<br>
As the prophet, peace be upon, him said, &quot;Avoid the seven big sins; not believing in Allah, magic, killing of souls that God forbid unless it's justified, taking interest, taking the money of the orphan, and accusing unwittingly (ph) pious Muslim women of sins.&quot; That is agreed to. And also, the rest of the big sins, such as adultery and alcohol and disobeying the parents and giving false testimony. We should rush to obey Allah in general, especially to mention Allah at the time when the armies meet.<br>
<br>
Abu-Adarda (ph), may Allah bless him, said, &quot;A good deed at the time of the invasion for you fight with your actions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Third, it became apparent to us through our defense and fighting of the American enemy that it relies mainly in war on the psychological war, given its huge media machine and reliance on air strike to hide its main weak points, which are fear and cowardice and absence of the fighting spirit among American soldiers. Those soldiers are completely convinced about the injustice of their government and its lies, and they lack a fair cause to fight for. And they are rather fighting for the capitalist and interest hoarders (ph), and weapons and oil merchants, including the criminal gang at the White House, which harbors crusader hatreds and personal hatreds from Bush the father.<br>
<br>
It's also become apparent to us that the most effective way to empty the air power of its contents is by establishing trenches that are covered and camouflaged in large numbers.<br>
<br>
I have previously pointed that out last year in the Tora Bora mountain (ph), that great fight in which the power of belief overcame the material power of evil by holding fast to the principles of Allah Almighty. And I will mention to you a part of that great battle to show the extent of their cowardice on one hand, and the degree of effectiveness of trenches in the war of attrition against them on the other.<br>
<br>
Our number were at least 300 mujahideen. We dug 100 trenches spread over one square mile at the rate of one trench per (inaudible) to avoid incurring injuries from the strikes.<br>
<br>
And our centers were targeted from the first hour of the American strike on (inaudible) 20th, the year 1422 Hegira, or corresponding to October 7th, 2001. We were subjected to intense strikes and then it continued intermittently until the middle of Ramadan, and after that, on the morning of the 12 in Ramadan, intensive air strikes began after the American leader was certain that Al Qaida elements were in Tora Bora, including this humble servant, and that rebel fighter Dr. Aminizara (ph). And the flights were around the clock, so not a second passed without military planes flying over our heads day and night.<br>
<br>
Wherein in the Pentagon, command center, devoted with all its allied forces, was determined with all its allied forces to blow up this tiny spot and annihilate it. So the airplanes poured fire over us, especially after they ended their mission in Afghanistan. The American airplanes hit us with smart bombs and heavy bombs, and string (ph) bombs, and also used bombs that penetrated caves and also bombers like B-52. The circuits were two hours over our heads, and each time fired 20 to 30 bombs. And the C-130 airplanes bombed us with carpet bombs and other murderous bombs.<br>
<br>
Despite this tremendous bombing, which was coupled with the outrageous media campaign, that was unprecedented on this time (inaudible), not to mention the hypocritical (ph) forces used to fight us for two continuous months, we managed to confront all their daily attacks, thanks be to Allah, and we forced them back each time defeated, carrying their dead and injured.<br>
<br>
Despite all that, the American forces did not dare to invade our location. So what clearer proof is there to their cowardice and fear and lies and their alleged (inaudible) surrounding their forces?<br>
<br>
The conclusion of the battle was the great and miserable failure of the forces of evil over a small group of mujahideen, a group of 300 in the trenches inside one square mile, at a temperature that was 10 degrees below 0. The result of the battle was the death of a few of us, 6 percent approximately. We prayed that Allah will accept them as martyrs. And as for our injuries in the trenches, it was at the rate of 2 percent, thanks be to Allah.<br>
<br>
So if all the international forces of evil could not achieve its goals over one square mile and a small number of mujahideen with very humble capabilities, how can these evil forces achieve victory over the Islamic world? This is impossible, Allah willing, if the people held fast to their religion and insisted on fighting for his sake.<br>
<br>
So our brother fighters in Iraq, do not be scared by what Americans promote about the greatness of its forces and their smart bombs and laser-guided bombs, for smart bombs have no mentionable effect in the middle of mountains and trenches and plains and forests. They must have an obvious target.<br>
<br>
As for the trenches, they are well camouflaged, and neither smart bombs nor dumb bombs will be able to get them unless by haphazard bombing which squanders the ammunition of the enemy and its money. So use trenches. As Amar (ph), may peace be upon him, said, &quot;Take cover with the land.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is take the land as a shield, for that is sufficient to exhaust the ammunition of the enemy within a few months. As for the daily fight, then it's something that can be easily dealt with.<br>
<br>
We also advise you to lead the enemy to prolonged and heavy and exhaustive fighting using the camouflage defense fight in plains, mountains, farms and cities.<br>
<br>
What the enemy fears most is the war of cities and streets, that war that the enemy expects tremendous, grave losses in. So we also stress the importance of suicide operations against the enemy, those operations that cause so much harm to the enemy in the U.S. and Israel and they have never seen anything like them in their history, thanks be to Allah.<br>
<br>
We also stress that anyone who assists the U.S. from among the Iraqi hypocrites or Arab rulers, or those who accept their actions and follow them in their crusader war, whether by fighting with them or through providing administrative support or any other form of support or help, even verbal, to kill Muslims in Iraq, they should know that they are infidels deviating from their religion and their blood is sanctioned.<br>
<br>
Allah Almighty said, &quot;All you who believe, do not take Jews and Christians as supporters. Some of them support each other, and those who take them as supporters then they are a part of them.&quot; Allah doesn't guide unjust people.<br>
<br>
We also stress that Muslims have to move and incite and organize the nation into armies to face these great events and harsh conditions, and to liberate themselves from the slavery of these unjust and infidel regimes enslaved by the U.S. From among the most ready for liberation are Jordan, Morocco, Nigeria and Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.<br>
<br>
It's also not hidden that this crusader war targets first and foremost Islam, irrespective of whether the Ba'ath Party and Saddam were deposed or not.<br>
<br>
The Muslims in general and the Iraqis in particular have to prepare for jihad against this unjust campaign, and have to make sure to load up on ammunition and weapons, for that is their duty.<br>
<br>
Allah Almighty said, &quot;Let them take care and pay attention to their weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
The infidels wished you would forget about your weapons and your belongings so that they can launch an all-out attack on them.<br>
<br>
It's known that fighting to achieve victory for the infidels is not permissible. And you know the Muslim's belief should be clear when fighting that it should be for the sake of Allah. As the prophet, peace be upon him, said, &quot;Whoever fought to raise the word of Allah, then he's fighting for the sake of Allah.&quot;<br>
<br>
And it doesn't harm in these conditions the interest of Muslims to agree with those of the socialists in fighting against the crusaders, even though we believe the socialists are infidels. For the socialists and the rulers have lost their legitimacy a long time ago, and the socialists are infidels regardless of where they are, whether in Baghdad or in Aden (ph).<br>
<br>
And this fighting about to take place resembles the fight with the Romans earlier and the collusion of interest doesn't harm, for the Muslims' fight against the Romans was due to the collusion of the interests with the Persians.<br>
<br>
Before concluding, we stress the importance of optimism and keeping good spirits, and warn against pessimism and dejection and fear. The prophet said, &quot;Be a harbinger of good news and do not spread pessimism.&quot; And he also said, &quot;The voice of Abultaha (ph) addressing the army is better than a thousand men.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was mentioned in the narrative that a man told Herod (ph) on the day of the Armuk (ph) battle how numerous are the Romans and how few are the Muslims. So Herod (ph) told him, &quot;Wrong is that what you said, for the armies do not achieve victory by mere numbers, but are defeated through leydown (ph) and such words.&quot;<br>
<br>
So let the words of Allah be before your eyes: &quot;If you know the enemy, then hit their necks and let your encounter with the crusaders follow what the poet said. Do not let your aim be anything but striking beneath our (ph) necks.&quot;<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I advise you and myself to be pious to Allah and (inaudible) in open, and to be patient and persevere in the jihad so the victory is patient for one hour. And I also advise myself and you to mention Allah and pray to him. Allah Almighty said, &quot;All you who believe, if you meet the enemy hold fast and mention the name of Allah often so that you may win.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh Allah, the sender of the book, and mover of the clouds and defeater of the enemy, defeat them. Let us be victorious and let us be victorious over them. Let us be victorious and let us be victorious over them. Let us be victorious and let us be victorious over them. Let us be victorious and let us be victorious over them.<br>
<br>
And as Allah said, &quot;Make us do good things on Earth and good things in eternity, and protect us against torture of Hell.&quot; And may Allah have peace upon his prophet, Mohammed.<br>

<br>
Not exactly. He says it's perfectly acceptable to join forces with the &quot;infidels&quot; in Iraq to beat down us American infidels, as the Iraqi infidels and Osama's followers share a common enemy, a greater enemy.<br>
<br>
I fully agree it is not proof of a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq, but it does show that Osama ain't exactly against the idea of helping good ol' Saddam out against those damn crusaders. I actually believe the purpose of the government making such a big deal out of this tape is to quiet down the skeptics whose main reason for denying an Iraq-Al Qaeda link is their belief that Osama would rid the world of Saddam's government himself before joining forces with him. This tape does, at least in my eyes, squash that idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2315<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/13/03 4:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=415.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bin Laden tape...</span><hr size=1> I took it more as cheering on the sidelines.

Terry Jones Sunday January 26, 2003 The Observer (UK)  I'm really excited by George Bush's latest reason for bombing Iraq: he's running out of patience. And so am I! For some time now I've been really pissed off with Mr Johnson, who lives a couple of doors down the street. Well, him and Mr Patel, who runs the health food shop. They both giveme queer looks, and I'm sure Mr Johnson is planning something nastyfor me, but so far I haven't been able to discover what. I've been round to his place a few times to see what he's up to, but he's got everything well hidden. That's how devious he is. As for Mr Patel, don't ask me how I know, I just know - from very good sources - that he is, in reality, a Mass Murderer. I have leafleted the street telling them that if we don't act first, he'll pick us off one by one. Some of my neighbours say, if I've got proof, why don't I go to the police? But that's simply ridiculous. The police will say that they need evidence of a crime with which to charge my neighbours. They'll come up with endless red tape and quibbling about the rights and wrongs of a pre-emptive strike and all the while Mr Johnson will be finalising his plans to do terrible things to me, while Mr Patel will be secretly murdering people. Since I'm the only one in the street with a decent range of automatic firearms, I reckon it's up to me to keep the peace. But until recently that's been a little difficult. Now, however, George W. Bush has made it clear that all I need to do is run out of patience, and then I can wade in and do whatever I want! And let's face it, Mr Bush's carefully thought-out policy towards Iraq is the only way to bring about international peace and security. The one certain way to ! stop Muslim fundamentalist suicide bombers targeting the US or the UK is to bomb a few Muslim countries that have never threatened us. That's why I want to blow up Mr Johnson's garage and kill his wife and children. Strike first! That'll teach him a lesson. Then he'll leave us in peace and stop peering at me in that totally unacceptable way. Mr Bush makes it clear that all he needs to know before bombing Iraq is that Saddam is a really nasty man and that he has weapons of mass destruction - even if no one can find them. I'm certain I've just as much justification for killing Mr Johnson's wife and children as Mr Bush has for bombing Iraq. Mr Bush's long-term aim is to make the world a safer place by eliminating 'rogue states' and 'terrorism'. It's such a clever long-term aim because how can you ever know when you've achieved it? How will Mr Bush know when he's wiped out all terrorists? When every single terrorist is dead? But then a terrorist is only a terrorist once he's committed an act of terror. What about would-be terrorists? These are the ones you really want to eliminate, since most of the known terrorists, being suicide bombers, have already eliminated themselves. Perhaps Mr Bush needs to wipe out everyone who could possibly be a future terrorist? Maybe he can't be sure he's achieved his objective until every Muslim fundamentalist is dead? But then some moderate Muslims might convert to fundamentalism. Maybe the only really safe thing to do would be for Mr Bush to eliminate all Muslims? It's the same in my street. Mr Johnson and Mr Patel are just the tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of other people in the street who I don't like and who - quite frankly - look at me in odd ways. No one will be really safe until I've wiped them all out. My wife says I might be going too far but I tell her I'm simply using the same logic as the President of the United States. That shuts her up. Like Mr Bush, I've run ! out of patience,and if that's a good enough reason for the President, it's good enough for me. I'm going to give the whole street two weeks - no, 10 days -to come outin the open and hand over all aliens and interplanetary hijackers, galactic outlaws and interstellar terrorist masterminds, and if they don't hand them over nicely and say 'Thank you', I'm going to bomb the entire street to kingdom come. It's just as sane as what George W. Bush is proposing - and, in contrast to what he's intending, my policy will destroy only one street.<br>

If that were the case, and they're still roaming about, the entire town would show itself to be a buncha gullible, passive slow moving morons who are about to be murdered one by one, except Terry Jones, who is tough as nails and won't take anymore BS, despite his ignorant neighbors.  And Mr. Terry Jones doesn't have Britain to help him level his street.
