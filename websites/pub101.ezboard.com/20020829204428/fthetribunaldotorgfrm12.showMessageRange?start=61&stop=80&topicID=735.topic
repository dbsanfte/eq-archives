Darkmask, I honestly don't think we are arguing the same topic. I am saying that ubers have an easier time at their epics because they have more resouces to draw on. You are saying that ubers have a harder time of it because they have less time. You claim you tried to see the smaller guilds point of view but you really didn't get it. 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Time is a HUGE resource, Oppurtunity is a HUGE resource, those are the resources in which we lack. That is all I am trying to get accross. <br>
<br>
I KNOW it is very hard for small guilds to take down mobs sometimes, I know the difficulties of organizing small raids, trying convince people to come.<br>
<br>
I was in smaller guilds before EV, I understand what it was like. The one thing smaller guilds have that larger guilds lose sight of it, individual goals of players, because you are so tight knight and small you can focus more on those things. <br>
<br>
Like False, most of my epic was down with outside help, I did manage to grab a few guildies late at night, but most of those guildies stayed more because they were my friend then they felt obligated to stay out of guild raid. Mojak, Skyliu, Chaichai, Alcamir, Kilil, Dalyct, Rhyse, and more went to hate several times for some pile of dust of a vampire which drops WAY too infrequently.<br>
<br>
When I did the monkey and iskar shm, I had members of SI/Legendary/VV helping, Karthunk, Swanson, Yugg *my mind goes blank on my little dwarf cleric, great little guy * Adobe, Sylena.<br>
<br>
It wasnt easy to beg people to come, but because of good people and good friends like Draelon, Kealii, Alcamir, Kilil, Mylis, Ulax and more they helped me aqquire my epic and things like that I will never forget.<br>
<br>
Epics are hard, they can destroy friendships if you arent careful, or they can help you see the wonderful friends you have who are more then willing to sit with you somewhere hours on end to watch a spot in a game. <br>
<br>
I know it is hard to get an epic when you dont have the necessary muscle to kill a mob, I know the frustration sitting their waiting for people and seeing someone else creep in, I know the dissapointment of thinking your epic item has dropped, but after you get up after kneeling down telling everyone, No, it didnt drop.  It might be easier to take down some mobs, but always getting a group from you &quot;uber&quot; guild doesnt happen, often times it is down with pick up groups late at night, ITS frustrating for everyone working on an epic, but I wish you all luck with it.<br>

By your definition, if I had a thousand guildmates I would get my epic almost automatically? Nah, that isn't how it's done. If you think EV are gonna port the guild out of a guild raid to kill RF or another epic spawn, you're smoking crack. <p><big><center>

Well since we're talking about epics, I didn't know it was possible for members of ubers to get six epics.  Congratulations on one of the MOST ignorant and assinine statements of this whole thread.

Hon, sit back and think....... a 20 member guild has 20 epics to do. A 120 member guild has 120 epics to do. 120 epics is 6 times 20 epics, get it? Not to mention, that with that many members, someone is always doing one quest or another and asking for help, someone is always almost 60, or almost to that next AA point and wants to just exp til they ding, some is sitting there drooling because the 10th ring guy is spawned, etc etc. We have so much more available to us, that it spreads the people out so much more, so when we are not on a raid, it is harder to get them focused on helping you. <br>
<br>
Plus you have to remember, a lot of smaller guilds full scale raids are for epics, none of ours are. You *can* (not saying always, but can) have the entire guild focus on that one mob to finish it up for you, people in the uber guilds can't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwalkabout.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/18/02 7:30:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My 2cp</span><hr size=1> Lilum&gt;Just because you're in a larger guild does not mean you have more goals to reach.<br>

If you are part of a raiding guild, guild raids &gt; personal raids. A raiding guild isn't a guild that does an occational raid, it's a guild that primarily raids. And no, epic raids don't count as a guild raid, they're 1-2 group efforts. Noone in my guild would help me doing my epic during the comps prime time (1pm EST to 6-7pm EST), they would be raiding with the rest of the guild somewhere.<br>
<br>
'Normal-guild' situation :<br>
<br>
Each member of the guild have their personal goals<br>
If it doesn't crash with the occational raid, guildmates may help during prime time.<br>
<br>
'Uber-guild' situation :<br>
<br>
Each member of the guild have their personal goals<br>
Uber-guilds raid every day, you need to get help outside of guild and do it outside of your guilds prime time.<br>

<br>
The 120 people in an Über-guild each want their epic, 120 epics (1 per member)<br>
The 20 people not in an Über-guild each want their epics, 20 epics (1 per member)<br>
<br>
So, 20 x <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> = 120 - that's what I meant about 6 times the goals, I'm sorry if I dropped you here.<br>
<br>
The non Über-guild members can set up a raid to kill mob-x for member-y's epic, the Über-guild's members are not so lucky, noone will schedule a raid during prime time for me to kill mob-x, if I wanted my epic I would have to work hard for it no matter my guild affiliation. Tell me again how Über-guilds are getting epics easier now that I explained this to you.<br>
<br>
I've been in both kinds of guilds, the &quot;old&quot; Companions where it was mostly about getting people epics and doing small raids like monday evening FG raid, and the &quot;new&quot; Companions which is a 100% raiding guild, so I might know what I'm talking about - we did <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lots</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> more scheduled epic encounters back in the &quot;old&quot; Companions compared to now where we do none. I can damn well assure you that it was easier to get an epic in the &quot;old&quot; Companions than in the &quot;new&quot; Companions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujonlee2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jonlee2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/18/02 7:59:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My 2cp</span><hr size=1> You utter monkfish.<br>

Having 120 well equipped people in your guild doesn't mean jack if they're always busy.  About the only valid point your argument has is that the actual person getting the Epic will be well equipped... but how relevant is that on the epic raids that require at least 1-2 groups?<br>
<br>
Read False's post - how much does it look like E/V's &quot;resources&quot; assisted him in getting his epic?<br>
<br>
I'm not in an &quot;uber guild&quot;, but this very issue has been plaguing us lately as well... most of the guild would rather raid somewhere more interesting than the typical epic trip that we've all done twenty times... we would rather go somewhere new or try something we haven't tried before.  Obviously these goals VERY rarely coincide... and people who are doing their epic quests often whine that they are receiving little to no guild support.  I can only imagine that this problem is even *worse* in a truly uber guild that raids 6 out of 7 days of the week, compared to Revolution's fairly easygoing schedule and level of guild development.<br>
<br>
DM and False made a helluva lot more sense than you and Trindle.  Sounds like a bunch of sour grapes and judgemental bitching to me.  (MY epic is harder than YOUR epic!!)  Like DM said, *everyone* has it rough, epics are supposed to be hard... different people have different challenges and problems to be worked out.  To worry about who has it harder, or to worry about anyone but your own self/friends/guild is rather pointless imo... just shut up and go do the damn quest!  Of course, you've got people like Dennli and Trindle who have it in for the ubers and take any chance they can get to bitch at them, justified or not.<br>
<br>
Of course, none of this has anything to do with the original topic of the post, unfortunately.  Revolution needs to get flamed more often, then lurking around here would be a lot more interesting.<br>

It is easy for you to point fingers at us &amp; say we have an easy time getting epics since we are have so many people and so many recourses, etc. And yet for some reason, that pearl stayed in my sack for 4 months &amp; I consider myself damn lucky. Genadena has had hers for almost a year &amp; the bottleneck continues to grow.<br>
<br>
Ya know, I understand that smaller guilds have problems with numbers and recourses, but I am getting tired of the sad comments that we have can just get epics all the time crap. I am not saying we have it better off than you guys. You want to be the kid at school who talks about how bad he has it, then go right ahead, but fucking quit it with the Ubers have it so easy shit.<br>
<br>
If ya do, please send Gena a tell &amp; tell her that cleric epics are a dime a dozen for us. I am sure she will agree. <p><BR>

Maybe rogue too, simply because its so easy to get and translates into good damage on raids.<br>

Hence, when you ask your guild to help you with druid epic or whatnot, you're just gonna get ignored most likely since your epic is so piss poor and doesnt help the guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelcheproudfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 528<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/18/02 11:19:29 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://images.about.com/specials/service/promotion/sod/male_lead_stealer/josh_ryan_evans.jpg width=129 height=163></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid Ezboard</span><hr size=1> our warrior epics have helped us a lot in maintaining agro.  <p><font size="-2" face="verdana">Elche Proudfoot<BR>
