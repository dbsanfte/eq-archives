index=3 was taken by Xalvis when he posted for access to the members section. <br>
<br>
And since Myrtle now has a total whopping post count of 5 on our board.<br>
<br>
Also EZBoard does not show posts made by other accounts within EZBoard Global or Local. It only shows what the recent posts are for that account.<br>

<br>
EZBoard has a bug. <br>
<br>
In the recent posts section of someone it does not remove this link even if the thread is removed. <br>
<br>
Myrtle thread for access to the members section was deleted a while ago, since that time Xalvis posted for access to the members section in turn taken up the index ID that was in the recent posts made by Myrtle. So in effect both accounts now show that as a most recent post. Unless of course Xalvis is more chatty than Mrytle is.<br>
<br>
If you had looked at the original thread this was attached too instead of jumping to conclusions you would come to the same conclusion. But then again I do not expect any less from this board.<br>

I guess I can say it again..  <br>
<br>
maybe you should read it slower this time.. as the speed at which I type it will have no effect on your reading comprehension skills..<br>
<br>
Your desperation and recruitment practices are the RESULT .. not the cause... <br>
<br>
With me not being a member of EV..  It seems like YOU would have a better idea of the CAUSE than I do..  As an outsider I am much more familiar with the RESULTS than the causes..  But since you have shown ZERO aptitude here for problem solving..  I will toss you a couple hints.. <br>
<br>
We can start with your guildleader..    He is so weak willed that he ADMITTEDLY tosses any semblance of CHARACTER he may have had out the window..  over nothing more than one OOC by myself .. <br>
<br>
EV as a guild was founded on TWO principles.  Being the BEST guild on the server.. and being the most EXCLUSIVE guild on the server..  since you personally are just somebody from Legendary who jumped on teh bandwagon..  I will understand that you do not know what YOUR GUILD was founded on.   The sad fact is that you guys are FAR from exclusive..  with recent events being proof of that..   And being the best..  LOL..  Seems to me all you guys do anymore is wait to see what Comps are gonna do next..  and then rush out and try to do it ALSO.. <br>
<br>
Second and third hand information follows..  but its from reliable sources.. and judging from MY experiences with your guildleader..  They are not hard to believe..   But apparently alot of the dissent and loot arguments of late,  have centered around the fact that your guildleader and his immediate friends recieve the best and newest gear to drop..  While you are not continuing to farm the stuff you have already done.  this leads to a clique within the guild who has better equipment lamenting in the bank on Mojak's buddies.. than some of your active members are wearing.   This is never a good thing..   But it sure seems believable....<br>
<br>
Bottom line is..   It seems you guys are living off the past.  Not being able to claim exclusivity.. or excellence anymore..  You have been reduced to a guild held together by greed.. and persuit of better gear..   I remember a day when people would strive to be the best possible EQ PLAYER.. and thus gain entrance to EV.   These days..  those people go to Comps or even RNG..  the people you YOU get.. are those who are just out to improve their KIT.. <br>
<br>
<br>
The sad fact is..  that with the absence of any purpose or values at the highest levels of your guild..  you have nothing to look foreward to except better gear..  That combined with the trickle down loot policy you currently use..  Its no surprise that you had two dozen people leave at once the other day..  <br>
<br>
<br>
Revolution is not an uber guild.  we may never kill WHOEVER.. or clear WHATEVER.   You have heard me make no such claims..  However.. what we are is a guild held together by .. Common VALUES .. Common GOALS .. and Friendship..  <br>
<br>
<br>
things that I wouldnt really expect a guild hopper like yourself to understand..   Good luck on your next piece of loot..  Its all you have to look foreward to..<br>

<br>
<br>
As much as I hate to admit it..  Im starting to think that his keeping the Manna robe we let him wear was a good thing also..<br>
<br>
<br>
Im having a BLAST laughing at the desperation which EV has fallen into.   Watching their desperate struggle as they grasp for every and any lvl 60 who they can get to wear their tag is fuckin HILARIOUS..  Considering I once respected and even admired EV as a guild.. <br>
<br>
Of course..  its under new management now.. and is little more than a laughing stock.  Like the 60 year old drunkard who hit 50 homeruns 40 years ago, who shows up at all the old timer games hoping for a little applause to make his pitiful , meaningless life seem a little less empty than it really is..As his name is called over the loudspeaker,  a handful of historians have to clue in the people  sitting around them that YES..  this guy was great once.   But its a shame to see him in the state he is in now... <br>
<br>

It's sad that everyone always assumes that every guild problem boils down to loot issues. Like if everyone got the loot they wanted that any and all others issues would magically disappear and everything would be golden.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - I realize loot is a major part of the game, but it is not the be all, end all that people make it out to be though. <p><br>

The FIRST word that was created using ALL CAPS was the 62nd word of the post.<br>

Furthermore the POST in its ENTIRETY was 225 words contained 3 word formed with entirely capital letters.

 Who ever heard of you? Does the fact you don't know someone out of the thousands that play everyday mean shit? You pompous ass... <br>
 The fact still remains that the person left our guild with a piece of our guilds equipment and you think it is ok. Yet you will give anyone leaving your guild a rash of shit if they tried the same with droppables? A bit of a double standard.<br>
 No?<br>

I've been meaner to you than you probably deserve..  <br>
<br>
<br>
but maybe not.. <br>
<br>
I will leave you alone now..  Regardless....<br>
<br>
<br>
but to leave on a bright note..   Your little .. WHO ARE YOU is only effective on those who have not been around.  We have argued on this board..  we argued on Talamay's board.  you have even come to the REVO board and argued with me before..  you are very much aware of who I am.  But I cant fault you for trying to play it off..    <br>
<br>
sucks to be you doesn't it..   <br>
<br>
At least take consolation in the fact that EV was on the way down before you took it over.   You were just the poor bastard who got to be at the helm at the point you fell to 2nd best..   As much as your lack of character has facilitated the decline..   you are hardly at fault.. <br>

<br>
As Mojak stated earlier, he was in tells with the accused about the item when the bitch logged in (supposedly- I still think she went to that zone to be an ass, but thats just me) and decided to slander this person in OOC where we were raiding.. <br>
It was rather pathetic, as these things should be handled in tells (as Mojak stated he was in) between officers/GL's or whomever it involves.. <br>
Thus making him just say fuck it....<br>
<br>
I mean you see shit like that and it makes you not even give a shit about the said loot/problem as you all cant even conduct matters of importance in a civil manner, you have to follow players around just to OOC shit in hopes that it will cause problems, in which it didnt in this case...<br>

When a situation like this arises you might notice most of the people in the guild dont really bother to give a straight on response. We just dont give a shit.<br>

When i get a pimple on my nose once a year, i dont run to the doctor and scream that i'm dieing. I pop the fucker, wipe the shit on my shirt, and go about my day ignoring it till it goes away. You are the pimple.  <p><table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4"><tr><td>

Xav is the guild leader of Revolution. Unlike a rejected aplicant gone postal looking to vent on the flameboards, he actually is making points, and so far no one has touched him.<br>
<br>
For christ sake Krickett can't even dish out a decent flame on him and that's all he's ever been good for.<br>
<br>
What I've noticed so far is no one .. not one person, has actually rebutted or refuted any of his comments. You can make fun of the caps lock, the spelling errors, fucking up the ezcodes (read the faq's moron) pretend he's a nobody and thus has no right to even say anything, but not a single person has actually called him on what he's been saying, or tried to retaliate. I'm just waiting for someone to try and tackle him head on, cause for fucks sake, he's been asking for it. And no one is giving him a run for his money. <br>
<br>
I mean can it be that hard to disprove him? Or is everything he is saying right on the money? Are EV washed out? Have they taken a back seat to the companions? Are they looking to recruit any and everyone level 60 with AA points? Do they take people with &quot;stolen&quot; goods regardless or the fact, even though that is something they would never stand for? Is Mojak this less then stellar guild leader with no morals, values, or ethics? I mean this is what Xav is accusing EV of, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one is contradicting him. And sure you could come on here with the generic &quot;We know what we are capable of and don't have to justify that with any remarks on these boards,&quot; but.. well that just wouldn't be any fun would it?<br>
<br>
He's flaming EV, and he's doing it well, so someone put him in his place, anyone? anyone? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=121147" target="_blank"><b>Croneus Titanis</b></a><Br>
