YES - she said things that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>implied</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a policy which Bush did NOT support.  She was... stay with me here... a shitty diplomat.  Her shitty diplomacy is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>indirectly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to blame for Saddam's invasion of Iraq, with Saddam directly to blame.  Aziz's remark states the obvious, which was equally obvious at the time - America would not be happy about an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Glaspie implied otherwise.  She screwed up.  Take note - regardless of that fact, Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was no more or less justified.  He was a clear threat to the region, and he even clearly threated Saudi Arabia with invasion as well.  Were we to ignore this threat simply because one of our diplomats screwed up?  If our ambassador to Germany had said in 1935, &quot;We have no opinion on ethnic conflicts between Germans and Jews.&quot;, would it then necessarily follow that we should not intervene to stop the Holocaust?  Or would it mean that the diplomat was an idiot who did not understand the implications of his statement?  Yes, our ambassadors represent the United States - and when they do so poorly, it is the job of the United States to correct that poor representation of our policy as quickly and effectively as possible.  If you want to get pissed at Glaspie, go ahead.  If you want to get pissed at the bureaucracy and appointment system that put here there, go ahead.  But to claim that the United States of America should ignore clear threats to itself and its interests due to diplomatic bumbling is astoundingly naive and stupid. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2644<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 8:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=506.topic&index=64>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How soon for more support?</span><hr size=1> That is a version I can buy, Caledhon, because it does not blindly deny what was said or give weight to Aziz just because he is saying what you want to hear.<br>

Exactly why I supported the 1st war. Right or wrong, controlling that much oil made him a danger and the rate he could build his military with that amount of funds was truly terrifying. <br>

What I am angry at is that the US never took responsibility for it. Instead they came up with fabrications to demonize him. I am not stupid enough to think that Iraq would have pulled out even if we admitted the mistake, but I do hate the fact that the US rarely if ever admits it's mistakes.<br>
<br>
But I will say that Bush Sr handled the situation extremely well after that and averted what could have been a severe uprising in the Middle East. The man deserves alot of credit for his coalition if nothing else. <p><br>

What do you want?  Glaspie's head in a basket?  Despite her screwup, the fact remains that the United States was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> responsible for Saddam's decision - Saddam was responsible for Saddam's decision.  Glaspie's remark may have pushed him over the decision threshold, but it was still his decision to make.<br>
<br>
&quot;Instead they came up with fabrications to demonize him.&quot;<br>
<br>
We didn't and don't need fabrications to demonize him.  There's reams, tons, heaps of evidence about the horrible brutality, disgusting human rights abuses, etc.  We were fed some bad information, but the fact that the occasional story of Iraqi evil was exaggerated or fabricated is meaningless in the larger scope of things.  Unless, of course, you are prepared to argue that Saddam really isn't thaaat bad, in which case I would be more than happy to direct you to any of the hundreds of examples and stories which are clearly not fabricated or exaggerated.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do hate the fact that the US rarely if ever admits it's mistakes.&quot;<br>
<br>
What would you like - a press release by President Bush explaining the intricacies of diplomacy with Iraq and exactly why and how Glaspie was so damn stupid?  Journalists and scholars managed to do that just fine, that's their job.<br>
<br>
Your lone complaint boils down to, &quot;But the government didn't take out an ad in the New York Times apologizing for its ambassador's stupidity!&quot;  So what?

<br>
What I would like is for facts to be presented instead of the US using misinformation to support a war instead of the truth.<br>
<br>
I don't want to hear how Saddam killed over 100k people in a genocide when our own CIA dismisses that as false. Saddam warned his people to evacuate when the town was overrun. The civilians got caught in a crossfire, much like what you are discussing in the thread on Isreal.<br>
<br>
I don't want us using the war on Iran as a reason for going to war now, because we did everything we could to keep that war going, including funding, arming, and consulting Iraq. We might as well have been fighting that war right beside him - how can we use it as a reason to fight him now? Bush quoted 1 million people dead on the Iranian side... we are just as much responsible for that as Iraq.<br>
<br>
I don't want to keep hearing 9/11 and the war with Iraq in the same sentence. If anyone was behind that it was Saudi Arabia with it's funds and people.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's asking too much, but all I want is honesty. Don't use false facts and misdirection and stories of atrocities that never happened - just lay out our real reasons. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We didn't and don't need fabrications to demonize him. There's reams, tons, heaps of evidence about the horrible brutality, disgusting human rights abuses, etc.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I agree, but those incidents are on a very low scale compared to genocide, the 8 year war with Iran and 9/11. As I have said many times, let the facts speak for themselves - he shoots anyone who opposes him including his own family. He will hold on to power at any cost. But don't embellish those facts like saying he starved his own people when he is the one responsible for Iraq being a modern, westernized state. Maybe there are shortages now, but let's add in the fact that he is under extreme sanctions and still has a military to fund in the face of a US invasion... which anyone could see has been coming for a long time.<br>
<br>
Give the American people the truth and let them decide. Don't make it out to be more or less than what it is, which is exactly what has been done imo.<br>
<br>
How many Americans do you think can actually tell you anything about the history that lead us to where we are now? How many could tell you how Saddam came to power and what he has done since then? How many could even give more than a few sparce facts about current Iraq? And how many of those facts would be regurgitated rhetoric from the evening news?<br>
<br>
This is not Kosovo or Serbia situation and I think it's wrong to present it as such. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What would you like - a press release by President Bush explaining the intricacies of diplomacy with Iraq and exactly why and how Glaspie was so damn stupid? Journalists and scholars managed to do that just fine, that's their job.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Then why do so few know about it? Why does 51% of Americans still believe Iraq was involved in 9/11 when our own CIA has denied it? Why can't most of the public tell you that 19 of the 21 hijackers were Saudi Arabian?<br>
<br>
If we had a well informed public that did their homework, I wouldn't care what this administration said. The problem is that most Americans have neither the time nor the inclination to learn the truth and thus swallow every word that Rush Limabaugh says and every implication the President makes as fact.<br>
<br>
I guess I am nieve, but I just want an honest account of the situation and an administration who will not use exaggeration and false representations to make a case. <p><br>

I don't think we are 100% responsible for Saddam though, nor do I think he is as evil as what we make him out to be. I would put him on the same level as Castro, as he is pretty good if you always agree with him, but he is a murderous letch if you so much as give a hint that you will cross him. Maybe he is worse in that he would starve his people to fund his military in the face of a threat, but then he's not a  Kim Jong Il who will starve masses of his own people to build up the military during peacetime.<br>
<br>
But let's be honest, there are many, many leaders in this world that fit that description. And there are many countries that have VX and Mustard gas - it's not like some high tech weapon, the shit has been around for decades.<br>

Speaking of the Holocaust and WW2, Loegan is completely against that too.  I mean, there is no evidence for him to have believed that the US should have helped its allies in the war.

<br>
Now as for WW2, the german U-boats were sinking our ships constantly.  Not to mention that Hitler had parked them just outside of Boston (marblehead, MA harbor).  His allies, the Japanese, tried a radical approach to bombing the US via balloon that worked far, far better than history lets on; historians today are SHOCKED to find out how many japanese bomb balloons made it to US soil.  There were design flaws, though, and so they were a failure overall.  People as far east as chicago still occasionally find undetonated japanese bombs in the woods and wonder how they got there.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1090<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 10:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=506.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How soon for more support?</span><hr size=1> heh I remember the big hope for the baloons was to start forest fires and terrorize the nation.

<br>
I left out what aziz said at the meeting because it wasn't relative. So here you go, this is for doubting Logan:<br>
<br>
From THE NEW YORK TIMES INTERNATIONAL SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1990 <br>
<br>
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 -- On July 25,President Saddam Hussein of Iraq summoned the United States Ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, to his office in the last high-level contact between the two Governments before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Here are excerpts from a document described by Iraqi Government officials as a transcript of the meeting, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>which also included the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A copy was provided to The New York Times by ABC News, which translated from the Arabic. The State Department has declined to comment on its accuracy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>HUSSEIN: Brother President Mubarak told me they were scared. They said troops were only 20 kilometers north of the Arab League line. I said to him that regardless of what is there, whether they are police, border guards or army, and regardless of how many are there, and what they are doing, assure the Kuwaitis and give them our word that we are not going to do anything until we meet with them. When we meet and when we see that there is hope, then nothing will happen. But if we are unable to find a solution, then it will be natural that Iraq will not accept death, even though wisdom is above everything else. There you have good news.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>AZIZ: This is a journalistic exclusive.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (Is this Aziz being a smartass or what? I love this guy!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>GLASPIE: I am planning to go to the United States next Monday. I hope I will meet with President Bush in Washington next week. I thought to postpone my trip because of the difficulties we are facing. But now I will fly on Monday.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So Loegan, can we agree that Aziz was there, at least? Now as for his &quot;lying&quot; to frontline, you think he is just trying to save face? Wouldn't it help them to admit the US was wrong by attacking after Glespie &quot;gave permission&quot; Which has been confirmed she didn't)? I'm honestly trying to understand your Saddam appologizing and US bashing, but I guess I don't.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh no, everyone's ganging up on me again. I guess I better concede that what was said in that transcript wasn't really said and that Traik Aziz, Saddam's mouthpiece who everyone calls a liar when saying Iraq has no WMD, is suddenly the most honest person in the world because he is saying what they want to hear.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You use a transcript to support your theories and when the transcript is used to prove you are most likely wrong, you attack the transcript's validity! You just failed Debate 101. I'm starting to agree with Telkandore, you are so far gone logical thought is eluding you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2650<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 3:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=506.topic&index=75>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How soon for more support?</span><hr size=1> I have already answered this. Nothing said after the meeting and in front of the cameras changes what was said behind closed doors. The meaning of Saddam was clear, the meaning of our Ambassador was clear, the answer to the reporters question made her mindest and expectations clear. She gave the OK because she thought he would only seize certain areas, not all of Kuwait. Whether the Ambassador had the right to say what she did, I have no idea.<br>
<br>
Yes, Saddam, after being ousted by the US, would lose face by admitting he asked permission from the US to go to war. How would he explain to his people that he was so weak he needed permission from the US to deal with Kuwait? And how would he explain the fact that the US trapped him and he wasn't smart enough to see it coming?<br>
<br>
It's just like these companies who won't admit their networks have been broken into. They know to do so shows weakness and then shareholders and customers will pull out.<br>
<br>
If Saddam shows weakness or indiscretion, then he will be assasinated or be dealing with a revolt. That's how it works with dictators whose power lies in their appearance of strength.<br>
<br>
And yes, I was wrong about Aziz being there, but that does not change the fact that nobody gives him any credibility when he says Iraq has no WMD, so why does he suddenly have credibility when speaking to this?<br>
<br>
He is going to say exactly what Saddam instructs him to say.<br>

<br>
Keep calling Aziz a lier. Everything he told frontline checks out. Glespie was not there to give anyone permission. She was summoned to give Bush a message (a lie) to buy him time to invade Kuwait without US or Egyptian intervention. The only thing that is clear is Glespie was summoned to see Saddam and then lied to when she expressed US concerns. Her comment about staying out of arab relations was for the benefit of Egypt, at thier request, so Egypt could carry out a peaceful settlement to the conflict in good faith. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2653<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 3:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=506.topic&index=77>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How soon for more support?</span><hr size=1> Then where did this come from?<br>

You encouraged this aggression - his invasion. What were you thinking?<br>
<br>
U.S. Ambassador Glaspie -<br>
<br>
Obviously, I didn't think, and nobody else did, that the Iraqis were going to take all of Kuwait.<br>
<br>
How does that fit in with your version?<br>

That is how it fits in with my version. That the US thought he was only going to take the al-Rumeilah oil field, the focal point of the dispute. They didn't give any restrictions though and things blew up.<br>

You originally expressed disgust with the United States and its government because we have &quot;screwed Saddam over&quot; so many times.  Now you admit that it all comes down to a bit of highly nuanced diplomacy for which Glaspie is to blame if anybody.  Not the entire government, and certainly not the nation.  In fact, your *primary* complaint now is that we didn't simply admit that a diplomatic FUBAR occurred resulting from a false assumption which was encouraged by Saddam.<br>
<br>
So how does your argument hold up now?  Is the U.S. still the big bad bully who has been pushing poor little Saddam around over and over after provoking him? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=506.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=506.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=506.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=506.topic&start=81&stop=88>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=506.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=506.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=506.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=506.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=506.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=506.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
