This is true, this is true.  Bulldozing her over made a much better point though didn't it?  I don't think any more nieve girls are going to be trying that anytime soon.  On moral grounds, I'd have to agree with you that they could have dealt with it better.  However, on moral grounds, I strictly place the responsibility of her life on herself...and therefore not on the driver...especially considering that I understand that not everyone in this world is moral, especially when it comes to survival.  My understanding of this is why I give understanding to the operator's actions.  You, however, refuse to even acknowledge his reasoning...a vital and nieve mistake to be so narrow-minded.<br>

<br>
Well thats a start.  Thats absolutely true.  That doesn't mean there isn't an absolutely true past that occurred.  It just means we can never achieve it...however we can still attempt to achieve that truth...and as a result at least become close to the truth.  The VERY first mistake a person makes when dealing with history is to assume that history depends on the viewer.  It does not depend on the viewer.  History depends on the actions that occurred.  What depends on the viewer is the portrayal of that history...in which case I try to find all views and all arguments of a given history and then formulate the best possible explanation.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>History is written by victors, there is always 2 or more sides to every story and event, so to watch some rookie who hasnt even finished his degree to claim to be the absolute and definitive authority on all history matters is hilarious.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Tuwene also forgot to mention that &quot;history is written by victims and losers as well&quot;.  Great way to try to manipulate a weak point.  The difference is that finding the writings of the opposing view often requires more digging...but they are there.  As for rookie, anything but.  The classes I take generally have 20-25 people per class in which we discuss and teachers and students alike comment to me after classes how they never thought of seeing some things discussed in ways that I bring them up.  They are amazed at the fact that I don't simply just pull stuff out of the book and copy and re-iterate it, but instead only use the books to formulate conclusions, and back it up with citations.  Apparently I'm a rookie that knows his shit, because thats what my teachers and fellow students tell me.  Nothing wrong with a rookie in that sense then.  Ya know, sometimes in basketball there are those great players that do awesome in their first year of playing professional basketball.<br>

Awe I'm so hurt by your words!  I really look to these boards as the real truth to what I am and am not, especially considering how ignorant and clueless most of the people on this board are in the first place.  You can continue to flame if you want, but please do it on the official flameboard and not in this section.  I just want to let you know before you waste your time that whatever you write can't reeeally hurt my feelings, not on a simple board like this.  Thats why when I debate I am very upfront...and then afterwards people like you become so offended because I trash your view which causes you to feel hurt enough to respond.  Or at least thats just my opinion, ya know, since I'm like a psych major and all (don't ask me to prove that one because I'm full of crap on that one...it was a joke).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Frankly, as a fellow History major, I'm embarassed for the both of us. You certainly shred the little credibility that my degree has with your ignorant rhetoric.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm glad that you are embarassed for the both of us, considering I'm not the one that shreds the credibility.  If you think debating on an online messageboard can possibly shred credibility, then you seriously have no credibility to your thinking processes.  <br>
<br>
Along those lines, I like how my logic (which is what it is, logic, not rhetoric) keeps being labled as &quot;rhetoric&quot; much like how Bush has a well-thought-out plan for Iraq and has an extremely strong backing logically for what he is doing yet you label it as &quot;rhetoric&quot;.  I don't think you understand what rhetoric means, because if you did, you wouldn't use it-I can guarantee that.  I'll supply a definition for you:<br>
<br>
Rhetoric:  Good man who speaks with skill<br>
<br>
-Quintillian<br>
<br>
Now I KNOW you didn't mean to compliment me...so we both must assume you don't even know what the word means.<br>
<br>
Now, there is a slightly different defintion for rhetoric also:<br>
<br>
The faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion.<br>
<br>
-an online dictionary.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't know about you, but persuasion is not in and of itself a bad thing.  Apparently you are complimenting me in this sense of the definition also.  You are claiming that I write very persuasive arguments, why thanks!  Persuasion is fine, and its even better when you use logic and evidence along side of it, which I have.  So whats so wrong again?<br>
<br>

<br>
Definitely true, except once again you place your argument in a wrong hue.  Its not that we are lucky we are not in Israel...its that we are lucky we are not in a state of war and terror in which Israel has to live with.  Israel would be using very similar measures that we use in our country if indeed it was in a state of long standing peace like our country.

History is written by the victors?  Yes and no.  Who are the victors?  The Roman Empire?  Sure.  But it fell, didn't it?  We don't know much about many of the &quot;victims&quot; of the Roman Empire, but is that because the Romans annihilated them, or because they did not keep written histories of themselves?  Carthage was wiped off the face of the planet, sure.  The Gauls?  The Celts?  The Etruscans?  What about the Roman Empire after it fell?  You could argue that it was never &quot;conquered&quot; per se, that it &quot;fell&quot;... ok.  So what about the Eastern Roman Empire - the Byzantine Empire?  They were definitely conquered, yet we have many many accounts of Byzantine history and life from the Byzantines themselves.<br>
<br>
The Mongols were victors, yet we know a great deal about the nations they conquered, largely from the histories those nations kept that survived.<br>
<br>
The Magyars were subjugated by the Habsburgs for centuries, but they certainly wrote their own histories, and we have a very good idea what happened there from both sides of the various conflicts.<br>
<br>
Pick an Empire, pick a nation, the list goes on... yes, conquering nations exerted influence on the recording of events, but that effect is nowhere near absolute like you're taking it to mean, Tuwene. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 1158<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/03 1:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.woc.org/public/oneirodynia/images/srllogo.GIF height=180 width=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange</span><hr size=1> tuwene is the winner.<br>

Yes, the roman empire fell; but they were not conquered (at least, not in a sweeping motion that obliterated their entire culture at once).<br>
<br>
Tell me something about the pre-Roman Gauls, though... or anything concrete about the Cartheginians that the Romans didn't write, etc.<br>
<br>
Our history of the ancient world comes almost 100% from ROMAN literature; fortunately, they were a HIGHLY enlightened society, and had writers, historians, etc who kept reasonably fair histories and more importantly, spread their literature around the conquered world.  When I say &quot;reasonable&quot; history, go read up a bit on the history of a little town up north called Londinium.  The history, which we know from written Roman records, is that the Romans came, found a riverside village, conquered it.  There was an uprising (led by a woman no less!) who actually managed to push out the Romans and retake the town for a bit of time.  They eventually took it back.<br>
<br>
Now, go find and read that history - AS WRITTEN - it's almost amusing to read about the mighty centurions beating back the savages (who probably ate babies and breathed fire).  If you look past the roman slant on the history, you will gather what probably happened, which I described above - without the gory details of any roman defeat (but plenty of details of celtic defeat).<br>
<br>
Would it be more fair if we had an equal historical document written by the celts from the same time period?  Of course.  Would it describe events in the same way?  Well, it'd probably agree that the romans were briefly kicked out, but then returned and took over again.  I imagine all similarities would end there.<br>
<br>
Where am I going with this?  Our view of history is always recorded by and tainted by the victors.  Do yesterday's victors become tomorrow's victims?  yes.  And when that happens, entire histories can be lost.  The amount of knowledge said to have been lost when the barbarians burned the library at Alexandria makes historians today cry.<br>
<br>
Now, it's all relative as to whether an empire decays (Rome) or is conquered (Carthage).  Carthage was more influential and powerful than Rome in their heyday, yet we have almost no history of them beyond the accounts of Hannibal.<br>
<br>
This is the trend meant by &quot;history is written by the victors&quot;, and it means that all history must be INTERPRETED, not MEMORIZED.  Countic really needs to learn that.<br>

I didn't go create the idea of history is also written by victims...thats something that my professors showed me...by providing the texts that show their opinions and views and memories.  The fact that you think that victims and losers can't write goes to show that your education only goes as far as what the victors taught you, while I know all sides.  To add heaps of coal to your already burning argument...there are TONS of records from people who had been conquered or victims of conquerors pre 1900.  Here are some examples for you:<br>
<br>
The Greeks-after the Roman empire subjugated them.<br>
<br>
The ethnicities that all were ruled under the Russian Empire, they all have histories that are well known and don't exactly agree with Russian history.<br>

The French.<br>
<br>
The French.<br>
<br>
The French.<br>

The Irish<br>

The Byzantines (as cale alrdy pointed out)<br>
