<br>
<br>
Anybody who was on wednesday morning just past midnight knows the server crashed. Immediately Hypersonic, on his cleric Nuzzy, and I ran to droga to do the angry goblin spawn.<br>
<br>
I get in the zone, and theres just a 55 shaman. That shaman disappears a few minutes later and is not part of the story. After several minutes Markey and Nuzzy zone in at the same time. Nuzzy and I run down halfway to the goblin then drop invis and start clearing the area around the warlord spawn so the goblins don't kill the angry goblin when he does his march, Markey took a different route than us. During this time Kindas and Oron zone in.<br>
<br>
We run a few feet down the ramp to the angry goblin and see Markey there. As I approach the goblin with my note Markey starts meleeing the angry goblin. After a couple of mins Kindas and Oron show up. Markey sends me a tell:<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 00:44:45 2002] Markey tells you, 'you can back up and maybe we lose, or you can have me do this all night getting healed'<br>
<br>
which I take to mean he is going to FD, and we will see who can hand the note in the fastest: Me, or whichever of them has the note. Or, he'll just stand there and cockblock everyone from doing the quest. Attacking a quest npc to prevent a quest hand in is against the PnP and considered harassment or somesuch. In layman's terms, it's gimp.<br>
<br>
Markey then gets killed by the angry goblin (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH) and it attacks nuzzy, who had been trying to atone the goblin off Markey.<br>
<br>
Nuzzy finally gets an successful atone in (while it is meleeing him) and I hand my letter in. We follow the angry up to the alcove where skargus spawns, and I engage immediately.<br>
<br>
About 20 seconds after I attack we discover that no, Markey was not talking about racing the handin. Oron and Kindas engage skargus as well.<br>
<br>
When the dust settles, non nuking cleric and tanking monk do less damage than ranger attacking from the side and presumably nuking druid. Oron loots the head.<br>
<br>
Pretty much knowing that I got screwed, Nuzzy and I /reported gaining group exp and petitioned. I didn't bother with the usual 'FUCK YOU FAGGOTS' commentary to Oron and Kindas, as it wasn't worth validating what they did.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes I got bored though, and struck up a conversation.<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:19:35 2002] You told Markey, 'If i had known you were going to pull more ragefireesque stunts, I wouldn't have bothered. I guess faith in humanity told me 'luck' would be at handing in the note first.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:19:47 2002] Markey tells you, 'who waas there first?'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:19:51 2002] Markey tells you, 'ok then'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:19:59 2002] Markey tells you, 'if you were there 1 waiting we would have left'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:20:03 2002] You told Markey, 'you zoned in as nuzzy did - you ran to goblin while we cleared the area of spawns'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:20:08 2002] Markey tells you, 'omg'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:20:12 2002] Markey tells you, 'i was in zone when no one was'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:20:24 2002] Markey tells you, 'i had to zone out to have a gm rez me'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:20:44 2002] You told Markey, 'Well, i'm sorry your rez took so long. was a 55 shaman and me in the zone for quite a while.'<br>
<br>
(I zoned into droga at 00:28:23, markey zoned in at 00:36:24 along with nuzzy. Not that it matters, but just for the record.)<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:20:44 2002] Markey tells you, 'i was factioning in droga when server went down, ask oron if my first tell didnt say ag up no one here'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:21:14 2002] Markey tells you, 'AND'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:21:28 2002] Markey tells you, 'the stuff in SF if you had any clue what it was REALLY about, you would not bring that up'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:21:55 2002] You told Markey, 'Heh. ok about the rf stuff. Did you have the note on you?'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:22:01 2002] Markey tells you, 'because all that situation did was make MHB look foolish for sticking up for a cleric that pulled the same stuff you tried too, perhaps it is expected of you guys, seems to be a trend'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:22:56 2002] Markey tells you, 'no your cleric came in solb, took spawn which was camped, turned in stuff to get whatever was needed for sf rf spawn....so same thing exactly almost, cept that time we were on the losing end, now you are'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:23:00 2002] You told Markey, 'We were there before oron and kindas showed up, i assume oron had the note. there in force first, there with the ability to spawn the mob first. as well as having cleared the way.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:23:11 2002] Markey tells you, 'i have the note as well'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:23:25 2002] You told Markey, 'I meant I'd drop the RF stuff, since no i wasn't there'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:23:29 2002] Markey tells you, 'but i can solo ag ne time, oron cannot, so i let him do it'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:23:44 2002] Markey tells you, 'not ag, but the big troll he pops, hes cake to solo'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:25:00 2002] You told Markey, 'By all means, you should have. I certainly wouldn't have tried to (even if i had the power) ks if i lost the handin. Which is what i figured you were trying to do.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:25:10 2002] Markey tells you, 'if i wanted i would have done that, i let oron do his thing, I was there first, simply as that, if table was reversed I would not sit here complaining to you how you guys beat me to something, thats ridiculous, i used to believe in the whole fair policy till i got burned a long time ago like 3 times in a week, then i said screw this, ill help and bow down to those with a rep of being nice or i know, no one else sorry, i am not trying to get screwed over again, its called CYA'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:25:27 2002] Markey tells you, 'did i lose hand in? did i ks? both answers are the same'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:25:57 2002] You told Markey, 'Ah, you only prevented me from handing it in until the KSers arrived. great distinction.'<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:26:07 2002] Markey tells you, 'no no'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:26:26 2002] Markey tells you, 'i prevented it you from handing it in until the person I was letting bypass me turn it in, that is the distinction'<br>
<br>
(this is important for later)<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:26:46 2002] You told Markey, 'I'm not complaining, i'm sure nothing will happen with the gms at all. Just saying be more clear next time your friends plan to KS someone, so there's no confusion.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:27:12 2002] Markey tells you, 'no one got ks, we aggroed mob 1, thats fact, that being that, that is all that needs to be known'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:27:48 2002] You told Markey, 'You fd, onto nuzzy, who atoned. Both parties wiped aggro. I handed in, triggering spawn = mine. i attacked it first as well.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:28:03 2002] Markey tells you, 'i died i didnt fd first of all'<br>
<br>
(I assumed a lvl60+ necromancer was smart enough not to die to a lvl30 mob, but I was wrong.)<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:28:44 2002] You told Markey, 'I'll take your word on that, i wasn't paying much attention to that. i assumed it was a FD being a necro and all.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:28:59 2002] Markey tells you, 'when i died oron immediately tried to hand it in...THEN, you guys all attacked the mob, you lost, I feel bad you lost your ring 2 stuff, at the same time if you guys had backed up, let us try, and if we failed it would have been all yours'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:29:38 2002] Markey tells you, 'yea, due to lack of paying attn i actually died, that i will take to the grave being i cant believe i died to a mob hitting for 60 + but hey stuff happens late at night'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:29:39 2002] You told Markey, 'i backed up, but nuzzy had been trying to atone it off you. i guess that got aggro (resists? or whatever)'<br>
<br>
(All this 'back up' shit I took to mean as to root it so it could be memblurred.)<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:30:39 2002] You told Markey, 'it turned as soon as you died, didnt pause'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:31:48 2002] You tell your party, 'markey died (loss of right), you atoned (loss of right), then i handed in (activation of right), and engaged mob first (as if it wasn't already mine)'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:32:17 2002] Markey tells you, 'anyways... i am sorry you lost your item, for that I do feel bad as that is work you have to redo, it isnt that bad though, also, its a contested spawn that stuff is going to happen, we had people inc, we asked you guys to back up as I (who has note) was at spawn point, you did not so i was forced to aggro mob to keep our quest mob, as bad as i feel, i also hope you can realize that if you were there first all you, if not sorry, thats not how it works, being in a zone 1/2 a mile away.......'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:32:44 2002] Markey tells you, 'does not grant you ownership of the mob, I wish it did, so this BS wouldnt happen, but it doesnt work that way, hope you have better luck next time'<br>
<br>
Remember the stuff above? Funny that he says this. Besides that he never said a word to me before attacking it, he attacked it to 'pass the right' to people who were half a zone away while we were standing right next to him. 'We had people inc' means 'we weren't ready.' And on a highly contested spawn, as he said this is; Whoever is there first and ready gets it.<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:34:18 2002] You told Markey, 'Guess we'll just train someone with the guards instead of actually killing them next time (heard some word from people in phalanx about an encounter in charasis while i was being KS'd here)'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:34:51 2002] Markey tells you, 'i dont rally know anything about charasis, i was running back to rez myself'<br>
<br>
(Anyone from the Phalanx group in Charasis wanna chime in about what was going down with Drusilla at the time?)<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:35:25 2002] You told Markey, 'and if you want to talk about mob ownership, no one owns it til it's engaged or triggered... loss of engagement = loss of ownership too. theres no black and white about what the outcome was though.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:35:43 2002] Markey tells you, 'exactly, and we had engaged it 1, end of story'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:36:02 2002] Markey tells you, 'as for hs, i dont know what you are talking about'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:36:23 2002] You told Markey, 'you skipped the 'loss of engagement' part. or the intentionally attacking a quest-only npc to prevent handin part. But anyway'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 01:36:38 2002] Markey tells you, 'i was trying to practice my 1hb on the mob'<br>

<br>
Merton of all people offered to MQ the report to skargus with me, if I got dicked by SoE. But thanks to our /reports of group exp, I got my report to skargus back. So a big thank-you to Merton for his offer. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately I didn't report the 'threatening tell' (how lame does that sound) from Markey, nor Oron getting the kill shot, so there was no proof of guilt for the gms to do anything. But that is what this board is for. Thanks go to GM Bogell for returning the report, regardless.<br>
<br>
I know there was another thread here about angry goblin with Nomenn and battlechaser. But this isn't like that stupid shit. BC gave Nomenn plenty of time to spawn it and then spawned it himself. <br>
<br>
Short story: We were racing to a spawn. While we did not arrive at the spawn first, we were the first party with the ability to trigger it, the ability to kill it, and the WILL to begin the encounter, and cleared the quest mob's path too. Markey claims he could have killed it and triggered it, but he didn't. He then tried to gimp it to prevent us from doing it until reinforcements arrived. Then, after I won the race, they KSed the mob and Oron ninjaed it.<br>
<br>
In conclusion: Ninjalooters = scum. People who assist ninjalooters with a heist are partners in crime. <br>
<br>
Oron = Ninjalooter<br>
Markey = The evil version of jay<br>
Kindas = the evil silent bob<br>
Pren = Gets to camp angry goblin again, but at least not shady too.<br>
<br>

Owning a mob through first engagement only applies to mobs that you intend on killing. Mobs that you are engaged with for the sole purpose of delaying or preventing someone else from triggering is not proper engagement. It's just like kiting. Verant stated that kiting a mob around until you're ready to kill it is NOT &quot;engagement&quot; This seems nearly identical in that you were only attacking the angry goblin to prevent someone else (who was ready for the mob) from doing their turn in. That's a form of &quot;kiting&quot; and that is not an acceptable form of engagement. Saying you were practicing your 1hb skills is absolute bullshit as well. There are plenty of mobs in that zone that you could have practiced on; in fact, I don't think you even get melee skill increase on green conning mobs. <br>
<br>
Sorry Markey but in this case you were dead wrong. <br>
<br>
Worst part about it was killing a mob that his turn in triggered. If he turned his item in, just cut your losses and come back another time, or petition a GM and submit a formal complaint; but don't kill steal someone. The worst thing that happens to you is that you lose future time checking on the angry goblin repop.  You in effect set him back double the amount of time by making him redo tasks and work that he had already completed. <br>
<br>
That's pretty fucked up.<br>

      Sorry you got KS, but fact of the matter is i did not want to aggro kite skargus around seeing you guys in zone, I have seen the AG camp get KS more then a few times, so I waited for the others to get there. Like I said, sorry you got KS, but dont come here and drag my name through the mud because I told you we had others in zone 15 seconds from AG. If you cant figure out why I said i was practicing 1hb you need to think a little harder...like I didnt know you were logging everything. <br>

Markey &amp; co. killed and looted a mob triggered by someone else. This alone is enough for the list.<br>
<br>
Then Markey come on this very thread and talk like KS is something normal and a legit way to &quot;win&quot; a race when your groupmates are too slow and another group got you beat on the turn-in to trigger an encounter. To fight a npc so someone else cannot turn-in an item is already low, but to KS the triggered mob and to loot the drop just show your complete lack of ethic. The scumbag definitly deserve his spot on the list. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pages.infinit.net/kerosene/sigfinal.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
