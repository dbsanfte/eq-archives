<br>
If I remember correctly of the conversation I had with Jaonne, they are a Equil and a Trans mix?  Which would explain alot but i just want verification.  Looks as though we have another KS team on our hands. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://kot.jellopit.com/images/sigs/ogeesiggy.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

At least my group got to see Jaonne dead though...cause he couldn't take our named alone and had to find that out the hard way.<br>

Be alert when you see these 2 around.

There is not a person in Equilibrium that I could say a bad thing about, and if you even knew they existed (which you admitted that you did not, last night), then maybe you could pass judgement for yourself.<br>
<br>
Provoked was formed some months ago by 3 good friends (Darkdoc, Ahliver, and Perfecto). We are a small guild, that is pretty laid back. Darkdoc is the GL now, since Ahliver and Perfecto had to retire from EQ due to RL job conflicts, and although he is not the most loved on the server, leads us quite well - and unselfishly.<br>
<br>
Second, your named that you had been 'camping' was up for hours, and nobody had been there...we had been and tried to kill him many a time. Saying that you were 'camping' him is a lie, because you went specifically to kill the named, which is all we did as well. We took part in no KSing, or jumping...you failed to kill a mob, YOU lost.<br>
<br>
Bosses in BoT are FFA if I dont see a group killing to them, or a group about to pull them. If a group is camping an area, waiting for a boss...of course its theirs.<br>
<br>
I haven't ever bind-rushed any boss in BoT...I've never charmed a mob and KSed a group thats been fighting a mob. And with the recent change to boss HP regen, they regen about 10,000 hp/tick as soon as they lose agro. It sounds to me like your angry about losing a fight (that was NOT in your 'camp') and just want to blame your loss on someone else who did what you didn't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryknis1>Ryknis1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/3/03 10:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTF is Provoked</span><hr size=1> Shit head, did you or did you not charm a mob that was in OUR camp as we were fighting the named?

Also, you can invis straight into his room..and his room was fully popped. Elif is always up, and drops nothing most of the time - so how about sending me a tell when you see me run by and let me know you are heading up? That wouldnt be too hard...because if I was alerted that someone was actually going to go up there with a group, I would just let you have it.<br>

Or maybe it is easier to send hate tells afterward, and post on the flame board.

It's ok, we all have learned to understand and try to respect the &quot;special&quot; people in todays world.  Just next time you rush over someone to get a named, try to ask an adult on what your next move should be.  Please make a responsible one at that.  No need to tarnish your rep any further.

Jaonne, you invised past my group breaking for water named without saying a word.  We were five mobs away at that point.  <br>
<br>
When I questioned you on what you were doing you told me that your group had to &quot;evac&quot; and was coming back for the named.  Our group had been in the area for the last 25 minutes but I decided to be polite and give you the benefit of the doubt (also because I really dont give a damn about any trash dropping off the named in there).  <br>
<br>
You wiped and attempted to rush back.  <br>
<br>
In the future I do not intend to give you the benefit of the doubt and you had best mend your ways unless it is your intention to become the new Arcibu.  <br>
<br>
If you continue acting like this may I recommend perhaps a transfer to Stormhammer - I hear that Township Rebellion is recruiting anyone with a BoT key. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chantci>chantci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/3/03 7:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:WTF is Provoked</span><hr size=1> I am Provoked what of it?
