<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  It strongly hampers one's own progression. That is like saying one is so fearful of life that it is okay to submit to something less challenging. There is no personal growth in that what so ever. I find social interaction IRL extremely engaging and positive. If one is having the problems you describe then it is not social engagement that is plaguing them. But since I disagree and we seem to have opposing persona as far as that goes, I would go as far to say that it is extremely detrimental because it gives the mind a falsity of what social interaction is.

<br>
I don't follow.  I wasn't saying that EverQuest should be used to replace live, face-to-face, social interaction.  I was saying that the negative side effects of these interactions would impact people less in EverQuest than in the real world because of it's anonymous nature which allows people to more easily disassociate themselves from the person on the &quot;other side of the screen&quot; (re: the Flameboard).<br>

Is there a way to communicate with people across the Playstation 2 easily like with EverQuest?  I don't own a PS2 yet, but if the answer is &quot;No&quot; I would imagine that is part of why you don't find the game so immersive.  People can and do form very strong social bonds through EverQuest, and as has been mentioned, this is one of the primary reasons (I believe) everyone plays the game so long.  EverQuest is the only game I've ever stuck with for 2.5 years, and the number one reason was the people.  Look at how many people stop playing the game but continue to participate in the community.  However, that doesn't mean it is addictive.  People can and do form the same kind of bonds in school, in chat rooms, at work, over message boards, over the telephone, in sports, at the local bar, etc. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A> at: 10/19/02 6:50:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bump</span><br>  Posts: 1011<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/19/02 7:08:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rigadoon</span><hr size=1> What else is the game supposed to be used for?

It mimics patterns of reality. You do the math.<br>

<br>
Yes, PS2, Xbox online and such have adaptable keyboards and headsets. The difference is the mind set and frame they are built for. As for social bond, my personal belief has become that they are false. You of all people are one of the few that I trusted and liked as far as EQ goes but most likely I will never meet you and your presence will have such minor detail in my future that time versus effort is minimal. I believe personal presence is the only way to go, there is so much that goes on that we cant see in real contact that either doesnt happen online or manifests itself negatively because our minds are trying to fill in the voids. Would I care what happens to you, positive or negative? Of course, but that is so minimal in comparison to what happens to family or friends I have had honest contact with. Im sorry we dont meet eye to eye on this subject, I guess its the perspective between an idealist and a realist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/19/02 7:19:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest and Addiction</span><hr size=1> You don't have to be sorry for anything, Jadae. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I posted this topic to debate the issue and get input on the subject.<br>
<br>
I agree that relationships, whatever their nature may be, formed across the internet can be more fickle than bonds formed when people have face-to-face contact.<br>
<br>
But now that we are on the third page, and gotten off the subject somewhat, I want to just restate the original question:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Is EverQuest addictive?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I'm not contending that people cannot become addicted to EverQuest, I think they can, so no need to go over that issue. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A> at: 10/19/02 7:30:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1666<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/19/02 8:34:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest and Addiction</span><hr size=1> You are both right and wrong Hayzen. You are correct in that something does not need to have addictive qualities for a person to be addicted to it. Hell, there are people addicted to rock collecting, but I have yet to see an addictive rock (other than crack of course lol).<br>
<br>
However, I believe you are wrong on EQ. EQ has addictive qualities <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> by design</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, because VI needs people to keep playing in order for EQ to make money. Using the random reward schedule technique is one way of accompishing this as is having an, for all practical purposes, endless amount of equipment to upgrade to.<br>
<br>
Throw in the social structure and pressure of keeping up (by time vested in your character) which is heavily influenced by EQs design, and you definatly have a game who relies on a pretty extensive bag of tricks to keep people playing.<br>
<br>
So while I agree that people can and do become addicted to activities/things with no addictive qualities, I don't believe EQ is one of them. EQ is addictive by design imo. <p><br>

<br>
This has been an industry standard of RPG game design since as long as I can remember.  EverQuest is an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> obvious</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rip off of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and The Forgotten Realms universe.  There are many examples I could list to support this claim, but I don't want to string this off-topic again.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the point is that I don't think this was a design made with the intention of making the game addictive.  It was made this way because games it is based off of have been made this way.  Brad McQuaid has said many times that he and the designers of the game were MUDers and RPGers, and they wanted to recreate that experience.<br>
<br>
Creating a compelling, and enjoyable game is not the same thing as creating an addictive game.  One of the marks of addiction is that you are compelled to keep using the substane, or repeating the action, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> even when you don't want to</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I don't think anyone here could make the claim that people, would be playing this game if it weren't enjoyable.<br>

You can find this same thing in real life social groups, work being one of them.  People do get addicted to work, but work is not addictive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 1919<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/19/02 10:00:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest and Addiction</span><hr size=1> of for fucksake you know eq is addictive verant has probally researched this and did all they could to lure people in, its the only way they make $$ if u could win the game then u would not pay every month for it.. i have 0 doubt they took steps to insure they could suck people in and keep them in .. dont bullshit yourself<br>

Holy shit, you are so niave!<br>
<br>
Store chains spend millions in researching what makes buyers spend money. They also know problem groups who are suseptible (impulse buyers, depression shoppers, low income people with poor budget skills) and target those groups. Every song that comes over the PA, every store display, every print ad, is based of research of how they can manipulate the buyer to blow his wad before he leaves the store.<br>
<br>
If EQ wasn't designed to be addictive, why would people spend 36 hours straight camping items? How many PS2 gamers play that long against a computer opponent in one sitting?<br>
<br>
If EQ wasn't designed to be addictive, why there people with well over 200 days played? Do you realize that 200 days is 4,800 hours played?<br>
<br>
The numbers are too large to say this out of the norm for the playerbase. Now maybe we are all freaks, but EQ certainly knew how to target us and draw us into their world... and I highly doubt it was by accident. <p><br>

I already explained this.  It is because of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   community</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, the competition that helps to feed, and the strong bonds people form between each other.  I had 115 days played on Hayzen over 2.5 years.  The very first day I played it I spent eight hours creating different characters, trying to come up with a name I liked, and then leveling Hayzen to level 5.  I thought the game was SO COOL.  You know what, though?  I spent almost the same amount of time playing the first time I popped Final Fantasy VIII into my Playstation.<br>
<br>
The loot and big monsters are fun, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   but only because there are people there to share the experience with</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Without the people it would mean jack squat.  When you're finished the with Playstation 2 game there is nobody to say goodbye to.  There is nobody that you've come to know that you may feel an obligation twoards.  You just turn the game off.  Why do you think there are so many people, just from our little forum, that continue hanging around and participating in the forums, in thier guild boards, even after they've stopped playing the game?  It certainly isn't because EverQuest is addictive, otherwise they would be playing still don't you think?  But they don't.  They stop playing, yet continue being a part of the COMMUNITY.<br>

Yes, the fact that the game never ends is part of the reason people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   initially</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spend enough time together to form these bonds.  But what do you expect from an online <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   persistent</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> world.  That's the entire point of an MMOG.  Just as it is the entire point of a retail store to sell merchandise and make money.<br>
<br>
You keep repeating that the glaring sign that EverQuest is addictive is that people spend so much time doing it.  However you keep completley glossing over the fact that there are a lot of people that spend just as much time hanging out at bars, going to clubs, and a myriad of other social situations. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A> at: 10/20/02 8:32:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1670<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/20/02 8:42:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest and Addiction</span><hr size=1> The point is that people would not spend such enormous amounts of time and effort if the game was not addictive. A non-addictive game just couldn't instill the desire in them to do so. If people were just in it for the community, there are alot of chat programs that use avatars and virtual worlds and don't require camping items for 8-36 hours. <p><br>

But over the last half of it.... it's made me think. heaven forbid.  When they created everquest. they did not make it to make it addictive. like you said before. something about intention. But eq is addictive. to a certain personality type or two. there is always exceptions. i think for about half the playerbase it is addicting and for the other half we are just passing the time away with it as a form of entertainment. no different then the tv. i went from one side to the other myself. i now use it for entertainment when i have jack else to do. but i think i was addicted before.<br>
<br>
Now the shopping thing. the retailers intent is for you to blow all the money you can. they spend massive amounts of money to keep you spending more time in their stores, spending more money on things, and coming back for more. they want it to be addictive. hell that means for $$$ for them. i know this from personal experience because i used to be a stocker for a grocery store. we used to spend all weekend setting up displays and rearranging them to get the customer to buy more. management would have meetings like every other day to figure out how to keep the customer in the store longer. best way they could do this was product placement. ever notice that your bread and milk are on opposite sides of the store? that's done on purpose. i don't think shopping in itself is addicting but the retailers intent is to make it so. <p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=414061">Hadena Rtehpwn 57 High Elf Weezard</a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/20/02 9:02:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EverQuest and Addiction</span><hr size=1> To be human is to be naturally dependant, and I believe that most people are empathetic towards this.  How many times did you help someone in your guild when there was nothing in it for you?  I did it many, many times and happily so.  Sometimes I felt an obligation to go to a raid or help with a quest, because I had made a commitment to these people.  Other times I played because I felt an obligation to people, because in the past they had spent their money, and time, and helped me achieve a goal in the game.  Just as I sometimes feel I am obligated towards my friends and family outside of the game.<br>
<br>
How often do people in chat rooms help each other achieve goals like that?  How many chatrooms do you know of that it takes more than one person to accomplish that goal?  EverQuest is not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   just</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the community, it makes up a very large percentage of the game for sure, but there are goals to be accomplished. But, the community is the driving force behind people wanting to accomplish those goals.<br>
<br>
I'm a huge BattleTech fan, and before EverQuest I played a game called MechCommander.  This is a real time strategy game based on the BattleTech universe.  The game is primarly a single player game, but it had a multiplayer feature.  I played in a ladder league called Starlance, in a Clan (a guild) called The Jade Falcons.  Starlance was basically a web based tournament league created by a fellow player; I think it may still be around I'm not sure.  I spent 1.5 years playing that game, about 8 hours per week.  Want to know why?  Because of the PEOPLE.  It was fun being a member of the Clan and competing against the other groups to earn points.  I didn't spend as much time with that game as EverQuest because multiplayer consisted of many short games, usually lasting about 20 - 60 minutes on average.  But that game also was not marketed, or designed, to be a persistent world.  I stopped playing that game about four years ago, and do you want to hear something crazy?  I'm still in contact with almost everyone from my MechCommander group.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I spent four hours reading a novel.  The day before that I'm sure I spent at least two.  It's a great book, and I enjoy it a lot.  I still have at least 1000 pages to go, and it may take me upwards of another twenty hours of reading to finish it.  I'll probably get to the end within the next few days.  Do you think I may be addicted to that book?<br>
<br>
Time spent on an activity is not a measure of addiction.<br>

It would be more accurate to say:<br>

But then I contrast that to a console game. Gran Turismo 1 kept me glued to the TV forever. I would spend endless hours tweaking my cars so I could eek out an extra MPH, or keep my tires on the ground, or my suspension tight enough I would waddle all over, etc.<br>

I stopped playing GT1 when 2 came out, and I still play it off and on, trying to get my track times down, but I still dont have near as much played time as in EQ or Camelot even.<br>

Addictions are just part of human life. Since there are no real challenges in most peoples meaningless consumer driven lives they need something to occupy their time until they die. I know alot of who are addicted to their families or addicted to their relgion. But no one does a 20/20 special making it out to be &quot;bad&quot;. Damn people, their are so many other things to worry about than &quot;Am I doing something 'bad' by occupying my time with EQ instead of watching TV or playing with my old Magic card collection?&quot;<br>
