<br>
so yeah.. they have a pretty valid reason for complaining.. &quot;<br>
<br>
ROFLMAO<br>
<br>
Um, get a clue bud.<br>
<br>
Gryme is up 6x per day, and is up most days of the week.  We're not flinging ourselves at him every day you know.  Sounds like that was a SHITLOAD of time you had to farm the area.  So he dies.  Farm parchments somewhere else, then go back the next day and farm your little heart away.<br>
<br>
As for us only going when we have a &quot;capable force&quot;... how would YOU know what a capable force for Grummus was?  Pop has been out for How long?  I don't see loads of info splattered all over Allakhazam's and messageboards on how to advance through the tiers.  Fact is, there's 2 ways you learn how to kill a mob...<br>
<br>
1)  You wait until everyone and their little sister has killed it, then wait for some person to take pity on you and post the strat, then mimic it and feel proud for being able to follow an instruction manual.<br>
<br>
2)  You get off your ass and try to figure it out yourself.  Eat a crapload of deaths, refine the strat, and kill it.<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer the second.<br>
<br>
As for Bahaemoth, to our knowledge he was still up on track after we left.  If he did despawn, we had no idea he would.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;wasting&quot; the spawn, he's a GATEWAY mob.  Everyone is entitled to try.  Sorry if someone didn't get flagged the first time round, but I for one have zero interest in sitting on my ass waiting for someone else to get a character flag when I can be working on flagging myself and other guildmates.<br>
<br>
Hell, you might as well start flaming all the people who get slaughtered in the PoJ trials.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Loser!  Why don't you stop doing the Exe trials so my Uberguild &lt;insert name here&gt; flags all the people in my guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sounds stupid doesn't it?  Or maybe that's how you think it should work?  Of course, that would say alot more about someone than anything I could put in print here...<br>

I'd flame their worthless hides if they tried the trial with two level 55 druids and an enchanter, because they have no grasp of the strategy needed to win, much less anything approaching the force necessary.<br>

<br>
&quot;I find it incredibly amusing that you would post this after killing the AoW. You can find a fucking &quot;How To Kill The AoW For Dummies&quot; on the Safehouse, you didn't figure out any brilliant strategies. You don't refine strats. You just zerg and fail and repeat until you get lucky by following someone else's successful strategy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong.  Our strats for AoW were developed independently.  The actual strategy we use only reached it's final form after multiple attempts, analysis of the fights afterwards, and countless adjustments.  Of course, given your obvious feelings towards Legendary, you can assume whatever you wish.  It won't change the reality of what actually happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do they fail to realize their actions have consequences? &quot;We didn't realize the AoW would despawn!&quot; &quot;We had no idea the MB would despawn! Don't blame us!&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, we do realize our actions have consequences, and we do make accomodations on encounters where we know what to expect.  We don't advertise this, and You of course, would not be privy to this, so I'll be happy to educate...<br>
<br>
1)  We made a total of 8 raid attempts on Avatar of War (Easily a typical number given the encounter) before it died.<br>
<br>
2)  For at least 5 of those attempts which I attended, we sent tells in advance to either The Companions or Elitists and Vagrants warning them that they we were going to attempt the Avatar of War and that they should have a raid-capable force in place to kill it in case we failed on the first attempt and would be unable to rebuff in time for a second attempt.  On 3 of those attempts, the Companions responded to our messages and fully assembled with our knowledge and consent in case we failed.  On at least 2 seperate occassions that I'm aware of EV informed us they didn't have the numbers to come to AoW if we failed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You engage the Manaetic Behemoth, a mob so far out of your range as to be laughable, with far less people than Triton and Fires of Heaven did? And you call that a legitimate attempt? I call it a bunch of selfish, worthless pricks deciding that if they don't have the ability to accomplish anything, then no one else should have the chance to prove themselves either.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, FoH called Bahaemoth a complete pushover.  They also didn't post the numbers they used, or any information regarding their strategies.  They never post their strategies and never will.<br>
<br>
So, what exactly is your point here?  That we should assume that there's some magical number to be derived from the fact that FoH took a 60 man raid and called it a cakewalk?<br>
<br>
What I see is You sitting there in the cheap seats, taking shots on something you know absolutely nothing about, getting angry because another guild attempted something that just happened to slow down your personal progress.<br>
<br>
Well life is tough, Horza.  All mobs are competitive.  It's not like Bahaemoth isn't up for DAYS at a time.  I'm sorry if EV's busy schedule didn't allow you to get around to killing Bahaemoth again sooner and that we went and made an attempt at a mob because you didn't get around to killing him, but do you Really expect the whole server to just sit on their asses and wait for you to get everyone flagged at your leisure?<br>
<br>
Why don't you take your selfish ass back to wherever it hangs out and do what I'm sure you're more than happy to tell other people to do... that is stop whining like a 5 year old who had his candy stolen, grow up, and deal with it.<br>
<br>
As for your analogy to a person jumping into the trials with no idea of what to expect, what do you think everyone did the first weeks of Pop?  They jumped in, tried to learn what would happen, and then tried to make adjustments to beat it.<br>
<br>
That is how you learn.<br>
