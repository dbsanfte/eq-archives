Feel free to add your own admirations.<br>
<br>
1. Chunli - Back when i first started playing this game, my friends who had been on Tribunal before me had told me of Chunli.  Although i have never interacted with her too much personally, I have heard of what a great player she is.  She is always kind and curteous and helpful.  I recall a time when I was level 20 when she gave me one of the heads for my red headband (I think that is the right color) and she even had her friend group wolf form us.  She never looked down upon the lower monks and seemed very humble as a player.  Since that time, I have tried to model myself after Chunli, and I hope that I can be as well known in the same qualities as in my mind she exemplifies.  I imagine that she doesn't know who I am, so I hope she isn't freaked out that I hold her in such high regard.<br>
<br>
2. Sindi - This is the monk who first invited me to the planes.  I have known her since our days chain pulling the champ room area in SolB.  I recall we resorted to this because our enchanter sucked and our group really really needed the mobs to be more single pulls.  In any case, she has always extended her hand in friendship and she is a very generous player.<br>
<br>
3. Laotzu - This is the monk who I consider my most influential mentor in the art of pulling.  Although I have only grouped with him briefly, his philosphy and demeanor in the art of the pull shaped my mindset in what and how I should pull mobs.  Without meeting Laotzu, I feel that my level of play would have remained at a much lower level.  <br>
<br>
These are the people that I admire the most from our Tribunal monk community.  Sure, there have been many monks over the years, and sure there are monks that some regard as more uber, but to me, these are the people who have changed me the most and significantly shaped the character of Makino. <p><hr>

So much of what we do(i.e. the art of pulling, for it certainly is an art), is and should be passed down one on one, master to student. Some mentors it seems, from my experience as well as reading those above, teach quite consciously, with an eye to moulding a next generation of monks to be the best they can possibly be. Others, no less worthy of our praise, teach by their example alone. With that in mind, I'd like to take this chance to salute some of the great masters I have had the honor of fighting beside and studying under.<br>
<br>
Karajassus Stormfists: As a struggling little single class guild fought to raise itself from anonymity and define itself in the dynamic world of EQ, Karajassus embodied the very qualities that made a Monk. By modern standards he was never very high level, but in my eyes as a young player he was a true Holy Monk.<br>
<br>
Fenie Diamondfists: Fenie may now be my guildmaster, but she has always been and always will be the best 'big sister' a monk could ask for. Fenie has been as close to a guild mascot as we could ever have, and few will ever meet a nicer, more considerate, consumately professional, or overall wonderful monk.<br>
<br>
Charmm Ming: the Lucky Prince. Charmm knew the Feng Shui of EQ, there is simply no better way to put it. If it could drop, it dropped for Charmm and in abundance. Despite obviously good karma, he was also a master of every little in and out of gameplay that made a monks life easier (i.e. &quot;if you put a turtle on your head and face the giant east, he won't be able to hit you....trust me&quot; - &quot;wow...it works&quot;). I kid you not, the lizard was amazing.<br>
<br>
Shaim: Despite a propensity for personal injury, and a hard work schedule, Shaim more than anyone else formed the HM into what we are today. By quite literally taking us through dungeons and pulling maneuvers step by step, he trained a generation of monks. He was a true mentor.<br>
<br>
Paimae Songsun: the LUV Monkey. Picking up where Shaim left off, Paimae has been called one of the best pullers to ever grace the game. I have seen him in action, and he certainly gets my vote.<br>
<br>
Chunli: (^_^) You always had the coolest equiptment (^_^) Seriously, although I have never been quite high enough level to play in your league, you have always been a role model to me and a great Holy Monk.<br>
<br>
There are really so many fine monks out there. It seems almost unfair to only name a few. Kungfoo, Huggz, Sinnamon, Akuroshi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , etc. Keep up the good work folks. There may be an influx of new monks on our server, but let us never fail to keep our standards the highest of any class. We owe that at least to our selves, and most assuredly to those who trained us.<br>
<br>

Those were very kind words my friend and I appreciate your good will.  However, I am just a regular monk who has plenty of LUV for his fellow citizens of EQ and I don't feel I should be compared to some of the other great names mentioned earlier in this post.  I live to help where I can and that alone is enough for me.  Recognition for anything beyond being a good person makes me somewhat uneasy.  I DO thank you though, brother, for being such a good friend over all this time and continuing to be the monk that YOU are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Being guildmates with you and the other Holy Monks was definitely the single most impactive event on my EQ existance ever.  I will never forget the things I've learned and experiences I had as a Holy Monk.<br>
<br>
My humble congratulations go to those other monks out there that have done so well.  They truly make a positive impact on our community and help make life in EQ a better place. It is purely the actions of these fine monks that makes people who play other characters want to create monks as well.  <br>

<br>
Wrenn is also famous for doing the first ever map and guide to the EQ zone Dalnir, which was used (and still is) by people on all servers. Subsequent guides to Dalnir were based on Wrenn's work. Wrenn also did this for some Anarchy Online zones during a brief time in that game.<br>
<br>
Definitely one of the best players and most knowledgeable monks on the server.<br>
