Ubers don't have time to raid epics. Those who want their epics AND join an uber guild do their epic first, guilded in a &quot;minor&quot; guild. Then they leave it. Easy.<br>
<br>
Dunno if Xav was bitter or defeated, you're right, it can be looked at in two ways.<br>

You're wrong on your last point thou. I did get your little joke. I just didn't find it humorous at all. Not your fault thou, i just can't find it humorous, tis beyond me.<br>

We have far to much to do now, and most of the stuff we hunt drops weapons that are far better than epics ('useful' epics like cleric excluded).<br>
<br>
That's why you don't see us doing many epics.  The fact that people join us with their epic is of little to no concern -- its certainly not part of our recruitment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/unandiinsunfang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NandiinSunfang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/22/02 1:01:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, Trains, and Sphincters</span><hr size=1> Epics are a personnal achievement (sp?).

<br>
That what i was saying. If you want your epic AND join an uber guild, it's better (easier ?) to do it before joining an uber. People still want their epic, even if better stuff drops now. Personal achievement.<br>
<br>
My point is i find disturbing the way some people use to get their epic. They &quot;use&quot; a_minor_guild001 to get it. Why does the minor guild do epics raids ? Because those guilds NEED guildies with epics, because they can't raid better stuff at the moment (as ubers did several months ago).<br>

<br>
 That is why the same guilds are always going to be the Uber guilds. Because there is no were else to go to get better loot. The small guilds will always equip players up so they can move to the big leagues. If you are a midsized guild and get a warrior that plays 12 hours a day, you can bet as soon as he has all the gear you can get him, he will move on. And the Uber guilds will almost always take him, as long as he hasn't screwed anyone over ( or at least in their guild) and will put in the time, he will always have a home among them.<br>
<br>
 That is what differentiates uber players and uber guilds from the rest. To have an uber guild, you need 20 hard core players who want to face new challenges and 100 loot whores. If your lucky and do it right, the 20 adventurous players will be the officers and the loot whores will be the cannon fodder. I could list the guilds that have attempted to be Uber but have gotten the mix wrong, but no need, anyone that has played 2+ years on Trib will know who they are.<br>

<br>
I think that's a gross oversimplification - and in my case, simply incorrect. I see the primary reason as some guilds turned into feeder guilds as level differencies. I.e. you hit level 60 in a smaller guild with lots of low 50s you really aren't in the same leage. Me leaving SP after staying there for almost a year was (basically) for this reason, not because I wanted phat lewts. I believe doing challenging stuff is much more of a drive for *most people* then phat lewts. Many of the IWANTPHATLEWTS people get weeded out during teh recruitment process as well.<br>
<br>
Rennat&gt;That is why the same guilds are always going to be the Uber guilds. Because there is no were else to go to get better loot. <br>
<br>
If you look at other servers you will see this is simply incorrect. When the smaller guilds like Revolution/SP/KoT and similar have a membership that consist of mostly level 60s they really don't have much to do that raid anyway. Look to other servers where they have a horde of e.g. n-tov capable guilds. The same happened on our server with the guild I'm in. Companions shifted completely focus a little over a year ago, going from a normal but very capable friendly guild to a raiding guild. EV had no competition for the endgame in Kunark (VP), but they had in Velious and will have to live with Companions also for Luclin. Maybe RNG and Legendary will get their act together sometime and start to contest Comps/EV sometimes too, who knows - it has to do with server maturity.<br>

<br>
while Walkabout's english is usually impeccible, I don't really understand this sentence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guilds turn into feeder guilds for a variety of reasons. However, its not really fair to term most of the 2nd teir guilds feeders, because, a feeder guild is charactized by high level exodus, much like DC had. Seems to me that lately many of the 2nd teir guilds have stabilized, and it would be a stretch to call RNG a feeder guild. <br>
<br>
The &quot;feeder guild&quot; problem is one that I have been aware of for a long time, it takes strong leadership and a commited membership to avoid it. Fact is most people who play EQ, don't have what it takes to be uber, especially with the requirements of mandatory raiding and consistent gaming time required by uber guilds. 2nd teir guilds fill that niche. <br>
<br>
If no expansion comes out in the next 8 months, you can bet that some of the 2nd teir guilds will be bumping into comps and EV. Thats to me is the distinction. the 2nd teir guilds are doing things that EV and comps did 6-8 months ago.<br>

And I should maybe add that by smaller I don't mean by the number of members, but what they are capable of doing. It's just &quot;lesser guilds&quot; sounds so bad heh.<br>

I think when you're level 60 (and now, have a nice collection of AA points) you don't log on to group, you log on to socialice. And a great way to socialize at level 60 is to raid. I don't think many in EV/Comps really have a problem with raids being mandatory, there is no obligation to log on to raid (at least not in comps, I have no clue how it's in EV), but you're supposed to join a raid if you're on.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

Elche&gt;Its not about the folks in the uber guilds, of course they don't have a problem with raids being mandatory or with consistent gaming time, if they did they wouldn't be in an uber guild. But to be an uber guild you need those two things, and not everyone has the will, the means, the desire, or the ability to be uber. The second teir guilds are full of those slackers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Raids are a great way to socialize thats true, I think if you checked the raid calender of RNG, SP and the rest, you'd find they do quite a bit of raiding <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . You find that people in EV and Comps are there because they want to be uber and are willing to commit to that play style. Its not a playstyle that fits everyone. Thats why other guilds exist. <br>
<br>
Why is it that on Trib there are only 2 guilds that are uber, while on other servers, there is a rotation for Tunare and NToV is crawling with guilds? Because of the make up of our player base. It could be that the Trib is deficient in uber players.<br>

I'm sorry if you took that as a direct stab at yourself, I would never suggest that you are personally a loot whore , though you feel a need to say that I am one.<br>
<br>
 So in way of correction, I am wrong, because it is even more incorrect to insinuate that all officers of Uber guilds aren't loot oriented. I was just giving a perfect scenario, we all know that no guilds are perfect now, don't we <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The only reason I felt the need to address you and ask if you maybe were looking to join is we do have room for lootwhores (we don't really have that many) is we already have 20+ hardcore players and as per your definition we have or at least need 100 lootwhores. Judging by your description of why guilds became feeder guilds, you do sound like the perfect lootwhore to me.<br>
<br>
I play too much to be your average lootwhore, I would fit in the hardcore player section. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

Whats my proof?  nothing, aside from the fact that we were desperate for recruits (especially in key classes) a year and a half ago when we sucked.  Now that we're killing stuff, we get 84923432 recruit tell every day.  <br>
<br>
In all fairness though, the ratio of loot whores to people who care about the guild isnt that high.  A lot of us have been together for so long that our loyalties run a little deeper than loot I like to think.  Every big guild has people that care about loot more than the guild itself, but I like to think that those people are the minority, and not the majority. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwalkabout.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/22/02 3:50:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, Trains, and Sphincters</span><hr size=1> Rennat&gt;Walkabout I would rather be a lootwhore than a wannabe , which is why you changed guilds.<br>
<br>
Rennat,<br>
<br>
All you need to do now, is to get someone from my former guild (SP) or my present guild (Comps) to support you. I was someone who put in all my effort for my old guild, as I do now for Companions.<br>
<br>
I left my old guild on good terms, but I do place my loyalty where my guild wants it to be.<br>
<br>
You however, are a piece of shit, insiniatuing that everyone part of a raiding guild who isn't a hardcore raider is a lootwhore. You are a piece of shit telling the rest of the server the reason the most people join an &quot;uberguilld&quot; is for loot only &quot;your 20/80 ratio).<br>
<br>
In short, your're a piece of shit. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">
