He's been able to make a lot of his agenda happen over time.  He's had a long sucessful political career both at being elected and at getting others in Washington to do what he wants.<br>
<br>
So are we to believe he was stupid enough to make the comments he made by accident?<br>
<br>
Let's take a step back.  While the &quot;majority leader&quot; has huge power, they also get the most press attention.  While his comments may seem like political suicide, do we think in his cracker state they are going to affect his political future?  Maybe he already had decided not to seek another term.<br>
<br>
But the most powerful position you can be in at the moment as a Republican is the threat of resigning or switching parties.  Since the party switch angle has caused incredible resentment and cannot be taken seriously, is it possible that he made the comment he made on purpose knowing exactly what it would trigger?<br>
<br>
It's obvious the White House and Lott have been speaking - Bush got Lott's promise (in the midst of bashing him) that even if he steps down as majority leader, he will not resign as this would split the senate again.  I wonder what power Lott now wields.<br>
<br>
I just have a problem seeing him being stupid enough to make a public comment like he did after such a long career.  You don't become majority leader being a political idiot.  I'm wondering if there could have been a reason for bringing himself under fire. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ravlowscorpse.com/kot/images/sigs/rigadoon-gag.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ravlowscorpse.com/kot/images/sigs/rigadoon.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2012<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/17/02 9:18:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trent Lott</span><hr size=1> Was wondering how long it would be before this topic popped up here.<br>
<br>
I think what Lott did was the norm. The way he got his ass in a sling was that they changed the rules on him in the middle of the game. Reps and Dems both have been using racial quips for years and years. Not sure why Lott became the sacrificial lamb, but I think it stinks.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I hate racism, but I hate uneven punishment too. If my party wants to start weeding out the racists in our ranks, then they can attack Trent Lott. Till then it's just political based hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
The man has already humiliated himself by apologizing and begging. Leave him the fuck alone now and move on. <p><br>

<br>
As Rig pointed out, this man has been very successful in his political career.  So everyone is left wondering why he would say such &quot;racist&quot; comments.   <br>
<br>
Well it's my opinion that the guy wasn't refering to the segregation issues.<br>

Mr. Lott was trying to give praise to a long time Senator that was retiring.<br>
<br>
I can't think of the word for it, but what is going on is what happens among friends.  When you or a friend is discussing something, s/he says something that if taken out of context can mean something completely different.  Mostly this is done jokingly, but here it is being taken seriously.  The media is even pushing this, inserting into everyone's head that Mr. Lott meant exactly what they are saying he did. <br>
<br>
I don't believe that's what he was refering to, for to do so would be political suicide.  Mr. Lott isn't that stupid. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

And the pressure is not really coming from the Dems.  If it was JUST the Dems makeing noise about this it would be much ado about nothing however he ticked off more than a few republicans with his comments and THAT is what is making things shakey for him.<br>
<br>
Also the slip of the tongue argument doesn't wash, he said almost exactly the same thing before (then again why make it a major issue now)<br>
<br>
One thing I think may be happeneing is the Republican party really wants to break the Democratic strangle hold on the Black vote in this country.   While this is not an official maneuver, I think there are some in the Republican party who both did not like Lott much in the first place and are looking for a way to break out of the white male image the GOP has right now.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Byrd. while very Sr. and haveing served as a Committee chairman was not nearly as high up.  No one is even comptemplateing making Lott resign from the Senate.  He will have to face the voters and THEY will decide if his comments means he loses his job or not.  If the Republicans want to boot him as leader over this, that is thier buisness but don't try to make this out as some sort of left wing conspiracy.  Lott's fate is entirely up to the GOP.  It is THEY who are making this such a make or break issue for Lott. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
Lott is fucked though. They just came out with another clip of him in 2000 saying Thurman should have been president. Between that, the clip from the eighties and his voting record, I don't see this one going away no matter what he does. Then you add in the fact that he has been kissing ass on every racial issue since this started, it just looks like he'll say anything to keep his job.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, I don't know what started this. It was four days after he said it that this shit started, and if I remember right, of the twelve reporters there, none of them even started this story. If it was that big of deal, what the hell took the papers so long to post it?<br>

Loegan, I thought that second blurb from him about Thurmond being President was more specifically said in regard to his strong defense ideas.  It was made during some Senate speech/discussion, or some such about a bill on Defense.   I've only heard it mentioned once, so I may have the information wrong, since it was mentioned very quickly.  The reporter talking about it said something about how it actually further verified that Trott saw Thurmond as a strong defense orientated politician.<br>
<br>
Anyone have more information about this second blurb? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
This issue affects the GOP, and has aroused strong sentiments and arguments from it, but to argue that the GOP happily pointed at Lott and said &quot;Gee golly, look at what he said!&quot; is ridiculous.  What motivation would there be for that?<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you like to believe the democrats are to blame for every little problem btu it is most certainly misplaced here.&quot;<br>

*sigh*  *yawn*<br>
<br>
&quot;It was Republicans who made this an issue and now it is the Republicans who can settle it.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, Republicans did not make this an issue.  Republicans took the issue and ran with it, either defending Lott or calling for his removal.  Republicans are calling for Lott's removal NOT because they think Lott is a bad person, or a racist, or any of the utter hogwash that is coming from the press and Democrat organizations.  They, and I, want Lott removed from his position of leadership because this issue and its fallout will render him incapable of effective leadership.  He has proven this beyond a shadow of a doubt - his gutless prostrations on BET, his disavowment of his voting record (as if there is anything to be ashamed of), his repudiation of not only his vaguely insensitive remark (understandable) but the *policies* which he and the Republican party support, all demonstrate that he is more worried about appearing &quot;sensitive&quot; than doing what is right.  Principles do count for something, Senator.<br>
<br>
What Republicans need to do is demonstrate clearly to blacks why affirmative action is a bad idea and always has been, and why Lott's voting record on civil rights is nothing to be ashamed of, as black Democrats are proclaiming.  Let Lott's downfall be a catharsis for Republicans, not an opportunity to pander and bow down to the Democrats' notion of racial politics.  Don't play their game. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

<br>
The press did not make this a story.  A longtime Senator making very stupid remarks who should have known better made this a story.  By your standards all the issues Clinton had could be blamed on the press.<br>
<br>
The story was reported, decried by the Dems (naturally and not unexpectedly, Dems decrying GOP over race is not news, its backpage stuff anymore) and was dying fast till a couple things happened.  This really took off when two things happened.  A handful of black republicans in congress (and elsewhere) and a handful of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>conservative</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> media personalities spoke up (JC Watts being the most prominent amoung the lawmakers.) and when the White House, while not calling for his resignation, basically smacked him hard for the comments, opening the door for Lotts internal enemies to make a move.  <br>
<br>
Again how do you possible blame the Democrats or the press?  They weren't the ones who made such a stupid remark, how are they responsible for the bad image the GOP has amoung blacks, particularly in the south?  Of course the press reported it, no offense but when a Senetor make such a stupid blunder, it is news, no matter which party he belongs too.  Were there calls from the left for him to step down?  Yes there were but if that had been the ONLY place the calls were coming from was the left it would have been only so much noise.  Nothing would have happened.  In the press the calls have come from MOSTLY the right side.  The left side of the press hass been pretty much split between letting this go (after Lotts umpteenth apology) and those still pressing the issue.  The mainstream media despite the so called left wing bias (its really an anti-establishment bias, not quite the same thing) was very slow to join into the fray.  You said it yourself, some of the most public defences of Lott have come FROM individuals in the left (as well as the right)<br>
<br>
When I say the Dems had nothing to do with this I mean two things, the story would have been initially reported, Dems or no Dems.  And until a few someone's in the GOP decided to ditch Lott, either through cynical use of a sensitive issue or because they truely were offended, this was well on its way to disappearing from the collective conciousness despite any noise the Dems were making.  It is the Republicans who made Lotts leadership an issue, not the Dems.  Democrats do not really have it in thier powere to affect GOP leadership issues.  Hell if Bush were to intervene today on Lotts(over his leadership, not the comments) behalf this issue would be over no matter how much noise the Dems would make.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

But to say Trent Lott made this a story is ridiculous, unless you have something showing how he began to spread what he'd said.<br>

Someone made the connection between &quot;these problems&quot; and &quot;segregation&quot;, because the connection isn't specified within the speech itself.  Find the first person to do this, and you'll find the culprit.<br>

<br>
Basically the exact same thing he said last week.<br>
<br>
The things of it is, Thurman ran on Segregation... it was the main theme of his campaign.<br>
<br>
Basically you have to look at all this in the whole context over the years. Personally, I don't believe him due to him saying this 3 or 4 times that we know of and also based on hs voting record.<br>
<br>
I really don't see him as a danger though (especially not after this) and could care less if he steps down or not. In fact, I think most dems would like to see him stay as he is now a major liability to the reps and stacks the deck on our favor. <p><br>

I think part of the reason is that when Lott first made the comments, it went over the reporter heads just what kind of implications they entailed.  I am willing to bet some of the reporters there were surprised by the fact that Thurmond had actually ran for president at one time, let alone knew what his platform at the time was.<br>
<br>
I still think this is a internal power fight within the GOP and we are just seeing the public ripples from the struggle.  No politician gets into such a high and powerful position without stepping on a lot of toes.  It looks like someone saw a chance, threw out a couple trial balloons and when they got a favorable response (and some ham handed fumbling by Lott in his apologies) ran with it. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
Loegan, what 1 or 2 other times did he say this?  I'd like to see if they were in a different context than &quot;strong defense&quot;.  His voting record isn't really anything to be ashamed of.<br>
<br>
Martin Luther King - Would have been the first national holiday for someone that wasn't in public office?<br>
<br>
Affirmative Action - I believe the bills he voted against were tagged with quotas, which is bad (since quotas would lower job qualifications).  Plus I don't like one of the basic ideas of affirmative action.  Given two people equally qualified for the job, the job should go to the &quot;black man&quot;.  Isn't that just as racist as giving it to the &quot;white man&quot;?  The winner of the job got it based on race.<br>
<br>
There was a third bill they've asked him about his voting record, but I can't recall which it was. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
