The enchanter was a troubled man, the warrior brave and strong. Five others joined the group that day for a three hour hunt, a three-hour hunt. The adventure started out mighty tough; the tiny group was lost, if not for the directions from the fearless ranger the night would be tossed, the night would be tossed. The group set foot on the shore beneath the hob-goblin caves with Caeramac, Jarilon too, Sibapuyad and his twink, the healer and the merry dwarves. Here on Thursday nights. <br>
<br>
Journal entry...<br>
It was a dark and stormy night in the plane of nightmare. The howls of the strange creatures of the land filled the air. The glow of the gloom nightmares illuminated the camp that the hardy adventure setup. The nightmares are pets of The Shade, the evil force that the band had gathered to destroy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm about forty stones, I was pretty sure I had paid for sixty.&quot; Ellendrone said shaking the small bag he used to store his peridots. &quot;I bet that dark elf cheated me, if I see him again I will sic Jobner on him&quot; the cleric said touching his hammer that he could animate in battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think we are out of beer&quot; Cearamac stated in a pained voice. Reaching into his backpack, Taug pulled out a stout dwarven ale. Throwing the skin to the enchanter he said &quot;careful with that it’s strong.&quot; &quot;I know chimed in the other dwarf, Synisalo, I once had half a mug of it and was drunk for three days.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jarilon&quot; the dwarf shouted, looking at the druid deep in meditation &quot;strength&quot;. The druid sighed and began to converse with nature summoning the strength of the winds and the earth and imbuing the dwarf with its strength. &quot;Ell&quot; whined the dwarf &quot;your god has forsaken me, I no longer feel protected&quot; &quot;Ell?&quot; &quot;Yes Syni, I told you as soon as I am done praying I will grant you protection,” the cleric said for the third time in five minutes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Sib, can you help me with your ranger stuff&quot; the dwarf said loud enough for the world to hear. &quot;Ssh&quot; replied the ranger putting his finger to his mouth and pointing down the hill. &quot;If we are to rid the cave of the hobgoblin guards we must do so one at a time&quot; <br>
<br>
Whispering now the dwarf leaned towards the chanter &quot; if we are gonna be taking on hobs I will need to be faster&quot;<br>
<br>
After the party made ready, the ranger went down the hill to get one of the hobgoblin guards. A few minutes later he came scampering up the hill being chased by not one but three hobgoblins. &quot;Taug take the one on the right, Syni the center one, Caeramac mesmerize the left one,” the ranger shouted out in a panic, shelving his bow and joining the third in melee.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will heal sib and Taug, Jar you make sure Syni makes it through alive.&quot; the cleric said franticly whispering his holy words. &quot;I got you&quot; responded the druid emphatically<br>
<br>
&quot;Caer mezz this&quot; the ranger pleaded. &quot;Huh what&quot; the enchanter said returning from doing his business by a near by tree. <br>
<br>
The battle waged back and forth the mighty warriors and the crafty ranger were outmatching the ugly fiends. With a loud thud and a clang, Synisalo's helmet was knocked to the ground. The dwarf followed, soon after.<br>
<br>
&quot;You girls look pretty tonight,” the elf thought to himself, thinking of the three young ones he left at home. &quot;Daddy is here to take care of you&quot; Jarilon cooed. A burning pain awoke the druid from his daydream, as blood poured out of the wound in his chest, a large gash made by the hobgoblin that felled the mighty dwarf. Seeing his fallen comrade the druid did what he thought was best. Summoning up his strength and gathering his concentration the druid released his spell, even as the hobgoblin's claws bit into his flesh. &quot;Whoa, guys that was a close one...guys?&quot; breathed Jarilon into the empty night sky.<br>
Jarilon was away from danger, but also away from his friends. Just in the distance he could make out the tree that he called home.<br>
<br>
Realizing his mistake, Jarilon quickly began casting another spell and was whisked back close to the camp with his friends. Calling forth the power of eagles the druid flew to where he saw his comrades last.<br>
<br>
Blood was every where. Hobgoblin parts covered Taug, and Sibapuyad. The ranger's robinhood like hat was stained red its feather hanging low from the weight of the gore. The crumpled body of Synisalo, laid in a fetal positioned against a funny smelling tree. Caeramac, giving the body a soft nudge with his foot exclaimed &quot;burp, he is dead lets move on before he starts to stink&quot;.<br>
<br>
The cleric still weary from the battle, battered and bruised, depleted of all his magic, limped toward his fallen comrade. &quot;He's not dead, he is just mostly dead&quot; Ellendrone said in a strained voice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave him, he is of no used to us mostly dead&quot;, the ranger said dismissing the dwarf with a wave. &quot;We are gonna need more help then he could provide anyway.&quot; Sibapuyad, said looking at the cleric who was already involved in some ritual.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have some friends that could help&quot; Said Taug as he wiped blood from his face on the back of the enchanter's robe.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can get your friends Taug&quot;, huffed Jarilon, as he flew into camp. &quot;There is no need for that,” said the dwarf, dropping to his buff. Then to the surprise of all around, Taug began to unbuckle his boots. &quot;Aren't you gonna get your friends&quot;, gasped the newly revived Synisalo. &quot;Yes, Yes they will be here soon&quot; the dwarf continued taking off his boots and socks.<br>
<br>
His socks were the oddest things you could image; they looked like they had faces on them. Placing one sock on his right hand &quot;this is Blackistan the cleric, you can call him Blacki&quot; then putting the other sock on his left hand &quot;This is Qryrofjleihsdfgklskszxvj yibgkrbhigfvibgfklbsfqqqqyyebrtkks, you can call him Q&quot;. The party looked at the dwarf not quite sure how to respond.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are going to have to rest the night&quot; said Ellendrone wearily, &quot;beside hobgoblins don't like the sun light&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;You get five minutes as soon as Syni is ready we try again&quot; barked the ranger, wiping goblin entrails from his feathered hat. &quot;We are ready to go Sib&quot; Taug said, nodding his wrists in agreement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well glah I sam outsa ber&quot; said the enchanter with a slur. With that he disappeared into the night sky, away from kamp.<br>
<br>
After about three minutes the ranger was on his feet scouting of the hobgoblin encampment. Ellendrone whispered prayers to his god, as the druid hugged a tree. &quot;Any one know why this tree smells funny?&quot; the druid said, as he returned to camp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gahh&quot; Screamed the ranger as he scampered back to camp.&quot; I think a whole mob is coming&quot;. Hearing this the druid began to cast his spell again&quot;. &quot;No this time we all fight...ah Caeramac?&quot; the rangers said now confused as he scanned the area for the missing enchanter. <br>
&quot;It's Fine Sib, you and Syni get the two on the left we can take care of the ones on the right&quot; the dwarf said hefting his mighty double axe in his sock clad hands&quot;.<br>
&quot;That one on the far left is their leader Syni, he is the scourge of the area&quot; Sib said, as he released arrow after arrow, from his magical bow, into the other hobgoblin.<br>
<br>
Taug swung his mighty axe into the chest of the right most monsters, as the other goblin looked mesmerized by the funny dwarf with the talking socks. The Axe switched from Taug's left hand to his right, never slowing in his attack on the hobgoblin. But as the axe switched hands, the dwarf would say some thing and wiggle his hand around. &quot;Feel the Wrath of Tunare&quot; the dwarf, said, with the axe now in his left hand. &quot;Beguile belar, foul beast&quot; Taug said, now with the axe in his right hand.<br>
&quot;Taste hot steel&quot; the warrior screamed, as the axe cut through the hobgoblin's mouth. Blood splattered every where as the dwarf charged his second foe. &quot;Stay, Tunare commands you&quot;,&quot;slow, nether creature&quot;, &quot;Betcha weren't expecting that, you bastard&quot; the warrior shouted in a jumble.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the rest of the party was dealing with the other goblins. Three arrows leaped from the ranger's bow one after another ...twang twang twang. The smaller of the two hobgoblins was pinned to the ground. Synisalo was like a whirling dervish swinging his sword and pick, in all directions. His sword grinding the hobgoblin's flesh to a pulp. Then with a well-placed shot he split the creature's skull like a block of ice.<br>
<br>
When the ranger was done with the second fiend it looked like some sort of feathered beast of lore, half goblin half bird.<br>
<br>
When the dust had finally settled, all the hobgoblins laid dead at our hero's feet. The companions’ turn towards each other to inspect themselves every one was there, Ellendrone the cleric, Jarilon, Synisalo, Sibapuyad, and Taug and his two sock puppets. Appearing from nowhere was Caeramac with a full skin of beer &quot;Back, did I miss anything&quot; he said, the effect of the pervious alcohol seemed to be gone from his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick into the water you will find a cave to the north it is through there we must travel&quot; Sibapuyad said diving underneath the black water.<br>
<br>
One after another the party followed, like well armored penguins, into the icy depths below.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guys, has any one seen Caeramac?&quot; the cleric said brushing his long black hair out of his face. &quot;Gah! Not again&quot; the ranger sighed &quot;I'll go get him&quot; he said, using the words he uttered all too often.<br>
<br>
So taking a deep breath Sib jumped into the water. How a ranger can track underwater might never be understood. Perhaps the movement of the fish, disturbances of the plant life or maybe it was the fact that the enchanter was swimming frantically towards him as red wisps of blood mixed with the dark waters. Behind the enchanter was all manner of creatures, biting fish, a crocodile, a slarghilug (the frogman that fish the waters), and of course a hobgoblin. It was quite a procession. The ranger grabbed Caeramac, pulled him to the surface and into the cave. &quot;Get ready, It seems Caer has made some friends&quot; the ranger commanded restringing his bow. <br>
As the creatures popped their heads out of the water, they were beset upon by our noble heroes. First the croc died with out much of a fight. &quot;I want that meat,” said the druid, who was not a vegetarian like many of his ilk. Then the frogman leapt out of the water with his primitive spear, seeing he was greatly out numbered, he thought it better to flee. As he turned to leave, an arrow pierced him through the neck. &quot;Oh, give me that meat too&quot; Jarilon said, with a ravenous gleam in his eye. Those of you who have never eaten Slarghilug don't know what your missing, part of it tastes like lobster, and the other part, taste of course like chicken.<br>
<br>
The hobgoblin's ugly gray head appeared out of the water it's tangled hair was a mess of vegetation and fur, water dripped off it's eight foot frame (ok it only seemed eight foot tall, in actuality hobgoblins are not much bigger then dwarves). Its claws gleamed a black so dark, light seem to get lost in it. Its fangs were stained red and pieces of fish dangled from its maw. With a howl it sprung into battle. The enchanter startled, immediately tried to cast a spell on it. Seeing Caeramac's motions it raced towards him before any of the others could act.<br>
<br>
&quot;Caeramac, don't aggrovate the monsters&quot; the cleric said, with a sigh, as he began casting his powerful heal spell. Even before the hobgoblin tore the flesh from the enchanters face blue light emitted from the cleric surrounding Caeramac. Almost as fast as the wound was made it healed, blood dried and skin and muscle repaired its self. The goblin turn it's attention towards the cleric. The warriors taunted furiously to try to get the fiend to turn and attack them. &quot;Your mom is a halfling,” Synisalo cried out. &quot;Your hair is matted, wet and you smell funny&quot; Taug said giggling to himself &quot;yeah that's a good one&quot;. You see warriors are terrible taunters, young girls at the wizard school have been known to be more mean.<br>
<br>
Placing his left hand in the hobgoblin's face, Taug mumbled a muffled sound. Angered by the dwarf, the goblin turned and started attacking which left an opening for the enchanter's tiny dagger. &quot;Caeramac, what have I told you about engaging the monsters&quot; Sib said with a stern look. &quot;But I killed it, I did real good, I killed it dead. It's dead, and I am not.&quot; Caeramac said spinning his knife. <br>
<br>
&quot;But, Caer we need you to rest during the fight so you will have the energy to cast your spells&quot; Jarilon said, explaining the reasoning for what seem to be the hundredth time.<br>
<br>
&quot;What ever&quot; Caeramac responded taking another swing of beer.<br>
<br>
The group wound its way through the dark dank caves. The only light they had was luminous lichen that glowed a pale green. <br>
&quot;There is a drop off over here&quot; said the cleric just above a whisper. &quot;We are gonna have to be careful and stay close&quot; warned the cleric as he began to float down with the aid of the druids levitate spell. The others followed one by one first the ranger, then the dwarves; the druid next then passing the cleric the enchanter came rocketing down. With a great thud and, &quot;I am ok&quot; Caeramac, made his presence known. &quot;Ah guys, I don't think I got levitate.&quot; Caeramac winced, finally noticing the pain in his ankle. &quot;I think it's broken,” Taug said not moving his lips, but wiggling the sock on his right hand. &quot;I can fix it,” the dwarf said again with out moving his lips.<br>
&quot;No that's ok, why don't you secure the camp&quot;, &quot;Ell, why don't you see what you can do&quot; the ranger said shoeing the dwarf away.<br>
<br>
OK the next area ahead is filled with bats, but if we leave them alone they will leave is alone.<br>
<br>
So the party proceeded quickly and quietly into the bat caves. &quot;I can't hardly see&quot; whispered Ellendrone, squinting his eyes against the darkness. &quot; I can't see shit&quot; muttered Caeramac who began an incantation. Light burst from his finger spreading every where. &quot;Put that out you fool do you want to alert the hobgoblins&quot; Synisalo snapped. In the brief time the light was on you could see the bats they were every where thousands of them. Some were small fruit bats other larger species of bats and finally the horrible, terror bats, which are almost as big as a man. <br>
<br>
The bats were not the worst of the problems, hobgoblins were. The hobgoblins that lived in the caves harvest the bat guano to grow the eerie lichen that lined the caves. The problem with Guano is it smells awful. <br>
&quot;Ew, what is that smell&quot; Caeramac wheezed holding his nose.<br>
&quot;It's Jarilon, druid use oils from the earth to mask their own odors&quot; Taug's sock covered right hand blurted out.&quot; No, it's not me it's the bats, well their guano to be exact&quot; Jarilon said while sniffing himself.<br>
&quot;Wind of Tunare, breath of the goddess allow us to breathe clean&quot; chanted the druid as he invoked a prayer. It was the same prayer he often used at home when changing the triplets diapers. A cool breeze flooded the caverns with the sweet smell of lavender. &quot;Mother of Marr, that is a useful spell you need to teach me that, for next time that bard Zannabarr comes to visit&quot; Ellendrone said, thinking of Sib's younger brother's uh.... problem.<br>
<br>
The party moved forward cautiously through the caverns. The ranger always 20 paces ahead scouting and looking for an ambush. The ranger stopped, then held up his hand indicating that the party should stop. &quot;I think we are passed the bats. There is another drop off ahead, then we need to take the right fork in the tunnels.&quot; Sibapuyad said, going over the route in his head as he spoke. Stepping to the edge of the drop Caeramac said &quot;wow that is quite a drop huh&quot; then he let out a light whistle. He must have hit a pitch that the bats did not like because soon our heroes were swamped with them. Little bats fluttering in their faces, larger ones clawing and two giant terror bats. &quot; Amazing Clangflooring&quot; shouted the enchanter, throwing dust in the air. Seconds later all but the two-terror bats fell to the floor stunned. The two large bats headed right towards, Caeramac.<br>
&quot;Mithaniel bind the bat&quot; Ellendrone whispered to his god. Then one of the bats crashed to the ground bound by the weight of the gods. Before the second bat could reach the enchanter an earthen hand reached up and grabbed it from the sky.&quot; I got the other one,” said Jarilon as he took a bite from a dragon egg.<br>
The two warriors immediately were on the one bat hacking away at it, as it lay pinned to the ground. The ranger filled the other full of arrows as it struggled against the earthen hand.<br>
&quot;We must make our way quickly down the slope, for I am sure the goblins heard our fighting.&quot; Sibapuyad said, shouldering his bow.<br>
<br>
The ranger was right; the Hobgoblins had heard their fighting and were setting up an ambush. Sib reached into to his pocket, and pulled out what at first glance appeared to be a watch. The Object twinkled, then glowed and finally a great burst of fire leapt for from it. Three goblins were burn in the blast and others scattered. <br>
&quot;Wow, what was that sib?” said the druid, blinking in disbelief. <br>
&quot;That my friends is Twink, my pocket wizard. I got it from a high elf named Alivar&quot;. Sib picked up the tiny fairy shook off some of the glitter and said &quot;Good job Twink, I'll call you if we need you again&quot; then he placed the tiny little wizard in his breast pocket.<br>
&quot;Well the hobgoblins seem disorganized and scared, perhaps we best be moving&quot; Ellendrone said, has he moved forward. The others soon followed with the ranger moving to the front.<br>
The druid seemed to be in a daze, but he followed the cleric like he was on a string. Every now and then the druid would bang into a wall and be awoken from his stupor. &quot;Huh what, no I am still with you&quot; Jarilon said has he came to his senses.<br>
&quot;Ok there is an intersection up ahead we need to head to the right hopefully we can avoid any more goblin patrols.&quot; Sibapuyad said looking down the deep dark tunnel...<br>
<br>
At the intersection a lone hobgoblin patrolled. &quot;I'll get him sib,” said Jarilon readying one of his druid spells. &quot;No, let me try something&quot;. &quot;He did not just say that&quot; The cleric said looking at the two dwarves. &quot;Ah I think he did&quot; responded Synisalo. &quot;Yeah I think he did&quot; agreed Taug. &quot;Yep, yup&quot; both his socks said in unison. Firing a flaming arrow at the lone creature sib yelled to the party &quot;the hobgoblin is incoming kill it quickly&quot;. The lone Hobgoblin came, then another and another. Five in total each screeching and swinging their claws. The ranger was about to be overwhelmed. &quot;Beguile amazement&quot; Caeramac said throwing up silver dust directly over his head. The whole world froze cleric and warriors were amazed as the goblins stopped dead in their tracks. The Ranger lay on his back in a fetal position. The druid was trying to remember the words to his gate spell. Caeramac, well he was mesmerized by his own spell.<br>
As the world came back into focus the warriors each were on a hobgoblin, the cleric still baffled that the ranger was some how still alive stood slack jawed. Jarilon having recalled the words to his spell began to speak them when he realized that every one was still alive. One after another the hobgoblins dropped and as the last body hit the floor, Caeramac broke free from his spell. There was no time for celebration as Sib was pushing the party forward and to the right. &quot;Moved down here as far as you can, there should not be another patrol for a while&quot; the ranger said, forcing his way down the right passage way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mephits, why did it have to be mephits&quot;, whined Synisalo as the came to a camp of the ugly blue creatures.<br>
<br>
Mephits are horrible things ugly and mean with smallish wings, too small to support their weight naturally. Tis an unholy power that grants them the limited flight they have. If you have never been in close proximity of a mephit, thank Agnos, for they are perhaps the smelliest thing this side of a dwavern brothel. Above all else though mephits are dumb.<br>
<br>
A lone mephit wandered away from its companions to do its &quot;duty&quot;. Moving behind a large rock the ugly blue creature turned to find itself face to face with the party of intrepid adventurers. &quot;Kill it,” said Taug, hefting his axe. &quot;Yes, Kill it kill it&quot; screeched Synisalo jumping up and down alternating legs. &quot;I want the meat&quot; called the druid. &quot;eew&quot; responded the ranger. You see mephit meat is more disgusting then hobgoblin meat. &quot;Oh I am out of beer,” Caeramac said searching through his pack. &quot;Snare it don't let it get away&quot; the cleric sighed.<br>
Stone hands reached from the earth holding the mephit in its place. &quot;Or I can root it&quot; sighed the cleric again. Taug and Sib quickly dispatched the mephit. Synisalo watched half shielding his face as the ugly blue creature died. Almost before the body hit the ground Syni was at the corpse filling small glass vials with the creatures blood. &quot;What are you doing I thought you didn't like mephits&quot; Ellendrone asked. &quot;I don't like them, but this blood sells for a lot in the bazaar&quot; Syni replied.<br>
&quot;Ok, we need a plan&quot; Sib said as he drew a tiny map in the dirt. &quot;Ok there are six of us&quot;, &quot;eight&quot; chimed in Taug, &quot;ok 8 of us&quot; sib continued. &quot;And a S-load of them&quot; said Caermac burping. &quot;Yes Caer, there are a lot of them&quot; Jarilon restated nicely. &quot;These thing can be nasty be they are no worse then the hobgoblins&quot; Ellendrone stated matter of factly. Just then another Mephit wandered into the party. &quot;Pzsylapt, Pzsylapt tar do?&quot; one of the nasty blue creatures shouted. Quickly the party ambushed him. <br>
About five minutes later another mephit came around the corner &quot;Pzsylapt, Magrw, tar do?&quot; the beast hissed. Just as fast the creature was dead. A few moments later &quot;Pzsylapt, Magrw, Qwryz, tar do?&quot; this continued for over an hour until one by one the mephits were dispatched. &quot;Them things might be nasty but they are not to bright huh?&quot; Sibapuyad said cleaning his swords. &quot;Yeah and they bleed like stuck pigs&quot; laughed Synisalo putting away the last of his blood filled vials. .<br>
Making their way past the camp where the memphits once occupied they plodded up the steep incline towards their destination the plateau of the Shade.<br>
An eerie glow shined ahead them they could almost make out the exit of the tunnel when a larger, more sinister, and if possible more smelly mephit jump out in front of them. &quot;yoos killed them...joo killed them all...Vhaksiz will not be happy&quot; The Agony mephit shouted as it attacked.<br>
Caeramac reached into his belt pouch and threw some slivery powder &quot;Camandus slugish&quot; he called out. The mephit turned towards him &quot;Caeramac, you will not evade me&quot;. How the creature knew his name, or understood if there was one person that could not evade him it was Caeramac, may never be known. Caermac dropped faster then a gnome in a halfling pie-eating contest. (Not halfling pies but pies eaten by halfling for the ogre readers out there...wait what am I saying ogres can't read).<br>
Before he even hit the ground the cleric and druid where summoning the powers of their respective deities. &quot;Tunare I beseech thee heal thine subject's friend&quot; Jarilon said as the moss grew around the unconscious chanter. &quot;Marr, It's me yup him again&quot; whispered the cleric to his god. Caeramac was up before the moss covered half his body. Just as fast he was down again as the blue beast whipped around and clawed him. <br>
Downing the chanter again it turned toward the two healers. Looking at the elf in leather and the human in plate it headed right for Ellendrone. The warrior's tried fiercely to get the mephit's attention &quot;your mother is a smurf and your father is Gargamel&quot; taunted Syni using his best dwarven curse. Taug taunted &quot;smelly, smelly taste like jelly&quot;. Only once the ranger started slashing it with his sword did it turn away. &quot;Tunare it's Blackistan please&quot; the puppet on Taug's hand said pointing at the enchanters body.<br>
The combine might of the two warriors and the ranger was enough to take down the mephit leader. &quot;Look at this,&quot; the ranger said holding up an earring that still had pieces of the mephits ear.&quot; &quot;Do you think we can sell it?” said Syni wiping his blade clean. &quot;Yeah it's magical,” said the enchanter who's clothed were a jumble of blood and moss. &quot;I can use that&quot; he continued. &quot;But but...money&quot; the dwarf trailed off. &quot; Lets get moving I can see the sun setting through the cave mouth if we want to take out the shade we need to hurry&quot;. The ranger said sheathing his sword. &quot;Up the hill move it&quot;.<br>
<br>
They finally arrived at the shade’s plateau. The field there was a lush green, everything seem peaceful, serene. The trees were swaying softly in the cool fresh air. Only the smell of brimstone and decay reminded them why they were there. “Careful now, we are close,” the ranger said almost silently. “Move to the left and follow the wall” Sib said, as he scout ahead. Out of the darkness flaming hooves raced. A large black horse snorted steam from its snout. With out thinking Synisalo was hacking at the beast. Taug’s axe ripped into the large beast’s hide. The fiery hooves kicked and knocked the dwarf off balance. Fire and lightning called from the sky knocked the nightmare to the ground. “Thanks Tunare love yah” the druid said kissing his fingers and holding them to the sky. <br>
Another Beast charged this one was meet with a hail of arrows. The horse continued its charge. From out of the clerics hands a hammer flew and with a will of its own attacked the hell spawned creature. Ancient magics flew from Caeramac’s hands burning the creature’s mind. Another volley of arrows landed and brought the beast to its end. Arising from the smoke was the shade himself. Riding atop an undead version of the fiery beast was the horseman of death. His pale skin gleamed, his black armor shone in the setting sun. In his hand he held a twisted piece of metal, a sword that he called the disemboweler.<br>
The two warriors stood side by side hefting their weapons. The ranger moved to a flanking position. Ellendrone stood just behind the warriors deep in thought as if trying to remember something long forgotten. Jarilon moved between the Taug and Sibapuyad ready to heal either of his comrades. Caeramac was digging in his bag for another drink. With a flash of steel the Shade attacked its horse crashing into the much smaller Synisalo. With a single touch of hellfire Taug was knocked to one knee. Ellendrone’s hammer again flew out and with the power of Marr began attacking. But as axe sword and arrows struck the shade they bounced off his armor as if some unholy spell protected him. The magics thrown at it by enchanter and druids seemed to do little to slow the shades attack. Only through great skill and their defensive style of fighting were the two warriors able to stand. As Ellendrone healed his friends he kept thinking, &quot;there is something I am forgetting&quot;. From his pocket sib drew his tiny wizard Twink. “Blast it with all you got Twink” Sib shouted over the roar of combat. Spell after spell flew from the small fairy blasting the shade with its eldritch magic. Though the shade was mostly untouched his attention was drawn to Twink. One thing you don’t want to do is get an unholy beast focused on you. With a swipe of his sword the tiny annoyance was gone.<br>
“What was it that the Mephit in the cave said” Ellendrone said more to himself they anyone else. “Something about Vhaksiz would make us pay…that’s it the shades name is Vhaksiz” the cleric said as if the he had discovered the meaning of life. “Say his name…say his name,” the cleric shouted and the ranger repeated. Then almost as one they shouted “Vhaksiz...Vhaksiz.. Vhaksiz.. Vhaksiz.. Vhaksiz..” “ Shade” shouted Caeramac, all proud of himself. With in seconds the gleam left the shade’s skin the armor glistened less and more importantly blood started pouring from the small nicks and cuts that had made during the fight. A black feather arrow flew from the ranger’s bow and landed with a thwack in the shade's neck. Blue light from the cleric struck the shade as fire from the heaven’s showered down on it. And in moment the shade was defeated.<br>
“ I want his sword,” cried out Syni from beneath the remains of the shade's horse. “ I want the meat,” the druid said on reflex. “I need a beer,” said the chanter. “ I think we can all use a drink,” the ranger said pulling out some elven wine. With that the party strolled toward the sun.<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
