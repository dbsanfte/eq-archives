<br>
First book I've been reading, Russia's War by Richard Overy, turning out to be as good as everyone has said it was.<br>
<br>
As far as our debate, there are two factors that have lead to the idea that the Lend Lease program did not aid Russia very much during WWII.<br>
<br>
- Improper Perspective - It's often mainly viewed as a program that shipped military weapons.  So only the planes and tanks that were sent are really looked at by most people.  I believe this is because it's easier to think of the impact that 1000 tanks would have, rather than what 1000 gallons of fuel could have provided.<br>
<br>
In actuality, the Lend Lease's biggest aid was in support supplies.<br>
<br>
Russia had 92 Locomotives, the US supplied 1900.  (The earlier shipments of these locomotives helped supply the Russian offensive in 1942, IE Stalingrad.)<br>
<br>
Russia produced 1,087 railway cars, 11,075 were produced via the Lend-Lease program.<br>
<br>
56 percent of the rails used to rebuild the Russian supply system came from the Lend-Lease program.  One railway was specifically built to ship supplies for the 1942 Russian Offensive.<br>
<br>
Radios - Prior to 1941, the Russian military had few radios, and they weren't incorporated into their tactics like the Germans had (every German tank had a radio).  With the losses in 1941 the availablility of radios decreased even further.  The German military also triangulated Russian radio traffic, and attacked such command posts that used their radios, contributing to the losses of radios.  (The earliest shipments of radios were used in the 1942 Russian Offensive, which was the largest they'd ever were able to mount, and was very successful.  Lend Lease radios helped make that happen.)<br>
<br>
Trucks - In 1942, at the start of the 1st largely successful Russian offensive, only 5% of the military vehicles were foreign, but still aided in allowing the Russian military to maneuver quickly during the 1942 offensive.<br>
<br>
Food - In 1941, Leningrad was seeing the first supplies of food from the Lend-Lease program.  The supply from the states during this period was only a trickle though, but if you knew the conditions within the seiged city, you'd know that every scrap of food helped.  By 1942, during the Russian offensive, the troop's food rations were able to be increased.  Around half of the shipped weight of goods to Russia was food.  SPAM, the condensed meat product, was universally refered as &quot;second fronts&quot;.<br>
<br>
Aviation Fuel - 58 percent of the aviation fuel used by Russia during the war was shipped via the Lend Lease program.  During the 1942 offensive, Russia's Air Force was of a strength that allowed them to fight effectively, with newly built Russian aircraft.<br>
<br>
All of these supplies and others allowed the Russian industry that was rebuilt and retooled by late 1942 to concentrate on the production of military weapons.  (Tanks, Rifles, Planes, Ammunition)  These additional weapons were first available in 1942 for the Russian offensive, but it wasn't until 1943 and the 2nd Russian offensive when things all came together.  With the additional tanks, experience, food, radios, and most importantly Stalin stepping back and allowing his Generals to do their job.  Allowed the Russian military deliver a crushing blow to the German army.<br>
<br>
<br>
- The Cold War - Since the end of WWII, the Russian government's stance on the effect of the Lend Lease program mirrors what Merton has presented.  It would have done them harm in the political war, if the US could claim that Russia owed the US for their existance, no matter how small of a claim.  This plan was instituted years before the end of war.  The military trucks and other vehicles that were shipped to Russia in 1942 were stenciled with USA.  The meaning of those letters were altered for the peasant's eyes to not mean USA, but instead &quot;Ubit Sukina syna Adolfa&quot;, translated means &quot;to kill that son-of-a-bitch Adolf!&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now no one should take this to mean that the Lend-Lease program was the sole reason for the Russians to have defeated the German's so soundly.  There were many factors that led up to the German defeat on the eastern front.  Some of them were committed by German forces, and others by the Russian forces.  So often the Russians, fearful of what would happen (by Stalin's political police) if they surrendered, their driven hatred for the Germans (in their 1941 offensive they recaptured portions previously occupied by Germany and discovered the horrors of German occupation, not to say Russian occupation was any less brutal), or the very basic Russian drive to survive, allowed those soldiers to fight to the bitter end.  German troops were fearful of the Russian soldier, for they knew each battle was to the death.<br>
<br>
What the Lend-Lease did, was to give Russia that extra leg up, that helped them to halt the German advances, bidding the time they needed.  So often Russian forces were on the very brink of destruction.  Every bullet, every morsel of food counted, and allowed their forces to resist.  By the summer of 1943, the revitalization of the Russian industry (helped in part by Russian industrialists being trained in the US), and the added supplies of the Lend-Lease program, allowed the Russian Army to mount the broad and decisive counter offensive in 1943, which broke the back of the German army.  In 1943 the Russian military was finally able to face the German army on far more equal terms.<br>
<br>
In taped interviews for Khrushchev's memoirs (IE the words that he will be remembered by for history!), he stated &quot;Several times I heard Stalin acknowledge within the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>small circle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of people around him.  He said that . . . if we had had to deal with Germany one-to-one we would not have been able to cope because we lost so much of our industry.&quot;  Because of the Cold War, this information wasn't published until the 1990s.<br>
<br>
1. Why would Khrushchev state in his personal memoirs, which he knew would not be released publically during his lifetime, such a thing about Stalin?<br>
2. Why would Stalin admit such things in private, when they would only lessen the stature of the USSR?  He never stated them publically, even when he wanted a more open relationship with the Western World, before, during and after the war?<br>
<br>
General Zhukov, the leading commander of the Russian Military.  He was Stalin's &quot;go to guy&quot;, when things needed to be done.  Every successful major operation, offensive and defensive, that occurred from the start of the war was planned by Zhukov and his command staff.  He stated in a private interview that was secretly taped in 1963 (when the Cold War was well underway), that he endorsed the view that without aid the Soviet Union &quot;could not have continued the war&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Russian position on &quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot; is one of honor.  They paid a high price, more than any other country, and many countries combined, for victory against Germany.  They don't want their glory tarnished or stolen in the least.  This would be the case with the notion that they required help from countries that would later become their arch nemisis.  So during the Cold War, their propoganda machine turned out the view that Russia defeated Germany in the east single handedly.  Though I find it wrong to have done this, I can fully understand their motives.<br>
<br>
The Lend-Lease program did not instill the fearce fighting spirit within the Russian soldier.  It only helped give him the oppurtunity to unleash that fighting spirit upon Germany.<br>
<br>
WWII was won by the ALLIES.  Both British and US can readily admit, that without the Eastern Front, we wouldn't have been victorious.  There is no way we could have conducted a landing on mainland Europe if those forces in Russia were otherwise redeployed in Europe.  It's time for Russia to readily admit that it wouldn't have been able to cope without aid from the west. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A> at: 10/29/02 2:14:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 1631<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/30/02 1:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=203>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Looking back over this thread and re-reading my posts weeks later, I find myself to have been overly rabid.

<br>
But the crux of the issue (and that is why I went kinda apeshit in this thread) is that every time that Europeans disagree or critique the American government, they get &quot;America saved your ass from Hitler&quot; thrown in their face.  Which is just a gross misrepresentation of the facts.  Speaking of gross misrepresentation of the facts...<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Since the end of WWII, the Russian government's stance on the effect of the Lend Lease program mirrors what Merton has presented.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
While I never presented false numbers to bolster my argument and could definitely cite my sources if needed be, I was guilty myself of perpetrating intellectual dishonesty.  The way I presented my arguments and facts about Lend-Lease were done to discredit it and ultimately present it as insignificant.<br>
<br>
While the rest of the world refers to the conflict as World War II, Russians refer to it as &quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot; or another loose translation is &quot;Great War of the Fathers&quot; (Velikaya Otechestvenaya Voyna).  The point being is that no one sacrificed as much as the Russians did to defeat Germany and when a random ignorant yank waltzes in and proclaims how America saved Europe through such &quot;glorious&quot; engagements as D-Day or Battle of the Bulge while not even realizing that the extreme scale of the fighting that Americans/British reached in Europe on those 2 occasions, were happening daily for months in Russia. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maxamaji>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 573<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/30/02 4:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=204>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> That's because of their gay zerg tactics.<br>

<br>
To support Merton's point about American vs Russian deaths.<br>
<br>
The US lost ~295,000, Britian lost ~328,000 soldiers, ~62,000 civilians.<br>
<br>
Russia, lost an average of ~8,000 (not sure if this is civilian and military) a DAY for the entire war.  Note that after 1943 Russian death rates were dropping to the more &quot;normal&quot; levels that other countries were experiencing, so imagine the death rates from 1941 - mid 1943!  In the first days of the war, Russian soldiers charged machine guns with baynets fixed and no ammo.  In the days of defence for Moscow, a militia was formed of some 270,000 men.  They armed these men with mostly pitch forks, swords and other farm utensils.  It isn't a surprise that they were all killed to the man.  The Russians would continually charge fixed German positions across open fields.  It wasn't rare for 2,000 Russians to be killed to the man, while the Germans only suffered burns from handling hot machine gun barrels.<br>
<br>
No other country in the world could have suffered the losses that Russia did. Thankfully no other country placed themselves into a position to test such fortitude.<br>

As for having &quot;we saved your asses from the Germans&quot; shoved in the faces of Europeans, perhaps it's from the apparent lack of gratitude and continual barrage of stinging remarks that US citizens receive from around the world.  Some is warranted, but most is complete and utter ignorance. I find it hiliarious since most of the negative utterances from Euros is about how ignorant and arrogant Americans are.<br>
<br>
So you'll just have to accept the facts of the truth.  Russia's  existance owes itself to the Western countries that it ended up fighting during the Cold War, not to say we didn't aid Russia for our own survival.  Be assured that the WWII ace card will be brought out to trump the negative comments that the US has to endure so often when forums get into pissing contests. =)<br>

It has bearing on why the &quot;trump card&quot; is played.<br>
<br>
If the US had been self centered, blind to the world, neutrally aligned, jackasses, Hitler would not have been stopped.  Russia would have fallen.  You would not be alive.  Israel would not exist. The US would possibly be facing a German dominated Europe today.  No other country can say this besides Australia and Canada (staunch British Allies/Colonies), all other countries were the benefactor of aggression by German and had no &quot;choice&quot;.  The US had a &quot;choice&quot;.<br>

Only those that died have something to complain about.  Those that are alive today, Germany isn't occupying them today are they?  Them being thankful for the sacrifices and work done by ALL of the liberating armies, shouldn't be much to ask.<br>
<br>
As for the French and the revolutionary war.<br>
<br>
1. The french government that aided the US during the Revolutionary War is NOT the government that sits in power of France today.<br>
<br>
2. It was in the 2nd year of the war that France lent aid to the revolutionaries in the form of money and ammunition.<br>
<br>
3. Three years into the war, France officially recognizes the US as a country, signs an Alliance Treaty.  France enters the war. (It could be said that the American Revolution was the First World War, as France and Britian pretty much were the world.)<br>
<br>
4. The bond between France and the US has always been strong.  It started to take a southward spiral in the Mid-80s, when France began to no longer support the US in world events.  Look at the current situation in the UN.<br>
<br>

I can start rabidly cockblocking you like I've done before in this thread and demonstrate to you how it would have been possible for USSR to win World War II without Lend-lease, Strategic Allied Bombing and Operation Overlord.<br>
<br>
But instead I'll just say this, it is pointless conjecture on your part and for every example or scenario that you can provide where victory in Europe would have been impossible without US, I can provide 10 that will say otherwise.<br>

The indisputable facts remain that USSR fought the vast majority of the German forces and defeated them while US wouldnt even open up a second front and fight the Germans themselves until the Soviets already broke the back of the German Army.<br>

One thing you should learn is that Europeans dont particularly enjoy grouping USSR with UK/USA as Allies.  Not because of ideological positions or such, but because the amount of effort and sacrifice expended by USSR as compared to UK/USA is vastly bigger.  To put it bluntly, you dont deserve to be put in the same category as USSR and to take credit for winning a war in which it is even questionable as to whether American involvement even had any impact on the outcome - is insulting, especially when you throw it back into the faces of Europeans.  The was started by Europeans and it was finished by Europeans.<br>

It isn't MY conjecture.  The information I gave came from EXPERTS on WWII.<br>
<br>
Lend Lease started in 1941 as a trickle.  It went into full swing shortly after the Soviet offensive in 1942, that freed up a route from the Middle East into Russia.  During 1941-1942 a portion of the supplies that Russia received were RADIOS.  These radios were KEY to the success of the 1942 offensive.  Without them, the offensive would not have been as large, nor would it have been coordinated.<br>

Do some reading.<br>
<br>
- The Russian military wasn't caught &quot;totally&quot; unaware for one.<br>
- Because of military &amp; political blunders, they were unprepared for the invasion.<br>
- Stalin repeatedly ignored information detailing when, how and who was invading.  Even when presented with the exact DAY of the invasion, Stalin's paranoia and misplaced trust of Hitler lead him to ignore the warnings.  (he thought that it was British disinformation, trying to get Russia and Germany at war) Stalin was so delusioned that he had flights of fancy of a Russian/Germany alliance to rule the world.  LOL<br>
- Yeah that grinding halt happened what? 300 miles from the original front.  They were gaining so much ground that they had to repeatedly stop and wait for their supplies to catch up to the new frontlines.  LOL<br>
- Thank Hitler himself for wanting to starve Leningrad to death, rather than invade and take it out.<br>
- That push in 1941 was the last real load the Russian military had left.  WOOT!! They gained a whole, what 100 miles?  Yay them!  Oh and all those villages that they retook and began killing their own people for &quot;helping&quot; the enemy.  Trumpt up charges and all.<br>

Russia had 92 Locomotives, the US supplied 1900. (The earlier shipments of these locomotives helped supply the Russian offensive in 1942, IE Stalingrad.)<br>
<br>
Russia produced 1,087 railway cars, 11,075 were produced via the Lend-Lease program.<br>
<br>
56 percent of the rails used to rebuild the Russian supply system came from the Lend-Lease program. One railway was specifically built to ship supplies for the 1942 Russian Offensive.<br>
<br>
Radios - Prior to 1941, the Russian military had few radios, and they weren't incorporated into their tactics like the Germans had (every German tank had a radio). With the losses in 1941 the availablility of radios decreased even further. The German military also triangulated Russian radio traffic, and attacked such command posts that used their radios, contributing to the losses of radios. (The earliest shipments of radios were used in the 1942 Russian Offensive, which was the largest they'd ever were able to mount, and was very successful. Lend Lease radios helped make that happen.)<br>
<br>
Trucks - In 1942, at the start of the 1st largely successful Russian offensive, only 5% of the military vehicles were foreign, but still aided in allowing the Russian military to maneuver quickly during the 1942 offensive.<br>
<br>
Food - In 1941, Leningrad was seeing the first supplies of food from the Lend-Lease program. The supply from the states during this period was only a trickle though, but if you knew the conditions within the seiged city, you'd know that every scrap of food helped. By 1942, during the Russian offensive, the troop's food rations were able to be increased. Around half of the shipped weight of goods to Russia was food. SPAM, the condensed meat product, was universally refered as &quot;second fronts&quot;.<br>
<br>
Aviation Fuel - 58 percent of the aviation fuel used by Russia during the war was shipped via the Lend Lease program. During the 1942 offensive, Russia's Air Force was of a strength that allowed them to fight effectively, with newly built Russian aircraft.<br>
<br>
All of these supplies and others allowed the Russian industry that was rebuilt and retooled by late 1942 to concentrate on the production of military weapons. (Tanks, Rifles, Planes, Ammunition) These additional weapons were first available in 1942 for the Russian offensive, but it wasn't until 1943 and the 2nd Russian offensive when things all came together. With the additional tanks, experience, food, radios, and most importantly Stalin stepping back and allowing his Generals to do their job. Allowed the Russian military deliver a crushing blow to the German army.<br>

From everything I read in this thread, it's exactly what you are doing. I guess that's a good way to argue though, it's what the Democrats in Politics do all the time. Seems to work for them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 604<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/30/02 10:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=218>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> blah <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A> at: 10/30/02 11:04:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/30/02 11:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=219>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> He treats people like Solovey when they present a differing point of veiw....Wow Merton Other people did Study this time period and not all of them took a Pro-Russian stance on it!<br>
<br>
Tell me merton, What percentage of the luftwaffe was engaged against the U.S./RAF during 1942-1945?<br>
<br>
You can say a large percentage of our bombs were droped from 43 onward but what of the air war that was going on before and during that time? Germany was only using 20% of its air power against Russia, But again I guess the war would have been NO diffrent had it been otherwise?<br>
<br>
What of all the non-war industries that were affected by Allied bombs? Textiles? Oil? Munitions(nitrogen)?Rubber?Steel? Transportation?Medical Suplies? Food?<br>
<br>
Even from your own numbers you say that Trucks/Cars/Planes took a 30% dive from where they should have been? So the Russians were fighting a german army that was only 70% as strong as it COULD have been?<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that between 30-35% of Germans troops were tied up in other theaters?<br>
<br>
Also What would have happened in the Japanese had invaded From the south thru the middle east? Would Russia have been able to keep on its great offensive with 2 armies fighting it?<br>
<br>
ALOT would have been diffrent, Russia WOULD have lost the war, In the same token The U.S. would have lost without Russia.<br>
<br>
You really need to calm the fuck down too. Your gonna burst a vein in your damn head...lol Its flattering how you keep bringing my name up. I guess It really gets you that some Ignorant American is actually is able to argue with you on a &quot;russian war&quot;.<br>
<br>
Its ok tho, Keep beliving your not an American while you sit in your American house, Watch your American TV, Play on your American EQ game, And eat your American fast food....<br>

America greatly helped in the successful outcome of WWII AS DID the Russians and anyone else who participated in it.<br>

Take any of those factors out and who knows what the hell the outcome would have been. Speculation on this is ludicrous at best.<br>

America did not win WWII alone. Neither did Russia or anyone else. We won it TOGETHER. <br>

I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity, which is displayed in spades here.  I actually took the time to write those essay sized posts earlier in the thread to dispel the typical Western attitude towards the war in Europe.  Obviously, it was fruitless, much like talking to a brick wall.  Ironically, I probably invested more time and effort writing those posts than I have invested in all the school work put together that I've done this school quarter.  I'm not going to reargue the same points over and over.  Dont have the energy nor time to rehash the same arguments.  I, no longer, can stem this tide of idiocy.<br>

Is it all that surprising that before the 1942 offensive the Russian military was unable to organize in large units acting in concert with each other, being that one of the most modern piece of equipment they lacked were radios?  During 1941 they began with a lack of these radios, and German military further targeted command posts that utilized their radios, which made an already lacking piece of equipment all that much more rare.  The entire time Russia was continually having difficulties communicating with their units in order to mount an orderly defense.  Then in 1942 they were suddenly able to mount the largest offensive operation ever, and in a way that was coordinated enough to sweep through the German lines.  Yeah all those radios the US sent, meant nothing.<br>
