Damn I hate zealots that think they have THE answer to something, simply by combining tiny pieces of diverse, inconcise information and developing a grandose theory.<br>
<br>
You are so wrapped up in your own believes, that any other concept is completely foreign.  How many people are gonna die now because of your bullshit!  How many people are gonna pop an &quot;E&quot; and a &quot;C&quot; and a couple of Tums every morning and feel &quot;protected&quot;.  No need for checkup screenings or physicals because they are Protected!  Dvinastat said so and it sounded so good its Gotta be right.<br>
<br>
If all the deaths from bad doctors were balanced with deaths from Quacks and unproven remedies such as you spout here, I'm thinking quack remedies would settle first.  I see nothing worse than some fool spouting inane drivel as the absolute truth in an attempt to convert otheres to his partially true, but totally whacked beliefs.<br>

D has some very valid facts there and what he says may have some value; maybe even a lot of value.  But now he's digging, aint he?  Now he has to prove himself or his beliefs further to make them valid.  Maybe he'll even cause others to dig and find facts and maybe even find what he professes to have found.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
But when a man answers a simple question for a reference with a triad on the cure for cancer, are you not just a little sceptical.<br>
<br>
..and Loegan, why dont you climb back under that piece of Maine granite you usually hide under and leave us to our own thoughts.  I still cant understand why you needed to come back and grace us with your holier-than-thou all knowing attitude.  Wait!  You must have some better opinion of this debate other than Bakamon, you're making yourself look stupid.  Grace us with some of your usual profound babblings. I'm sure you have an opinion developed on this.  ACK!  You might even agree with me.  God forbid!<br>

Here's another idea: you left us once; how about giving it another shot.

I again said bullshit and called him a zealot!  Is this some guy presenting a paper to the AMA or a collector of trivial information trying to make a point.  Is this some guy trying to get laid by convincing his girl that he cant get her pregnant because he had garlic and chives for dinner, or someone working on their Masters.  I'm saying his point may be valid but is highly lacking in Proven information and I for one find it extremely hard to believe. The one great thing he has going for him is that everyone Wants to believe it.  Therefore anything that is even close to plausable will be believe, and worse, acted upon.<br>

Jeebus HP fucking Christ folks!  This is the Tribunal Flameboard!  Flameboard!, you know the board where kids come to call each other gay just to get a reaction and up their post count. This is Not an organized debate with a moderator.  What rules exist are extremely broad.  My opinion and how I present it is Just as valid as his or any other.  You have something to contribute, then jump in.  Prove him right. Otherwise my point of view is just as valid as his.  I dont mind either way.<br>

(I) Is there anything so bold
   as an honest person?
think on this....
when your body is pierced
and the draining blood
makes your fingers numb
is it easier to be honest
and face that,
or hide away for a few more minutes...? <>

(II) she stroked the white mane
traced the sacred horn
with her fingertips...
she lightly licked the red smears
from her fingers...
it burned like it was supposed to.
she smiled sadly at the glazed eyes...
a touch less beauty in the world <>

(III) He knew it was time
and hence, he knelt...
pain in arms
and pain in head
he bent his mind in circles
as the blood dript
in circles...
and set his life
upon his lips... <>

(IV) it didn't take a lot
he thought
to fill it up...
and dipping finger
baptised one and all
making sure to save
the rest
till he turned them all
away... <>

(V) She slipped further...
into
the lake...
and the wetness
was mostly from her eyes.
what she thought was best
was being afraid
and in that
she turned away
her every wish... <>

Very true....Some of my family is into farming and I have seen thousands of gallons of milk just spilled down hills...I have watched fields that were ready to be planted simply not planted....This is to ensure a reasonable price for farm goods..<br>
<br>
However many plants we consume have no natural defense against swarming insects....The only defense would be to die and sead the ground and rise next year before the insects come back...Unfortanatly for us that would mean we starve..I do not like pesticides....But a plants natural defense does not ensure that humans will eat. <br>
<br>
Pesticides are bad....But out of all the ways to ensure the people get enough food so far its the the most effective. If there was a more natural way that you could grow crops and feed everyone for a price that everyone can afford to eat at...then I would be all for it...But anyone who has been on a farm knows how damaging insects can be.<br>

One scientist said that the first time NASA used plutonium in a power source for a space vehicle (it was either a satellite or a probe meant to go to Jupiter, can't remember which) the thing broke up in the atmosphere, gradually scattering debris and therefore plutonium across the world as the pieces re-entered over the years. It was about 20 years ago, and he said today it is possible (using a geiger counter) to detect atoms of that plutonium everywhere in the world, even inside most people.<br>

For the last time...I said P R E V E N T cancer from ever happening, not 'cure' it once it does.  Didn't I tell you to have your kids explain it to you?  I'm guessing this 'simple' question was what is the cause of cancer...and I think that was explained in detail.  Of course, you had to read what I posted, not stutter across my big pretty words and give up when you don't know the meaning.  By the way, judging from your last 2 posts there's a fevered ranting idiot here alright...you probably don't want to hear who it is though.<br>

Hayzen - according to my physics teacher in high school, the moon never does orbit the earth entirely.  It's orbit is affected by the earth, but it never actually completes a rotation about it.  The moon's orbit is like a serpentine curve, weaving back and forth between the sun and the earth, with the earth passing straight through the middle of it.  Thus the moon appears on different sides of the earth, but never fully rotates about it.  The only body it fully rotates about is the sun.  I'd draw a pic of the orbit cause it's easier to understand once you see it, but I don't have anywhere to host it so maybe someone else could. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1188<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 9:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Loegan - I am not saying Dvin is right, because I am smart enough to know that I don't know. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Anyone came come here and quote obscure and completely unknown professionals and call it maple syrup.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  You know, I'm sorry that you're such an ignoramus that because you've never heard of a person, he's unknown and therefore of no consequence.  Nevermind the guy was intelligent enough to be awarded the highest achievement in science which celebrates 'the greatest advancement of mankind in research annually'.  I got a question for you Bakamoron.  Actually a little story.<br>
<br>
You see, there's a man who's arguably the greatest inventor known to man...except that he's obscure, untaught in schools.  However, every invention of his is still used today, or based off of his work.  Stuff like the vacuum tubes in the monitor you're looking at, the ac current that runs it.  Small time inventions like radar, radio, lasers, helicopters, the fluourescent bulb, x-ray machines.  He paved the way for world-wide wireless communications, fax machines, radio-guided aircraft and missiles.<br>
<br>
Do you know who he is?  Very few do, not edison, not westinghouse, not marconi.  He's pretty obscure, yet he's easily the greatest inventor of all time.  So I guess because he's obscure and not celebrated we shouldn't believe anything he says, and we shouldn't use anything he gave us.  That's it, tell the power company you no longer want their 3-phase alternating current power, cause you've never heard of the man who invented it and are therefore skeptical of its existence.<br>
<br>
There, I told you enough you can look up who that man is, or you could have one of your kids do it cause you've already revealed how inept you are at such things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uholdan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Holdan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 10:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Couple of Problems with your theory, Dvin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> -Free radicals damage DNA matrixes, which the cells then repair. This process is aerobic....it relies on a blood pH of 7.4 or around slightly alkaline. This happens everyday...the DNA then repairs all damage done<br>

<br>
First, let's analyze this.  Before we start, I urge you to do research on Acidosis, as you'll learn a lot about what controls the PH of your blood.  It has very little to do with what you actually eat or drink, and more commonly is the sign of a more complex problem, diabetes, renal failure, etc.  It is almost never used 1) as an indication of Cancer or 2) an indication of a proper diet.  See, basically, your theory takes into account that basically all of what you eat is metabolized into the bloodstream and remains in it's core form while circulating, which is not true.<br>
<br>
Second of all, you theories contradict each other.  You advocate needing a lot of oxygen for your blood so that your body doesn't go into anaerobic respiration, but the problem with this theory is that too much oxygen in your blood without being consumed is acidic in and of itself.  Please also research what antioxidants do, as well as how many of the items you suggested were actually acids.<br>
<br>
Let's go through some other stuff.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> -The top leading causes of death in the U.S. are 1) heart disease 2) cancer 3) doctors<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This is a direct fabrication.  Please provide evidence of this from an unbiased source.<br>
<br>

<br>
Explain to me then why leukemia exists in cases in the red blood cell.  I would imagine that the cells that physically carry the oxygen throughout the body would have a hard time getting cancer if your theory was right.  Oh, and there is another big problem with your theory.  The CDC says there is no proof nor has there ever been.  Oh, and according to Nobel, Otto Warburg NEVER WON A SECOND NOBEL PRIZE.  And his first one was for discovering the physiology of the respiratory enzyme.  Otto Warburg claimed to have all sorts of proof proving his THEORY of the cause of Cancer, but he was never able to get any of his equipment back from Germany.  Therefore, he was unable to ever prove this theory.  It's based on one simple principle - Cancer cells are Anaerobic, and most other cells are Aerobic.  By his thoughts, flooding your system with oxygen will prevent cancer.  Basically, it's like saying since urine is yellow, if you dye a public pool blue kids can't pee in it because the water will be green and not yellow.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> -Acid build up from eating sugars and other highly acidic foods, plus the lack of oxygen, forms an anaerobic blood atmoshphere in which cancer thrives.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Back this up with evidence.  Not something that says that cancer is acidic, but rather one that says that an anaerobic blood atmosphere causes cancer or enhances it's growth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> -Yes, that said doctors -- iatrogenic health problems kill approximately 225,000 a year, with prescription medicine side-effects bringing in 100,000 of those deaths -- car crashes kill 40,000 a year and schedule II drug overdoses 20,000<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Where did you get these figures from?  I guarantee you they are incorrect.  In fact, I'll counter with correct ones, I am using the CDC's report from 1999 for causes of death, as they haven't complied the 2000, 2001, or 2002 reports yet.  Here are the figures listed -<br>
<br>
2,391,399 deaths in the US in 1999.<br>
<br>
Heart disease accounted for 725,192 of these deaths, or 30.3 percent of total deaths.<br>
<br>
Cancer 549,838 deaths.  Or 23.3 percent.<br>
<br>
Stroke - 167,366.  Or 7.0 percent.<br>
<br>
Accidents killed over 96000.<br>
<br>
Your figures are complete fabrications.  To say that iatrogenic problems were the cause of death of 225000 is not only ignorant but completely false.  Please back this up with some iota of evidence.<br>

So you quote the WHO?  Decent source.  Are you considering this to be a valid source of information?  Oh wait, jump to their main page and read the part on cancer.  It pretty clearly says the SMOKING is the number one preventable cause of cancer.  In fact, reading their documents regarding what they advise you to do to prevent cancer, they list breast feeding, wearing sunscreen, and not smoking.  But not a single time do they advocate any of the ideas you have listed here.<br>
<br>
So now are you saying that the WHO lies like everyone else that says that more oxygen isn't the cure for cancer?  Can we even value their opinion if they'd lie against their master cure?  Please enlighten me.<br>
<br>

Reputable studies for this please.  Please reference with a medical journal reference number or other paper research I can read from a valuable source.<br>

The problem with Otto Warburg is that he never had a single shred of evidence to back up his theories.  It was all based on conjecture and theory, and not a single bit of proof.  Provide me with references of one study that proved him correct.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Intrigued -- alkaline foods, cardiovascular exercise. He needs oxygen and to bring his pH down.

Yes, I know this is hard to believe, but once again doctors cause their patients to get ill. Trying to use surgery to cut it out results in it metastasizing to other parts of the body (sharon osbourne) and making it a threat. And so much more profitable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are a fucking idiot.  Basically, what you are saying is that everyone has prostate cancer (or will get it) and it's perfectly fine unless it's operated on.<br>
<br>
Right.  So for these 98 percent of men that have prostate cancer, (which according to you is neither painful or harmful) <br>
<br>
Show some evidence for figures.  I've backed mine up with the research and I'm calling your cards on the table.<br>
<br>
What's really sad is the theory that someone might read what you are saying and think that A)  You have a clue what you are talking about or B)  Anything you've said is actually true or fact.<br>
<br>
And my last question for you -<br>
<br>
If oxygen is what prevents all cancer...<br>
<br>
Why is the leading cause of cancer related death in males LUNG CANCER?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Oxygen is not such a nice element as most any chemist can tell you. Without it we couldn't make energy to keep our bodies alive, that is true. But higher then 20 something percent and &quot;bad shit&quot; starts to happen. Submarine sailors make their own atmosphere and there is a high limit to oxygen % allowed. I seem to remember it was for biological reasons, not just increased metal corrosion.<br>
<br>
Also, divers everywhere are aware of oxygen toxicity that is swift and fatal, caused when total saturated oxygen levels in your tissues are too high for the body to expell.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes and no.  The air around us (at least at my location from sea level) is approximately 26 percent oxygen.  What you are talking about is how the shit starts to happen when blood is unable to exchange oxygen on a cellular level as quick as it is replacing it.  Basically, you are talking about Acidosis.<br>
<br>
In the medical field, we have a saying, and it's pretty accurate in this situation.  Blood flows in a circle, Oxygen flows in and out.  Any variation on that is bad.  Oxygen flowing in a circle throughout the blood stream can lead to acidosis of the blood and cells leading to the eventual amputation of limbs.  This is quite common in patients on prolonged use of oxygen assistance devices, or home 02.  Increased oxygen levels (that is, levels beyond what your body can handle) will definately lead to health problems.<br>
<br>
Please stop saying that Otto Warburg received 2 Nobel Prizes.  If you want to keep doing it, list the years.  Because according to Nobel, he received only one for a study not related to cancer.<br>
<br>
Oh and since we want to use Nobel prizes as a reason to think someone's study was valid -  Why don't we use DDT as a pesticide again?  I mean it only killed a bunch of people, but it was designed by Paul Hermann Müller who won a Nobel prize for making it!  I mean if he won a Prize, it HAS to be right!<br>
