The blackness was like congealed night as he pushed his hands through it, forcing his way higher and higher.  Pain.<br><br>Closer to light he came, fighting, until finally he broke the last layer.  His eyes opened a tiny bit to a glare of light far too powerful to bear.  Should he open them further he would surely be blinded.   His fingers twitched but the rest of his body refused to function.  He tried lifting his head to no avail, finally relaxing back, face covered in sweat, to think.<br><br>Events swam in circles about his consciousness round and round, impossible to grasp, impossible to sort out.  How old was he?  Where was he?  He tried opening his eyes more and the light was anguish.  His vision was blurred beyond recognizing his surroundings.  Relaxing his eyes he lay still.  He still flexed his fingers and now his hand was capable of movement.<br><br>His mouth was dry like sand and his lips cracked and crusted with blood.  His throat refused to make a sound beyond his dry breathing.  He tried to work up some saliva in his mouth to wet his parched lips, but it was slow going.<br><br>&quot;I'm amazed you're even alive,&quot; a voice said from somewhere.  He tried to respond but nothing was working.<br><br>&quot;Poor Bowynn… You just walked right into this&quot; she said softly.  He felt a damp rag touch his lips and the pain was searing, but relieving at the same time.  Again he tried to respond and the most he could manage was lifting the left side of his body a bit with his elbow and shoulder.  At the moment he tried, an explosion from his back tore through him with a weak shudder as he slumped, unconscious. <p><CENTER>Bowyn - 24th level Hero of Renegades<BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bhibernia81741 target=_blank>Realm of Hibernia, Bedevere Server</a><BR><HR=25%><BR><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4051 target=_blank>Bowynn Bel'Aurora - 58th level Enchanter</A><BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg target=_blank>Tribunal Server</A></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 1583<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/15/01 12:56:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Betrayal, Part 2</span><hr size=1> &quot;I love you,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; he returned with a smile.<br><br>&quot;Come closer to me,&quot; she said petulantly, &quot;…that's better.&quot;  He leaned in to kiss her lips and the world erupted in white-hot pain.<br><br>His breath scraped out of his throat, too dry to give it voice.  His limbs writhed in agony, fingers and toes curled tightly in an involuntary grasp.  He was certain there was a fire searing him through his right side from the back.  He tried to scream.<br><br>A hand pushed down on his forehead, a cool hand that felt good against the heat of his skin.  He moaned slightly at even this tiny respite from the pain.  <br><br>&quot;Why isn’t he dead?!&quot; a male voice spoke, close to his ear.  <br><br>&quot;The poison didn't finish him.  What can I do?&quot; a female voice spoke, somewhat familiar, somewhat nonchalant.<br><br>&quot;Karana!  This is not the sort of work I enjoy!&quot; he shouted.<br><br>&quot;Quiet,&quot; she said, &quot;he'll be done soon, then we just clean up.&quot;<br><br>Wetness touched his hand and pooled through his fingers.  He tried to lift his hand to see what it was but it was beyond his strength.  As a matter of fact, keeping his eyes open was beyond his strength… breathing… seemed beyond his strength.  He faded into the blackness once more.<br><br>&quot;I love you,&quot; a female voice said.  It was different from before… huskier… powerful.  He tried to move, to respond, to do anything.  He just hoped she spoke again.  Her voice eased the pain and soothed the burn.<br><br>&quot;Your heart's blood flows from you…&quot; she said thoughtfully.<br><br>&quot;Please…&quot; he managed to utter, nearly without sound.<br><br>&quot;Do you know me?&quot; She asked.  He shook his head in response<br><br>&quot;Well, I know you.  Your heart pounds so fiercely yet so rebelliously.  You would blind yourself to your creator while showing traits that make her beam with pride.  You are an extremely contrary man.  Maybe it is this conflict... this never-ending clash within you which drives you.  But… it is dangerous in the extreme.  You play a game which borders on destruction.  Would you so readily risk your existence?<br><br>&quot;Are you..?&quot; he asked numbly.<br><br>At this the voice laughed like bells.  He almost smiled at the pure beauty of it.  She laughed from a deep place in her where there was joy and happiness.  She laughed with pure mirth.  His heart swelled at the sound of it.  <br><br>&quot;My dear sweet man… I am not Tunare.  It's a good thing too as I find you irresistibly attractive and the old elf has reservations about touching her children in certain ways,&quot; she said seductively as she drew the end of her finger along the side of his neck.  His eyes snapped open.<br><br>She was a thing of absolute beauty.  A human lying on her side next to him.  Auburn shoulder length hair, green mischievous eyes, alabaster skin, all robed in crushed red velvet which moved along the curve of her hip in a very enticing manner.  Her eyes studied his, her lips on the verge of a smile, but holding at a curious set.  He again focused on her eyes.  They swirled with an unnatural light and drew back for what seemed like miles.  No.  No human ever possessed such eyes.<br><br>&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked.<br> <p><CENTER>Bowyn - 24th level Hero of Renegades<BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bhibernia81741 target=_blank>Realm of Hibernia, Bedevere Server</a><BR><HR=25%><BR><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4051 target=_blank>Bowynn Bel'Aurora - 58th level Enchanter</A><BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg target=_blank>Tribunal Server</A></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 1670<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/01 12:56:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Betrayal, Part 3</span><hr size=1> &quot;What does it really matter?&quot; she replied.<br><br>&quot;I guess it doesn't,&quot; he said thoughtfully.<br><br>&quot;Oh, of course it does!&quot; she said playfully, poking him in the arm with her finger.  <br><br>&quot;Owww!&quot; he exclaimed drawing back from her, &quot;that hurt.&quot;  Throwing her head back, she laughed that deep down laugh again and he found himself smiling along helplessly.  She was tall for a human and though she was slender, there was a bone deep strength apparent there.  This was a woman who could be soft or hard depending on the situation.  <br><br>He surveyed the surroundings as his senses came more alert.  They lay in a round room with sumptuous padded walls, plush with purple velvet.  The entire floor was soft deep carpeting strewn with pillows of all shapes and colors from the square kind popular in Qeynos to the rounder style more common in Felwithe, from the earth tones of Paineel to the gaudiness of Freeport.  <br><br>She was sitting back from him back from him, smiling seductively.  He sat up, keeping his eyes on her green eyes.  She seemed almost coiled like a snake ready to strike... or maybe a leopard.  She inched slowly towards him on her hands and knees, causing him to move away from her a bit.  This only seemed to spur her on as she let a small laugh and moved to her hands and the balls of her feet.  He moved back a bit more slipping on a cushion and going flat on his back when she sprung.  <br><br>She landed on top of him, pinning his wrists to the ground eliciting a soft &quot;ummf&quot; from him.  She was a sturdy woman, as evidenced by her thigh muscles pressing against him.  She bent low close to his face.  Her breath was a mix of cinnamon and cloves warm on his chin.  She moved her face close to his and began coursing over the skin of his neck bathing him in her scent.  She moved back to his lips and struck, catching his lower lip between her teeth, biting softly.  He explored the sensation for a moment before pulling back and pushing up on her slightly.<br><br>&quot;I ask again... who are you?&quot; he said in a quiet demanding voice.<br><br>&quot;Is it so important that you know my name?&quot; she replied, seeming a bit disappointed.<br><br>&quot;It is,&quot; he replied.<br><br>&quot;Well, if it's really that important to you,&quot; she said moving to the side of him and sitting up on her knees, feet behind her, hands in her lap.<br><br>&quot;You have been to the city of Freeport.  You know of the temples there,&quot; she started.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I'm familiar,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;You have performed many services for the church of the twins, if I recall, you are well thought of by the people in the northern district.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You could say that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let's just say I appreciate your hard work and I've seen your face when you stood before me, longing and unsure.  I doubt anyone else has ever seen that face of yours.  It moved my heart when you shared it with me, knowing that it was a secret shared only by the two of us.  That is rare, even amongst the gods-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Woman, what on earth are you talking about,&quot; he interrupted backing away from her, eyes locked steadily on hers, hand arched in a perfect arcane trinsimbal and ready to cast.<br><br>&quot;Don't you recognize me?&quot; she said sitting back.<br><br>&quot;No I don't-&quot;<br><br>&quot;How about now,&quot; she said, standing.  It seemed a breeze came through the room and disturbed her hair slightly.<br><br>&quot;I'm telling you-&quot; he started as he began shuffling backwards.<br><br>&quot;You know me,&quot; she said, her skin turning to a grey marbled hue and her form freezing into place.  Before him stood a statue he had most definitely seen before.  It had been an odd source of comfort for him at times when he had lived in the Temple District of Freeport as an outlaw to the rest of the city.  He sat, hands supporting him behind him, clothes in disarray, completely speechless.  He sat staring at the statue before him.  It was quiet and still, and just as he remembered it.<br><br>&quot;Erolissi…&quot; he whispered, eyes wide and locked on her face.  First one green eye opened then the other.  The mouth curved into a playful smile. <p><CENTER>Bowyn - 24th level Hero of Renegades<BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bhibernia81741 target=_blank>Realm of Hibernia, Bedevere Server</a><BR><HR=25%><BR><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4051 target=_blank>Bowynn Bel'Aurora - 58th level Enchanter</A><BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg target=_blank>Tribunal Server</A></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A> at: 11/23/01 10:54:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 1681<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/23/01 11:43:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Betrayal, Part 4</span><hr size=1> &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; he asked her, still tensed like a rabbit ready to run.<br><br>&quot;You are dying,&quot; she replied sadly, her skin and color returning to normal as her features drooped sadly.  She touched his cheek, a look a sorrow on her face as he flinched away.<br><br>&quot;As I suspected.  What does this have to do with you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am involved in all matters where the heart is involved,&quot; she replied moving to his side to lay next to him, placing her hand on his arm.<br><br>&quot;And what does this have to do with that?&quot; he asked eyeing her hand suspiciously.<br><br>&quot;What's the last thing you remember?&quot; <br><br>&quot;My new house in Rivervale,&quot; he said, eyes closed in an effort to remember, &quot;I was somewhat of an outsider among my own people, you understand.  Nothing obvious, just a lack of connection with them and their way of life.  I always felt welcome among the halflings.  I was settling back for the evening, pondering my decision…&quot;<br><br>&quot;What decision?&quot; she said entwining her fingers in his.<br><br>&quot;I used to be a bold traveler,&quot; he said, removing his hand from hers.  &quot;I've been from one end of this world to the other, seen things too beautiful to describe and things so horrible I wish I could eradicate it from my memory.  My life's blood was exploration and discovery.  I decided to give that all up.  I'm not as young as I used to be and I have much to research.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Adventure is in your blood… it's not so easy to change to a life of comfort and ease,&quot; she said, again taking his hand in hers.<br><br>&quot;It was a welcome respite, none the less.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What else do you recall?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing much, really.  I had a warm glass of spiced wine and had begun to read my book.  Everything after that is a blur, and a painful one at that,&quot; he said squeezing her hand slightly.<br><br>&quot;You were betrayed and stabbed… by someone you care for,&quot; she said with disgust.  He sat back and pondered the other bits of reality which floated around recently.  Pain.  The voices.  Was that reality?<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, what?&quot; he asked, startled by her terse response to his thoughts.<br><br>&quot;That is the reality you are dying in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is there nothing I can do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course there is,&quot; she said eyeing him seriously with those swirling green eyes.<br><br>&quot;Care to share?&quot; he asked nervously.<br><br>&quot;You could stay here with me.  Whatever the head elf says, I think I have more claim to you than she does.&quot; She said, toying with his shirt.<br><br>&quot;And what's my alternative?&quot; he said pushing her hand away without much real force.<br><br>&quot;They call me the goddess of love.  I am more than that.  You people think that it is so simple.  I am a goddess of jealousy, broken hearts, madness, and last... but hardly least, I am a goddess of Revenge.  You see, this is love.  The good parts, the bad parts, and I get to embrace all of it's aspects.  I am the girl that becomes speechless in front of the handsome courtier.  I am the man that cuts down his unfaithful wife.  I am the water that echoes in the ears of lovers at play as I am the fire that rages in the hearts of the betrayed as I am the cold loneliness of the heart that knows no companion.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you enjoy it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.  The madness and misery, longing and rejection, hurt and revenge, is pain to me…&quot; she said, looking down, a pause in her voice, &quot;but even so, there is also Justice.&quot;  At this, she looked him in the eyes, the green swirling brighter and faster.  &quot;As the twin sister of Mithaniel, I am no stranger to it's concept.  I offer you, as an option, Justice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How so?&quot; he asked leaning closer in interest.<br><br>&quot;I can offer you justified revenge on those who did this to you,&quot; she said inches away from his face.  She seemed to be waiting for something, a tension filled the air.<br><br>&quot;And what is the price?&quot; he asked, a cynical smile curling his lips.  She smiled in return, reaching out and grabbing a fist full of his tunic and pulling him close.<br><br>&quot;The price is that you will be mine, and no other's.  The day of your death you will come back to me.  Until then you shall know no other love except battle and adventure.  I make this offer to you.  The choice is yours.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I guess my retirement is over,&quot; he said wistfully.<br><br>&quot;It wouldn’t have lasted a month,&quot; she said smiling, releasing her grip on his tunic.  She laid back seductively among the pillows.<br><br>&quot;Say what you will, I was looking forward to it,&quot; he sighed.<br><br>&quot;Then you have made your decision?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have,&quot; he said, hand resting on the ankle next to his leg.<br><br>&quot;Then we seal it,&quot; she said solemnly.<br><br>&quot;And how is that done?&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you think?&quot; she said pulling open the front of her dress.<br> <p><CENTER>Bowyn - 24th level Hero of Renegades<BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bhibernia81741 target=_blank>Realm of Hibernia, Bedevere Server</a><BR><HR=25%><BR><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4051 target=_blank>Bowynn Bel'Aurora - 58th level Enchanter</A><BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg target=_blank>Tribunal Server</A></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 1749<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/26/01 5:56:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Betrayal, Part 5</span><hr size=1> Bowynn awoke to cold stone beneath him.  Sight and sound came slowly to him.  The burning sensation was mercifully gone from his side though his limbs were stiff with the inactivity of a long sleep.<br><br>As he tried to sit up, a hand gently braced him behind his neck, steadying him.  He turned his head to the side to see who helped him.  A smile crossed his face as he recognized the man standing there.  Camthan.<br><br>&quot;Hello, old friend,&quot; Bowynn croaked through his dry throat.  Camthan smiled and then concern painted his face.<br><br>&quot;Bowynn… I don’t pretend to know what has happened…&quot;<br><br>&quot;How long have I been... away?&quot; he asked looking around.  He was dressed in a robe of yellow silk, lying within the Temple of the Twins.  Marble columns and purple draping marked this as a sacrosanct area of the temple.<br><br>&quot;Almost a year-&quot;<br><br>&quot;What!?&quot; Bowynn exclaimed, breaking into a small fit of coughing.<br><br>&quot;Almost a year since you disappeared.  No one knew what happened... what did happen?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don’t remember.  All I remember is the dreams of…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Erolissi…&quot; Camthan finished for him.<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Bowynn said suspiciously, looking at Camthan.<br><br>&quot;Don’t ask me.  I'm her priest but in this I have no knowledge.  She brought you here whole and that's all I know,&quot; he said lifting his hands in front of him.  He had a small stylized rose imprinted on the palm of his left hand.  Bowynn looked at his own palms.  There was a similar rose, but on his right hand.<br><br>&quot;What is this about?&quot; he asked sharply at Camthan.<br><br>&quot;It means you belong to her,&quot; he said lifting his own hand, &quot;mine is the left because I serve her as I choose to.  Yours is the right because you are somehow tied to her beyond your ability to deny...  What have you done?&quot; he asked, part in awe, part in horror.<br><br>&quot;I made a pact,&quot; he said almost inaudibly, face gone slack, memory returning in small parts.  He clenched his right hand.<br><br>&quot;There are worse Deities to be bound to, Bowynn,&quot; he said, smirking.  Bowynn didn’t look up or smile. <br><br>After several minutes of sitting silently, lost in thought, he swung his feet around and stood.  Wobbly at first, he steadied himself and got his balance.  He put his hands on Camthan's shoulders.<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said and then began looking around the room.<br><br>&quot;I'm afraid when you `arrived' you had nothing with you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing, no staff, no artifacts, nothing except the robe you wear.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I need those things!&quot; Bowynn yelled on the verge of panic.  He stopped realizing who he was yelling at and his face calmed.  &quot;I'm sorry... I have no right to raise my voice at you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's okay,&quot; Camthan nodded.<br><br>&quot;I'm not fit for travel like this… do you by any chance have some traveling clothes and perhaps a pair of boots?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure.  Get some rest and I'll have them brought in,&quot; Camthan said pointing to a cot at the side of the room.  Feeling admittedly weary, Bowynn lay down and quickly fell to sleep.<br><br>*   *   *   *   *<br><br>Rising in the depth of night and navigating by his enhanced night vision, he got dressed in the garments Camthan had brought him.  He wandered past several duty paladins on his way to an area he recognized, eventually finding the fountain.  He walked up to the statue of Erolissi and knelt.<br><br>&quot;Goddess… I will remember my pact to you as you will remember yours to me.  Guide me,&quot; he whispered emphatically, imploringly.  He touched his rose imprinted hand to her ankle.<br><br>&quot;Bowynn?&quot; a voice whispered.<br><br>&quot;Goddess?&quot; he asked looking up at the statue.<br><br>&quot;Hardly!&quot; the words came from behind him following by laughter.  He turned his head and was momentarily stunned.<br><br>&quot;Alajan…&quot; he said breathlessly as he walked to her.  He stood in front of her for a moment before putting his arms around her in a hug.  &quot;It's good to see you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What are you dong here?  Where have you been!?&quot; she said, hugging him back.  <br><br>&quot;That is a long story,&quot; he said pushing her to arms length to give her a reassuring smile.<br><br>&quot;Good, come with me and tell me on the way,&quot; she said looking him up and down.  &quot;You need supplies… where is your stuff?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have no idea... listen, I may not have long, and I need your help.  I need to find my possessions, it's the only way I can do what needs to be done,&quot; he said looking at her seriously.<br><br>&quot;And what exactly has to be done?&quot; she asked suspiciously.<br><br>&quot;I wish I knew… I have a feeling that I will be shown the path as I come to it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If I didn’t smell an adventure, I'd haul you off to a nut house, you know that?&quot; she admonished him.<br><br>&quot;I know it sounds strange, but I need you to trust me-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Heard that before,&quot; she said winking.<br><br>&quot;Can I count on you?&quot; he asked, smiling.<br><br>&quot;Well, I need to get out of town anyway, if you know what I mean…&quot; she said with a wink placing a few platinum pieces in his hand.<br><br>&quot;Gotcha.  Let me get a few things and we'll get out of here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Meet me in the tunnel near the sewers, it's safer,&quot; she said with a smile and then darted into the shadows.  He smiled after her and looked at the money in his hand.  He walked off towards the merchant district hoping someone would still be there selling supplies.  He had a sense that there was going to be quit a bit of travel involved.<br> <p><CENTER><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4051 target=_blank>Bowynn Bel'Aurora - 58th level Enchanter</A><BR><A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg target=_blank>Tribunal Server</A><BR><IMG SRC=http://www.visveres.com/sigs/sig02.jpg><BR><IMG SRC=http://www.visveres.com/sigs/sig03.jpg><BR><IMG SRC=http://www.visveres.com/sigs/sig24.jpg><BR><IMG SRC=http://www.visveres.com/sigs/sig29.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoctraculapinkerton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Octracula Pinkerton</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 478<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/30/01 4:48:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.game-revolution.com/games/xbox/action/azurik_james.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Betrayal, Part 5</span><hr size=1> Wow.
