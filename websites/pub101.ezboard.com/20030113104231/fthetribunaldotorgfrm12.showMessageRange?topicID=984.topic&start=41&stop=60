Does this stuff ever disappear?<br>
<br>
Basic idea:<br>
<br>
They were selling overclocked and re-marked chips.<br>
<br>
Anyways if you had a pentium system from Comtrade (they used to have massive ads in Computer Shopper) back in 1995 -1996 over 75 MHZ speed... and still have it, and the invoice, pull it outta storage or pull it apart and pluck the chip out.  There will likely be a sticker on the back of the chip.  Remove this carefully.  Write down the numbers on the back of the chip itself (NOT the sticker) and consult intel's website to find the actual speed of the CPU.<br>
<br>
Were you sold an overclocked chip?  If you were, FIND THAT INVOICE and contact Comtrade if they still exist.  A little pressure and a little referencing and you can get a full refund of the purchase price.  Computers were not cheap back then either.  A class action lawsuit was being formed on this but I believe it fizzled out, so this may make them more resiliant to getting your money back.<br>
<br>
Just info if someone found the site and wondered wtf was going on with it.<br>
<br>
Probably was wrong of me to post up that Comtrade was defrauding people back then too, and wrong of me to post the contacts and people at the company to get ahold of to strongarm into providing a refund.  After all, they wished for that to be private information, and someone coulda flown off the handle and went and killed someone working there... and then, with the mentality of some on this board, it woulda been my fault.  ; )<br>
<br>
<br>
Poked around a bit and Comtrade seems to have disappeared and resurfaced under a new name.<br>
<br>
www.vistapc.com<br>
<br>
I'd suggest not purchasing from them.<br>
<br>
Anyways... sorry to sidetrack again  : P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umaxamaji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MaxaMaji</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 430<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 6:24:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> I agree with Dvin.

You read how he was salivating over the possibility of someone breaking into his house, how he was locked and loaded and waiting.  Ask Ladmo, that's not the attitude you need to have around firearms.<br>
<br>
Sooner or later, his impotency will begin to gnaw at him...till he starts lowering his standards for using that gun.  Like...if someone cuts him off in traffic...or more accurately he purposefully cuts someone off (cause he is in florida and I'll be damned if more than 5% of the populace drives over 25mph there), they get out of their car to say something to him, he claims carjacking and shots ring out.<br>
<br>
Better to let him off himself first.  The way he sounds, it's almost as if he did that to his guild to dare them to come do something to him.  The guy probably jacks off with cosmoline every night.  I'll bet dollars to doughnuts the guy's on some kind of SSRI (prozac, luvox, zoloft, paxil etc).  All people on those drugs suffer from akathisia, and usually end up shooting up brokerages and schools.<br>
<br>
You think my mentality of wanting him to off himself first instead of taking out what, 10-15 people around him is scary?  I hear it's nice to vacation in Tallahassee then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarsiana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arsiana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ZESTY!</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 10:21:55 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The United States is by far the most powerful nation in the world.

Darkmask had a relationship with Razzine which included cyber sex and trading of pornographic pictures.<br>

You freaked out on me when I tossed 2 bits of information at you saying I was gonna get banned from this board for posting RL information....<br>
<br>
#1  I referred to you as your real name.  If you don't want people knowing your real name, don't use your first name in your e-mail address... you idiot.<br>
<br>
#2  I made reference that I knew you lived near me.  Well... if you didnt want me to know that, why in the hell would you make mention that you saw me in the evening news?  It was a local event when my apartment building caught on fire, and as such would not have reached beyond a few states.  I picked a highway, referenced it, and there ya go.<br>
<br>
Then you had a little tantrum.  You provided the information in previous posts, dummy.  I've never posted anything about you that you have not said before.  I just made ya *think* I did  : )<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkmask as far as the Darkvenom situation where you say I posted his RL information.  I posted his real life name.  I never posted any information beyond that.  Why did I post his real life name?<br>
<br>
Flash back to the old E/V board.  The members.boardhost.com/~arkdin address I believe.  There was a thread on there, in which an anonymous individual flamed me.  IP tracking matched it up to Marv (Darkvenom) and I posted I knew Marv had made the post.  This was before any ebay talk.  This was before anything like this at all.   Darkvenom then got upset, saying Boggs had made the post from Darkvenom's computer, and since Marv had dealt with me in the past, he decided to post my info, and made a post of fair length telling everyone I was a guy (which I have never hidden the fact, lol) and that my name was Stephen Faulkner, and that I lived at XXXX for XXXX and that I sold him XXX and my ebay name was XXXX.<br>
<br>
Then, and only then, did I refer to him as Marvin Cole, and I referenced the ebay name he used, as well as the ebay name that Dredd / Weltal (same person at the time) and Dail used, which he purchased the Darkvenom character from.  Basically a couple of the same things he posted about me, but nothing at all that anyone could contact him with.  If I told you someone was named Sam Smith and had an ebay name SamsSales or something, you'd have no way of contacting them unless you wanted to go through ebay itself, which would be trackable.  I never posted information on him beyond that, even though I had it.  You make it sound like I did.  You make it sound like I made the first move.  You make it sound like I have made a habit of posting names, addresses and phone numbers.   I've not, except in the case of Jason Leydon, and it was to assist others with getting back the money he stole from them.<br>
<br>
I still see nothing wrong with exposing a person.  Providing their SS #'s and the like is unnecessary, but name, address, phone number?  This shit is everywhere, and easily accessible, and the #1 thing that will keep an anonymous internet idiot who thinks he's invincible because of his anonymity, from being as such.  I still think anonynimity and the consequenceless nature of it, is a dangerous thing.  An individual who faces no consequences is guided only by their own morals and beliefs.  Sure, a majority of the people out there have enough self control to keep themselves in check, and have decent enough morals to not present a problem, but there are ample amounts who *need* consequences to keep them in check.  I honestly believe the internet would be a much better place if anyone and everyone was required to link it up with real life and everyone had access to everyone else's name and address.  But then again I have nothing to hide, and I'm one of the ones who just doesn't care who knows my name is Steve or that I live in New Hampshire : P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 766<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 7:07:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> Yeah I remember something about that... is there a link to it or has it washed off the board? : P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usculduggery6.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SculDuggery6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 7:37:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hm</span><hr size=1> Furor's phone number was once posted on a public board.<br>

<br>
You feel your name, address and telephone # are not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> information, as they can be obtained through the sifting through of certain public records? People who have their phone #'s unlisted are in fact NOT disclosing their <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> information with the list buyers/sellers. YOU are wrong.<br>
<br>
Answer me this:  Do you also condone those persons who would take gaining your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> information to a higher level? Say, having you followed to see where you work?  What time you leave? How long it takes you to get home?  How about sifting through your garbage? Hey, YOU threw it out? It's fair game now!  What if they also decided to see what grocer you used? Innocent enough right? They could, now armed and weilding your daily schedule, meet up there casually, to determine what brand of toothpaste you use, since that is also not personal information.  But hey, by YOUR line of logic, I am sure you do not believe in anti-stalking laws either.  Because YOU have the right to know, since there is no such thing as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> information! Heaven forbid the pretty girl who slighted YOU back at some college bar and withheld her <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> home phone #, damn her doesn't she know the records are public? <br>
<br>
Where do you draw the line exactly?<br>
<br>
This reminds me of that post a while back about the firm or whatnot (may have been bogus) who would go stalk the girl of your dreams for a hefty price.  They also saw NOTHING wrong with going through a persons <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> information.  Personally, if I found that some freak was hiring someone to do that, I would make sure he ended up in cement boots in the east river. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatancoindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/3/02 4:07:54 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.muppets.com/profiles/graphics/StatlerWaldorf_s.jpg width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> I am girl boggled now.<br>

The Police Officer was probably asking for your SSN in order to start a form for the paramedics - we use your SSN because you are very simply requesting credit from the Ambulance Company in order to cover your medical costs.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we can't refuse to transport you.  But we usually ask for it because it's essential to have it to bill your insurance company or Medicare.<br>

You were condoning the attacks saying how it should of been expected because of the way we side with Israsel and how you and your father were the butts of racists remarks such as sand nigger, which I never said, nor condoned. I flew off the handle because you wanted to justify the 9/11 attack, it happened on a private guild board, you want to discuss it publically, fine. Listen I tried to work things out between us and see where you were coming from saying that America deserved this ( the attack ) because of their uneven treatment of palenstine people in the gaza strip and so on. I just didnt get it, but I knew I got highly emotional and slammed you pretty well for saying such a stupid thing, and trying to justify the attack which you tried to do. 9/11 hit us all pretty hard and not a day after you were coming out saying how our forgein policy made this possible and how it was coming. I just felt it wasnt right for you to try to justify this attack a day, a week after the attack. <br>

Darkmask had a relationship with Razzine which included cyber sex and trading of pornographic pictures.<br>

Darkmask then found out that Razzine was using him, but he still loved her.<br>

<br>
Hi, my name is Dumai, I need to harp on this because it is all I have in life.<br>
<br>
Way to cross post moron, I answered this in the reality sinks in forum, but apparently in defense of your boyfriend Rynnia you want to use any dirt to make me look bad. Ha, how pathetic. Yes I had a relationship with her, I have made no qualms about that, she sent me pics (which she also sent to other guys on the web ) with letters of love and promises of devotion. I used to know her from 6th grade, so I believed alot of what she had to say, but I didnt fall for it completely, so much so she felt rejected by me, she said she got hurt and then started to go after Bowynn to hurt me, which it didnt, but she attempted to rekindle a relationship to which I watched what was going on and saw she was trying to play us against each other in order to aqquire lodging and money. I didnt bite, Bowynn did along with some other players, one being from SI who gave her cash to move. I revealed to Bowynn what was going on, she then rolled off with his computer.<br>
<br>
Seriously, if you think flaming me about Razzine is gonna get you anywhere, you are stupider then Rynnia looks. I have no problem telling the story or anyone knowing it when confronted by some jackass wanna be know it all who in facts knows very little, that would be you Dumai.<br>
<br>
One could also guess though from your relentless pursuit of this after the many times I have told you what went on, that you had a crush on Razzine, and perhaps are even dating her now, and you wish to rush to her defense because you enjoy her 500lb body and her wheelchair loving. So Dumai are you the one involved with Razzine? or even worse, the girl who couldnt say no to any man, said no to you, how crushing that must be to your ego.<br>
