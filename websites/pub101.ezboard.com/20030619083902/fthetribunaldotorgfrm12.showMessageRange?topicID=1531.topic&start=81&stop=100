That's a pretty ignorant fucking statement.  Some guilds trial guild people to evaluate them, that is their METHOD of discovering what type of person they are.  I'm not even gonna go into how little your opinion of someone matters and how it has absolutely zero to do with the &quot;honor&quot; of a guild.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should create a guild you sorry fuck so that we can throw rocks at it with pussified, ill-informed comments like your own.  Although from the looks of your post, you couldn't get a lemming to follow you off the EK cliff so I guess that idea is out the window.  Do yourself a favor, stop trying to impose your own definitions of &quot;honor&quot; on others.  Because when you try to, you show that you have no fucking idea what the word means.  You are an Ignorant, meddlesome fuck and I hate you.<br>

You little cum sucking ass nugget. I don't give a shit about how you feel about me. Your opinion of me means absolutely nothing. You can try to flame all you wish. Your just a lonely little flameboard postwhore in my eyes. You spend alot of your freetime sitting in front of your pc on this site spewing hatred and loathing towards people you know nothing about. This makes you an expert on people? You seem to find pleasure in this activity. If this wasn't the internet your actions and behaviour would probably land you in a mental ward. You might want to consider seeking some professional help for this hatred. Maybe some prozax or even lithium might solve these feelings of low selfworth. Probably not because you seem to get off torching people for fun. Most of your threads/post are a waste of bandwidth this site could be using for other things. I might make one suggstion, back the fuck up. Take a look around. You'll see no one gives a rats ass who you are or what you think. <br>
<br>
<br>
The whole reason I started this post was a to bitch about a no &quot;honor&quot; fucktard who decided he would train a zone for the fun of it. It wasn't to flame or rant on Legendary. Personaly I have no qualms with Legendary. I don't run in the circles they do, nor have I had any run ins with their people. Other then in the arena the other day with one of their Shammy's and that was for fun. We were all bashing each other. We taught him a lesson in PvP though a 65 Necro &gt; 63 Sham. Nuff said...<br>
<br>
<br>
On another note... This is what I was taught honor meant. If you think my definition in anyway doesn't describe honor, let's see it. You ignorant piece of monkey shit...<br>
<br>
Honor: <br>
That which rightfully attracts esteem, respect, or consideration; self-respect; dignity; courage; fidelity;<br>
especially, excellence of character; high moral worth;<br>
virtue; nobleness; specif., in men, integrity.<br>
<br>
You, you little cum guzzler have NO HONOR nor do you deserve any honor! <br>

It's quite obviously contradictory to tell me how little you care about my opinion yet proceed to waste what was probably 3 hours trying to type a weak ass reply to me.  Secondly, it might interest you to know that I spend absolutely ZERO of my freetime on this board.  Yes, I get paid to flame your ass and I love my job.  Finally, &quot;spewing hatred and loathing towards people&quot; is what this forum is here for.  If you look down on this activity or feel it is a &quot;waste of bandwidth&quot; and that &quot;nobody gives a rat's ass&quot; then what the fuck are you doing here??  BTW - this forum is actually awesome therapy and my therapist recommends it to many people.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your intent, you DID flame legendary.  Weak ass flame that didn't make no sense, but try and backpedal all you want, it was a flame.  Since you've gone to all the trouble of looking up a word that, based on your previous post, you didn't understand.  Perhaps you will continue and explain how your newly-looked-up definition of the word justifies up your comment that TRIAL GUILDING AN APPLICANT THAT YOU DON&quot;T LIKE equates to LEGENDARY HAS NO LEADERSHIP OR HONOR.  Should I quote you again or do you even remember what you said??  YOU are the one who said it, I called you on it, now back it the fuck up or get the fuck out and stfu. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=guukguukk>Guukguukk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/03 8:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> sheesh</span><hr size=1> Wolvar your post made no sense.

Both bags and myself stated that Razeer had no honor and was an asshole, and that IF legendary let him in they would be lowering thier standards and making it APPEAR as if they had no honor.  I personally have met a few pple in legendary and some are nice, some are assholes like razeer.  So plz wolvar, after the bus drops you off from whatever middleschool you attend try to find something more constructive to do than tell pple you dont even know (for god sakes you only read his post) that you hate them.<br>

btw you should read that deffinition of honor, so that you may come to realize you have none.

I never did try to flame Legendary. I am not the one who started it. I'm also not backpeddling. I never once mentioned the name of the person who trained us. Nor the guild he was tagged with. Until it was brought up in another post. Personaly I don't care who is in Legendary. I do think if they are keeping the company they keep. Then yes the guild has no honor. You are only as strong as the weakest link. Legendary seems to have some weak links. Actually as ass nuggets to be presice. Now back off. I had no problem with you Wolvar.. This wasn't your fight.

The tag is a repsentation of the guild and it's beliefs. If the leadrship is going to allow this to go on. Knowing it or not. Then they are no better then the fucktard doing the random acts. Shouldn't try to defend the person. If there is enough proof to banish the bastard then do it, move on, say your sorry for this persons actions and that you didn't know it was going on.<br>
<br>
I've noticed Legendary has a few people on this board who are regularly brought up on charges of disrepect to other players. I feel for the Guild leader and the officers they have in place. I have only seen one in action. Does seem though, the leaders of this guild are constantly on the defencive trying to defend their guild. I would hate to have to look over my shoulder wondering what so and so did.. Might want to look at the people in charge. Can't blame the ranks for the lack of judgment calls by the leadership. <br>

So basically right there you are saying that they had no honor since &quot;I saw the guild tag &lt;Legendary&gt; when I used (/who razeer all)&quot;<br>
<br>
Talk about back peddling.<br>

Yeah most of us don't like stealing or training or scamming...but there are a few out there that think its ok.  Cause, when it gets down to the nitty gritty...this is just a game afterall.  Not all guilds are operated on honor and respect to the extent that you might want them to be.  *shrug*  If they want one of these people in their guild thats their own perogative and should really be none of your business.<br>
<br>
Take it up with the guild themselves.  If they don't care...well...guess you are shit outta luck.  I'm sure they are so god damn hurt that one or two people don't like them.  This is Lego we are talking about here anyhow...half the server hates em already.  Few more aren't gonna hurt.<br>
<br>
And on a side note...wtf is up with people telling others to read what they said?  They probably did you dumbass and thats why they are saying shit back to you.  Not their fault if you are an idiot who can't seem to be able to say what they wanna say the first time. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=226786">Venerable Jaeydee</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->64 Oracle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://kot.jellopit.com">Knights of the Tribunal</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1639<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/19/03 9:18 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: sheesh</span><hr size=1> LOL yer hanging yourself you dumb fuck.

Where were we?  Ohh yeah, OUT OF CONTEXT.  Yet again you show your ignorance, here let me paste the original quote and break it down for you to a 3 year old's level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Just curious.. How many Legendary or ex-Legendary are on the POMS list? I'm not Lego bashing (no reason too cept for Razeer).. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>but if they allow this type of scum to join even if he's a recruit on a trial basis doesn't say to much for it's leadership or honor..</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This was actually a decent job at attempting a subtle jab, but you went overboard with the final statement which is why that is the only one quoted.  HE IS ALREADY A MEMBER OF LEGENDARY ON A TRIAL BASIS.  Therefore, your word IF was not used in the normal context and would have been better served replacing with the word SINCE based on the remainder of the sentence and the facts of the issue.  However it is not grammatically incorrect since the word actually has many interpretations.  You see, it doesn't matter how many times I tell you I am not smashing you in the face while I am smashing you in the face, it doesn't change the fact that your bleeding and my fist is sore.<br>
<br>
APOLOGIZE you fucking twit, you maligned a guild because you don't like something a trial member did.  Grow some sack and TELL THEM YER FUCKING SORRY! <br>
