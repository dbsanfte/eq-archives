<br>
Ok, I've been noticing something as of late that NEEDS to be addressed.  People Aren't posting!!  FoV has been faithful to the boards, but the other guilds on the rotation are failing to even respond to the posts that they are up for a Dragon slaying.  I see alot of requests for dragons, but no one has said a damn thing about whether or not they were successful or it was a Failure.  No one has come on to say &quot;Our Turn is Up, Pls move to next person&quot; even once.  This is something that Prach has asked for repeatedly and all guild leaders have agreed.  Why is it not being done?  We all need to work together to get these dragons dead in the simple fact that if you Cannot take out the dragon, either pass it to the next guild or Get Off The Schedule.<br>
<br>
That brings me to another point i was going to make in a different post, but Time runs short on me, so I'll post it here.  If you plan on taking a dragon, PLEASE have at Least 2/3 of the raid YOUR Guild?  I keep watching various guilds on the rotation going in for a Naggy kill with 7 people or 8 people from thier guild and 20+ from as many as 4 other guilds.  This is not a Guild Raid, this is a PUBLIC Raid.  If you wish a public raid, wait until the dragon is FFA, otherwise, leave the dragon to the Guilds with the organization to it out without 2 or 3 wipes, wasted coffins, wasted Exp, wasted Time and another dragon that Isnt' dying.  These dragons are NOT hard to kill, you just gotta THINK about what you want to do before running in there to get feared and prolly Die.  This &quot;Overwhelm the Dragon with pure numbers&quot; thing doesn't work anymore.  Try something new, use your heads and think about it a bit, how do the big guilds take out the big mobs? What you all are doing is Zerg Tactic Public raids.  Personally, I find it insulting to Prachlyn and all he's doing to keep this schedule organized in the first place and I'm seriously suprised he puts up with these raids taking a spot on the rotation.<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Ok, so I've said what i came here to say, and I hope you all read thru it.  It's not a slam or a flame of anyone, just a plead to please consider your actions and just use a tiny bit of common sense.  If FoV is taking out either dragon with an average of 10 people on a raid, why are you failing with 40?  We aren't uber and we aren't twinked out, we just plan things out and do things right the first time.  <br>
<br>
I wish you all the Best of Luck killing a dragon soon, but the way you are trying now, it will not happen, to many people will lvl past 52 without Ever seeing one of these 2 Die.<br>
<br>
This post has been entirely MY opinions, it does not reflect on my guild in any way shape or form, so if ya wanna slam me for my opinions, but it will get you about as far as arguing religion with a catholic priest.....  I've said what I needed, and I want responses.  If you need advice, I'm around, you know who I am.  If you just wanna cuss me out in tells, welcome to /ignore.  I'll help anyone I can, in any way I can, you just gotta ask me sometime.<br>

Ok, i see your point on the sign up and alliance thing, but when i see a member of a guild doing Nagafen in Nexus asking random people if they would like to join, and I've been sent tells Personally asking if me or my guild would like to help, that is NOT an alliance thing, it is a public raid.  There are alliances involved, such as TI and SL allying for kills, but if there are 5 guilds involved, it's not quite the alliance thing anymore.  I see people in the zone, and in Lavastorm, and in Nexus and PoK being asked simply because they are lvl 45-52 if they would like to join a dragon raid for the &quot;Chance to roll on phat lewtz&quot;.  If it was strictly a few guilds and maybe a couple of guests, that's ok, but this random asking Joe off of the Street thing is getting out of hand.  Next thing you know a guild with 3 people the right lvl is gonna be signing up and asking 35 people they hardly or outright don't know to join in so they can have a shot at killing him.  These public raids fail, and fail, and fail, and do nothign but waste time for the Few guilds that actually take time to prepare and think this stuff thru, and get the kills quick and clean.<br>
<br>
I'm not pointing fingers here, but I will ask that the guilds, in respect to the Few of us that Can and DO take out these dragons, try to keep it to a limited number of guests.  I'm getting tired Personally of being sent tells by X Friend #1 askin me if I want to join a Dragon raid being hosted by X Guild(s), and if I have any friends that want to, invite them to.  It's classic Public raids on Schedule Dragons.  If we want to make them public raidable, and say Screw the schedule, we could do that, but it would be a HUGE pain in the ass of Prachlyn And the guilds trying to Successfully raid him(them).<br>
<br>
I refer to Nagafen throughout my posts because, to date, he is the only one being contested.  FoV has taken Vox every time she has spawned and no other guild has even tried to lay claim to her as of yet.  If anyone feels like taking a shot, we welcome it, but until someone can successfully take out Nagafen, their shot at Vox will pretty much be nothing more than a long CR.<br>
<br>
This is all my opinions, i still wish for more Feedback from Guild leaders, and Prach's opinion of course.  Keep me updated as well guys, I don't want my guild flamed for taking a dragon on our turn when other guilds don't post their Fails/Success's.  I have had to work my way all the way to Nagafen twice now just to find out if he's up, and the trip out is just as bad if not worse.<br>

Vox isn't an issue for us, noone cares about her so we just keep killing her.  Naggy though... seems to be what everyone else in this rotation is after.  Personally I don't see him as any easier than vox...  he hits slightly harder and faster.  Vox just CH's for 7500 three times.  I can though, see why people hate vox.  her AE just obliterates them in that time it takes to plow through the extra 22,500hp.  Get the resists...  and its no biggie.  <br>
What would be a great idea in my opinion, would be some sort of filtration on entering the rotation.  Wasting time is pointless...  letting naggy frolick around his little lair while he awaits his next 30+ ppl meal to be catered to him... is kinda like... ludicrous?  I would think that there could be a bit more to this schedule than wacking guilds on the head with a nitestick so that they wait their turn to be naggy's next picnic.

We never said YOU specifically had to have any certain number of HP or any certain buffs. WE as a guild (FoV) do both of these dragons weekly, and we kill them every time we fight them, no failures, no goin in for a 2nd or 3rd try.  We simply state the proven fact, you get a minimum resist requirement, and you WIN, otherwise, you Fail.  We have taken guests in with us wihtout the resist requirement on them, they get feared, they die, our guild mates don't.  Some reallize what happened and try harder to get better resists, the rest, get mad and say we didn't heal them.  We don't waste time trying to do things an old fashion out dated zerg tactic method.  We use tactics and get it done.  Take what Pyro said as Advice, not an order, if you wish not to take his advice, die like the rest, but do NOT complain to us or anyone else that you cannot kill the dragon and it's &quot;Not Fair&quot; because you refused perfectly good advice. <br>
<br>
Like the old addage says...&quot;you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink&quot;....well, here is your water, here is our advice.  Fathersword took it, and learned From US, he raided with us Multiple times, and LOOK, Conclave Beat Naggy!!!  Father told them what to do, and they did it, with 16 people, not 35 or 40.  Soon, they will be doin what we do, and they will be trading off kills with us.  In the meantime, you all will still be crying because you can't kill a dragon, GROW UP, you don't listen, you don't like our requirements, don't raid with us and don't bitch at us for your stubborn attitudes.  /applaud Father!!!!<br>

Are you really this big of an Ass ingame and in RL?  We are trying to get something done here, and to help.  You come on here just to post flames? WTF?  Go post on the Flameboard and leave our boards alone man, Grow the Fuck Up!!  We are working on getting stuff done to get guilds like SL and CoE and TI Dragon Lvl...and you come on here and pretty much act like a miniature Estevan.  If ya don't have something useful to say, shut the fuck up.  You have done nothing but slam FoV and/or its members since we Started doing the dragons.  If you are just trying to help out your &quot;Buddy&quot; Prachlyn.....well....HELLO????  He is backing US on this topic, I just talked to him ingame Last Night.  He agrees with me on this, and will prolly post sometime soon, meanwhile you are making a total fool out of yourself trying to bash us with this Drivil of a post.  It has NO meaning to it in any way except to TRY and make me look bad.  Way To Go....BRAVO!!  I'm SO ashamed of myself, I was pissed off and made a gramatical Error, OH MY GOD it's the END OF THE WORLD.  Get Over IT!!<br>
<br>
If you have something meaningful to add to this post, i'm still looking for Imput from any of the smaller Guilds, I would LOVE FW's opinion, and SL and TI's collective input.  <br>
<br>
I've still not seen a reply from Prach as well, so I'm still waiting on that one.....<br>
<br>
Anyone else with a PoV other than &quot;You suck cause i said so, look, you mistyped X word here...HAHAHA&quot;  I welcome your imput as well.  Frankly, at the beginning of FoV's run at these dragons, I respected you Naeamian, now, after that post, you just seem more and more like a childish little Ass.<br>

You come here to help, but you are incredibly pompous/obnoxious.<br>
<br>
You catch more flies with honey, my friend. Noone cares WHO you are or WHAT you are trying to do if you are going to be rude about it. You spend so much time tooting your own horn that you don't even consider anyone else involved in the rotation. <br>
<br>
But wait! You have given other guilds advice! I know, I know, because you keep bragging about it. So you are a good guy, you give advice. You are so very humble.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you and your guild have Vox/Naggy down to a science. Kudos! (Seriously, no sarcasm. Good job you guys)But let's give these other guilds a chance to learn - whether or not their entire raid is made up of guildmates or otherwise. <br>
<br>
Some people prefer to try and try again on their own and learn from experience than to leech information from others. <br>

I understand a lot of people like to kill these dragons and they do drop important loot, but there is no reason that they have to be killed every 3 days or whatever.  If a group tries and fails over and over, so what?  It is their 48 or 72 hours to do it how they like.<br>
<br>
If a guild wants/needs to invite other people along on their kill, that is their right.  It shouldn't matter if they are alliances, friends, total strangers.  The way I see it, at this time the only way for me and my guild to get any experience in how to attempt these dragons is to be invited along with someone else.  We aren't quite ready to take these on our own, and some of my members are a bit impatient for their drops.  So if they can go along with another guild, even if we don't know the guild ahead of time, I think that is great.  Besides giving us experience on the dragons it also gives us a chance to interface with other guilds and make more friends in the process.<br>
<br>
Now I know you have said time and again that you guys are willing to take other people with you, and that you are willing to help others learn how you take these dragons out.  That is great, I'm glad you are willing to do this.  Perhaps I can draw upon your expertise when my raid officers think we're ready to be added to the rotation.  And perhaps I'll send you a tell to find out when you're planning to take them down and see if anyone in my guild would be able to go along.  It seems you don't mind getting tells; I don't really like to bother people I don't know without &quot;permission&quot; so to speak (which public postings saying &quot;we need help with naggy&quot; give me, I feel).<br>
<br>
But if you think about it, how did you guys learn your techniques?  Did someone teach you or did you try and fail several times before you got it down?  If someone taught you, who taught them?  Somewhere along the line, there was much death at the feet of these foul beasts before the perfect method was established.  If someone else wishes to take the same road in their learning curve, that is up to them.<br>
<br>

What really started this conversation was the Alliance thing.  If 2 guilds are raiding this dragon repeatedly with each other, and BOTH are posting requests, those 2 guilds make up 1 raid force, and that 1 raid force is getting 2x the tries of any other guild/raid force.  I do not have any problem letting people learn thier own way, and i did not mean to sound pompous or arrogant, I was simply irritated at an individual that had nothing to post other than flames and slams.  If he has posted even ONE intelligent post or idea, something constructive, I would not have responded the way I did.<br>
<br>
We really are tryin to help the other guilds, and I personally hate to see people struggle thru CR after CR in a situation that should never have happened.<br>
<br>
The alliance rule has been in effect on this rotation for longer than I've played, it just kinda got forgotten over time, as the dragons were never killed.  In all fairness, 1 raid force should get the same # of chances as any other raid force, or it would be total favortism.  Why should any single raid force/Group of people get 2 or even 3 times the number of shots to kill a dragon, and sometimes, IF they actually kill him, get the chance to get the NEXT kill, with the same raid force, when there are several other guilds also in line for the same Dragon?  If guilds are allied, that is fine, and if guilds want to raid together, that is fine, but Please, do as Prach has asked in his separate post....if you raid as an Alliance, Post as an Alliance, to give all &quot;Raid Forces&quot; equal chances at the dragon on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
Again, thank you all for your imput, this is Exactly what i was after. Your ideas have helped me refine my own and I hope I have broadened your horizons a bit.....I just want us to all get along, and for us to ALL be able to take out these dragons.<br>

P.S.  On the FYI.....yeah, any group could do that Moonflower, BUT that group would then face the wrath of all the guilds on the rotation again, as FoV did when we first started.  We got off to a bad start, that we all know and all accept, but we've reformed ALOT since then.  We have since then re-established our reputation as one of the more honorable guilds in this rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naeamian>Naeamian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 791<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/28/03 5:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=584.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clarification</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The alliance rule has been in effect on this rotation for longer than I've played, it just kinda got forgotten over time, as the dragons were never killed.

how do you define an alliance tho? lets say im in conclave and we're a bit short on numbers so i invite some thantos to my naggy kill.. thantos returns the favor on their turn and invites some conclave to their turn..  are we in an alliance? no, but it sure as heck looks like we are..   the goal is to allow everyone a chance at taking the dragons down who wants one.. unless you have a full time &quot;police&quot; entity watching over the rotation at all times, things like that are going to happen..  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109755" target="top">Naeamian Sweetlyric</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Again, I ask why you post?  Did you add a Single thought of what might be done? NO, you simply said &quot;Here, you are wrong.&quot;  You cannot add a single Constructive thought to a conversation if your life depended on it.  If you could, I think you might have done it already.  I'm trying here, I'm asking for a solution and all you do is point out more problems?  WHY? What does it gain other than you lookin like an ass for pointing out things WE ALL KNOW ALREADY?  Stop pointing to the problem over and over and over, and start pointing to a Solution.  Everyone else in this thread has Tried to think of Something....ANYTHING...that might help.  A comprimise, or an agreement, but you only re iterrate the problem again and again.  WE GET IT!!! You don't have to tell us another 20 times.<br>
<br>
Please, post something more along the intelllectual lines of an adult, and help us solve the problem of making this schedule fair.  You were one of the people that yelled and screamed when FoV first started, because &quot;Things weren't fair&quot;.  Well, now we are TRYING to make things fair and all you can do is point out the same points all over again.  If you are such a genius, Solve the damn problem!!!<br>
<br>
I still stand firm in my belief that 2 guilds that raid more than 2 times together, and have an agreement amonst each other to Continue to raid as such, should do the honorable thing and post as an Alliance.  It is only fair to those guilds that don't make alliances, for one reason or another.  It is comparable to FoV tryin to lay claim to 3 out of every 4 Nagafens that spawn, no matter who is up or why, because &quot;we are more deserving&quot;.  You would raise hell, yet faced with the SAME situation, I'm staying lvl headed and cool about stuff.  Talk to me, and respect me as an adult, and you might recieve the same....who knows...might try it sometime.<br>
<br>
You know my opinion, anyone else with an opinion, Please post, but Try and make the post worth reading instead of just another mindless and pointless flame.<br>

Those of us looking from the outside do not know whether two guilds have a standing alliance or agreement to help out on the dragons.  As the rules state (and Jerrok has recently reiterated), an official alliance should sign up together and take up one slot in the rotation.  But if it is not an official or standing agreement, and a couple guilds happen to help each other out a few times in a row, there really isn't anything to stop that nor I don't think there should be.  If they continue to do so every time they are up in the rotation, then there could be basis for a complaint against them.<br>
