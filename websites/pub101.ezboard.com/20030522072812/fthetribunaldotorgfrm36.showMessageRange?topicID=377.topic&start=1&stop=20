I think he gave a great speech.  I could feel his conviction through the TV.<br>
<br>
One think I found fun, was when I started paying attention to his eyes.  He'd look left and then right, as if he was addressing the Congress.  Well in accuality he was just switching from reading the right teleprompter to the left teleprompter.  Hehehehe TV magic!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, great speech, but I'm wondering how all that will be paid for while there is a war going on. (since I have no doubt that we are going to war)  But the big thing I wanted from the speech, didn't get delivered.  I wanted some solid proof about the Iraq situation.  Now, I realized just as the speech started that no such evidence would be presented, as the venue isn't really set up to provide a Slide Presentation. =)  So now I'm looking forward to the Feb 5th speech from Powell to the UN. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
On the other hand, you ever notice how during his speeches he leans forward over the podium, placing his forearm on the podium and leaning on his forearm while squinting at the audience?  I bet he is trying to read off the teleprompter - somebody get that man some glasses.<br>
<br>
Finally, I am torn between what was funnier: the constant use of the word &quot;nuculear&quot; or the fact that Republicans were applauding after every sentence.  Now, I was trying to figure this out and I'm just not quite sure if they were applauding after every sentence because they so fervently supported his statements or because they were impressed that he was managing to complete sentences without saying something stupid.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
But on the serious side, I think the speech was good in terms of what he wanted to accomplish - rally support and get that approval rating back up.  On the flip side, I think he might have painted himself into a corner by announcing specific amounts to be allocated to specific programs while the budget deficit is rising.  I would be surprised if all the promised legislation will make it through in the form that he proposed last night.<br>
<br>
I didn't catch his Iraq portion of the speech, I was pontificating upon the greater implications of those hydrogen cars while sitting on the toilet - but the part where he claimed that America was being threatened by Iraqi weapons and that it was American goal to bring democracy to Iraq was comical. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1040<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 7:22:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I heard that his approval rating hit ~80 percent after last night's speech.<br>

<br>
Giving specific numbers for programs (re: Merton) is easy to do in such a speech, as all he needs to do is propose that. It's entirely up to Congress to get it into a bill in the first place, pass the bill to fund it, and if/when they cut it it's not his fault. I think that it's a no-brainer for the head of the Executive branch to do that.<br>
<br>
The notion that we can bring democracy to Iraq leaves me very flat.  I'm not sure that any Arab nation wants democracy. Western colonization of Arab states failed in the past and I think it's doomed to keep failing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeron>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 879<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/03 10:58:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Finally, I am torn between what was funnier: the constant use of the word &quot;nuculear&quot; or the fact that Republicans were applauding after every sentence.

Was this your first State of the Union Address?  It's always this way, and with every president.  And if you were able to recognize people, the democrats were standing up and applauding just as much as the republicans.  On some issues they were up first.  What I REALLY think people should be talking about in this thread is the democratic response from the WA Governer.  All he did was attack and criticise. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

You can fault George all you want, but one thing he's not, and that's a liar.  If George says Sadam cant prove he destroyed xxx tons of anthrax, its a fact.  If George says Sadam cant prove he destroyed xxx liters of nerve agents, its a fact.  If George says he has proof to back all he claims, then the proof is there.<br>

Of course being a Democrat yourself, all this is just some meaningless drival.  Whats so hard about believing a president can be honest and trustworthy.  Wait!!  Bill Clinton.<br>

What I said was it is nothing but claims till something is shown to back it up.  And just how do you know George isn't a liar?  No one thought Nixon was a liar either till Watergate happened.  Johnson lied about the Gulf of Tokin and we all know what kind of mess that led to.  I am going to assume he isn't lying but I am not going to take what he says as gospel either till there is something more to back it up.<br>
<br>
You need to wake up and realize blindly trusting the claims of ANYONE in politics if foolish and naive.  It has nothing to do with what political party is involved.<br>

Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why?

<br>
If the only possible use for such weapons is to dominate, intimidate or attack, surely it is worrying that the USA has (and continues to make) many times more chemical, biological and nuclear weapons than Saddam Hussein.<br>
<br>
The only recent attack on the USA with such weapons was committed with a strain of anthrax developed by the US military itself. Domestic biological weapons also threaten the world -- if anthrax can get out, I wonder if President Bush could truthfully account for all the other lab nasties if asked to do so by the UN. <p>--<br>

<br>
Bush has made the case that these things exist only for intimidation and attack, so it is hypocritical to possess them in larger amounts than the enemy. Even the upcoming attack on Iraq to get at Saddam is supposedly going to be done with conventional weapons.<br>
<br>
Sure, keep enough samples to manufacture vaccines and antidotes, but get rid of the offensive stockpiles and reduce the danger to the world.<br>
