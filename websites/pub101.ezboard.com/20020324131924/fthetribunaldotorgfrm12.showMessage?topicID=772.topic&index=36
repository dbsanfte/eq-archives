Also, the comments about G-Dubya's foriegn policy abilities made me chuckle.  The koreans had some choice words for him.  I don't remember them exactly, but they made me laugh.  Maybe someone who has a good search engine can find it.<br>
<br>
Ah, nevermind...found it.  They called him a &quot;politically backward child&quot;.  I don't know why it makes me laugh.  It just does.<br>

And does this guy actually work?  I think he spends more time in Texas than in the Oval Office.<br>

I hope you all like it.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why people hate Clinton, but I'm equaly astonished at the dumbasses who love him like he's a rock and roll star. I've seen nothing on this thread so far to show how great he was.<br>
<br>
1. Protected the environment<br>
<br>
This is true, but it was more Al Gore campaining than Clintons. He did hamper developement into some areas that are in serious need of developement though. He also stregthened already tough policies in the EPA that make 10 million dollar highways cost 30 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> billion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dollars when they are done. Check the H3 highway in Hawaii for examples of the EPA wasting our tax money. <br>
<br>
2. Balanced the budget (destroyed by Reagan and Bush)<br>
<br>
This takes congress more than the president to balance. The nation was due for this after the cold war and any president would have done the same.<br>
<br>
3. Stopped paying 200 dollars for toilet seats (ala Reagan)<br>
<br>
This is bullshit. Policies were in effect before Clinton that allowed for internal policing of military supliers prices. I was in the military under Bush and I remember this being a huge issue.<br>
<br>
4. Never fought a secret war or made deals with our sworn enemies (reagan and bush)<br>
<br>
Hello, China? Most favored nation status and lots of questionable deals. Satelite technology, nuclear secrets. Like most Clinton lovers, you are confused.<br>
<br>
5. Allowed research into stem cells perhaps allowing a cure for Alzheimers<br>
<br>
This is true, but we are also way behind other counties in this area. A stronger president could have done more.<br>
<br>
6. Passed the American with Disabilities act (fought tooth and nail by republicans)<br>
<br>
And who foots the bill to install a better access ramp onto all these government buildings? And it gave just about everyone in America disabled status. Just have to go to the doctor and get a note that you have carpel tunnel syndrome and you're off to sue your employer. Who foots the bill for all these lawsuits now?<br>
<br>
7. Passed the family leave act (fought tooth and nail by republicans)<br>
<br>
WHo foots the bill for this also? Paid vacation went from a week for maturnity at most places to 7 weeks. Even if you're the husband. What the fuck do you 7 weeks off of work for?<br>
<br>
8. Increased the minimum wage (sigh....fought tooth and nail by republicans)<br>
<br>
And we will all pay for this as the price of big macs go up. Minimum wage is supposed to be just that. The absolute minimum to get by in an area. It should be set by state not federal. As everyone should it costs more to live in California than it does in West Virginia. But the federal government wants to make the US confortable for everyone, even if you have no desire to get skills for a better, higher paying job.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying Clinton is the devil, he didn't do anything too bad. But I also don't understand the blind loyalty people show him. He's just a guy who coasted through 8 years, where nothing too eventful happened, and rode an economic boom caused more by the communications revolution than anything he did. If you want to idolize someone in the 90's idolize Alan Greenspan. At least he did something besides get a hummer in the oral office. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

You can't be serious. Ok, you have forced me to resort to posting hard facts. It sucks, but you leave me no choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually I am gonna cheat and copy. Here is a timeline I had that I copied from somewhere (CNN or MSNBC I think). I edited out all the good stuff and just left in the negatives (excluding political junk) for this post.<br>
<br>

<br>

January 6<br>
Government shutdown ends when both sides agree to a budget deal. <br>

<br>
<br>
--------- 1997 ----------<br>
<br>
March 26<br>
Thirty-nine members of the Heaven's Gate cult, including their leader, are found dead on in a San Diego suburb. Apparently they believed they would leave their bodies and join alien travelers in a space ship behind the Hale-Bopp comet. <br>
<br>
August 31<br>
Britain's Princess Diana is killed in a Paris car accident. <br>
<br>
------------ 1998 ---------<br>
<br>
May<br>
Pakistan becomes nuclear power and along with India carries out underground nuclear tests. <br>
<br>
August 7<br>
Car bombs explode outside the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing hundreds of people. Two weeks later, Washington retaliates as ships launch missile attacks at suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan reportedly run by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden. <br>

<br>

<br>
June 28<br>
After a seven months of wrangling over his welfare, young shipwreck victim Elian Gonzalez returns to Cuba. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This also doesn't include all the Iraqi stuff, cause I am sure there was at least 3 or 4 campaigns during Clintons terms.<br>
<br>
I'll admit, there is no WWII calibar stuff, but with Oaklahoma, the first bombing of WTC, Columbine, the embassy bombings, government shutdown and at least two attacks on the White House... I would hardly call it an uneventful 8 years.<br>
