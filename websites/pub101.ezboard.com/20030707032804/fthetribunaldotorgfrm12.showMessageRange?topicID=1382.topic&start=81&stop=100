<br>
You caught me. I've been following you around everywhere you go. I've always wanted to be like the great Laotzu. Get over yourself.  I read these boards as much as you do, and of course I do not post as much as you I do tend to remember things from time to time. Its part of my nature. So if my memory is your &quot;stalker&quot; then well.. whatever floats your boat.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are you saying you COULD have come up with strats for new mobs, but instead decided not to bother and let the Officers and Broshan do all the work<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is exactly what I'm saying. I have had my share of offering strats to our officers and Broshan. However it comes down to two things. 1- Broshan and the officers have the final say in what happens. I am fully confident in their ability to develop great strats for our guild. You see their skill surpasses mine because they understand this game better than myself. 2- Those ppl have more respect in RNG than me because I don't have as much experience leading an RNG raid. It takes a lot to change your guilds normal raiding style to do things differently. Because sometimes I don't agree  about some strats that RNG has come up with, I will never have the final on how it happens. It doesn't bother me, but yes I could do it if I really wanted to.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Or maybe you meant you're COULD develop a strat for Aerin'Dar and present it to RNG's team, but you just can't be bothered? I guess we'll just have to trust you on that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, I could offer a strat to kill Aerin`Dar. But you see, I play this game for fun. Some ppl find creating strats and watching other ppl execute them to be fun. However, I'm not one of those ppl. So I leave it for the ppl that do. My fun is talking to the friends I've made in game. And being their to support my friends when something exciting happens. So yeah, I guess you would have to trust me in the sense that I could do what you do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This is perfectly logical... however, I guess you obviously know everything about our Guild, our players, and raid leaders. Otherwise, you couldn't make sweeping statements like...<br>
<br>
&quot;I know more strategy then you think. Inside and outside EQ. Plus I have more kills under my belt, so I can confidently say I am more skilled than someone such as yourself. &quot;<br>
<br>
Uh huh, keep telling us about your l33t skillz.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You see, I know what it takes to kill mobs like AL, BB, Cursed, HP. So I take my comment back about skills. I know little of your skill and will not compare my skill to yours. However my knowledge of each encounter makes me more aware of many more mobs to come which prepares me for the future. If that makes me &quot;l33t&quot; then ok.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ah, I see... well, if you're trying to turn this into a RNG vs Legendary flame, good luck. I have nothing but respect for Broshan, the team at RNG, and most of the players there<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't need to compare RNG to Legendary. In fact I wasn't aiming to make it sound that way. So my apologies on that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for trying versus doing, we set targets, we kill those targets. Sometimes it's on the first or second run (like Aerin'Dar), sometimes it takes more. Like Grummus. We've had 2 runs, lost twice. I'm sure you killed Grummus on your first run, but I guess we're just not that Skilled as you are, are we?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Assuming you were being sarcastic. You are right. We didn't kill Grummus on our first run. However we did on our second, but that doesn't matter, because this isn't a Legendary vs RNG thing. <br>
<br>
As for the skill. Killing certain mobs has made us more aware of what to expect. I wont say we are more skilled.. but more knowledgeable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't know what definition you use, but most of the EQ world classifies Tier 1 as VT/Aten Ha Ra capable, and since to my knowledge they have both cleared VT, they would seem to fit the bill.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You're right according to the standards they are, But don't mistake my opinion for a statement. I, personally, consider a Tier 1 guild.. one that sees the content first time and time again.. for example.. FoH, AL, LoS, Triton. You see these guilds have a way of doing things first.. even if some of them have inside info, but that doesn't mean every guild can kill it.  However they do it and ppl sit watching anxiously what will happen next. Of course I wouldn't put it past EV to be able to do what some of those guilds do. They are a strong guild, but they don't command as much respect as those guilds who have as many as 1 million hits a month on their website. But then again that is making an assumption that I don't know for a fact how many hits EV does have. which I do not. So yeah.. my standards are set a little higher than most. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6407" target="top"><br>

EV i would assume is primarily concerned with advancement in PoP at this point.. being the &quot;leading edge&quot; of tribunal's tier 1 assault on the planes, and adding to their already large list of accomplishments and server firsts..

<br>
First of all, EV and Comps stopped &quot;racing&quot; for VT/Emp/Seru a couple of months before PoP came out and set up a nice, convenient rotation on those mobs/zones (one guild got VT, the other got everything in Ssra and Seru (not counting mobs killed by other guilds of course, but it was only really Creator and AL that were being killed by other guilds at that stage), and then the mobs were switched the next week).<br>
<br>
Secondly, EV has indeed left SoL behind - I'm not aware of EV killing a *single* uber mob outside of PoP since it went live (and if they did, it wasn't recorded as a &quot;raid&quot; for attendance bookeeping purposes). I don't think anyone in EV has even zoned into VT once since PoP went live. EV made a deliberate decision to focus 100% on PoP content and I very much doubt you will ever see an EV raid force outside of the Planes ever again, unless the late night crew starts getting itchy again =).<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

I can think of 4-5 real chances we've had at idol, and two of those chances ended when kael went down, despawning idol. So before your guildmates spout off about how we're uncapable of killing AoW, they should think about how many attempts they've had at shit like AL and realize we're in the same boat, just reversed roles. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Jonlee, I am pretty damn near positive you are a dumbfuck. In case you didn't know, Idol doesn't have the same 30min despawn timer AoW has. So no, Transcended has never despawned AoW.

My mistake. Was getting AoW and Idol mixed up.<br>
<br>
As to the Idol not despawning after 30mins. Youre right. I wouldnt know, since it hasnt been up for more than 10 minutes whenever I've been on a Vindi/Statue/Idol/Aow raid.<br>
<br>
But let me get this straight. Youre saying Trans havent actually killed the IDOL yet? And youre whining about AoW?<br>
<br>
I cant believe any guild would be so gay as to whine about another guild taking a mob they havent even ATTEMPTED yet.<br>
