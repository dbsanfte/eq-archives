Yes, I mow my lawn. But just a neat trim.<br>

Waxing isnt required. Nor do I require it.<br>

HEY, don't ever equate Stay-at-home Mother's with &quot;not contributing to society&quot;.  God I hate that.<br>
<br>
It is not the fault of women, it is the fault of the fucked-up lazy ass, limp dicked men that won't work their fucking ass off to make sure that they support their family.  Do I think women SHOULD be able to work? Hell yeah... I know some great women at work that are smart and extremely productive.  But if they are married, and ESPECIALLY if they have children, they should not HAVE to work.  If you really think sending children to this useless piece-of-shit school system (in America) is being productive, you need to do some fucking research.<br>
<br>
Do you think someone is going to HAND you a fucking 6 figure job?  I started working at McDonald's at 22, by the time I was 27 I was making 6 figures.. but I worked fucking 16 -&gt; 20hour days and would do any shitty ass job to make sure I stayed near companies that would assist me in learning more and moving up.  I knew when to move on because my career wasn't moving forward, etc.  These people that I see around me these days are like &quot;Hey, I worked almost 8 1/2 hours yesterday... can I get a bonus?&quot;.  <br>

<br>
Seriously though, my girl doesn't fit into that 1950s article to a tee, but there's a lot of things in there she's cool with.  And vice versa.  I find that when people love and care for each other, they go all out to make the other one happy.  Sometimes its me coming home with the shitty day and I'm rubbing her feet, and sometimes its her.<br>
<br>
Understanding and caring.  Having been involved with enough women to believe I know... I think long term happiness is based more off of mutual respect and love than any other single aspect.<br>
<br>
So here's my take on women for the younger frequenters of the board:<br>
<br>
Overly Intellectual women, well hell.  They &quot;can&quot; be loving and caring, but most of the ones I've been involved with seem to want to debate me to death rather than enjoy a relaxing moment.  I can only take so much &quot;world view&quot; and  &quot;psycho analysis&quot; from my spouse before I want to curl up in a fetal position and hide.  Do date one though just for shits and giggles.<br>
<br>
Psycho women.  There are plenty of these.  And I've dated 3 of them I can think of off the top of my head.  They can be a lot of fun for the first couple months because they seem &quot;interesting&quot; when in fact, they are just freaking insane.  But by that point you're involved, and fuxored.  I also find the stronger a person you seem to others, the more psycho women are attracted to you and willing to get involved with you.  So be aware mohar.<br>
<br>
Overly social women.  I also have a problem with this type, but that's because of my personality type.  I like to go out every once in awhile, but when your woman wants to go out and do stuff a lot more than you do, you're going to be unhappy.  You'll feel like a bump on the rug.  Considering you probably play Everquest, you probably aren't the type to go out every night and do something.<br>
<br>
Overly flirtatious women.  This one is by far the worst in my opinion.  Women who are constantly flirting with someone else besides you.  It will make your soul sick and add a good amount of self doubt to your life until you detach from this type.  I'm not talking about the occasional &quot;wow, he's cute&quot; or what not.  I dated this one chick in college who also fell into the psycho category who would go out to parties and do the &quot;bump and grind&quot; dancing shit with other guys.  And I'm not talking a casual relationship here.  She and I had been practically living together for a year.  Drove me up the fucking wall.  I shouldn't have been shocked when she cheated on me on a cruise.  That bitch had to be nailed down to be tamed.  She'll never be 100% faithful to any guy.  If your ego is cool with this sort of thing, party on.  Believe you me, you will date one at some point.  Also, there's a difference between ridiculous levels of jealousy and reasonable concern.  It's important to note the difference.<br>
<br>
Tons o' baggage women.  They tend to be easy to land, but you'll be really sorry you did in about 2 months when they are already talking marriage.  This is actually the type I recommend avoiding the most.  Things to watch for are in the first 2 days of knowing them they tell you &quot;I was molested as a young child&quot; or &quot;I really got screwed over by a ton of guys in my life.&quot;  These things are fine (I find believe it or not many women have been either raped or molested or had something like that has happened to them) but it needs to be delt with and YOU cannot solve it for them.  And if you do, you'll be unhappy.<br>
<br>
BITCHY women.  Complain all the time about this and that.  Unless you really get a thrill out of trying to be the intrepid problem solver for someone's problems that will never end, you'll be miserable with this type too.  Overly judgemental women fall into this category too.  Being judged all the time will make you a sniveling wretch in good time.<br>
<br>
Non sexed women.  If a woman states they &quot;don't really enjoy sex&quot; or makes no attempt to enjoy it... BAIL NOW!  Even if a woman can't orgasm for some reason, they should still be capable of enjoying sex.<br>
<br>

(My old building actually does not exist anymore - was destroyed on 9-11.)  Since then I have changed careers.  After several years of working 14-24 hours a day, sometimes 7 days a week, no vacation, and many mornings waking up in my suit at my desk by a phonecall from a co-worker telling me the morning meeting starts in 5 mins, I decided I didn't want to live the rest of my life that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fab ~  I was not equating Stay-at-home mothers with &quot;not contributing to society&quot;.  I believe stay-at-home mothers DO contribute to society, in very important and fundamental ways.  However, I do NOT believe Stay-at-home mothers = personal slaves.  Running a household is enough work, the bullshit it says to do in that article is a little ridiculous.  I think women who stay at home deserve a little appreciation from their husbands in return and should not have to bend over backwards for their working partners 24/7.  We have bad days too.<br>
<br>
So anyway, the intentions behind my quote: &quot;I'd rather be a contributing member of society than a personal slave&quot; had nothing to do with stay-at-home mothers.  Sorry for the ambiguity.<br>
<br>
<br>

Understanding and caring. Having been involved with enough women to believe I know... I think long term happiness is based more off of mutual respect and love than any other single aspect.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree 100%.  It's about mutual caring and respect, but the &quot;mutual&quot; aspect was nowhere to be found in that article or Matan's post.  Didn't see much along the lines of &quot;respect&quot; either.  And that was what I was responding to.<br>

Do tell,what reverse sexism you have been seeing...<br>
<br>
 Women not hiring men at the most important jobs?  Only giving them shit jobs and paying them less than the woman working next to them?<br>
<br>
 I know, woman hiring men only to do us sexual favors because other wise we consider them useless air heads.<br>
<br>
 OOOOh wait, women getting the best jobs, just because they are women not because they had to work twice as hard to get there.  That wouldn't be a possibility.<br>
<br>
 Or the old stand by she gets to sleep her way to the top.  This I have seen, and consider these, so called, women a disgrace.  But think about it who did she sleep with to make this happen?  MEN!  Not reverse sexism that is mutual sliminess...<br>
<br>
 Is there anything wrong with being an at home Mom or Dad?  Not at all that is great!  Is it less important... NO WAY!  Is it less work?.... Maybe for the working partner since they aren't expected to come home and split the house work.<br>
<br>
 The problem with it for me is this:  I have no intention of relying on ANY man to provide for me and my children.  I have seen the results time and time again.  Man sleeps around, mistreats her, after all what is she going to do about it?  She really can't afford to leave.  Or maybe he is a great and honerable man like I assumed when we got married, but oops there was an accident maam.  Good luck providing for your kids.  I'm sure that McDonald's job your qualified for should almost cover daycare.  <br>
<br>
 Reverse sexism?  How do you figure?  Where is this happening and how do I get there?     <br>

That does in fact happen a lot, at least in this metro. Many, many adult women are store managers here and they tend to create a very ..uhm..how do I say this nicely....hen house atmosphere *ducks*. They like to hire similar aged women and teenage guys. It's almost funny if ya think about cause you know theyre thinking 'sweet revenge'. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1179.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1179.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1179.topic&start=61&stop=67>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1179.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1179.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1179.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1179.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1179.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1179.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
