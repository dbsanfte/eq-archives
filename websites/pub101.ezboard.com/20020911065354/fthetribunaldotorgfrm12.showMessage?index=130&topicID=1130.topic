<br>
Recap:<br>
Mando believed what he was doing was right, some agree with him, and some do not.<br>
<br>
The rest is just peeps who have no clue what happened, are just guessing, are assuming stuff that isn't true, or are just losers.<br>
<br>
Do I agree with what Mando did?  <br>
&gt;No.<br>
Would I do the same thing? <br>
&gt;No, multi-guild raids should handled with random rolls for those who need the loot.<br>
Would any Legendary members do what Mando did? <br>
&gt;No, if they want to stay with Legendary.<br>
What mesures could have been done to avoid this, other than avoid raids lead by Mando?  <br>
&gt;Ask the loot rules ahead of time.<br>

Keep talking Arec, I'm sure you missed this post by Mandoman on the first page, since you obviously did some research instead of ignorantly blurting &quot;where did he say that?&quot;.  And considering Froc only tried to say otherwise once and never came back, I'm willing in my mind to concede this argument point to Mandoman, simply because the nay-sayers are ignorant or not participating.  And in the end, no matter how stupid you look or act, Sylie (sp? dunno the real toon personally) is still wearing the belt.  You splitting the insignificant hairs of this argument is pointless, just like your life. <p>Jaggedspine Infinitelysad, Phalanx<BR>60 Barbarian Shaman, The Tribunal<BR><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97215>My Stuff</a><BR><img src=http://www.umr.edu/~clloyd/Sig.bmp><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umandoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 369<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/02 1:15:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New PoMS</span><hr size=1> *beats on the dead horse a little more*<br>

Jesus you guys I dropped this shit 2 pages ago, stop misquoting people.<br>
<br>
Yes that's what Mando said...yippie doo da...Ostracula said that Froc *admitted* to this...all I see is Froc saying that Mando got it all wrong...just like you Larg, and you Osctracula, and you Kinvaras, and I'm sure some other people did too.<br>
<br>
Froc's actual quote..<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #1 Mandoman said how we were trying to form a KS GRP too? Is that so, hrmmm. Im sure that was what we had in Mind.

Where you got your idea of us having a 2 Rogue, 2 Wiz GRP fuck knows<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So just because Froc only bothered to post here once that means he's obviously lying?? is that what this has come to? good lord<br>
<br>
Lemme 'splain...a little louder for the cheap seats<br>
<br>
There was no KS group for the 1st Dragon...dunno where you guys got that Idea.  Maybe Mando *thought * that there was or that we said it somewhere...but we didn't.  Froc already posted on here that his group was not an xp group what soever...please go back and read the post for god sake.  You people read one quote (a misquote at that) from Mando and took it as gospel for the entire thread assuming that the other guy was lying.  That's just pathetic.<br>
<br>
There was a group that got together to attempt to get the xp on the SECOND (READ) SECOND dragon (which we never killed)  The ONLY reason we did this is because of the way the loot was handled on the 1st one.  Who wants to do something like this and not even be CONSIDERED for loot?  Does that make us loot whores? No  The intention was for everyone to get a shot...not just for US to get a shot.<br>
<br>
This was said in group that the only intention was for the loot to be decided upon considering all that were there. NOT (REPEAT) NOT so that we could &quot;ninja&quot; it for ourselves...another one of the misconceptions here that I have explained more than once, which by Larg's logic means I must be telling the truth right?<br>
<br>
Mando decided something probably in a hurry because there was alot of people there who he could not lock the corpse from.  I wouldn't have wanted to see it ninja looted by someone who couldn't use it either...but that is (just my opinion) not a very good reson to hastily award it to someone else without consideration for the others.  This point I already conceeded to him.  It was his descision and it's done.(water under the bridge)<br>
<br>
The only reason why you guys only hear Legendary &quot;and a few noob rogues&quot; complaining about it is because I'm pretty sure that with the exception of Slyie that was all that was there.<br>
<br>
For god sakes just drop it.<br>
<br>
Ostracula I don't know what the fuck you think you can offer into this insight...I sure as hell didn't see you there.  You have no fucking clue what happened and you are simply forming judgements based on misquotes and misconceptions.  So if you wanna throw misquotes in my face go for it...afterall it's a misquote from someone who you weren't even quoting.(LOL?)  Way to prove me wrong buddy.<br>

If there were multiple wizards from a single guild there, either they were grouped or they have no right to bitch, because they didn't put their best foot forward to begin with to engage a Sont-style fight.  Froc posted once, spouted off about several different subjects, and never came back and tried to give reasoning or evidence to the contrary of Mandoman's post.  His very posting confirms that he was engaging Mando in open channels about how his group could have the majority damage on this battle.  Now, most of the time, when people are that pissed, there's often a &quot;impotent&quot; motivation.  For some reason, this whole Froc vs. Mandoman seems to lead in that direction.<br>
<br>
In the game of &quot;No I didn't, Yes You did (repeated a bunch of times)&quot;, generally the person who is in the wrong is the person who stomps off in a huff.

In a community reputation actually means something.<br>
<br>
THe Comps- Good reputation, only EV can compare to them in terms of accomplishment, and they certainly don't make asses out of themselves on a daily basis. Among them, Mandoman is widely regarded as a knowledgeable and well respected member. <br>
<br>
Legendary- joke of a fucking guild. And even among them, Froc is a joke even more, an asshole among assholes. How would I know? I was only guilded with him before he joined Legendary.<br>
<br>
I wasn't there, but given the two conflicting parties, I have no qualms with accepting Mando's story as the truth given reputation and past encounters. <p><center><http://www.bangalorenet.com/system1/sailo/images/2rips.jpg></center>
