<br>
Asians don't get special preference at top US academic institutions. They certainly don't need it. In fact, seeing as education is valued so greatly and is emphasized so much by many Asian American families, there are many undergprograms that are virtually &quot;overrun&quot; with Asians. Look at any of the top programs in California universities.  Berkeley...Stanford...no shortage of Asian students to say the LEAST.<br>

<br>
I beg to differ.  When any person can get into a community college and graduate as easily as graduating high school, then yes they *could* be unqualified for obtaining admissions to a higher level university and yes they are refuges for those that are unqualified in the academic world.  There is also the chance that they *somehow* know enough to be able to compete at the university level, and thus be *qualified*.  However, since I have attended both a community college and a somewhat high-end university (took some summer courses that would transfer over), I have the ability to state that YES high-end universities are WAY above community colleges when it comes to detail, focus, academic qualifications in order to successfully learn the material presented and learned.  Community colleges do NOT have the capability to present knowledge in such detail as a university is capable of doing, and therefore one who goes to a community college may not be able to perform at a university level.  I firmly believe that not all people are smart, that not all people can work at their education to become a genius if they really want to, that some people are meant for labor-like jobs, and that we are not all exactly equal in potential to become brain material.  Anyone who thinks that is naive.  I try damn hard to pass my classes at UofM while there are kids sitting next to me that can wiz through the content in 15 minutes every night without scratching their head.  I'm by no means a genius.  I was part of the &quot;last batch&quot; of accepted students to the university.  I'm not complainin in the least bit.  I'm willing to accept what I am.  Too many people are told they can fly if they try hard enough.  People need to realize that they can achieve success no matter who they are, but they shouldn't be told that they can live their dreams, be God, fly, or other illogical things.  Personally, I'm built for the labor industry.  I'm a tough guy, and can work all day long outside and enjoy it.  Too many people have a lack of respect for laborers.  Too many people think that being educated makes them better than the next guy.  It sucks.  At least admit that community colleges can't compare to universities, because they can't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 727<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/03 12:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=26>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: U of M</span><hr size=1> Count,<br>

Someday you'll graduate and realize that with VERY FEW exceptions, what you learn in college isn't meaningful in the least.  It's the process of learning how to learn, how to do effective self management and time management, etc that matters, and you can't say that someone working full time at a blue-collar job and doing a community college degree isn't getting the same valuable experience that a history major at some university is getting.<br>
<br>
You'll argue this point; I would have, also, when I was in college.  Having since been in the &quot;real world&quot;, I can quite clearly see higher education for what it really was for, and can very much see how a similar preparation can be had at a state or community college.<br>
<br>
There ARE exceptions to this, where what you are taught is directly relevant to what you do with it after school - anything like engineer, doctor, or scientist isn't something you can just spend 2 years at a junior college and suddenly have the skills to do.  But 99.9% of liberal arts degrees have little or nothing to do with what you'll actually do with them afterwards (yes, this includes history majors!  Its a rare breed of history major that goes on to either write history papers or teach history - most go on to be lawyers, or enter the business world, or publishing, writing, etc.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 288<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/03 4:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Someday you'll graduate and realize that with VERY FEW exceptions, what you learn in college isn't meaningful in the least.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Now now, you know that ain't true at all.  And if you think it is, well then you obviously don't know much about university research and development.  Personally, I'll admit that my field of study (history/teaching) is hardly one of the kinds that requires a large university in order to progress in it.  Large universities do have a nice advantage of giving students access to old and rare documents and books that aren't normally available (a pro for history) but other than that, I think most colleges could pull off history as a major pretty well.  I'll humble myself for that, I'll take the blow.  The fields that I was referring to were fields that require one or more buildings just for a VERY specific application.  For instance, UofM has its own nuclear reactor, completely run by the university, for research and studying.  Do you see community colleges with nuclear reactors?  We have a &quot;life sciences&quot; building being built as we speak.  This building is made specifically for stem cell research, complete with full labs to meet the demands of those who plan on working with genetics.  Do you see community colleges with labs such as these?  We have a windtunnel, tons and tons of stacks of books in the libraries (some 20+ libraries, full size), a plasma building/lab for technology that deals with plasma, something like the 4th largest hospital in the nation with a HUGE medical study branch, and many other countless &quot;specific&quot; buildings that I can't think of off the top of my head.  You seriously think that all these buildings and labs are created JUST so people can learn how to learn and to learn how to have self management and time management?  These are HARDLY &quot;very few exceptions&quot;.  Altogether these buildings comprise of about 40% of campus.  To give you an idea of the size of all of the campus (to compare in your mind), its about 48% of the city of Ann Arbor (i.e. statistics on property owned by the university, and not by the city).  The city population is roughly 90,000 people.<br>

No where did I say that.  I said there are possibly better opportunities (most definitely if its law, business, medical, or engineering when referring specifically to UofM compared to a community college).  You seem to think I have a lack of respect for blue collar workers, laborers, and people who OFTEN are underappreciated.  Please don't get that impression from me at all.  I am most certainly one who holds laborers in high respect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There ARE exceptions to this, where what you are taught is directly relevant to what you do with it after school.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If you call roughly 30-40% an &quot;exception&quot; then yep, there are exceptions.  Most of the kids that leave college here either move on to grad school, or graduate in medicine, engineering, law, or business.  Thats hardly an exception.  Actually, I am kinda the &quot;exception&quot; at my school, coming out with a degree that actually fits your argument.<br>
<br>
I really don't want you to get the impression that I think laborers are somehow lower class than academic people.  I don't, at all, and in fact I really despise it when other people think that way.  I'm just setting things straight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 730<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/03 10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=28>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> Fair enough - I don't know what school you go to, and what % of students are in &quot;vocational&quot; type programs (science or engineering) versus liberal arts or more generic &quot;education for the sake of education&quot; majors.<br>

Certainly if you go to MIT or CalTech, you could argue most students are VERY MUCh going to apply the stuff they learn to their post college life.  You'd have an insanely difficult time making the same argument for Amherst, however, even though it is &quot;as good&quot; of a school by whatever arbitrary rankings you see these days as MIT or CalTech.  Just a very different focus.<br>
<br>
I'd contend that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>significant</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> majority of 4 year college students come out with a liberal arts degree - and I don't mean to make this sound &quot;lesser&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; (and I don't think you took it that way, but I wanted to make that clear).  That simply means that these people have learned how to learn, as well as learned how to analyze, think through topics, and form coherent thoughts when expressing their ideas.  While these are all good things, they certainly are not the same as the Electrical Engineering student who learns how to design microprocessors and promptly goes to work for Intel.<br>
<br>
Probably counter to your original statement, I'd guess most 2 year community college students end up getting a degree in MUCH more focused, practical topics than the average 4-year liberal arts students.  They may not be the advanced nuclear science degrees or MDs, but don't discount the value of an MIS or something in the 21st century workplace.  You'll get more job offers these days with an MIS from a community college than an english major degree from a respected 4-year institution (the very top schools, such as the ivy league, are naturally a significant exception). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/22/03 12:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> UofM stands for &quot;university of michigan&quot;.

There are a few fields where UofM is number 1-4 (based on info 2 yrs ago, so it coulda changed by now) in the nation though, specifically: nuclear engineering, business, and biological studies in medicine.  Due to the ties between biological medicines and nuclear engineering, we are currently number 1 in &quot;nuclear medicine&quot; which deals with radiation treatments, etc, beating out MIT by a decent shot due to having labs and a reactor for it.  I don't know if MIT plans on going in depth on this particular field or not.<br>

Actually, thats one thing I have been persuaded to believe.  I haven't gotten any 2 yr program experiences so I don't really know for sure.  But, I have some friends who do that kinda stuff, and when they do, they always seem to get intern/temp jobs that are hands-on experience before graduating.  To me, thats a great way to go if you go for those fields.  Lots of jobs don't require intense studying of terms and theories, but instead learning &quot;labor&quot; tasks and such.  Not only that, but why waste money on expensive 4 year schools anyways, if it doesn't apply to your career?  <br>
<br>
BTW, for all you out there who think that being smart somehow puts you above laborers...you couldn't be further from wrong.  Laborers make the world work...and they do it with their bare hands.  Go out and get a labor job (construction, grounds keeping, concrete crew, tunneling and drilling, etc etc) and when you come out, you tell me who works harder.  Both the thinkers and the laborers are needed in this world, so don't think so lowly of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wittlesvaseel>WittlesVaseel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Most anything is better than <BR>

This is a rule of thumb that my parents once told me when I was choosing between heading straight to university, or starting out at a community college. Go to the university if you don't mind being taught by a TA, or go to a CC to get taught by a (this is the only word that comes to mind) professor. <br>
<br>
Either way, it wont matter if you come from a CC or university, the ONLY thing barring you from success is lack of ambition.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Wittles 54 warrior Retired<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Naffenea 54 ranger<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Screaming 52 druid<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Vaseel 51 bard Retired</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/22/03 5:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> Obviously ambition counts for a lot, but in many fields so does pedigree.

<br>
I was not a stellar student, but did get into and graduate from a law school wtih a good enough name that I never had doors closed to me.  And in some fields, like law, the law school you went to can remain very relevent to your ability to get a certain job (say, General Counsel of a large company) even 20 years after you graduate. On the other hand, if you want to work for yourself, it doesn't matter one hoot.<br>

Definitely not a good rule of thumb.  Lots of my classes are taught by professors, with a classroom size of around 25-30.  Some of the major &quot;basic&quot; classes have large lectures of a couple hundred people taught by a professor and then broken down into discussions of 20-30 kids by a GSI, but every single class has a professor readily available to assist and help you.  Not only that, there are about a bajillion different ways to get help from other people who know their stuff as well, all for free.  At least at my school I haven't seen this concept ever really be true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=largthemiserable>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 363<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/27/03 12:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Go to the university if you don't mind being taught by a TA, or go to a CC to get taught by a (this is the only word that comes to mind) professor. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

...?  I've never been taught by a TA in the 9 semesters it took me to get a B.S. in Physics.  Even for classes that are large due to their common necessity (basic chemistry, physics, etc.) are taught with a lecture-recitation combination, with the main professor teaching the lectures, and other professors teaching/leading the recitations.<br>
<br>
Someone above mentioned that a majority of people graduating from college (at least at the bachelor level) don't use what they learned in college.  I don't know about anyone else, but could I get a few examples of that?  Maybe it was just my school (Missouri's school of engineering and science) but I got the impression that engineers, comp sci's, management, scientists, mathematicians and even historians used what they learned.  You may not use every little detail ever taught to you, but you'll use some if not most of it.<br>

On the flip side I have met a large number of people that got degrees in education that did end up teaching or still are teaching. Everyone in my family that got a degree in forestry or engineering spent their careers in that field, and 1 friend that got a B.A in Business Admin was hired and presumably still working as a manager at Target.<br>

I have a friend who got her degree in Chinese studies and went on to law school.  Also a friend who got a degree in English and went on to Med school.  Oh, and a classmate in Japanese who went on to graduate school in computer science...<br>
<br>
As for the multitude of people who work in silicon valley that i know, the vast majority of them did not get a degree in Computer science.  They came from all walks of life. One being a postman who jumped careers and made 80k as a sys admin on his first IT job.  I will admit though that computers is a unique field in that way.  <br>

Mostly because there isn't a whole lot of science left in computer science (some will argue that there's too much hype), and rather a lot of computing applied to sciences or IT. So you may have a better time with a cursus starting with say physics and then icing the cake with some computational algorithms courses. <br>
