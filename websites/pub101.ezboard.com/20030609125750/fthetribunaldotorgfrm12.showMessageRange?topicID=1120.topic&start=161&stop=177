<br>
Take note:<br>
Awakened by screaming child due to phone call at 0202am Sunday morning.  On answering maching, call stated I needed to give up account that was given to me.  I, also, am apparently harassing individuals on here and if it doesn't stop, my RL job will find out and consequences will ensue.  <br>
<br>
Hmm...talk about separating game/boards from RL!  <br>
<br>
Account is officially mine and being paid for appropriately.  I am in no rule violation.  It was not bought or sold.  It was not taken fraudulently.  The whole &quot;don't tell her this, don't tell him that&quot; shit doesn't cut it anymore.  That took balls to admit, Wick...and by god I did it.  The rest of that, unfortunately falls upon you and her.  <br>
<br>
I will say that my posts have been nothing more than mere opinion and laughs upon reading everyone's verbal bombardment on me, namely Bowynn. <br>
<br>
So, as some would say, at a request (I say by threat of RL consequences)...my main will no longer be Kaeko Pussifoot.   I will no longer continue to post on this thread or about Wick/Daeja or whoever else you can think of.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, I would like to change who I would be for the day.  New individual would be Daeja/Whimsy.  Hitting lvl 55-60 in game, is way more important than finding a place to live and getting settled down.  That must rock to have no responsibility.  I do believe you say to leave RL in RL and game in, well, game.  But if you say I play a chick to cyber and suck fat cock in RL...then how is that not harassment to me?  Its a fucking flame board, get over it.  <br>

<br>
Yes, we were pretty close. I stuck up for you on occasions that possibly I shouldn't have. <br>
<br>
Tom made an error in judgement, so please do not go tossing Kaeko's name around. That situation will be rectified shortly. Had I known sooner, it never would have happened, as far as I am concerned.<br>
<br>
As far as running anyone's life - you only know half the story. You don't know shit about me or my life. Please keep your fucking mouth shut when it comes to me outside of this game, because as far as I am concerned, I no longer know you. <br>
<br>
I'm going to ask you one more time to stop bringing up my real life, tom's real life, frank's real life, or anyone's real life on this board. It's not necessary. I could give a fuck what people know about me, my fucked up marriage, my divorce, whatever.<br>
<br>
The problem is, you were Tom's friend, and you broke his trust. And even though he and I are on the outs, I still love him and I know it bothers him that you betrayed his confidence. <br>
<br>
You've known him way longer than I have. You two go way back, were pretty good friends. What a wonderful friend you are now. Way to go, Tony. Way to fucking go.<br>
<br>
(And an FYI, Tom is a grown man. He does what he wants to do. I don't run him. He's fucking stubborn as a mule. He does what he damn well wants to - but you should know that, because birds of a feather...)<br>
<br>
Anything else you need to say to me, call or email me. I'm not going round and round with you here. I respect your family too much for that. I hope you can respect your friendship with Tom and do the same.<br>

Again, Tony, you know nothing about what is going on here. <br>
Hitting any level really doesn't mean shit to me. What matters to me is getting my life together. <br>
<br>
The only time i play EQ is at night - when I'm not going on interviews or job hunting, or dealing with my mother because my father is sick and probably going to pass on soon. I'm dealing with RL shit. And to get away from that, I log on in the evenings and play a fucking video game. Just like many other people do. I don't shirk my fucking responsibilities. <br>
<br>
If you truly think that this game means more to me than settling down, then you truly never knew me at all. Good-bye, and good riddance. Tom is truly better off without you. Shit, he's better off without both of us. God Bless Him.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 682<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/28/02 12:19 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~jakecj7/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you like fucking my personal life?</span><hr size=1> If you guys want to discuss all your real life crap for others to see please do it on another forum.

YOU are not Kaeko Pussifoot.  You are nothing but a virus infecting her body.  She'll shake you.  I am Kaeko.  I created her, I played her, and I never roll played.  She is me.  I leveled her to twenty and gave her a name.  I married her off.  I made friends as her.  I fought battles with the good people of Norrath in Kaeko's name.  I did not try the pathetically lame strategy of getting people to give me things because of a female avatar that did not represent any woman in real life.  And I played her because I *AM* a female - I'm not a man trying to manipulate other men.<br>
<br>
Please, leave Dae and Wick alone.  I adore them, I did from the very first day I met them, I did my entire EQ life, and I have since the day I left two years ago.  And so do the many other people they have done good things for.  They are sweet, decent people, who have problems like everyone else in real life, which are really nobody's business.  I sincerely doubt that you are the faultless, sinless, pure shining soul sent down from above to judge them and find their lives, hearts, or decisions wanting.  <br>
<br>
And to anyone who this sad, lonely, miserable person decides to say rude and crass things to, please do not associate Kaeko with it.  Kaeko is a young woman who is blissfully happy married, raising three children, and working full time who ran out of time to play EQ with the devotion required.  Kaeko is a woman who remembers every one of you fondly and misses her time in Norrath.  Kaeko is looking forward to EQ2.  Kaeko is not spending time here, trying desperatly to hurt people.<br>
<br>
And now, I must adieu.  My youngest, who was diagnosed with Asthma last week (at less than to two years old), has now developed Pnemonia and needs her mommy. <br>

  Thats great.  I'm glad to hear you think so highly of people like them.  Someone has too...many people do.  I, however, have seen through the shit they pull over people; in game, and in RL!  But thats okay, just my opinion.  <br>
<br>
  I apologize to the board moderators, as I said I would post no more...Thank god, right!  I would like to add, on this final note, the account stays with me.  It was given to me by someone who didn't play it.  I took over payments.  I will not relinquish control of the account to anyone.  Period!  Ban the account.  The characters were brought into Norrath, by you.  Thats fine.  The characters will be deleted, by me.  All have been deleted as of a few moments ago anyways.  <br>
<br>
  So, these idle threats in emails (Wick) for me to give up the account, and your sorry ass subject &quot;Sorry it has to come to this&quot; shit...Go fuck yourself, Ass.  Verbal threats over a fucking VIDEO GAME just do not cut it.  Daeja, you say you want to bring my command into this.  Please, be my guest.  I have taken the liberty to print up the threads, in the original form.  Please send this in and call me for harassment.  I have not challenged you, nor said anything not true about you in RL.  But thats cool too.  <br>

I shed a tear reading about your kids.  I really did, sweetheart!  Thats a sad story.  As it was put to me, RL doesn't mean shit on this board, Bitch!  Hope they get better, and you rest assured that Kaeko has been deleted.  <br>
<br>
  I will also hold off on my morbid RL rip on you with your parting comment, Kaeko, at the advice from friends that I can get about as morbid as they come.  You bring RL into the board, and it will get flamed...I'll just say this:  Asthma sucks.  And if I am accused of bringing RL onto the boards, why can you?  Namely your kids (cause that flames might get kinda fucked up with that one...I'm pretty sick.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
Tom (as you have said) &quot;Don't bother replying, as I won't respond.  As far as I am concerned, I don't know you.  I am no longer your friend.&quot;  I've heard a ten year old say that before.  My compadre and I would like to know if you want your candy back? <p>Failure; when your best just isn't good enough</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 1340<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/29/02 7:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fucktarded Guilds- My ten cents cause my two cents is fr</span><hr size=1> id flame this keiko but i have no clue who it is.. but she sure seems whiney <p>retired poo slinger</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulargthemiserable.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/29/02 8:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fucktarded Guilds- My ten cents cause my two cents is fr</span><hr size=1> Keiko has got to be Bob Dole, noone else refers to him/herself in the 3rd person nearly as much. <p>Jaggedspine Infinitelysad, Phalanx<BR>60 Barbarian Shaman, The Tribunal<BR><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97215>My Stuff</a><BR><img src=http://www.umr.edu/~clloyd/Sig.bmp><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udaeja.showPublicProfile?language=EN>daeja</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://liquid2k.com/daeja/gem2_839.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Sassy.</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/30/02 12:16 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/VEUX1804/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/VEUX1804CustomImage1687467.gif width=122 height=199></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Assclown</span><hr size=1> Email sent, DM. <br>

FYI, T -<br>
<br>
The account was <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> mine</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. Not Wick's, to give. He was doing you, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>his friend</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, a favor. The fact that he asked you not to tell me should have hinted to you that it was<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not his</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to give. He made an error in judgement due to our separation, and that's something he and I have handled between us, and he knows he was in the wrong. <br>
<br>
That said, you *should* have done the right thing and given it back. It's not like you have put much time and effort into that account. But oh no, you feel the need to pitch a fit and delete characters. We should have known better than to expect reasonable and civil behavior from the likes of you, oh well. <br>
<br>
So, I hope you feel better now that you've thrown your tantrum and lost a long time friend in the process. And, instead of handling this privately, you continue to post here. I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish, but &quot;you go boy&quot;. <br>
<br>
By the way, say what you will to make me or Wick look bad. You think I give a flying fuck what anyone else thinks? You think I care if they use this as ammo for future flames? Our real friends, the ones that matter, know us better than that. <br>
<br>
I do not intend to &quot;go to your command&quot; about this shit. My issue is about principles. I could really give a fuck about anything else. How old are you again? Grow the fuck up and let it go. Seriously. <br>
<br>
Finally, feeling the need to apologize to everyone for this fucking, boring, pointless thread. Feel free to lock it, discard it, what have you.  It's fucking sad, and I'm sorry you all had to witness it. <br>
<br>
p.s.<br>
CD Keys are your friend. <br>

When calling someone else a child perhaps you should examine your own words.  When the other kids on the playground didn't want you on the team you took the kick ball and put a hole in it so no one else could play.  Do you want your candy back?<br>
