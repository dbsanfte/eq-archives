What insights did I give, other than the fact you are ignorant?  So since you were the one who made the orginal statement, how about you give us proof that everyone on welfare, hell I'll even take a majority of people on welfare, are people who are low life scum, pop out kiddies like mad and these kids all become criminals.  How about a signifigant percentage?  I can see how your playing of Everquest has given you superior knowledge of the inner workings of the welfare system.  Way to go.<br>
<br>
Have you even met and talked to anyone who is on welfare?  Go ahead, I'll promise you the vast majority of them won't bite.<br>
<br>
Here's a hint on your so-called facts, you heard it from somewhere or someone told you about it and you nodded your head sagely and then came onto the flameboard and acted like a Everquest playing parrot and just recited it word for word, with no checking of facts or even finding out the situation for yourself.

51 Republicans in the senate is far from &quot;unchecked.&quot; There are many opportunities for debates that require 60 votes to cut off.  Yes its a majority and yes the committees will all be controlled by the majority, but its no free ticket to get every bill passed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>At least the republicans can take all the credit for the mess now, since they control everything. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This has been the standard response from the Democrats, minus the typical &quot;there really is a silver lining in this&quot; statement. Its losers trying to put a best face on losing bigger than happened in ~100 years. Things are so rosey for the Democrats that party leaders all over the country are in serious jeopardy of losing their jobs or having to step down for having run such lousy campaigns devoid of any positive message or issue other than &quot;George Bush is the devil.&quot;  Do you think that Gebhardt is happy about stepping down? It's not exactly advancing his presidential aspirations.<br>
<br>
By that logic, the Republicans should have thrown the election so that the Democrats could keep running Congress for the next two years to make George Bush's re-election easier.  It's just not logical. Politicians exist to win elections and party leaders exist to help that happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1755<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/9/02 10:55:07 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Its losers trying to put a best face on losing bigger than happened in ~100 years.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Oh please, did you actually see the numbers? Yes, we lost and I give no excuses (other than 9/11 saving Bush imo - but there is no way to prove that - he might have pulled out some good approval numbers anyway though I seriously doubt it), but the population as a whole are still basically split down the middle.  We lost, but as close as it was, I don't see the public sending democrats any kind of message with the results.<br>
<br>
With numbers like these Bush would be crazy to stray too far from the center (as would democrats if they had won by such a slim margin overall) if he wants a second term.<br>

<br>
So be it. There are worse hobbies to take up I guess.<br>
<br>
Now on to your retarded comment, just because this is a real easy one that really shows what a pathetic grasp of simple concepts you have and it pleases me in some strange way to highlight what everyone already knows... the fact that you are are trying to take over the board jester slot.<br>
<br>
I am a democrat. Unlike you, I am not a the cowardly type who continuelessly refuses to identify with anything. All I ever see you say is &quot;I never said I belonged to this&quot; or &quot;I never said I didn't do this&quot; etc, etc. You just sit back and take shots at other people who at least have the balls to commit.<br>
<br>
I belong to the democratic party. When they lose, I lose because that means republicans are now able to make policy that effects me because I am a citizen of this country. (Do you even have enough balls to identify what country you are a citizen of? You can't seem to commit to anything else). <br>
<br>
So yes, since I am a member of the democratic party, that means I say we... as in democrats of which I am affiliated with.<br>
<br>
Understand that? It's pretty simple really, but then you don't have many levels of structured thought processes to work with. Guess that makes concepts like being a part of many groups at once and using the terms we and them correctly pretty difficult for ya. <p><br>

He won't, which is why in this lame duck session homeland security is the number one goal and almost the only real goal. He's going slow and will give the people what they want -- a homeland security bill that the Democrats held up before the election in some more bad strategy.<br>

<br>
Well, I can agree with the message that &quot;we support the Commander in Chief&quot;. What I meant was that it wasn't sending any message about which party was in trouble or considered ineffective. I think America likes George Bush, who happens to be a republican, rather than they like a republican who happens to be George Bush. The same could have been said of Clinton in his second term. There were republicans who voted for him in support of his economy performance, despite the fact he was a democrat.<br>
<br>
I also think such close numbers indicate that there isn't as many important differences between philosophies of the parties that people care deeply about. Both parties have actually moved pretty close to the center. Even democrats scare me sometimes when it comes to social issues these days.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Democrats should take your advice! They are electing one of the most outspokenly well-left-of-center representatives as House minority whip.

<br>
That's because alot of analyst are saying the dems lost because they have moved to the center and basically support the same things as the current administration (or at least do not speak out against it). Personally I think it is a mistake as well. <br>

We should just bide our time. I think Bush will ruin the economy and by the time 2004 rolls around, people are going to be bad enough off (the middle and lower classes anyway) that change will happen. If he had divided the tax cut more evenly overall I think it would have worked alot better, but his cuts favor the wealthiest of the wealthy. I am not a believer in Trickledown (Voodoo) Economics. Wealth is built from the bottom up (spending = demand), not the other way around. To make new jobs you have to increase demand of products. To increase demand of products you have to have the majority of people spending money to buy that product. <br>
<br>
Giving the rich a tax break may increase demands on yachts and high end autos, but that's not going to revive the economy. It's the lower and middle class spending that creates jobs. <p><br>

<br>
What fucking drugs were you doing while attempting to read my orginal post?  Or did you just pick out a couple words and try to be cool by posting some lame ass thing with a swear word or two?<br>
<br>
&quot;What insights did I give, other than the fact you are ignorant?&quot;<br>
<br>
 NONE (exactly my point) and have yet to prove I'm the ignorant one.  Hence the question &quot;Where is your gained insight?&quot;... I don't know how I can make the question any more lamen than that.  ok Gained Insight =experience, vast knowledge... get it???<br>
<br>
 Show me where it is I said everyone on welfare was a lazy ass popping out kids...  Show me where I said people on welfare were bad.. Oooh if you go on to the second paragraph of my first post, you will see an example where I say just the opposite.  Where a lady that I worked with had 3 jobs and was on it.  And I saw her last week (two weeks ago now) when I visited my home state.  Hence your telling me that I don't like poor people and try to talk them completly ignorant as well.  Not to mention the EQ 24 hours a day WRONG when I also said in the post I just got back from traveling out of state.  Hell, the few things I did say about myself you STILL got wrong.<br>
<br>
 First off I said we had bigger problems than our welfare system that need to be fixed first.  I said the people that are living off welfare (hence not inbetween jobs or unable to work) that pop out more kids to get more money from the state.  Yes... it does happen... and I'm the sheltered one /sigh... and yes the majority of kids raised in this environment are what is filling up our jail cells.  Want to find out for yourself go visit your local jailhouse and see your suppliers, ask how many of thier momma's was on the welfare.  Please put down the crack pipe and try to concentrate real hard on this one. I will make it even easier just for YOU... <br>
<br>
  I did not say I had a problem with all people on welfare.  I gave examples where it can be useful.  I also gave examples how sad it is some people are working as hard as they are and still have to rely on it.  <br>
<br>
 The problem comes in when some LAZY ASS who has no intentions of working because the world owes them attitude soaks up the money from the system.  I would say I'm sorry if this hits too close to home for you but the fact is I'm not.  Maybe, I was talking about your momma..  Learn to move on. <p> <HTML><BODY>

A poor guy earns $20,000 a year.  He pays 20% taxes.  That means $4,000 to the government.  A tax cut is implemented, and now he only pays 15% taxes.  Now only $3,500 goes to the government - a $500 tax break.<br>
<br>
A rich guy earns $200,000 a year.  He pays 40% taxes due to our lovely graduated tax system.  That means $80,000 goes to the government.  A tax cut is implemented, and now he only pays 35% taxes.  Now only $70,000 goes to the government - a $10,000 tax break!!<br>

I dare you to name me ONE tax shelter or one &quot;loophole.&quot;  ONE.<br>
<br>
I make a certain multiple of $50,000 per year.  Here are my deductions: home mortgage interest, home real estate taxes, state income tax, personal property tax (on cars). Notice something about all but the first? They are all taxes.<br>
<br>
I'll give you a big prize if you find me anyone earning $50,000 who pays a disproportionately small share of income tax due to a tax shelter or a &quot;loophole.&quot;  There ain't none.<br>
<br>
Bring some facts to the debate next time.  And if you paid 40% income tax on a $20,000 income, visit H &amp; R Block this winter.

Our only remaining disagreement concerns who should spend what money.  He wants the government to take the money I earn and give it to others to spend:<br>

When I see people say &quot;gubment cheeze&quot; I laugh.. but I look back on a time in my life when my mother attempted to live on her own, without my fathers help, because she was not getting along with him.  We were getting almost 800 a month, plus food stamps, (200 a month) medicare, AND church donations.  She couldn't work because I had a baby sister.  We lived in a motel in Long Island set up by the government which we paid 200 a month for.  There was NO incentive to get off of welfare for the other families in that complex.  Some people had four or five kids crammed in, and the mothers boldy admitted it was because it increases the amount they got per month.  Anyone who claims welfare doens't corrupt people had better have some real life experience with it, cause if not, you're high and mighty from your beautiful homes. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.
