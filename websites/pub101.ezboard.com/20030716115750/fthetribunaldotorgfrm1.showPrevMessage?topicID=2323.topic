<br>
My children area aware of the whole issue of gay and lesbian people as they are both scouts and were in scouts during the whole court/news thing regarding homosexual people in scouting. We also have some friends who are homosexual. While it is not our way of life, it is that of others. I teach my children tolerence and acceptance for people who have different lifestyles and belives then their own.  I allow them to play this game completely supervised and there are some servers where I do not allow them to play because there are alot more &quot;hunters of children&quot;  I very closely monitor my childrens game play and when I discover my childrens friends who play everquest I speak to their parents and inform them of the nature of the game and what types of issues their children are exposed to. I happen to be suprized that 99% of the parents of the children my kids are friends with let them play everquest with no clue what their children were actually doing.  <br>
<br>
I also happen to have many children who play with our guild or who are in our guild, and I always keep who the children are confidential to protect them from the &quot;children hunters&quot; I have many times had parents log on their childrens charicters and talk to me asking me questions regarding their kids and what they are doing online. I am happy to speak to parents and do so frequently.  <br>
<br>
When my children play everquest I sit beside them and watch their chat and what they are doing... <br>
<br>
The question is not do children play everquest, because we all know they do, its what are we as adults going to expose them to or are we ready to explain to them what they see and experience online?<br>
<br>
I know parents who let kids as young as 4 years old play the game, because they themselves play constantly and its a way to share their interests with thier kids. Do I agree with this, Im not sure. A 4 year old cannot yet read, and the game for them is pushing buttons to make &quot;monsters&quot; die.  a 10 year old playing the game can read, and is very impressionable. They will not understand much of the true experience of Everquest relationships and finess, but will be impacted by the game and have questions regarding the content and such... a 13 year old is developed much more and will understand more... ect... <br>
<br>
If Varrent didn't expect kids to play they would not have added language filters and GM's to help control the use of the game, they would not have added the user agreement that you must click ok to each time you play. <br>
<br>
**************<br>
ok whats my point?  I would like to here some stories from parents, I would like to know Do you allow your kids to play eq and how much do you monitor their play if you do... and are you really comfortable with answering questions regarding sexual orientation, sex and relationships and language with your children after their EQ experiences?<br>
*****************<br>
<br>
I know thats alot, but its a topic you don't see discussed in public often.  In todays RL we have trust that they will go to school and teachers will sensor their activities, thats 3/4 of their life for 13 years.  What about our jobs as parents when they are not at school? Does our job become harder with everquest on the computer?? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kezmer>Kezmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 560<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/7/02 8:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~mkelly300/_uimages/Kezman1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Children and EQ</span><hr size=1> God made Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve .. thats what i teach children...<br>

Why is it the responsibility of society, in this case, teachers, to censor the activities of our children? If in school, they should be learning, and while I have my own opinions about the educational system, I don't think it should be the responsibility of said teachers to babysit our children. It is up to the PARENTS to raise the child. While it takes a village to raise a child, it is not the sole responsibility of that village. PARENTS need to take an active role in the life they produced.<br>
<br>
I would have to say, that I'd be inclined to not let my child play EQ. There's a lot of adult themes, that are introduced by the population of players. There are ethics involved in the game, that I would not want my child to pick up. What ethics? For example: Kill Stealing. It seems so simple, right? Break it down to its basic element of morality: Respect. So what if your child sees it happen to them, and therefore, they think that it's alright to take something of someone else's? Follow me?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When my children play everquest I sit beside them and watch their chat and what they are doing... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm curious, as to what your response is when something occurs, or is said, that you feel is not right, IE: sexual content. <br>
<br>
These are honest question, not being snide. Just my opinion, I could be wrong.<br>

I am pretty damn sure, that if you are clear with your child, with your expections of behavior for them, that you will NEVER have to raise a hand to them. You should only ever have to express your disappointment, not hit them. Physical abuse only breeds more physical abuse, as well as being a great way for the child to have to spend years and thousands of dollars on shrinks later in life. <br>
<br>
Lest this become a topic on disicipline, let me say, that parents spend more time HITTING their children, than spending TIME with their children. Or, just neglecting them entirely. That said- would you want your child's fondest memories of childhood to be, &quot;that time dad/mom and I went on a raid and killed dragons!&quot; <p><center><a href="http://pub50.ezboard.com/bgardenofearthlydelights"><img src="http://www.xaetrex-networks.com/client_pages/Razzyne/Once-Delight2.jpg"border=0></a><BR>"YEZ I AM EVIL TEMPTRESS SOURSOURERER!!<BR>YAR MATIES I WILL BOIL YE EYES!!!"</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dikinydellight>DikinyDellight</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/7/02 10:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Children and EQ</span><hr size=1> I have a grandchild that I do not let play this game. He's 12 and wants to play but I don't feel this is a place he should be anymore than I would let him go out in the city unsupervised. Even if I could see every chat box, etc, and I know I couldn't, then it's still not something I think a 12 year old has any business doing. He is better off shooting baskets in the driveway or playing Madden on his Playstation 2. <br>
<br>
I don't enjoy playing with children here for a lot of reasons and I would think other adults wouldn't especially enjoy it either. Adults can take advantage of children and children can be annoying so it works both ways. <br>
<br>
Just one instance of what I mean by annoying: My son let him play a character one day and he thought it great fun to drag monsters over other people just because...to a 12 year old boy this was amusing...to me if that happened I would not be too amused. <br>
<br>
So, no, I wouldn't let them play Everquest. Possibly an older teenager might be ok but that's up to the parents. I still feel teenagers have lots more constructive things to be doing with their time like school work, extra curricular activities like sports or band, socializing with friends, etc. than staying inside alone with a computer.<br>

If I was asked a  year or two ago I probably would of said it was fine for a child to play, but things changed and my answer today would most likely be that I wouldn't recommend it.<br>
<br>
My daughter played while I did (starting at 13), she still does on occasion, we had a lot of fun most of the time.  It was something we could do together.  She and I met some great people and walked away with some very close friends, some we were able to meet and still talk to all the time.  I read her logs to check up on her and some  didn't like, but nothing much went on there except the occasional pervert who I of course did not appreciate they way she was talked to.  BUT...I also have to look at it as a learning experience because it opened up a lot of conversations between us that may not of  happened without being exposed to certain situations.  <br>
<br>
I did not freak on bad language, because what I hear coming out of kids mouths around her school etc, is nothing different.  I wasn't thrilled with people who used it excessively but it wasn't as if it was shocking. I did not worry about racial jokes, gay jokes, etc because she was brought up to be a tolerant person and doesn't judge anyone by their race or sexual preferences.  She looks at people who feel the need to belittle others as the moron's that they are.<br>
<br>
Overall it was a good experience for both of us...until in the last  year it all seemed to change.  People used to be helpful to eachother and just enjoyed the fun of the game, the thrill of the hunt, having a good time together.  Then it seemed people just became too involved in the game and forgot it was a game.  People with nothing better to do than talk crap about one another, spread lies, or just attack innocent people for no reason.  She was cut out of a guild because I left (although she had nothing to do with the situation), called fat by people who had never even met her, and just plain put in uncomfortable situations that should never be a part of a game.   The game lost its innocent fun that made it great in the first place.  Luckily she is a great kid and didn't let these things bother her other than not enjoying the game anymore, which is the same that happend with myself.<br>
<br>
We both learned a hard lesson about people and the losers that can hide behind a character in a game because they don't have to answer to anyone.  We learned about how someone can pretend to be your friend but would stab you in the back over a game.  <br>
<br>
My son used to play at 4 and 5.  He couldn't really read so it wasn't a problem, now I won't let him play other than a newb char for a short amount of time with me hanging over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Overall, I don't think either one of us would trade the stupidity of some bad times for the few wonderful lifetime friends we made along the way,  the times we shared, or the conversations we had over issues that may of not happened because the situations didn't arise, and most importantly the laughs with some very close friends.  <br>
<br>
Would I suggest it for any child now?  HELL NO!  I wouldn't suggest it for any adults either.  <br>

I disagree with that. If a kid knows that the only thing they will recieve for breaking dads windshield, or smoking pot or whatever is a stern talk, then they're going to be doing whatever they want.

I never really dealt with the guys trying to cyber me and such cause I would basically just laugh in their face.  But by the time I was 17 I knew better than to do stupid things like that.  Actually, I knew that many years before that.  So I would say 18+ for EQ is a little extreme, but I guess it just depends on how strict you want to be (a question you could ask yourself here is: would you allow your children to chat in chatrooms that were unmoderated?).  There are ways for your kids to rebel thru EQ.  They can cyber people just cause you said not to, they can stay up all hours of the night because you don't approve.  Thats how some teenagers work.  Thank goodness I was not one of them (I think my parents are rather grateful for that as well).  I also know its easy to get wrapped up in the anonimity (sp) of EQ.  I suppose younger people are possibly more inclined to get involved with that, but I know many older people that have also gotten sucked into it.  Actually, I wouldn't say there was one paticular age that is more likely to get involved.  It happens to the younger and older alike.  You just have to have a good head on your shoulders and not use the game as a safe haven from the real world. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~g1ct/jaeydee.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=226786">Jaeydee Deo'Coileach</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->61 Oracle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ravlowscorpse.com/kot">Knights of the Tribunal</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lonagan>lonagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/8/02 12:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2318.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Children and EQ</span><hr size=1> I personally don't think spanking is a very effective method of discipline, at the very least not as a sole method of discipline.  I was spanked growing up (for some odd reason all the time, /grin), and in recollection it really was not the most effective way for my parents to get me to change my behavior.  At times, when I was being a brat, or merely acting childish, a hard spanking was perfect to get my attention, and in simple situations like that, it's probably an effective thing, if that's what you choose to do.<br>
<br>
But when you look at bigger stuff, say drinking and driving, skipping school, etc., it dosn't really work.  If all you can do is spank a child when they make a mistake, then you're never really going to get your message accross.  Growing up is a process of gaining trust.  I feel that so long as you establish that trust (whether it be the trust to cross the street on your own, date on your own, or drive on your own) as something important and desireable, the child will have a very good respect for the importance of not violating that trust, and in the case that rules are broken, the revocation of that trust will have much more meaning, and a much sharper sting, than any spanking.  I guess I just don't see how hitting a child conveys a life lesson. <p>  Kazak- 57 Troll Warrior.<br>

  Few things are more enraging to people than to have their identity or their sense of home stripped away.  They will fight for it, kill for it, sing for it, write poetry for it and novelize about it.   Because without a sense of home and belonging, life becomes barren and rootless.

<br>
but if you do it all the time it no longer has the desired effect and instead they learn that the pain will only last a short time. <br>
<br>
on the issue of children playing the game. i myself spent the majority of my childhood in 1 of 2 places, either at school or on my computer. its only within the last 2 or 3 years that i have actually started thinking about the effects of that.<br>
I lead an active life now, i consider myself to be fit and healthy... but i do have a friend who, even now, spends the majority of his time on a computer. he's a great guy, but i fear for his future and its not because his parents neglect him, in fact its the other way around. he has the most loving parents i have ever seen, but they really should have introduced him to a sport early on.<br>
<br>
anyway... the main points i want to get accross are...<br>
1.small physical disipline is, in my opinion, needed in only the most severe cases. used more than once or twice it will loose its effect and may start to become dangerous.<br>
2. kids do not belong in the game without supervision, and even then as only a bonding excersise.<br>
3.introduce your children to a sport. but... do not force them to go, introduce them to it and see if they like it. as a karate instructor i see kids all the time who are there only because their parents make them... nothing i do will make the child change their minds.<br>
<br>
as always these are only my opinions... im always open to discussion tho if you think im wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=433480"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"> Mezimar Crackyvhore </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Not to mention if parents are working and school gets out at say 3 and work gets out at say 5 by the time you get home and get dinner and go to any activities you have in the evenings... then there is bedtime at say 9:30   How much time have you truely spent with your child... Now if your child has friends they want to go play with their friends on the weekends, ect... so Is todays society saying that by the age of 5 when children enter school they should have all the ethics and such learned to last them the rest of their lives?? <br>
<br>
Todays society is different then that of a few hundred years ago or even a hundred years ago... heck even 50 years ago... Back then How much time did parents spend with their children, before school was manditory, before society told kids &quot;thin is in&quot; and &quot;Violence is the way&quot;  In our history children did fear a spanking they didnt need them often because they behaved and they knew if they got a spanking it would be a beating they would never forget... Today our kids get to school and are brainwashed so to speak by the time they spend away from their families, they are introduced to &quot;your parents cannot spank you its against the law so you have nothing to fear from them act any way you like&quot; and their friends share with them all the wonders of the world from sex to cursing,  <br>
<br>
So Why do I say its teachers responsibility to watch out for my child when my child is at school? I say this because my children when they get to school end up spending more time with teachers then with anyone else.  I spend time with my childrens teachers each week, either on the phone or in the classroom after school. I ask what is going on in their lives and communicate to the teachers what is going on at home. I check homework and meet my childrens friends parents. I drive my son when he goes on dates and pick him up afterwords. (hes not old enough to drive)  I do as much as I can to be active in my childrens lives. I teach them from their experiences and I work with their teachers to help them be prepared when they face the real world on their own. <br>
<br>
Spanking... well yes I have spanked my children, and will do it again, however I use this form of dicipline rarely and only when there is no other option... My children have not grown to be violent or mean, they actually are very gentle and loving people so far... and I hope to see them all grown up and still the same. <br>
<br>
How does EQ experience effect my children? Well when my children see something like KS-ing we talk about it and about the morals of it... we talk about ethics.. I am not one to BS with my kids, Im a strait shooter, I tell them strait up how life is and how to deal with it and not be part of the problem. an example, someone ks-es you dont go ks-them or shout in zone what a jerk they are for 30 min... /report them and move on... or ask them did you realize that was my mob? and move on... as for sexual content, I monitor my childrens play to protect them from child abusers and other trash, my children are well educated in the workings of the human body and sex ed.  we talk about relationships mostly and how to respect others, how to respond when someone says no... no means NO. those types of things... EQ gives us a chance to talk about peer pressure and such... <br>
<br>
Lots of good talks,  HOWEVER, My children and I do not hunt dragons together ect... (we only have one computer) I teach them the rules of playing the game, IE: NO KS-Ing <br>
<br>
I would rather have my child exposed to things in everquest with me there to talk to them and supervise them then have them go out in the big city alone and be faced with the same situation and be hurt because we never talked about it.  <br>
<br>
My children are very capable of traveling via city transportation and going places on their own, I do allow them to do such things, mostly because I monitor them so closely and we talk so much... if they go places in rl they call as soon as they get there and they have a time limit so I know they are safe, My son has his own cell phone in case of emergency.... there are many things I can do in rl, but I have more control when its in game...  Yes I have hopped on the keyboard and said &quot;hey this is a kid your talking to /report... <br>
<br>
as for kids playing the game. I have little patience for people who cannot play the game nice, ksing and training others is simply unexceptable! the children who are in my guild honestly conduct themselves better then some of the adults. They know we have expectatins of them and they know they must represent our guild well or they will be out of the guild... because we help our members learn the game and play the game better we believe that our guild is nothing with out its members, we support our members and a kid likes knowing that support is there, they like how we do things, and they dont wanna loose that.  We group with them, talk with them and teach them and if there is any question about their play style or what have you we dont invite them... yes we have turned down many people for their inability to play the game nice or correctly.  but if they are doing something wrong no matter what age, we still work with them, we do this because we dont want to run into them later and get killed because of them.<br>
<br>

<br>
I will say that I agree that kids should not spend all their time on the computer, my kids are both in scouts, and occasionally do sports when the season comes around of the sports they like, my kids also take gymnastics, and like hunting and fishing and being outside, but once a week they are allowed EQ time and it is limited... <br>
<br>
Same with Television time and playstation time.. all limited, <br>
<br>
Their chores include 20 min of reading per night, every night. And they are rewarded for reading not with allowance but for every 1000 pages they read they get to go to dinner to a place of their choosing, and if they read say 2000 pages they can bring a friend to dinner with them. I do know parents who offer simular rewards for behavior and homework, only using Everquest time, if you be good you can play, or if you get your school work done you can play...  <br>

Children will be sad that they hurt your feelings at first but once you start doing the same exact thing over and over again they catch on. They begin thinking to themselves &quot;Well, if I did this, I would only get the normal talk that I've heard my whole life&quot; so they do it. Same thing happens with spanking though once kids get older. So yes, it takes more than spanking. But to NOT spank your child would be weak on the parents part. You wouldn't be using all the child training tools you have been given. It's like eating a meal with a knife only when you have a fork and a spoon available to you. <br>
