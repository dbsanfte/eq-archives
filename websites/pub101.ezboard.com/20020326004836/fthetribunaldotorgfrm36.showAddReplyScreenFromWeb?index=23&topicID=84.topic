<br>
To focus on the original comment, only those who have fought for something can really appreciate that something. You have never felt more alive, until you were almost dead.<br>
<br>
Vietnam was fought for and won by the military. You show me one credible source that shows the US did not win one single battle(not skirmish's). The loss came from the politicians.<br>
<br>
That young man who went did because his country  either a; drafted him and he went because that is what a citizen does, or b: he went believing in the cause. You Merton are currently residing in a country excercising a freedom of speech that you never would have had in your entire life had your family stayed behind in bumfuckegypt or whatever pissant Russian oblast you come from.<br>
<br>
The domino theory applies very well to Vietnam. Veitnam fell, but what about the other countries in the region that didn't? Thailand(which is still fighting it's own communist insurgents), the phillipines, malaysia. Those countries very well could have been bought their time with the sacrifices of American lives in Vietnam.<br>
<br>
This bullshit you spout of American assistance not being sought is also smelly. South Vietnam asked for assistance back in '61. The US responded by sending in advisors of all sorts to assist in their 'internal' matter. North Vietnam also brought in their own advisors from the USSR, China, and N. Korea, although not in the same numbers. Had Kennedy not been killed and probably later impeached, the likelyhood of US involvement staying at advisory levels was great. Then Kennedy died and that asshole handmaiden of Satan Johnson came into power. If ever there was a person you should turn your bullshit attitude it is him. McNamara as well.<br>
<br>
A civil war has never been fought by just the immediate parties. Outsiders are always brought in, not because it's none of their business, but because they believe. As a piece of shit commie fuckface studying in college in the US(of all places) it is not surprising at all that you would adopt an isolationist attitude, ie it's not happening here so it's none of my business. If it's something that is happening on a nation state scale, you bet your ass it has repercussions for the entire global community. <br>
<br>
Have you ever noticed what happened to every other country that the US has fought and kicked ass? They are now prosperous members of the world community. Piece of shit communist/socialist/marxist/whatever countries are still trying to develop toilet paper that hurts less than sandpaper while other countries are able to focus their energies on important stuff, like flavorable condoms.<br>

I posted the quote because I liked it and it struck a cord with me.  Merton, perhaps, answered a few of the replies with too much venum, and offered an opinion where none was sought, and for that he should be slapped.  However, please in your responses, refrain from lowering yourselves to personal insults, it takes away from the argument/issue you might be making.<br>

I'm afraid I don't have my books on me, and I'm FAR too lazy to look up which countries : P<br>
<br>
However, I don't think there was really any significant outside support that actually made it to either side, since the North had resources to stand on it's own, and the South was looked at as too unlikely to win for outside countries to be willing to help.  That and I'm sure the blockade kept a bit of help out as well.

<br>
How was it exactly won when U.S. retreated and left South Vietnam to be overrun by communists?  Oh wait, you're blaming the politicians.  Then in that sense, there are very few countries who lost wars in the history of the world.<br>
<br>
Considering that the vast majority of the fighting in Vietnam was skirmishes, raids and guerilla warfare - your statement that U.S. did not lose a single battle (that wasn't a skirmish) is intellectually misleading.<br>
<br>
However, perhaps the Tet Offensive would be enough to demonstrate that the U.S. forces were defeated in something that wasn't a mere skirmish.<br>
<br>
Also, you should keep in mind that the VC and the NVA practiced guerilla warfare for the most part since they did not have the resources to operate with conventional war tactics.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should stick to subjects that you know, instead of calling others &quot;jackasses&quot; to &quot;bolster&quot; your point.<br>

I don't see how denigrating my origins has anything to do with the thread, more than likely it is another attempt by you at intellectual dishonesty that I find crass and juvenile.  Furthermore, I find that your constantly expounded &quot;American freedom of speech&quot; has serious limitations.  Furthermore, you should be aware of the fact that U.S. does not hold the monopoly on free speech, it is a basic right guaranteed to every human being as stated in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 (which, ironically the U.S. never signed, I believe).  Furthermore, I could be exercising the same type of free speech in my &quot;pissant oblast&quot; since Latvia is a westernized nation whose constitution resembles closely those of Western Europe.<br>
<br>
Also, the duty of the citizen is to be vigilant, it is not to be a pawn of the government to be tossed into some meat grinder of a war.  Since the government derives its powers from the citizens (at least in theory), the citizen has a duty to protest what he believes may be wrongdoings on the part of the country and not to participate in them if he chooses not to.<br>

Hmm, more insults in a vain attempt to discredit me and prop up your vacuous statements.  You know, you should consider the fact that not everyone who lived or was born in USSR was a die-hard communist.  It would explain such people as Andrei Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.<br>

How would me being a &quot;piece of shit commie fuckface&quot; relate to the fact that I would adopt an isolationist attitude?  You are stretching logic quite a bit here.<br>

Merton.  Tet was won by the U.S./South.  In fact the losses were so bad for the the Viet Cong that they ceased to be an independent organization (though always very closely allied with the north) and became simply an extension of the North's army.<br>
<br>
Every single attack launched during Tet was eventually defeated.  While it WAS a political blow (and a very serious one at that) the North failed to meet any of its military goals.  And in fact never again tried that kind of massive scale assault again while the U.S was directly involved.  (The same kind of political &quot;victories&quot; could be gained without giving the massive US firepower reserves such juicy targets)<br>

<br>
Glad you brought up Tet. Tet '68 destroyed the VC, after that even they were not even a minor factor in the rest of the war. Not even the NVA were able to effectively fight after that disaster. US casualties rose only when Johnson announced the policy of Vietnamization, and started the withdrawal. Going from a search and destroy mindset to a defend the enclaves, increased casualties amongst Allied troops who were not allowed to go out and recon their area's as much as before.<br>
<br>
-Furthermore, you should be aware of the fact that U.S. does not hold the monopoly on free speech, it is a basic right guaranteed to every human being as stated in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 -<br>
<br>
Damn, you got me there. Even in my beloved Bulgaria, which is a member of the UN, they had freedom of speech. It's just whenever you said ANYTHING that didn't agree with the party line, you were sent off the the re-education camps. <br>
<br>
Freedom of speech in the US is vastly different than it is in other countries. Not just east versus west, but America vs. the British Empire and her associates. The US may not have a monoply, but it sure does have the freeest(three 3's?) form around.<br>
<br>
