<br>
&quot;The question as to when a human person begins is a philosophical question — not a scientific question.  I will not go into great detail here,39 but &quot;personhood&quot; begins when the human being begins — at fertilization.  But since many of the current popular &quot;personhood&quot; claims in bioethics are also based on mythological science, it would be useful to just look very briefly at these philosophical (or sometimes, theological) arguments simply for scientific accuracy as well.<br>
<br>
Philosophically, virtually any claim for so-called &quot;delayed personhood&quot; — that is, &quot;personhood&quot; does not start until some point after fertilization — involves the theoretical disaster of accepting that the idea or concept of a mind/body split has any correlate or reflects the real world.  Historically this problem was simply the consequence of wrong-headed thinking about reality, and was/is totally indefensible.  It was abandoned with great embarrassment after Plato's time (even by Plato himself in his Parmenides!), but unfortunately resurfaces from time to time, e.g., as with Descartes in his Meditations, and now again with contemporary bioethics.40  And as in the question of when a human being begins, if the science used to ground these philosophical &quot;personhood&quot; arguments is incorrect, the conclusions of these arguments (which are based on that incorrect science) are also incorrect and invalid.&quot;<br>

I guess we should congratulating you, Wenin, it seems as if you think you know the answer when even Plato himself realized the fallacy of the argument!

- I strongly disbelieve any notion that a human fetus has a soul upon conception.  <br>

- I believe that by the time of birth a human fetus has a soul and is a human being.<br>

- Since I claim both of those to be truths for myself, then it is concluded that there must be a point of time that the soul is created during the pregnancy.<br>

I agree that it is a philosophical question.  One's philosophy shouldn't be imposed on another.  So wouldn't it be wrong to first claim that it is a philosophical question, and then claim that a soul exists within a human fetus upon conception?  Hayzen, this is one of those Straw Men, you were pointing out earlier.<br>
<br>
I don't need to have the existance of a soul to be scientifically proven for me to know that it exists within me.  I do need it to be scientifically proven to exist within a grouping of human cells for me to extend human rights upon them er... it.<br>
<br>
So you were saying?<br>
<br>
Just a side point of interest, nothing I'm presenting as my own idea:<br>
Did you know that there are people that believe that some people are born without souls?  It would be interesting to talk with someone that believes that, and would be interesting to talk to someone that apparently doesn't possess a soul. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Sorry, there is a difference between &quot;I believe in a soul&quot; and WHY you believe in a soul.<br>

You state your beliefs as fact.  You say a fetus absolutley does not have a soul.  You say this has bearing.

That makes no sense at all.  If something doesn't exist, then it must exist from the start.  Ummm yeah ok.<br>

Hayzen, I haven't stated my beliefs on the existance of a soul as a fact, outside of my own personal decisions.<br>

Kell, if you want to water everything down to the biology of it all, then you are left with the side of the arguement where a lifeform must be able to exist on it's own.<br>

<br>
You have to allow philsophy into the discussion, because our disagreements are based on philsophy.  You believe that humans have rights to be protected, the mere existance of those rights, all of our rights come from philosophy.<br>
<br>
There is something that seperates us from the animals of the world.  If there wasn't then we would be granting all animals with the same rights of man.  If you leave out philosophy from the discussion and only leave biology you are left with the following.<br>
<br>
Man is no different than any other animal in the world.<br>
<br>
Man has domain over other animals, because he has the ability to do so.<br>
<br>
In the world of biology, death is not wrong.  There are no morals within biology.  Morals and things being &quot;wrong&quot; are based in philosophy.  Granted there are some core beliefs that most humans hold, but these beliefs are grounded in philosophy still, not biology.  Killing another of your own kind is not wrong in many other species upon the planet.<br>
<br>
So if you wish to disallow philosophy, Pro-Lifers loose by default.<br>

<br>
Evidently, you were unable to grasp what I was trying to get at. I was getting at that if a soul DOES exist, and this IS the basis which we regard human life, it would have to exist from the moment of fertilization. <br>
<br>
Occum's Razor again. You cannot prove/disprove otherwise, but simply base this on some &quot;feeling&quot; or notion that you have, that a soul is not endowed upon a human being upon fertilization. You cannot simply pick some point in time along the way, that's completely illogical. <br>
<br>
Occum's Razor would demand that if indeed there were a soul, and we were to use this as a basis for human life, it would have to be at conception.  Until you can actually &quot;prove&quot; otherwise, which you can't, deductive, logical reasoning has to lead to that conclusion.<br>
<br>
That is what that quote from the article was about. This is why philosophers abandon the premise that a human becomes a person at some other point in time other than fertilization. This is why I told you to write philosophy books, if you think you can sell people on this notion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So if you wish to disallow philosophy, Pro-Lifers loose by default.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
While this is true in the broad context you are looking at it, I was trying to get at the fact that we cannot go by a particulair philosophy that states <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>when</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a human soul is endowed, or a human gets &quot;personhood&quot;. Since one cannot possibly pinpoint this event and time, one cannot use this particulair philosophical premise to base one's argument on. I did not say we should abandon all our core society's beliefs because of it though, which is what you took it as. I did not mean it that way. We, as a society, can still use our belief that human life is sacred and that every person, no matter at what stage of development, should have the right to live. It is a biological FACT that once fertilization occurs, a human being is created. <br>
<br>
I eliminated the inconsistent philosophical notion of a soul, not the core moral beliefs our society places on human life.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 450<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/27/02 8:35:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion, how many support this..</span><hr size=1> <br>
At p. 12 now that the debate finally hits the core of the issue, here's my 0.02:<br>
<br>
- The soul / flesh duality has led nowhere in philosophy, theosophy or metaphysics (if it had, we would also know what 42 is...(yes it is a reference to D. Adams)) The arguments have been rolling for thousands of years and no clear definition of life, and measure of it's value, has been made yet.<br>
<br>
- My very personal agnostic take on this is to ignore the soul and focus on sentience. A conscious sentient being possesses a rather unique quality : a perceived sense of ego. As far as I know, only humans, dolphins and chimpanzees have a sense of sentient ego (the recognition of their image in a mirror being one of my "meter tests", imperfect as it is).<br>
<br>
Based on this, a fetus is only a potential sentient being. Abortion, in this logic, does not destroy a human life, but rather the potential of a human life. This negates the argument of abortion being guilty of manslaughter. It does not make abortion morally benign though, it only invalidates its legal prosecution. In other words, if the conception was the result of a reckless conduct, moral responsibility would demand that the price of the mistake be paid and this potential of a sentient life be not wasted. The victim of a rape on the other hand would have morally legitimate reasons to refuse to realise this human potential. Again : this is "faith" and beliefs we are exchanging, rational argumentation can only go so far in this discussion.<br>
<br>
S.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS : I don't get your invocation of Occam's razor in regard of the existence of a soul.<br>
<br>
Occam's razor : if you have two answers to a question, the simplest of the two is the correct one (very bad idea to invoke in a philosophical argument...)<br>
<br>
I don't see how the eternal existence of a soul being incarnated into flesh at fertilization would be simpler or more complex than the creation out of the ether of a soul at the same fertilization moment. Include any variant, i still don't see what Occam has to do here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PPS : "This is why philosophers abandon the premise that a human becomes a person at some other point in time other than fertilization."<br>

Propaganda and blood and guts pictures are nice and all but it certainly does not reveal one's true opinion or support the person's cause. Such things have never stopped a war, didn't stop autopsies, doesn't stop smokers from smoking. <br>
<br>
Put some effort into facts, words, and sources, at the very least in addition to your pictures that you'll no doubt soon be passing out to kindergartners in an attempt to get their beliefs set in early. Cause otherwise, you just look like the local town loon that blindly follows whatever Pat Robertson tells him to follow.<br>

<br>
Kell, if it can't be proven one way or the other, then you are left with eliminating it from the picture completely.  You aren't left with stating it as a &quot;fact&quot; that it exists from the beginning.  How could you possibly ever state anything as a public fact if you can't prove that it even exists.<br>

So either you are left with allowing everyone to insert their individual beliefs, or you are left with removing the item from the equation completely.<br>
