<br>
Radgen, when you are the person responsible for UPHOLDING the law, you are doubly, triply responsible for not breaking it yourself.<br>
<br>
Members of Congress make law.  We are all bound by it, of course, but they are legislators, not executives.  It's bad enough when they break the law, but its much worse when the president does.  <br>
<br>
The president is, as Elche said, the Chief Executive.  If you don't know what that means, including all the ramifications, please go read a few books and educate yourself before posting here any more.  Can you trust someone to enforce the law if they break it themself?<br>
<br>
With authority comes responsibility... Clinton flagrantly abused his authority to hide his personal misdeeds and neglected his responsibility to the nation's citizens.<br>
<br>
You say the public didn't care - I agree, many didn't, and it was truly unfortunate and indicative of the low level of education and political insight prevalent in America today.  Only people who do not understand the presidency could ever be so apathetic.<br>
<br>
You say it doesn't matter, and that it happens all the time... that previous presidents were as bad or worse.  Show me a modern president who lied, in office, under oath, as blatantly as Clinton... or committed any other comparable offense... and was NOT called out for it.  That means from FDR forward, by the way...<br>
<br>
At least you could respect Carter.  Maybe all you care about in a president is their effectiveness in ramming personal policy preferences through Congress.  I find that attitude sickening, personally.  There is SO much more to the role and the job of the president - in fact, that aspect of their job was only very recently added to the repertoire when FDR put the Presidency on steroids.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Just thought I'd add... my respect for Carter has waned considerably ever since his recent Goodwill Tours of communist nations.  Buddy buddy with Castro, that's Human Rights Carter!!<br>

<br>
Better yet, say he bounces a check (a felony) does he warrant a resignation?   He was IMPEACHED for a lie about a PERSONAL matter that had nothing to do with either his job or public policy.  It was too much of an OVERREACTION for the offense.  I never said the offense did not deserve a response.  It most certainly did.<br>
<br>
And it is a little hard asking for another example of a President who has lied under oath, since This was the only time in modern history that a sitting President was forced to testify under oath in a court of law.  The closest I can come is Reagan's testimony about Iran-Contra after he left office.  I can't say if he was lying or not, but according to his testimony he was either lying or did not remember half of his term.  I don't know which is worse.  <br>
<br>
LBJ did not lie directly to congress, but he had advisors twist the Gulf of Tokin incident under oath, in order to get a justification for escalation.  This was not found out till after his death.<br>
<br>
Eisenhower and Kennedy had full knowledge of mistruths that were made by underlings, under oath, to congress.  Involveing Recon flights over Russia and The Bay of Pigs respectively.<br>
<br>
Notice a theme here?  These were all lies and mistruths, that involved US policy and the work of Government.  Not whether you were getting a BJ in the Oval Offices closet.  <br>
<br>
Oh and Cal.  You think that those who MAKE the laws do not have as much duty to abide by them as those assigned to execute them?  YOU are the one who needs to go back to school.<br>
<br>
They should BOTH abide by the laws.  And legislators ARE held accountable, for misdeeds.  There are a whole range of sactions, that congress can bring against members SHORT of removeing them from office.   Said tools are also useable against The President, (or any federal office holder in fact)<br>
<br>
Clinton's lie abotu his affair did not warrent an Impeachment.  Official sanction of SOME type, but not impeachment.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, this is small potatoes compared to his last few pardon's.  THOSE were unexusable in any moral or ethical sense, but since it was perfectly legal, I guess that was ok with you guys huh?<br>

No they were laughing at the President...The most powerful man in the world was caught with his pants down!...That right there is enough for me to call him an Idiot.<br>
<br>
And besides the &quot;sex&quot; scandal Clinton did tons of other crap that I would consider wrong for any president to do. The biggest, in my eyes of course, is selling weapon guidance systems to a hostile nation there for giving them the capability to launch a nuclear strike into the U.S. from there  home soil.  <br>
<br>
Clinton is one of those guys who no one bad mouths because they like how stupid he is. They know they can get over on him and everyone he knew did get over on him including his wife. The world was laughing behind his back because everyone knew he was a big dumbass.<br>
<br>
Oh and one more thing...If the leader of the free world...The most powerful man in the world...Bounces a fucking check then he should be impeached. Because if he cant balance his check book then how the hell do we trust him with an arsenal of weapons that can destroy the world? <br>

<br>
Sold a guidance system to China *shrug*  Reagan sold weapons to Iran, yet he is not pilliored.  I am not defending Clinton.  It was a bad idea, just like the Iran arms deal was a bad idea.  But it was a bad POLICY idea.  Nothing about either deal was illegal.  (Diverting the funds to the contras WAS illegal but that is a whole other argument)<br>
<br>
Impeachment is the &quot;death penalty&quot; of politics.  You don't use it to punish every wrong, because it is not appropriate except in the most SEVERE cases.  With the exception of a small handfull, ALL modern presidents have tried to get around the limits of executive power.  The worse case was Nixon, but Reagan, LBJ, Kennedy, Eisenhower were all guilty to a much lesser degree of the same thing.  In this Clinton is not unique, but HE is the only one being demonized for it.<br>
<br>
It is just as wrong to demonize only one sinner in a crowd of them, as it is to ignore the sinner because everyone else sins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone does it&quot; is not a valid excuse, but you can't just complain about ONE person and ignore the others either.<br>

However the guidance system sold to China are used for the specific reason of delivering long range strikes, which makes them a direct threat to the United States. If Clinton had sold china some SAM missiles it would be a whole different story.<br>
<br>
Perhaps he wasn't stupid...Perhaps he just played dumb to get what he wanted. The main difference between Clinton and the other presidents was that the other presidents made mistakes in American policy when they were trying to further American interests in foreign affairs. Clinton sold arms for himself...He in no way was pushing American interests when he did that. At least if the other Presidents were wrong they could always say in their view they were trying to do what was right for the country.

<br>
I am not standing up for Clinton in any way, but as a person who lives outside the USA it really worries me that a militaristic anti-environment puppet like Bush is at the helm of the world's superpower.<br>
<br>
I like the USA and Americans, but due to its power everything the USA does influences what happens in other countries (you have a recession, we have a recession ... you go to war, we send help, etc).<br>
<br>
Living under a conservative government that does Mr Bush's bidding in fear of losing out on international trade, I feel very much affected by who holds the US presidency.<br>
<br>
As soon as Bush came to power, the level of tension in the world started to build up and simmering conflicts started to boil over (well before 9/11). Warmongers in India, Pakistan and Israel are now mimicking his &quot;war on terror&quot; rhetoric to justify their aggression.<br>
<br>
I know that many Americans feel it's time to address home issues and that all this international reliance on the USA is unfair, especially with the hurt from 9/11. But it's like the biggest boat on the river -- some people love the sight and want to get on board, some people think it's ugly and want to sink it, others couldn't care less ... but everybody has to deal with its wake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uradgen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/02 4:02:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Democracy in Action</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Clinton sold arms for himself<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

And just where is the proof of this?  You can read minds all of a sudden?  Just what did he get out of the deal personally?  YOU may not think it was in America's interest does not mean that it was done for personal gain.  If China is NOT an enemy.  Not at the time of the deal, or now.  Iran at the time of that arms deal WAS an enemy.<br>
<br>
And I beg to differ on the weapons that were sold to Iran offered no threat to the US.  For one thing PART of the deal included spare parts and missle relaods for the F-14,s they had left over from the Shah days.  You don't think they could have caused a problem to our forces in the Persian Gulf?  How was that in America's interest?  It got some hostages in Lebenon released, but then encouraged more kidnappings and at what cost?<br>
<br>
It also included TOW missle launchers and missles.  These are heavy anti-tank missles, and one of the few that stand a good shot at knocking out an M-1 tank with one shot.<br>
<br>
Those weapons stood a far greater chance of being directly used against Americans, than any ballistic misslies from China.   In the end they weren't but that was because we never got to the point of a substantial direct military confrantation with Iran.  But there was a very real chance of such a confrontation occuring at the time those weapons were sold.  That made it a bad POLICY, just like the China sales were bad POLICY. <br>
<br>
<br>
You all can keep trying to turn logic into a pretzel, but the fact remains, Clinton did nothing worse than any other modern President (except Carter and Ford).  It does not justfy those wrongs in the least, but you can't single him out, and rationalize everyone elses wrong doing. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
One is a personal anti tank missile..The other is used to launch weapons of mass destruction thousands of miles into America's back yard. Can you see how comparing the two  is just not viable? I would rather have some anti American monger with a missile that can blow a tank up then with a missile that can blow a city up. Just ask yourself this...Which would you rather have a foreign nation with weapons that can hurt your military...Or a foreign nation with weapons that can destroy your country?  <br>
<br>
Both were bad policy just one was rotten while the other was sour....The Iran deal would have made a direct confrontation with Iran more difficult...Perhaps even very dangerous to American troops. The China deal would make a direct confrontation with China suicide, reminiscent of days when the M.A.D. understanding was reached between the U.S. and Russia. Unlike Iran which may blow up a tank with our weapons. We gave China the ability to blow up a CITY. That is why the China deal is way out of the Iran deals league.<br>
<br>
&quot;And just where is the proof of this? You can read minds all of a sudden? Just what did he get out of the deal personally?&quot;<br>
<br>
Clinton had many &quot;contributions&quot; to his campaign fund from Chinese officials. While these &quot;contributions&quot; were for the most part on the up and up they just happened to start flowing in after Clinton &quot;shared&quot; the inter ballistic guidance systems with China. You me and everyone, can put 2 and 2 together and see that something was not right there. But your right he was slick and always seemed to get away with it. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am not standing up for Clinton in any way, but as a person who lives outside the USA it really worries me that a militaristic anti-environment puppet like Bush is at the helm of the world's superpower.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Clinton was in office I am sure most people could say he was a &quot;anti military pro environment puppet&quot; While that looks great on paper, In reality many people died from that view. Bush is just pushing to get the military even partially to where it was before Clinton raped it. If Clinton proved anything its that you can't handle all your problems simply by talking nice to the people who dont like you.<br>

He has gone way beyond that. He has gone to emergency powers, detention without trial, offshore torture of prisoners and talk of pre-emptive nuclear strikes. He has even gone to &quot;greenhouse gases are destroying the world, but as long as we can make a profit we're not going to do anything about it&quot;.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I believe 9/11 was committed by Al Qaeda terrorists (unlike a lot of the crazy sites out there) and I am glad to see the Taliban gone.<br>
<br>
However, I also believe Bush could be accused of adopting 9/11 as his <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.barnsdle.demon.co.uk/hist/fire.html">Reichstag Fire</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. Remember he was &quot;elected&quot; without having a majority of the vote.<br>
<br>
Or in Star Wars terminology, his opportunity to get Jar Jar to propose emergency powers and create an army of the republic.<br>
<br>
To me, the response to &quot;greenhouse gases are destroying the world&quot; is to radically change your course, even at the expense of wealth and comfort. I place higher value on the wellbeing of the planet than on my own advancement and I am disgusted by people that are willing to fuck the environment for personal gain.

Emergency powers are an appropriate response to an emergency.  Should he attempt to keep these longer than necessary, well then that's another can of worms...<br>
<br>
I'd like to see where Bush has detained any American citizens without trial.<br>
<br>
Offshore *torture* of prisoners?  You mean Guantanamo?  That's so laughable it's sickening.  I would love to see any reputable source give evidence of torture beyond the &quot;sensory deprivation&quot; nonsense you posted earlier.<br>
<br>
Talk of pre-emptive nuclear strikes?  Yes... talk.  It's an option, and it's also an option that will not be taken.  I'm sure that the leaders of the United States like to examine all choices available to them, however, and see nothing wrong with talk.<br>
<br>
You're going WAY over the edge trying to compare Bush to Hitler.  (Close down the thread, Grozzer's made a Nazi reference!)  No matter how much you may dislike his policies, that's just ridiculous.  He was elected president, minus quotations, with a majority of the electoral college votes.  That's the way the system works.

Ever hear the phrase close only counts in horshoes and nuclear war?  We are still BOTH fucked.<br>
<br>
BTW the Clinton did not start the drawdown.  Bush Sr. did.  All Clinton did was continue a policy that was already in place when he took office.  It was not HIS idea.  It was a bi-partisan process.  The only cuts that got real complaints were for large weapon systems, and that had more to do with jobs than any concearn for military readiness.<br>
<br>
And the forces were not gutted.   It was for the first time in US history, a rather well thought out and planned drawdown.  There was nothing like the hollow unit syndrome like we had after Vietnam, korea, WW2, WW1 etc..   We no longer needed nor do we need now, the 2.5 million men we had in the military during the hight of the cold war.  We DO need  a few more now(or a lessening of the missions), but before we increase the manpower it needs to be restructured.  Our military is still to &quot;heavy&quot; for the types of threats and missions we now face.<br>
<br>
And don't forget part of the reason for the drawdown was the fact that there was no USSR sized threat(and still isn't), and we could no longer afford to keep such a huge standing military.   Deficiet spending cannot be kept up forever.  <br>

<br>
Almost the entire population of China lives in a demographic area the size of California.Until the arms deal the &quot;nuclear&quot; aged Chinese nation was only able to strike American soil with a nuclear weapon if it was launched closer to American shores. (like from a ship). They didn't have the technology to launch a missile into space and have it land on the other side of the world at all.<br>
<br>
This has always given the U.S. a tactical advantage of most other Nations. While many nations are nuclear capable only very few have the ability to strike with that nuclear power anywhere in the world. After the arms deal China became one of those nations. What makes China so dangerous is it's inability to sustain a long term war. Because its mostly an agricultural country it can not field the troops and feed them at the same time for very long. It at this point it could not handle a conventional war with the U.S.<br>
<br>
Which means that if we ever engaged China a nuclear war would probably ensue. Before the arms deal this war would have been short. Only a few nuclear missiles would have leveled the majority of China. That was a big enough deterrent to keep them from using their vastly inferior nukes which  they might not even be able to use on us because the might not be able to get a ship or a plane in range of American soil.<br>
<br>
With the new Technology they were given however...They could easily now launch a nuclear weapon into Chicago. How Clinton could even fathom this was ok is beyond me. He gave a potential threat the ability to strike us at any time any where....Iran may not like us and the arms deal was a bad idea however they were not given the ability to deliver those missiles to Americas back yard. <br>
<br>
Clinton did not create a nation that would be very difficult to fight like Iran. He created a nation that now has the power to destroy many many Americans. This was not the case before but it is now. We GAVE another player in the nuclear community a trump card. The first rule of thumb is you DONT give away your trump cards. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usolovey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solovey</A> at: 6/6/02 7:28:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1081<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/02 7:36:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Democracy in Action</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Offshore *torture* of prisoners?

<br>
Where the hell did you get that load of crap from?  Your post is so full of misinformation it is scary.  I don't even know where to begin.  <br>
<br>
First of all, China has had ICBM's since the late 70's.  Their reliability has always been suspect (and still is suspect) because they have not been able to do long range tests like the US, French, UK and Russia have.  They don't have a whole lot of them (somewhere around 50-200)   But they have enough.  Now they may be able to hit a specific area of a city as opposed to just the city but that doesn't matter much since the city will be gone.   And it is a little condecending to think that China can ONLY have gotten this ability by buying/selling the know how.  They have a large, technically capable community of engineers and scientists.  The main thing holding them back, is an lack of somwhere to really test thier missles over an extended range.  This is a problem they still have.  They don't have a target area outside of China that they can use.<br>
<br>
Also, its not like the intent of the sales was to help the chinese missile program.  The weapon sales to Iran were just that.  Slaes of weapons to a nation that was openly hostile to us.  The sales to china were not intended for military use, even if that was what they ended up being used for.  AND our relationship with china, while not warm, is not anywhere near openly hostile.  When you have ANY exchange of trade.  There is the risk of the material/info being used other than it was intended.  The USSR did this to us time and time again.  The Mig-17 owed its existence to the UK selling a jet engine to Russia.  The Russians first heavy (and nuclear capable) bomber was a bolt for bolt copy of the B-29.  Russia was constantly diverting &quot;civilian&quot; items, particularly computers, to military use through out the Cold War.  Hell their canceled shuttle program was almost a carbon copy of ours.  The incident with China is hardly unique.  Nor will it be the last.<br>
<br>
Also you need to take a long look at history again.  China has fought 2 VERY long wars in this century alone.  You are making the same mistake that we made in underestimating the Vietminese.  Vietnam is a primarily agricultral nation, but they sustained a war for 35 years.  China fought the Chinese for near 10 years bofore we even got into WW2.  The chinese civil war was close to 30 years old when it ended in 49.  Do not underestimate China's ability to execute a sustained war.  It is the will to fight, that determines how well a nation can sustain a fight.  Not whether it is a agricultural or indutrial nation.  It would not be far from the truth to say that WE are the ones who have trouble sustaining hostilities, not the Chinese.<br>
<br>
And one other thing.  Clinton did not make the sale to China just as Reagan did not make the sale to Iran.  The sales were made under thier watches, but it is a different type of responsibility.  Its not like Clinton personally ok'd the manifest.  All he did (along with congress, we don't live in a dictatorship afterall) was authorize the policy and guidelines for the sales.  It was executed by beauracrat, and they made a mistake(and admitedly, a dozy).  It MAY have been forseeable, or it may not have be.<br>
<br>
And again, Iran was a openly hostile country that we sold <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> weapons</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Our relationship with China is far from warm, but they are NOT an enemy or openly hostile.  We did not sell them <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> weapons</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, we sold them items that they used for in a way we did not intend.  Still not good, but not the same thing either.<br>
<br>
And have you looked at a map?  Are you really sure of that &quot;california&quot; statistic?  It looks REALLY suspect.  Of course if you got that from the same sourse as the rest of this manure pile, it would not surprise me. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
