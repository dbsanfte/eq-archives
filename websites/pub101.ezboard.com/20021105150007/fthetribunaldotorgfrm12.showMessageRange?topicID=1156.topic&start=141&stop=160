Id like to know. Because you have to kill 9 of the 12, which means you're gonna have to kill the pussies + aary + at least one triplet (or vyemm).<br>
<br>
Last time trans was in, we cleared it all, and came back when vyemm spawned to kill him. RNG/SI tend to kill AT LEAST one triplet (usually clearing them all) and usually vyemm. I dunno about AN, cuz thats not during my playtime, But I'm pretty damn sure they clear north too each turn.<br>
<br>
Wipeouts happen. Hell, trans usually wipes once or twice to aary still. when we killed vyemm for the first time 2 weeks ago, we wiped 3 times before killing him.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem (and I feel like im just repeating myself from other issues with lego) is the inconsistency to stay with the rules. So spawns will be fux0rd for one week (which the rotation will allow RNG extra time for), and patch will be next week. It will be an annoyance to rng, but I'm sure they'll live. I'm more worried about next time. If they didn't know (assuming Rynnia is lying about everything here... which I sincerely doubt considering it ties in with what I was told and tells I recieved) then next time there shouldn't be a problem... RIGHT? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uariarsagittar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ariar Sagittar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/20/02 5:32:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NToV is now FFA</span><hr size=1> Lying???

<br>
Day 1 of patch<br>
<br>
We send in trackers and at the time only Vyemm and Roy are popped (early morning EST).  As my understanding from people I'd spoken to in AN was that is was 48 from 1/2 or full pop (and what was told to me AGAIN the next morning from an AN officer I spoke to).<br>
<br>
We decide to do Tormax and Yelinak (who are both popped very early).  We engage Tormax, and get trained with Tormax's guards.  The person who trains us also decides it would be funny to hail Kyenka at the zone line to slow down our CR.  After 45 mins and petitions, we are ready to pull Tormax again.  The Kael Zone goes down.  Skyshrine ALSO goes down for an emergency fix to the key bug.<br>
<br>
Tormax repops immediately and we prepare to engage again.<br>
<br>
At this time, Shalita tells us that Rynnia said it was 48 hours from pop and that we needed to kill Roy to confirm our slot in the rotation.  This conflicts with the information that we otherwise had.<br>
<br>
Yes, Rynnia said it was 48 from patch up time in the tell he sent to us.  On the other hand, Rynnia also told us that in order to get a rotation slot we needed to kill Roy + all of NToV except Vyemm and Triplets on our FIRST run in the FIRST 48 hours or wait 2 more rotations to try again.<br>
<br>
This was completely different from what RNG, SI, and Trans told us, which was just kill Roy.  Even on the details we heard there were differences, with some saying we had 48 hours after killing Roy to ourselves, others saying we had 48 hours from when we started attempting Roy.  Funny how these well-defined and so clear an idiot can understand them rules work.<br>
<br>
Understandably, without any written documentation of the rules (Which Rynnia still insists we do not need) we wanted confirmation of this from the other Guilds in the rotation.<br>
<br>
What we wanted was an absolute clear definition of the rules.  Is this so hard to understand considering the disagreements over the entry rules?<br>
<br>
I sent a tell to Rynnia, and wasn't able to remain online that night.  Sorry I didn't send a tell the next day Rynnia, that was my fault.  I should have and I forgot.<br>
<br>
Day 2, we go into NToV.  That night we kill Roy, Dagarn, Fesh, Kreizenn, Koi'Doken, and Mirenella.  We didn't engage Nev or Jorlleag.  Yes, the Roy split took a while, we were short on monks who knew the pull.  It happens.<br>
<br>
Day 3, we enter NToV and AN is there.  We're told Rynnia had told them it was FFA.  After discussion, AN pulls out, but after they had already killed Vyemm.  We kill Nev and Jorlleag, start to clear to Triplets but had an unfortunate aggro from the x-roads (lots of mobs).  We call the raid as recovering the raid is unlikely due to repop, and the time to reclear would have pushed us very late.<br>
<br>
Day 4, nobody is in NToV, so we go in and attempt the Triplets as we've never killed them before.  We've never actually engaged the Triplets before, as our previous trips were spent mostly working out the pull.  Zlexak, Cekenar and Sevelak all die on the first Successful pulls.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would like to see the rules posted.  If they're so dam easy, then why would it be so hard to post a simple set of concise rules?  Put it in a public forum if you want.  As you said, it should be that simple.<br>

Talked with you a couple times, and gotta admit you have a valid argument. And just one thing, Unless you talked with Rynnia/Lilwee/Jhentar/Thinkness/Wildien, don't believe them, best bet. Like Rynnia said when told I stated 48 hours from full pop, I don't have the authority or the right to make that kind of decision. =p <p><HR>

He has 2 guards, one is bugged and wont aggro when you pull Aaryonar, and the other one comes only 50% of the time, split tank the pet, it takes 30 seconds at most to kill and get on Aary.  Jesus.<br>

These rules aren't complicated, and as stated many many times, we're never had a problem before.<br>
<br>
Roy pops, you go kill him, and any other dragons that are up. He's the only damn dragon in there that takes any kind of timing or real strategy, so even if you just kill him, even a guild new to North should be able to clear the required dragons on thier second day.<br>
<br>
Why do we want at least 10 of 14 dragons killed? So you don't screw up the guild thats after you with a hugely staggered spawn time.<br>
<br>
Thats it...someone wants to complain about time differences or something, talk to AN, they are probably the only high end guild on the Trib that could give me a good arguement about how the spawn time could completely fubar thier spawn. Yet they've never had a problem, and I've never heard a peep from or about them.<br>
<br>
Legendary, you seem to want to make this into an us vs. them thing. Thing is, we don't hate Legendary, we just don't want what you do on your turn to fuck up our turn. It's that simple. <p><table width="300" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#003366">

<br>
Um, that's how you do it.  We single pull Roy, drive through.  Takes less clerics, has less uncertainty, and is easier to control when done properly.  Tnx k la~<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought Legendary engaged Zlexak back when they first gimped Transcended's turn and wiped out to him.&quot; - Merton<br>
<br>
Getting Zlexak + 2 isn't engaging.  It's a pull gone bad.  Simple.  And wipes happen due to pulls gone bad.  Duh.  While I'm sure that with your superior pulling skills you've never done that, us mere mortals need to learn every particular pull.<br>
<br>
&quot;You guys backpedal good. Real good. I mean that is some grade A backpedaling.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow... you are REALLY stretching it Merton.  Are you Really SO desperate to come up with some excuse to flame, you can't even see how absolutely bereft of logic that statement is?<br>
<br>
Read the disclaimer... &quot;As I Recall&quot;<br>
<br>
IE, any errors in my recounting are due to my own perception/knowledge of the events.<br>
<br>
Have I EVER posted here before on this topic?  No.  Am I claiming to correct someone else?  No.  IE, my first and only post is completely consistent with every other post I've made on this topic... wait, I've only made ONE post!  Dam, amazing that it's consistent!  Would this be the backpedalling you're referring to?<br>
<br>
Oh wait!  I understand now... you're referring to this conspiracy you discovered when you cobbled together the clues from 10 or 20 people's different flameboard posts!  Clearly, they were ALL representing their guild; it's SO obvious now!  They ALL were working together to advertise their cover story to explain a set of events that took place a number of months ago!  And, amazingly, Shockingly, they aren't all Exactly the SAME!<br>
<br>
How could that have happened?  There must SURELY be some top level cover up going on!  There's absolutely no way that people could have heard different things, percieved things differently, remembered things differently based upon where they were, whether they were at that event or not, and whether they were actually officers involved in the decision-making process!<br>
<br>
No!  It must be some shoddy attempt at rehabilitating their guild's image on the server with some massive concocted story!  And obviously there must have been some incredible planning and co-ordination to get them all to post here.  Oh, but they CAN'T fool YOU!  Not with your keen sense of observation and brilliant analytical skills... you saw Right through their Master plan.<br>
<br>
Or... maybe you should stop trying so hard to analyze a bunch of flameboard posts as factual data in order to stir shit.  Spend your brainpower on something more constructive.  <br>
<br>
But wait!  This is the flameboard, which gives you complete license to act as irresponsibly as you like, say whatever you like, act as stupidly as you like, and do it without any consequences or repercussions.<br>
<br>
Unless of course, your posts take on such a consistently vitriol-filled tone that what few valid points you have made in other threads (and you DO occassionally make some valid observations) appear to be nothing more than the rantings of a bitter, hateful person who has nothing better to do with their productive lives than try to spout about how so many people they meet are loot whores, backstabbers, and liars, and how you were oh so bitterly cheated and wronged so many times by so many people.<br>
<br>
Then of course, people Might discount your opinions and see your posts as being a reflection of Merton, the person and player.  Not that this would ever happen... I mean people don't REALLY take the flameboard seriously do they?  Nobody actually thinks that people who act constantly angry and outraged on the Flameboard are the same in game.  People don't actually lose friends over flameboard posts do they?  That doesn't Really happen does it?<br>
<br>
Oh wait... maybe there are consequences...<br>
<br>
Stick to what you're good at Merton, which I assume is playing a monk.<br>
<br>
Of course, I'm not sure that I expect that to happen either.  <br>
<br>
Most likely, you'll come up with another Brilliant defense of why you're free to expound upon your viewpoint, probably involving extensive use of /quote, a creative use of cussing, and broad generalizations about anyone and anything who happens to be on your hate... er, hitlist.<br>
<br>
Of course, this will be done while conveniently ignoring that your source material comes from a Flameboard, but why would that bother you when you can use it to buttress another claim that there's some massive conspiracy that you've seen through Yet again, why pass another opportunity to lash out at people who you barely know, why not use it to show people how much more Integrity and Honor you have.<br>

Of course, 'their way' will ironically result in them being fucked out of all of the ntov spawns.<br>
<br>
Maybe legendary is getting a harder requirement than other guilds to join the rotation. I don't know. Personally, I think that for fucking it up multiple times now, they should have to work harder for it. But none of the leaders/officers of the rotation can say that, because they'd be oppressing the swarm...er, little people. <p><center><font size=2><font color=ashen><u><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101490>Baron Pren, Human Grandmaster</u></a> on The Tribunal Server

<br>
The implication you are making is that you need multiple monks to do the Aary pull.  This might be quite a shocker to you but the whole Aary pull boils down to a bard putting an Eye of Zomm into the pit to watch for flurry drake roamers, the monk running to the top of the steps, heaving a javelin into Aaryonar and running back.  Half the time Aaryonar comes with one pet, in which case you have the MT go defensive right away and start tanking Aaryonar as everyone else and a previously assigned secondary tank gets on the pet with all the other melee.  I dont know how much HP the pet has, but its some ridiculously low amount, maybe 30k-40k hp.  He dies under 30 seconds if even that long.  After pet is dead, assist the MT.  If you cant split tank a mob that melees for 290's, is slowable and has the HP of a kunark dragon, then you seriously need help.  This isn't fucking rocket science, but for the Legendary monks, maybe it is.<br>
<br>
Here's another shocking tip for you, you dont need multiple monks for ANYTHING (except Triplets) in NToV, everything in there with exception of Triplets can be pulled easily by a single monk.  As for triplets, it is possible to split them and get a single with one monk, but I used a Paladin to tag off me just because I didnt want to waste time trying to work the split.<br>

<br>
Did you retards pull him into the hall right outside the Triplet room?  Because thats the only way you could have trained the entire raiding party with multiple triplets.  Legendary monks, brace yourselves for this one as well.  When you pull Triplets, you will know if you have more than one even before you reach the first ramp leading down to the T intersection.  I mean, you dont actually pull them to the hallway just outside the triplet room, do you?  Do you...?  <br>

Look at the list of some of the excuses that Legendary has given.<br>
<br>
Back in June when they jumped Transcended.<br>
<br>
&quot;We didnt know&quot;<br>
&quot;We were practicing flurry drakes&quot;<br>
&quot;We were trained&quot;<br>
&quot;We took the named mobs to penalize Transcended for training us&quot;<br>
<br>
Legendary's &quot;official&quot; story changed at least 5 times before the whole issue was finally beaten into the ground.<br>
<br>
Nowadays<br>
<br>
&quot;Nobody told us the rules of the rotation&quot; <br>
&quot;Rynnia and SI are out to get us&quot;<br>
&quot;We thought we had 48 hours from half/full pop<br>
&quot;Aeadiin told us it was 48 hours from full pop&quot;(which was a blod faced lie, btw.  He never told you such thing)<br>
&quot;RNG and SI wouldnt give us a fair shot At Aary&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
And on and on and on, etc.<br>
<br>
Same fucking shit, no one takes responsibility, no one is held accountable, just a bunch of Legendary members dumping blame wherever its convenient, cause God knows you guys could NEVER be at fault.  Right?  Riiiiight....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Why dont we ever hear Legendary excuses like....?<br>
<br>
&quot;We just plain suck ass&quot;<br>
&quot;We are grossly incompetent&quot;<br>
&quot;14 clerics wasn't quite enough&quot;<br>
&quot;We didnt zerg it right this time&quot;<br>
&quot;Its not a wipeout if we camped a cleric&quot;<br>
&quot;We wanted to kill Velious ubers and then clean up NToV, have our cake and eat it too&quot;<br>
<br>
Laotzu, I dont mean you specifically in regards to backpedaling, I mean your guild as a whole since beginning of June.<br>
<br>
Legendary backpedals all the fucking time, its amazing.  The average Legendary member's tolerance for bullshit must be astronomical, cause I already start to retch every time I see your guildmates offering up more excuses and half assed explanations.<br>

Knew what pulls?  Other than the triplets, Dagarn and Koi, it's all rooted.<br>
<br>
Druid can pull it all except for the triplets (bind outside, gate out, SOW, zone in, COH, pull.... sow makes it very easy.)   Nice excuse, though.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as splitting Aaryonar off from his pet(s), you only have to split one pet.    Even if you have to zerg aary + 1 pet and die once, it shouldn't push the raid to a 6 PM killing of Aaryonar.

We single pull Zlexak out of the three with only one monk.<br>
<br>
Who cares how you split them, or how many people you use to split.  Just takes time to work a split on a new mob.<br>
<br>
As for Roy, I got there late, and the only monks there other than me were 59, 57 and 56 (at the time).  Yeah, sure, chuck a jav and see how long most monks with those levels survive the pull.<br>
