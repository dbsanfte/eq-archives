<br>
The complaint is that you ignored the list when someone did sign up, and fubared thier attempt.  They got together, started fighting thier way to Nagafen, and then found out he wasn't up on the way there.<br>
<br>
Sign up for them and take yer turn like all the other people here; if noone is signed up for them, kill them.  Let us know when you do so we can keep the spawn time correct, so that other guilds can plan accordingly.  If that was your plan, then every would be happy; killing them everytime they spawn, and ignoring this list is going to have a bit of an adverse effect on your rep...<br>

I work Day Shift, and I'm an insomniac, no excuse, but thank you for pointing it out *blush*.  Pyro's original post and the reason we did what we did is to prove that we DO have the capabilities.  I'm mean, if someone came on and posted that they wanted to kill Nagafen with 9 people and requested a spot on rotations there would be a few different responses:<br>
<br>
1.)  Ridicule.....People would blow us off or claim we're full of shit lookin for attention.<br>
<br>
2.)  Condenscension.....people would put us down for bein &quot;L3WT WHORES&quot; and say we should be fair about it and take a decent sized raid or go kill something else, give the &quot;majority&quot; the opportunity to do it.<br>
<br>
3.)  Anger.....people would say we are tryin to make fools out of the other guilds doin Vox/Naggy and NOT killin them and we'd be throwing it their faces that we did it with so few, or they would probably just refuse us our chance outright.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we screwed your rotation up......but look at the statistics, NO ONE was taking them down...it was failure after failure after failure....Vox....4 MONTHS....No Kills, and ya know what? She dropped the Shittiest Loot Table Drops...&gt;NO RBB&lt;  &gt;NO BOOK&lt;....we got the bard scale and 3, yeah that's right, fuckin THREE of those Damn Spears.  Does your guild REALLY want to gather for all of that, die numerous times, have a lengthy CR afterwards for the pit people and end up with 3 of those damn spears? HELL, She didn't even drop a WR bag.  We got lucky the 2nd time she fell, 2 bags, still no RBB, 1 Scale, No BOOK, and a couple of Gems.  Sapphire and Star Ruby I Think....not absolutely sure about the Ruby.  We killed a Crap Loot Vox with Nada on her, we then killed another Vox and YOU Never even Noticed the FIRST ONE.  Thats how often you all are in there checking on her and planning raids, she was down for a WEEK and no one even registered that she wasn't spawned.  You noticed Naggy, but that's cause a guild went in to break FG's.  Otherwise, if not for that ONE guild, no one would have noticed.  Honestly, I'd count my blessings for not having to do all that work for 3 Crystalline Spears.  I'd be thanking the guild that DID take her down and tell them i felt sorry for them about the loot turn they happened to get out of the way.  Btw&gt;....on Naggy, the first of 2 times we took him, it was crap loot as well, and 2nd time...well, wasn't as bad, but he stilld didn't have all that Uber Loot you all are complaining about us stealing, I sure as hell don't have a CoF yet.<br>
<br>
Now, if you are all done with the &quot;Bitch Session&quot; as Daeja so Very well put it, if anyone is interested in Joining us on one of these raids sometime, well.....you got Pyro's name and you can always post here, we check in frequently, we'll notice.<br>

Then again, in the meantime, it was noted that this list was created to avoid guilds jumping ahead of you, being trained as you prepare to pull, etc. The same person telling us this story is knowingly ignoring this list. Wonder how surprised he'll be when it all starts happening again ...<br>

<br>
Why is it the only people posting ANY negatives on this are all like 55+?  could it be that thier guild lets them tag along for FG's/IG's and lets them roll on Dragon loot cause of it? now that there is another guild doin this and doin well WITHOUT the higher lvls, you can't get away with it so much.  Jay, what lvl are you again?  Like 58 right? Go find a guild that takes out Gore and friends and STFU.  Prich.....errr....Prach, it's time to get over yourself.  Others, I think most of this is a misunderstanding of what we were trying to do.  We have opened ourselves to ANYONE that wants to help, but like any guild, we have loot rules.  The simple fact is that we are killing the dragons when no one else seems capable of doing so.  Look at your own records, Vox went for 4 months without a death, then you all threw a fit cause we killed her...TWICE.  Naggy was about a month between each death, with at least 3 or 4 wipes at a time, then you throw a fit cause we kill him...TWICE.  We didn't wipe, we didnt' fail, we went in, we Killed them, We Left....'nuff said.  If you have a lvl 52 and want to join us, send a tell to Pyro and we'll see what we can work out.  If you Don't have a 52, get over it, you've failed and failed and now we aren't and you are just pissed cause we are doin what you can't.  We aren't special, we just plan it out and do it right the First time.  And yeah, I'm 49, but not for long, I'm currently an Inductee, with a Temp Tag.  I could still get booted, it's not easy to stay in this guild and i'm workin my ASS off to stay here.  If you want to try, I wish you the best, i'm just worried about my own tag atm tho.  BTW...I was 48 Yesterday and will prolly be 50 tonight.  Levels aren't hard to attain and I Have been given a time limit.<br>
Things haven't been handed to me that I haven't earned. <br>
<br>
SO....if you dont' have anything Productive to offer this Thread, go post something on the flameboards somewhere about how your Momma grounded you and you can't play tonight, if you are interested in getting these dragons to die again on a regular basis, help out, sign up, and talk to Pyro.<br>

Hello, umm pretty sure your gimp brigade has been the one that has resorted to petty personal attacks on the person who volunteers to run this board. <br>
<br>
I hate to break this to you, but no one gives a flying fuck that you can kill vox with 9 people or whatever number you long winded losers brought. No one is jealous cause you people are farming pally epics or getting leet kavruul's mystic pouches so umm....you get over yourself.<br>
<br>
There has been a serverwide agreement for the last two years regarding these two dragons. Is the agreement antiquated? Yeah maybe a bit. But until its decided that everyone will not follow this agreement, it still stands. All your guild had to do was post &quot;We are going to attempt -insert dragon here-&quot; and then post &quot;We have killed -insert dragon here-&quot; but you didn't, and in the process fucked another guild over. Congratulations you're selfish bitches, welcome to the server, please have a seat beetween Arcibu and Alexandr.<br>

And you people have the fucking balls to &quot;attempt&quot; to flame Prachlyn? I've known him for about a year and although elfbitchy, hes still a damned good guy. And I use the term &quot;attempt&quot; loosely. Haahaa SNL computer guy...good one...<br>

Even if it were just a post that stated &quot;we're taking Vox and/or Naggy, deal with it&quot; ... while rude, at least that would have let other guilds know that (a) the mob they were preparing to take down isn't there, and (b) they have competition for the mob.<br>

Pyro did two things when he decided to make a public post: 1) Make aware to the public that FoV was killing the dragons and 2) FoV was going to continue to do so, considering that they were proclaimed FFA right after PoP; and you could either join FoV or try to compete.<br>
     First of all, for all of you who think that EQ isn't a competitive game, you are wrong. I'm honestly shocked that I even heard someone say such thing.  Day by day we witness the KSing and total domination by so-called &quot;uber&quot; guilds, and that is only the beginning.  For ALL of you who feel that this game isn't competitive, you are either twelve years old or have managed to do absolutely nothing with your lives.  I attend a rather prestigious law school (of which will remain nameless) and am very active in the world of politics, and let me say, the competition that floats around EQ is almost worse than that which I experience in my day to day endeavors.<br>
     Secondly, Vox and Naggy are FFA as far as I'm concerned.  As was mentioned in a few posts, the only people bitching are the ones who have nothing to do BUT bitch.  It was stated shortly after the release of PoP that dragons were FFA. And now the board and server (which in this case is really only one person) pull a complete 180? I'll be damned if I sit and watch hypocrites complaining.  <br>
     Last but not least, WE (FoV) are a guild of approximately 52 level characters.  WE are not uber, but we get things done.  WE enjoy ourselves.  WE like each other and boot the people who can't play as an integral member of the team.  And above all, WE like Pyro.  WE have succeeded thus far because Pyro has let us to victory.  I have been a member of the Vagrants, and yes, a member of Prachlyn's guild; and never have a run across such a fine leader in EQ as Pyro. He knows what to do, he has people willing to take advice (not commands), and he gets things done with as few people as possible.<br>
     Goodnight, and may God bless America. <br>

<br>
fellowship of vindication has failed to meet these 2 requirements..as such, regardless of the fact that the dragons themselves were FFA, fellowship of vindication has acted counter to the regulations prachlyn has set up to ensure that guilds wishing to attempt these dragons get an honest shot.<br>

First of all, did I know about this schedule?  Yes, but I will admit I honestly had no idea whether or not it was still updated/followed.  The very few times I have come to check, the dragons have both been ffa.  Also, I didn't believe that Vox hasn't been killed in three months, that seems a long time for good loot to go unclaimed.  Obviously I was wrong, and I apologize.  I do see reason for these schedules, as I would hate to see the dragons start getting killed as soon as they're up by the same people over and over again.  So Pyro, yes, I think you probably should have posted here that you were going to do it.  That being said, it's so uncommon that it's ever actually done, that even if he had posted here first he most likely would have been the one to do it.  (I believe that Vox was still ffa at the time we killed her though.)<br>
<br>
That being said, I have a lot of respect for Pyro.  I agree he kind of came off sounding like a jerk in his first post, but he's not.  My first ever attempt on Vox was a pick up raid to help a bard get her epic piece.  I didn't want any loot, just the experience of watching a dragon die  (though I love dragons so it was kind of sad too lol).  24 people, and we tried twice.  The first time a pet somehow managed to agro on Vox and we wiped.  The second time, we had level 65 clerics/enchanters come in to buff and help clear the way, and we still wiped, though we managed to get her down to 20% before the last person went down.  Both times nasty cr's.  The next day I sent a tell to the bard asking if she was still trying, she said she hadn't been able to get the people together but another guild was and I might be able to join.  So I sent Pyro a tell, and he said sure, get your resists up and you're welcome here.  I went to the bazaar, got some resist gear cheap (I'm talking under 100 pp here, not uber in any way), borrowed some gear off a friend (again, not much, I barely was over what he asked me to meet), and joined them.  I was immediately impressed by the entire raid, and it was so refreshing to be with a group of people who were so incredibly organized, and who listened to the raid leader without questions.  There were 14 people that time (I think) and I remember telling friends I was talking to at the time that we would probably wipe but it would be fun anyway.  Vox went down without a hitch, and only two people died.  Pyro then gave the one scale that dropped to the bard who had tried to organize one the night before, and a wr bag to a monk who wasn't in the guild.  I still don't know how he managed to do it with so few people, I can't think of that one thing that was different than the night before with 24 people.  In fact, we had less buffs on (c3, aego, and the rest were only what we 52 and under could provide).<br>
<br>
I told Pyro that I was impressed with them, and if they wanted any help later to give me a shout and I would be happy to help.  He sent me a tell when they did Naggy.  I think there were 12 people when I did Naggy with them.  Again, everyone was so organized and knew exactly what they were doing.  They also weren't greedy, when a necklace dropped that a wizzie not in the guild could use, the necklace was given to him.  After Naggy died (I found Naggy harder than Vox, but maybe because I didn't have a bard in my group for Naggy), I was given a share of the loot as well, even though I had told Pyro that all I wanted was the experience and didn't expect any loot at all.  I don't think if I had attended that raid with any other guild I would have been offered that much.<br>
<br>
One other thing I want to say is I think the fact that he can organize raids with so few people that turn out so well is a huge bonus to me.  On a raid with 40+ people that worked well(though I have heard of 40+ people wiping on Vox), I might be able to throw in a couple of heals, help buff at the beginning, but not much else.  (Of course, I've only been on 3 dragons raids now, two with this guild and one a wipe, so who knows, but that is always what I expected when I decided I wanted to do a dragon raid.)  With 12 or 14 people, I came out of the raid not saying to myself: &quot;wow, I watched a dragon get killed&quot; like I thought I'd be saying, but &quot;wow, I helped kill a dragon&quot;.  I honestly felt that I made a difference.  I know I saved at least one person who was at 2% life when I managed to get a heal off on him.  It was such a great feeling coming out feeling that I had helped kill two dragons, and that the outcome might have been different (at least for one or two people there) if I hadn't been there.  That feeling was worth more to me than any of the loot that Pyro could have offered me, and for that I want to thank you.<br>
<br>
Would I raid dragons again with Pyro if he asked me?  Yes, I would jump at the chance, though out of respect for the members here, I would want to see the schedule followed.  As for the schedule, I think it's great, and like I said I see why it's here, but on the other hand, go take a look at the recent posts on this board.  There is a very long thread about why no one is killing dragons, somebody even said that he hopes that somebody does something to rekindle interests in the dragons.  Well, Pyro did.  And no, he didn't do it the way this board dictates he should, but he did it.  The dragons are once again being killed and looted.  Even if he was doing it for his own personal greed, if he didn't do it, who would?  Should we let Vox sit another 3 months without getting killed?  Sounds childish to me, the whole &quot;if I can't have it, no one can&quot; attitude.  Yes, I agree he should be posting it here, even if he doesn't agree with it, out of respect for the many members who do still use the schedule.  But I also hope that he continues to kill the dragons when he has the chance and helps people who might not otherwise be able to get their drops.  My two cents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daeja>daeja</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://web.ecomplanet.com/SPEL2810/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/SPEL2810CustomImage0538196.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Princess Cootapappy</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/03 7:00:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/SPEL4787/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/SPEL4787CustomImage0253217.gif width=140 height=182></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the hell is this? -Opportunity</span><hr size=1> Pyro said:<br>

Keep in mind that many people have more than one character. I personally have a level 51 paladin who doesn't look to be leveling anytime soon, and I have been thinking about slicing a dragon with her nifty sword.<br>
<br>
And finally, some people are commenting because ultimately - this is their server. I think we all just expect some common courtesy. <br>
<br>
I still think that if you had approached this issue differently, this would be a more civil discussion instead of a pissing match.<br>

Pyroticator is a flexable guy, although he came across strongly, i'm sure in the future he will choose to post when we are killing, and have killed naggy and vox, to be a little more courtious to those who choose to go after them at some other time.  I think the point of this thread, was actually to let people out there know we are here to help them, with epics, or just if they want the experience of a dragon raid before they move on in levels.  We want your company, all you need to do is talk with us, but we do agree to post about the dragons. I just want everyone to know we are not here for farming dragons, we're here for fun, and to help those in need, so again, please understand us, this argument is not needed.<br>
