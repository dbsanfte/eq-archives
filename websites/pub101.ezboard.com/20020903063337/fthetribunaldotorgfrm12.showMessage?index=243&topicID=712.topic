<br>
If i where in there shoes i would not make arrangements for every guild on the server to have weeks on end to learn the zone while they sat around. A certain show of ability relevant to the zone is not unreasonable. <br>
<br>
Will be interesting to see how it plays out over time, but hopefully it will end up with most of us enjoying this game we have so much time and effort invested in.<br>

Such as pulling mobs through people's fights and training each other, etc.  I can't see N-ToV being done by 2 guilds simultaneously so there is no way that 2 guilds could share the mobs there nor would they want to I would think.  The first to start fighting in N-ToV gets the whole pot of gold.<br>
<br>
But hell, figure it this way, EV finally cleared N-ToV on Labor day last year, I think Comps cleared it a month or 2 later, so E/V has been farming it for almost half a year (jesus christ, time fucking flies) and Comps been doing it for 4-5 months I guess.  You can't seriously expect that you would be able to keep the monopoly on it forever.  Sooner or later you would have to share, work out a rotation, go FCFS or FFA or whatever.  I really would hate to have N-ToV become a rotation based zone because you know just as well as I do that if SI is allowed into rotation, there is a bunch of guilds that will also ask for it as well, and clearing N-ToV once every 6 weeks just because you got a 5-6 guild rotation would absolutely suck ass.<br>
<br>
So, I dont know what is the best solution, but at any rate I foresee a lot of grief and bitching over this.  We've been fairly fortunate in terms of crowding as compared to other servers who have a 4-5 guild rotation on N-ToV already or 1-2 AoW capable guilds on their server scrambling to kill anything as soon as its up.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Send me a tell in game!</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 1:56:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://people.ne.mediaone.net/pretzhere/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> There is no reason to threaten the people in the rotation. As it's been pointed out we have the equipment and experience to clear the zone in about 8 to 12 hours. <br>
<br>
It's hard to explain just how difficult ToVN is to an unprepared raid group. One yard trash drake has the ability to cause you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hours</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of CR time and corpse summoning. Our first several attempts we had keal armor and sleepers weapons and it took many days to even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> try</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to clear the zone. Takes weeks to learn enough about it all to even clear it. You would have to beat us there and win at your rolling several times just to clear it once. And you'd be wasting alot of time while we fight it out. It only takes us one &quot;win&quot; to clear everything left. That means Vulak loot without the hassle of clearing. WTG, us!<br>
<br>
These threats are all very amusing, but in the end we still win. Like I said before, your best tactic might be more serious ass kissing and less bravado. You say you have nothing to lose, but it just isnt true. No one likes to be beaten repeatedly. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

<br>
No I have not directly spoken with EV, but the member of Companions I spoke with said that they had already discussed this with Mojak.  I'll send him a tell at the earliest possible time.<br>
<br>
Yes it does end up that SI will technically be attempting this on The Companions' turn, and I trust that they will abide by what was discussed, and I appreciate how quickly and easily something was agreed upon.<br>
<br>
It's not so easy as &quot;yeah SI is in the roatation.&quot;  SI has to demonstrate that they are able to accomplish certain things before this holds true, and within a certain timeframe, or SI loses their shot and has to wait a couple more weeks before trying again.<br>
<br>
Seemed intelligent.  Seemed logical.  Seemed fair.   And it sure as hell is alot better than Saturday.<br>
<br>
As far as all of this speculation on what would happen were guilds to just fight over the spawn as was done on Saturday...  Basically if a GM is not present to verify who had a &quot;force&quot; present first, then the GM has to make a decision based upon the stories told by both sides.  If the stories conflict, or it is too difficult a call to make, the GM will (and it may vary between GMs) sit there while the 2 or more conflicting parties work it out.  If a resolution is not reached the GM will simply remove all conflicting parties from the zone and put a ban on them (from the zone) for as long as the GM decides.   Had no agreement been made (IE: no duel took place and Mojak and myself had not budged) this is what the GM said would happen.<br>
<br>
Clearly that is a waste of everyone's time, and it benefits everyone to work together to find amicable solutions without GM involvment, because if the GM is forced into a decision where there is no apparent solution, everyone loses.<br>

Seriously, talk to Mojak, get in the TOVN rotation &amp; crap, and then start bringing up ideas for a massive guildwar in the commons.

Typical situation removes both parties from the zone for a duration if they cannot work it out.<br>
<br>
GM rolling on it only encourages the situation to keep happening, and more work for the GM in the future especially if a roll is expected.<br>
<br>
GM will allow a roll if both parties agree, though. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhazewire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hazewire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 8:19:35 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> nerf rynnia.<br>

Once again being the outright hypocrites they are.  Thought I'd dig up my favorite Loegan quote again:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We may not be angels but we are straight shooters. I bet you we have ten times the respect on this server than you and you guild of con artists will ever have.<br>
<br>
You want to feel proud of running a guild this way? Be my guest. Believe me, you are only hurting yourselves and proving what others have said to be true. Reputation is everything in EQ - believe it. <br>
<br>
Remember that day a few EV were kiting Klandicar around in WW while you guys were prepping? That was fucked up and I told the guild that. My motto is &quot;Loyalty above all else EXCEPT honor&quot; and it makes no difference if it is EV, if it's fucked up I'll say so and let the cards fall where they will.<br>
--Loegan<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So what you say to this Loegan?  I brought that gem to light in the Anhur/Aluvinn thread where they stole spawns from people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> already actively engaged in clearing it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  That doesn't matter unless it's EV who's engaging it though eh fellas.  Also from that thread:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> zone is FFA... if you can't deal with that,<br>
go to fucking sebilis. <br>
...they confront us about it and whine that its a camp. first off, the zone is FreeForAll.<br>
--Aluvinn<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for the KS. Tough luck. Supprised they didnt invite me =\ We would have taken the next camp you moved to just for bitchin.<br>
--Herely<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fact is -- until mobs start dropping deeds - no one owns land in everquest...normal blue server subculture recognizes camps in most cases but it wouldnt hold up to a GM.<br>
--Nupe<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yep, rules to live by...unless it happens to you.  Then out the door with em, time to CoH passed everyone and claim the zone as your own because you broke it a year ago!  That makes perfect sense to me uh-huh.  Seriously, do you people not see the 180 degree turns you make at the drop of the hat when it's your guild that's in the wrong?  Apparently not, you'll find some way to claim righteousness.  Quote the pnp word for word when it works for you, lay claim to some 'rotation' and cry foul when it doesn't.  Always the victim.  Lastly, this post cracked me up:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Last I checked no one person, group, or guild could lay claim to any camp or zone according to PnP policies. Therefore, you can take your little rotation system and shove it up your ass. &quot;<br>
<br>
Hey Gonzaga, it's called having a little fucking courtesy, but I guess you've never heard of that before. <br>
--False<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah False, like EV's heard of it.  You used www.dictionary.com didn't you?  All about respect alright, or rather the lack of it.  Treat others as you would like to be treated...steal spawns from other people and then when spawns you're not even camping become threatened you pull gimp tactics then come <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> whine</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about it on a board.  That doesn't bother EV though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We wouldn't find it so funny if you didn't come here whining about it. That's what I find funny. I don't goto your board whining about how someone stole my camp n shit. I never do, suck it up, IT'S A GOD DAMN GAME JACK ASS!<br>
--Cecel<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oops...that sounded hypocritical as well.  Thanks guys, once again I am amused.<br>
