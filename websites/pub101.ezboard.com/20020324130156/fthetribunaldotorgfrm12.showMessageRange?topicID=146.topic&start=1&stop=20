A joint raid was suggested. Then we were notified that last time MHB went to Hate they had 50 people. Well Baraden and i were communicating through emails and both agreed that 13 groups in Hate would be just too many. So I said EH would bow out and let MHB have the plane and we would raid else where. Baraden also said if there were some people that were at the spires and could join them. Baraden and I thanked each other for working out an arrangement.<br><br>I got home from work at 6 o'clock and was told MHB had bowed out of hate. I contacted Abbru immediately. He told me they did not have enough Clerics log on. Bractos (one of our raid leaders) suggested to MHB at that time we again do a joint raid. MHB declined the offer once again of a joint raid and said they would do something else possibly. We said fine and welcomed any MHB that wanted to join us which some did. <br><br>I also want to say Tombern did a hell of a job taking over as main assist for me when i was having serious lag issues.<br><br>EH was in constant communication with MHB. When Baraden logged on i talked to him immediately about the situation. And there were no hard feelings.<br><br>Salve if you are not happy with the decision your guild made i can not help that. If MHB had said &quot;we still want to do fear&quot; EH was out of there. That simple. But after we orginally bowed and then you bowed out I do not see what myself or anyone in EH did wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usalveghostwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salve Ghostwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/29/01 12:35:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I Know the Facts</span><hr size=1> I know the Facts, Kegovis ... it wasn't the &quot;facts&quot; that I was trying to convey, it was the emotion.  <br><br>The fact is, our people arrived to find you all ready gathering at the spires.  The fact is, our officers bowed out because they believed that you were ready to go up when we weren't.  The fact is, you were nowhere near ready to go to Hate (which somehow became Fear in your post, how are your facts?).  Our people logged on to find the raid cancelled and your people still sitting around in GFay.  <br><br>Now, I'm not saying that what you did was wrong on a server level.  If VV or Legendary, or just about anyone came along and said, &quot;You guys aren't ready, and we are, tough luck.&quot; I would say that's life.  That's what you expect in FCFS.  What you DON'T expect is for people that you've helped, to lie to you in order to jump your raid, which is EXACTLY what you did.  <br><br>There are hard feelings, as this post might indicate to anyone with functional gray matter, and the fact that some of our members chose to salvage their evening by accompanying you doesn't change the &quot;facts&quot;.  If you had genuinely &quot;backed out&quot; of going to Hate, you wouldn't have had so many people parked at the GFay spires informing our people that YOUR raid was still on. The truth is, you told our guildleader what he wanted to hear, then went ahead and did what you wanted.  <br><br>So ... regardless of what other people think ... and regardless of whether your memory returns to you ... I think that you're stinking slime between my toes.  Maybe other people will think that you're one of those fun slime creatures that stretch, and want to play with you.  I think the only thing that you stretch is the truth.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/29/01 2:51:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/mairya/images/ladidadwarf1.jpg height=215 width=193></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Know the Facts</span><hr size=1> Get over it ya big pussy.<br><br>Kegovis has constantly looked out for others' feelings whenever I have seen him.

I logged on at 5pm est thursday to set up the raid in G fey.  As kegovis mentioned we had indeed been informed that both our guilds had Hate raids scheduled at the same time.  Kegovis had indeed contacted your officers and discussed and agreed to a Coop of the raid.  We in guild thought we might endup going elsewhere instead of ending up in a &quot;pissing contest&quot; over the raid since MHB was reported to us as having brought 50 folks to their last hate raid.  <br>So anyway i tell everyone to go ahead and come to G Fey as planned.  I then was contacted by Abbru (apologize if i mispelled your name. bow ).   I told him we had agreed to a coop and he had no problem with it.  I also told him we would go elsewhere if it would result in an overly large raid.  He asked how many i had coming. I told him i would know better at 6pm est.  and would update him on what we had for the raid.  I then proceeded over the next hour to give him updates of the key personell i had coming (aka clerics and enchanters) .   Around 6pm i sent him a tell and abbru informed me he was having the same problem most of us have. He had NO CLERICS from MHB coming.  Dont believe me, ask him.  I said &quot;ill keep trying to network and get some&quot;  and i did.  Around 6:30pm  Abbru informed me that we could have Hate to ourselves (which wasnt our intention and i made that VERY clear,  once again dont believe me.. i dont give a damn).  I told Abbru that we had aquired Clerics and that all MHB were welcome to join us as we had origionally agreed to a Cooperative raid.  Abbru told me that the MHB's were going elsewhere and wished me good luck as i did him.   We still had some MHB's agree to come along with us on the raid.  One of them was our main assist for some time.   <br>The raid did not go very well if that gives you some satisfaction,  we tried to rush the raid and it backfired.  I did my best to make everyone from MHB feel welcome on the raid as i would hope they would do for me.   <br>I really dont get why your having such a shitstorm on kegovis,  hell i was there leading the raid and got no flames from you.

It is when people complain about something that was the result of miscommunication &amp; cry &amp; cry &amp; cry. I know that Kegovis would never try to fuck someone over intentionally. He is rather noble &amp; considers others feelings when making decisions. The pussy who posted that crap knows it &amp; should have thought about it in his small head before he made the post. &quot;Uh ma. Yous thinks Kegovis, he mad at us &amp; was tryin' to trick us?&quot; Fuck it. I am tired of people not thinking about shit like this before making a bitch post on a messageboard.<br><br>I remember there was some gay bard named Vesper, who would continually cry about everything. If fact, all of his posts on Talamay's board were crying posts. Anyway, he was Outside Karnors oneday, just bitching at everyone who would accidently take his pulls. This shit happens alot OSK. Lots of miscommunication. This guy would not fucking shut up. Every 5 min or so, it would be /ooc Thanks Somedude for pulling my kill!!!! The guy thought someone was out to fucking get him.<br><br>I am sorry if I don't regard Hate as much. It is true I should respect the fact that others do treat it as a big deal. But, give it a while &amp; you yourself will treat posts on Hate with the same concern as an incidence in Guk or SolB. <p><B><FONT color="gold">Ladida Hohum<BR>Vicar of The Tribunal Server<BR>The Elitists<BR>Follower of Brell</FONT></B><BR><BR><img src=http://home.dencity.com/ladidahohum/pikelsig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/30/01 10:36:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Congrats Kegovis</span><hr size=1> Ok I am new here.

I passed that information on to my guild and we planned accordingly. Kegovis chose not to pass that information on to his guild and when the time came for him to stand up and be a guildleader and tell his guild of our agreement he chose not to. Some of the Hearts chose to join EH on their raid and the rest of us found something else to do with our time. Those are the only facts, anything else is just an excuse.<br><br>Officers of MHB have spoken to Kegovis and I have spoken to him very briefly since this. We can not change anything that has happened in the past and will plan our upcoming raids with this information in mind.<br><br>If anyone else feels the need to respond to this, have fun. As far as the Hearts are concerned it is a done deal and we have moved on.<br> <p><center><img src="http://www.fiberoptica.net/images/baraden.gif"
