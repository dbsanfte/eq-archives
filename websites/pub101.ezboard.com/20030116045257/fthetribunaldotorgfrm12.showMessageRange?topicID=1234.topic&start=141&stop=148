First of all, to me it seems like SI wanted out of the rotation anyway and this just gave them a convenient way to do so without looking like asses for dumping it for the real reason, which is the rotation has just gotten too big.<br>
<br>
Also, Hayzen has pointed out to you guys that when this stuff about rotations came up and everyone knew that EV and Comps weren't going to be a part of it and could come and go as they pleased, why didn't any of you object to that then?  It even went so far to make rules in the eventuality that either of those entities interupted your raid.  <br>
<br>
I would have thought that if either Comps or EV went in and cleared out all the loot in a day, you would be glad because now the guilds that can clear in one day will get a shot at all the dragons all at the same time when it repops.  My logic must be flawed somewhere so correct me please as this seems to contradict what Rynnia was saying.<br>
<br>
RNG has formally declared that they will no longer recognize any rotations.  So, what is this a reaction to?  Or were you guys just thinking this the whole time and just coincidentily declared it in this thread for no reason at all?<br>

&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you have a clue?  Seriously... or are you Companions member #11473-212 and are just spouting off on the flameboard?<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all....<br>
<br>
SI did NOT want out of the rotation.  I spoke with RNG a couple of days before pulling out about making a 24 hour rule instead of 48, so the zone could be done in 1 day.<br>
<br>
4 weeks between turns, in a zone we are not particularly interested in as a main goal, was not an issue.  Believe me... we didn't want MORE turns  : P<br>
<br>
<br>
The MAIN problem was, that, for the last 5 weeks in a row, either EV or Comps have gone into NTOV and killed a few spawn.<br>
<br>
The rotation provided for this, but not on such an annoyingly frequent basis.  The rotation basically said if Comps or EV went up into north that the current guild up got an extra week.<br>
<br>
Well when everyone in the rotation is pulling an extra week, the time between turns is now EIGHT weeks.  Or 6 trips a year.<br>
<br>
This would not be a problem if Comps / EV had gone into North after the current guild's rotation had be tossed into FFA period (48 hours after Aaryonar pop) but rather each and every instance was right in the middle of the 48 hour period, f'ing things up royally.  Never... not once, did either guild go and clear it all in one day, either, cuz it doesn't spawn like that.  So no, nobody was particularly &quot;glad&quot; when Comps or EV went.  Your logic is flawed.<br>
<br>
SI is / was past NTOV.  It was a nice place to go for a quick raid to gear up some of the newer members.  1 Run per 4 weeks taking 1 day to clear was a good deal.<br>
<br>
Having to do 2 runs over 6 total days because either Comps or EV go on your turn, and the spawn is fucked up cuz Comps or EV did the same shit to the guild earlier, is a nuisance and a waste of time.  I could give a shit less if Comps / EV wanna go up there, either, and I am certainly not gonna suggest to them when they can and can't go.  They can go when they want.  But do not suggest that SI was looking for an excuse or scapegoat to leave the rotation.  If we wanted to be in NTOV so bad, or had alterior motives with this, then why the hell were we not in NTOV the second week we were allowed because EV went in 2 mebbe 3 (cant remember) days straight on our turn, instead of passing on it to Transcended (who ended up losing half their spawn to Companions anyways).  Why has SI not patch rushed NTOV?<br>
<br>
Lemme ask you this... if you were in a rotation for NTOV, which suddenly went from 1  2-day run per 4 weeks for 14 dragons to 2 seperate 3 day + runs per 8 weeks for MAYBE 14 dragons... would you stay in that shit?<br>
<br>
I'll aswer for you.  No, you wouldn't.  It would be a complete waste of your time.  Hell it would be a waste of time if every single thing you killed dropped its &quot;good loot.&quot;  So we pulled outta the rotation and will focus more on Ssra and other things.  The loot is much better off that crap anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulysandros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lysandros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/28/02 9:00:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NToV</span><hr size=1> RNG never said we wont respect rotations, Skeeja isnt the Guildleader, he was just flaming EV/Comps for fucking around with the rotation.

Of course not, why do you think we pulled out months ago and said we'd go whenever we wanted to? And now you are doing the same thing that EV and Companions did back then, it's only natural progression happening here, everytime you add a new guild to the rotation the spawns are going to be messed up till next patch rolls around and more guilds are going to want to get into the rotation every turn, making the spawns stagerred because noone has the tactics down for all dragons for a first time clearing unless they borrowed them on the net.<br>
<br>
Now, if you rotation guilds would just have kept the damn place dead it wouldn't be such a hassle having to kill several dragons to have a go at RoV, which was actually our objective last time we went.<br>
<br>
Lysandros,<br>
We raid everyday, if we go to ToVN it's because nothing else has spawned that day that we could have the slightest interest in, stuff spawn everyday so we can't just postpone our RoV attempts by a day or however long it takes till the next guild goes FFA because other stuff will certainly have spawned that is higher priority for us. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19405 target=blank>Marshall Sscaley Iceblade</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions ~ Team Headstart</a></i> <br>

When people proclaim that they are an officer of a guild and make statements like that, it just seems they are speaking for the guild. Perhaps teaching your officers not to use such proclomations in the future will help prevent future confusion.<br>
