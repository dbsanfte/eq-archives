I think there will be a lack of response due to the price of it all, initially then we might see one of two things, a price change OR people saying this server rocks. Some of the features are pretty cool but the gameplay wont be a hell of alot different so I'm not totally convinced that it will be worth paying 4 times what we pay at the moment.<br>
<br>
 All the other stuff we have on other sites so, the new items/quests/GM events will have to be pretty spectacular to be worth the price of a whole new game each month. So lots of pretty swords, robes and armour will need to be added in and actually interesting events that are plot driven need to appear. It's alot of work and it's easily screwed up.<br>
<br>
Alot of it looks cool like I say but I am reserving judgement till I see it running. The proof is in the pudding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utrindletrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle Trueheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pally Chick :)</span><br>  Posts: 478<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/4/02 1:34:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1284.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> You know what kind of server i *would* pay for?<br>

Feel free to hire the size CS department Sony has, and you'll realize that $10 isn't enough.<br>
<br>
The bandwidth/hardware requirements have grown considerably.  They had a few choices, they picked one... but no matter which one, you'd all be complaining:<br>
<br>
1). Up everyone's fee to $15/$20 a month, lots of complaints, and people that barely were willing to pay $10 would probably leave.  <br>
<br>
2). Stop development.  We know what would happen here, but dang programmers are expensive.  Odds are these guys are getting &gt; $100k a year, and the team has grown considerably, takes a lot of you just to cover these guys, and then add all the administrative overhead of &quot;herding cats&quot;...<br>
<br>
3). Reduce Customer Service... Nope, they spent a ton of money trying to fix this,  but they probably can't go much beyond what they are doing for $10.<br>
<br>
4). Create a &quot;premium&quot; service that you pay a bit more for than what you get out of it, but it'll help cover the costs of keeping the #1 MMORPG at $10.<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Alan on this one... look at your Cable bill, and you know cable companies, they have no CS to speak of, and they use a much cheaper medium for delivery.<br>
<br>
Listen to all the new MMORPG's coming out... they all mention that it really can't be done for $10 a month.  EQ had Sony as a big partner to ante up a lot of money to support it.<br>
<br>
Also, read what MS said about Windows95... and what reality was... EQ got a lot closer to what they put on the box than Microsoft EVER has.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying they are perfect, but I am saying that I've gotten a lot more than $10 a month worth out of EQ.  Before EQ I averaged $100 a month on computer games, where it would takea bout 2 weeks to beat it and get bored with it.<br>
<br>
$10 a month is nothing, it's less than you pay for Internet badwidth, less than you pay for cable, less than you pay for telephone.<br>

Why waste energy on complaining about it, just play the game you have come to love and be ok with it.&quot; Atlaar<br>
<br>
Ditto,man.Why complain when the price you will be paying will remain $10?You will still have your uber weapons and your crappy CS.I myself,although I won't be able to pay $10 and will stay on this server beacuse of my friends,think that all the ideas put forward for the Legendary Server are great.Think of a GM event every couple of times you log on,think of the exitement of something unpredictable happening while camping the same boring old spawn,think of being a lowbie in such a world.I think it will be great,and whoever will have the money that I don 't have to play on that server will say its great.I will never know for sure,cos i'm not gonna be on it,but I surely don't complain about it.That's stupid.<br>

My &quot;How dare you Verant!&quot; attitude blinded me of those facts.<br>
<br>
But, I still smell something fishy here. I know Verant was juggling around the idea of a premium type server long ago. They had one of those polls I remember, that asked if anyone would pay more for a premium type server with extra CS and other things. They didn't release the results I don't think, but from getting opinions on it myself in game and on the boards, it seemed the popular opinion was &quot;Nope&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's a risky thing for Verant to do if they're in need of more money, and with the ton of money I'm sure they're putting into setting it up, it could turn into something very bad if the plan fails. A move they knew would be very unpopular, that has a good chance to not work out...

I mean if they couldn't do this kind of stuff when they have been promising it for over 2 years now, what makes anybody think its gonna happen now, regardless how many people they hire or how much they charge. Personally I'm of the opinion that they should have just offered to do this for everyone for an extra $5-10. I think most people would pay that just for the increased CS and the map feature. If the dynamic content is near what they said it would be like, i think most ppl would definitely would come up with the $$$, not 30 extra, but 10 would be ok. I mean the whole thing is kinda like with Microsoft. They come out with a new OS, yah its gonna have some new cool stuff, but its still gonna crash on your randomly, so forth and so on, so most ppl are hesistant to upgrade. Someone on one of the posts, not sure if its on this board or not, compared it to digital cable vs. regular cable. Thats not exactly a fair comparison, as both are pretty much bug free services. A more accurate one would be asking someone to upgrade to digital cable, when the cable they have now, a 1/4th of the channels cut out intermittently, some of your favorite shows, the cable company just stops showing, and you get a horrible signal.  <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46665>

<br>
Exactly.  <br>
This is why i feel the pity for the people paying it.  Sure, the benefits are great.  But i doubt they can carry them out when they can't even get a firm grasp on the fundamentals of Good Customer Service.<br>
<br>
You can spend 30 minutes in abusive tells from a disatisfied customer which leads to banning/suspending them or dealing with their pissy emails because they're peeved at the lack of CS.... dragging yet another set of labor hours into the picture.  <br>
<br>
 Or you can spend 5 minutes coming up with a good (consistant!!) solution and give your customer decent CS - even if there's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> slight</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> chance of them being in the wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Which do you think is cheaper?<br>
<br>
Verant has taken the &quot;Hard ass&quot; approach to dealing with Customers.  That can get costly.....  and it also makes us less confident in them when it comes to promising better CS for a nice premium.  <br>
<br>
As for GM events, all we've seen them do for the most part is release unkillable mobs on people, disrupt what might have been the first good group in a week &amp; call it an &quot;Event&quot; with no plot/storyline etc.  <br>
<br>
Sure.  I can recall about 4 decent GM events in 3 years.... but two of them were promo's for their Expansion!!!  C'mon now.  There's plenty of DM's and LARP'ers who could write good Events.  Why not snag some events from them for a few bucks or offer a free 6 month subscription for the best idea.  Make it a contest (great, cheap PR!!) <br>
  <br>
<br>
There's smarter ways to improve the level of customer satisfaction without dishing out a lot of cash.  In return, they could just say - &quot;Hey guys, we need to up the price.  We can't afford to keep going at this rate.&quot;<br>
<br>
In return, they're more than likely to get a - &quot;hey man, love the game.  I'd be happy to pay the extra $5 - $7.&quot;<br>
<br>
We've paid $10 for 3 years...  that's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cheap</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If they had a happier, more loyal player base, asking a smidge more per customer, without feeling guilty, would not be an issue. <br>

<br>
  In all businesses the main thing you must know is what is considered a reasonable price for your product. To be honest, EQ is probably a bit under priced , but $40 a month might be a little overpriced. They can find out a little by polling the customer base, but the only way to be sure is by actually implementing it.<br>
<br>
  I hope the new server is a success , I wouldn't play on it, but the more revenue that they can derive from online gaming, the more money they can devote to it, which hopefully will allow us to see better more involved games *with* decent CS. I would hate to think that EQ, as good as it is , is the height of what online gaming will be.<br>
<br>
  I also expect EQ to probably increase subscription rates by about 20% this year, it doesn't look like their customer base is increasing any and they will want to show an increase in revenue so realistically they should raise the rates. They could probably double the charge and still maintain over half their customers and cut their costs in half, when EQ starts declining that is what they will do.<br>

<br>
Economically speaking, $10/month is very inexpensive.  Before I began playing EQ, I would spend maybe $75-100 dollars/month for games (a conservative number), because I like to play games.  Since I began playing EQ, I have purchased exactly ZERO other games.  I have a couple games I can play when my ISP is fuxored, but I play EQ exclusively.<br>
<br>
VI/Sony hasnt raised thier rates at all since day 1, mostly because the subscriber base continued to grow.  But now as player populations begin to plateau, they need a way to generate more revenue in order to remain competitive.  Have they outlasted every other MMORPG? All indications say yes, but as newer games begin to emerge which are superior to EQ (DAOC is still a contender for that honor), the current pricing model they have + stagnant player populations = EQ loses.<br>
<br>
I'm sure they did some kind of risk study to see what would happen if they jacked up monthly fees to, say, $15.  How many people would they lose? Maybe they decided it wasn't worth the risk.  They took a target revenue figure, juggled some numbers, and came up with the Legends Server.  It satisfies the needs/desires of a certain cross-section of the EQ population, and it makes them money.  If only 50 people from each existing server left and went over to Legends, well....thats 2000 people on Legends.  Not that hard to suck in what amounts to 0.5% of thier player-base, IMHO.<br>
<br>
They have been trying to satisfy various player-types and demands and been fairly successful.  This is another reason why EQ has such wide appeal.  Hard-core PvP?  Got it.  Team-based PvP? Cross-server events? Character Transfers? Role-playing? UK Subscribers? Yep.  Sure, it would be great if they offered the Legends server for $10/month, but since they are adding so much more content and bells and whistles, it *should* be more...<br>
<br>
$40/month is a lot of money, but has anyone looked at the proposed price points for up-and-coming 'EQ-killers?'  Some of the numbers being kicked around for SWG, City of Heroes, et. al. are around $12.99-$18, and I've even heard rumors that SWG will be more in the $20+/month range (Gotta pay Lucas for that licencing fee <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  And I bet you that they wont offer the kinds of services VI is offering with the Legends package.  You will pay to play and that's it...<br>
<br>
I'm not paying $40/month to start from scratch again.  That's MY bottom line.  But people WILL pay this money, and if it doesn't pay for *our* (read: non-Legends subscribers) EQ, well, then I'm sure it will pay for the development/R&amp;D for EQ2.  And that is a good thing. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65044"><b><i>Kromagnon</b></i></a><br>51 Champion of Vis Veres<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=64070"><b><i>Keldomahge Sayvray</b></i></a><br>52 Wanderer of Conspiracy<br></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1284.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1284.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1284.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1284.topic&index=34><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1284.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.threadControl?topicID=1284.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1284.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1284.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm33">Spell Traders<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm8">Cogito's Whacky Woondarland<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm2">Admin Stuff<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <table border=0><tr><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
