<br>
What I am genuinely interested in is your mindset. I know mine was pretty much the same as when I smoked. I wasn't planning on quitting anytime soon, but I wasn't planning on doing it for the rest of my life. And sometimes I planned quitting by a certain date. Like when I said, I will quit smoking when I finish college. Which didn't really happen.<br>
<br>
So do you guys plan on quitting for good eventually? Or when you do quit, do you think it will be just to go to the next game that holds your attention and interest? Or do you plan on playing these types of games till you kick over dead? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/DLadida.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

<br>
Yes I do feel myself looking for that next big game, it scares me a bit to get consumed again.  Thing is, I think EQ ruined me for the genre.  I've played Daoc, AO, E&amp;B, one more I forget and am now sparsely playing AC2 and every one I get bored of and find myself doing other things.  I blame the games at first, but I really think it's because I'm burnt out on them.  No matter what aspects they have, it's still doing something to build your charachter up so you can be better than the next guy.  I'm tired of that.<br>
<br>
Real life is slowing seeping back into my day, my relatives still have to drag me off this dumb computer, but it's getting easier for them now that I can log off instantly anytime I want because no one is dependant on me being on.<br>
<br>
Take all written above and coat it with a thin film of nagging guilt and that pretty much sums up my mindset.  Getting better though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qanamilrafiki>Qanamil Rafiki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/8/02 10:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you ever plan on quitting the game?</span><hr size=1> I thought I was going to play until they had to boot me off last summer, but now after a hectic semester of college where I had little to no play time, I don't think I'll be around much longer.<br>

Im not even really sure why I quit back then. Anyway, spent 13 months trying other games and finding them all sadly lacking compared to EQ. So some time partway thru the Velous era, I restarted again. Quitting hasn't crossed my mind since then.<br>
<br>
I know eventually I will stop playing, but its going to be becuase something drags me away. Right now, I cant see anything on the horizon that is going to drag me anywhere. Im not going to go searching for something else like I did the first time becuase that search came up with nothing. <br>
<br>
Ive got a bit of a pet hate for all the people who claim to be playing until MMORPG X comes out, at which point they will play that becuase VI is evil. There seems to be a bit of a pattern. If your aiming for futurer game, then you dont really have your mind set on goals in the current game, which means you end up sucking at the current game. This further reinforcines that you dont like the current game and you want to play the next game. Of course, the pattern repeats each game :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=minnigan>Minnigan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/8/02 11:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you ever plan on quitting the game?</span><hr size=1> I quit back in april for six months, mostly due to cash flow issues and school, but during that time I was playing legend of the five rings constantly. but I guess I got burned out on that as well (l5r is like magic, just with a fuedail japanese theme) and came back to eq.

Ive come to the conclusion that all gaming companies suck ass so whether it is a VI game or not really doesnt matter.

I'm trying not to be self-righteous about it, but it's hard because the more I think about it the madder I am that I lost so much time to this. I've concluded that for people who play the &quot;end game,&quot; this is the strongest impediment to quitting:<br>

<br>
Being in a guild and the peer pressure it brings keeps people playing longer and for more hours than anything else I think. More than the game's inherent drawing power (its 'addictive' elements), wanting to 'do good' for your guild and be there for them spurs excessive game play for a lot of people. For some it's their competitive nature, for some it's the feeling they get from being there to help people, and for some it's about being part of a successful organization.<br>
<br>
I too will NEVER be in another game like this.  I'm very interested in seeing what the future of massively multiplayer online games holds. I truly believe that, eventually, the number of people who lose themselves in the game to their detriment will be great enough that a lot of people stand up and take notice.  Three years from now there will be a heck of a lot of people like me for whom the novelty was very interesting yet who woke up 2+ years later saying &quot;wtf??&quot;  The 48 Hours piece was the tip of the iceberg.  <br>

This is the reason so many people become frustrated with EQ. Not only does it require a huge amount of time, it requires it on a consistant basis. Games on PS2 or Xbox may require alot of time, but you can take two weeks off in between and not fall behind. EQ on the other hand demands consistant time and alot of it or you end up far behind.<br>
<br>
One of the hazerds of the genre I guess. <p><br>

Hey Ladida, what did you do to quit smoking? I tried chewing the gum, but then I realized I could get twice the nicotine goodness by smoking while chewing the gum, leaving the taste of the smoke in my mouth because the gum absorbs the flavor. ^_^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pribar>pribar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/8/02 2:24 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you ever plan on quitting the game?</span><hr size=1> I log on a few times a week to yak with friends, port guildies, etc, but havent seriously played since Luclin, been 51 since then. as far as cancelling my acct, not gonna happen, too easy a way to have fun for a few hours with friends i have halfway across country, 12 bucks a month vS 300 buck plane tickets you do the math.<br>

The game isn't even fun anymore.  I enjoy message boards and talking in chat channels to my friends.  Everything else I can take or leave.
