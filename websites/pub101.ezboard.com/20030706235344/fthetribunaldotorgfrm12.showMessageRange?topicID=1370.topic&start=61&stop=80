Actually most places check for drugs at work after accidents.  The reason for doing this it that it's a lot easier to get out of a Workman's comp claim if they can bring evidence to suggest that you might have been loaded.  As a part of this way of weaseling out of the workman's comp, they need to show that they didn't know about it, which is why you have a hiring drug screening.<br>

Ok maybe I was not clearer over the two posts I made, and damn the no edit button on the last one. I am not saying make alcohol illegal. I was saying that his analogy of getting run over by a high driver was compared to drunk driving. Without reading to hard into my post you would have also understood I was calling for the decriminalization of some drugs.<br>
<br>
Sure they broke a ton of gun laws in Columbine. And those laws, kept people alive how? You are calling for more enforcement? Try and make it harder for teenage kids to procure guns and ammo. Will make the job of law enforcement much easier. Probably have less high schol shootings too. Gun regulation whatever. Increased policing is only good when you want a police state /shrug.  <br>

Umm ya i'm not impared, but you should put down the moonshine. As for the Hemp argument. I was refering to much more then clothing. It makes oil (end your dependancy on the middle east), it makes construction products, and you know what? It could get loggers off the dole, help the economy, and improve the enviroment. You can't figure it out then mabye you need to get high, rather then siping the rocket fuel. Do some research into it. Oh but wait you won't because you are probably closed minded right.<br>
<br>
Speaking of snow job. You apear to be one of those people who think your country is doing a good thing spending billions on a war on drugs, believe your government is winning it, and believe you stand as a shining example of how others should handle drug use. Take a look at how Holland handles drug use and then come to me. You CAN learn from others you know. Maybe you are not closed minded, but rather one of those people whom propagandists love....small minded.<br>

<br>
1) In most states pot/weed/marijuana is not punishable by jail time until you are carrying enough to be charged with intent to sell.<br>
<br>
2) For those of you asking what harm does pot do? here's one answer. Before pot became a 0 tolerance policy in the military, over 500 people were injured (some even losing their limbs due to snap backs on a ship) due to the fact that they were high while on duty.<br>
<br>
3) For those of you thinking I'm one of those &quot;Drugs are bad&quot; people, Let me inform you. My father was a deputy chief (also in Ohio btw) and that did not brainwash me into hating drugs. If anything I wanted to do them more. <br>
    However, I am now finding out that all the pot I did in high school may have actually *gasp* been bad for me. I now suffer from black outs, migraines, and dizziness, which doctors believe may have been caused by my pot usage (and pot only mind you).<br>
<br>
     I still believe in letting people find out for themselves. It's their life, let them ruin or not ruin it all they want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kruleintentions>Krule Intentions</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/02 12:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loegan, I've solved it</span><hr size=1>  I agree with you, I don't think you should be high while working. That said why does the military give pilots speed to stay awake and alert during flights? I'm not sure of the exact figure, but they are issed it if the medical staff feels they need it. <br>
<br>
This happened in Afghanistan. The pilots were logging in very long flight times and complaining of fatigue. At this point they have the option of being issued a Methemfetamine drug. There is some speculation that the pilot who droped the bomb on allied troops conducting live fire exercises in an area designated for this purpose may have been high.<br>
<br>
I've never done Meth, but having talked to those who have, you are prone to halucinations, and parinoa. When the pilot thought he was under attack, he may have actually halucinated the attack, and acting in self defence. Rather then punishing him for what happened, maybe they should look at the medical records and see if he was issued something. If that is the case, maybe soldiers should not be issued drugs by the government while they are flying. <br>

Sorry I don't sit here with a dictionary. It is sad that you have to flame me on spelling though. Grammer flames are about as weak as your argument. You are against drugs...good for you. Yet you fail to address my argument. I spelt words wrong, oh no then my whole argument must be flawed, er ya get a grip.<br>
<br>
How was that? Any punctuation needing fixed teacher? Was my spelling good enough for you? I think sitting down with the bong would do you a world of good. You obviously need to RELAX. <br>
<br>
Oh and by the way I am not using drugs at the moment, maybe that is my problem, that or the multitude of papers I have been writting. Still wondering what your excuse is.<br>

That 'study' used only 150 people, didn't screen for other drugs, didn't include impairment they might've had from the onset, and was generally piss-poor.  They used people being treated for dependence on weed for crying out loud...of course they have prior mental problems!  A one time battery of tests does not a hypothesis render.  Here's an abstract from a real study:<br>
<br>
'A Johns Hopkins study published in May 1999, examined marijuana's effects on cognition on 1,318 participants over a 15 year period. Researchers reported &quot;no significant differences in cognitive decline between heavy users, light users, and nonusers of cannabis.&quot; They also found &quot;no male-female differences in cognitive decline in relation to cannabis use.&quot; &quot;These results ... seem to provide strong evidence of the absence of a long-term residual effect of cannabis use on cognition,&quot; they concluded.'<br>

<br>
Even with her flawed study, the lady leading it concludes &quot;that the study does not suggest in any way that pot causes serious brain damage...effects generally appeared to be modest.&quot;  So much for that.<br>
<br>
No one believes the hemp argument other than hopped up dipshits huh?  Then answer me one question braniac...why is hemp illegal?  Don't say for the THC cause it's such a minute amount it's barely there...there's more mercury in our fish than THC in hemp.  You'd have to smoke two telephone pole-sized buds to get high off of hemp...so if there's barely any illegal THC in it and it doesn't have any redeeming value as you say, why keep it illegal?  Uh-huh.<br>

Do I know how it works?  I've been smoking on and off for about 9 years now, so I'd say yes.  Have I moved on to 'other' drugs? No. (did coke a couple of times, know why?  Because my buddy started doing it after he switched jobs and his new job drug tested...the tests forced him to quit weed)   Is weed boring for me?  No.  The real question is, do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know how weed works or just what you see antidrug people tossing out as reasons against it?  The Gateway Theory is flawed at best.<br>
<br>
'In March 1999, the Institute of Medicine issued a report on various aspects of marijuana, including the so-called Gateway Theory (the theory that using marijuana leads people to use harder drugs like cocaine and heroin). The IOM stated, &quot;There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.&quot;'<br>

<br>
The costs to the people as Rik mentioned of policing marijuana is ludicrous. In 2000, 46.5 percent of the 1,579,566 total arrests for drug abuse violations were for marijuana -- a total of 734,497. Of those, 646,042 people were arrested for possession alone.  Over half a million people for just possession?  Come on now, surely there's time better spent for these officers on real crimes then hauling in somebody for just possession.  That's a lot of arrests for a plant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kingheavyj>Kingheavyj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/02 4:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loegan, I've solved it</span><hr size=1> Yes i know how weed works, and im not just tossing out anti drug shit thanks.

Weed is sooo bad for you.  Guess thats why its approved, in Canada, for medicinal use.<br>
I guess the gov't wants all the people with serious medical conditions to become brain dead and they're hoping that eventually they'll move onto the heavier drugs. <br>
I have a friend who has MS, he's approved for using medical weed, since he's been using it, his condition has stagnated...he can walk out of his house, he can drive his car, and he's enjoying life again...add that to your so called stats. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nuttinbutrouble>Nuttin Butrouble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/21/02 6:28 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loegan, I've solved it</span><hr size=1> ... sorry Modair, my mistake... maybe it was just me but you were acting like a 12 year old in your posts, despite the fact that you say you're 25.. <br>
