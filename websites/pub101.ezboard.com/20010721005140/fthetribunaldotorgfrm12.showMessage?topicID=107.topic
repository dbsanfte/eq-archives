<br>
Inarius and llanowar<br>
<br>
Two members of The Circle of lemmings (who by theier actions now have me blacklisting thier guild, Diamond Circle did this long ago, and stayed our guild enemys for quite a long time)<br>
<br>
Reason: Firstly, less, this is TECHNICALY legal, but I am sure you would agree fully cowardly and dispicable. Starting last night at about 7pm I returned to camping Lord Grimrot in south karana. A druid there, with a cleric friend, where also nearby, and after talking, we agreed to help each other as I needed dead version, she needed live. So, we cleared the ph, and timed it, the first round, I stayed at the spawn while Decipher checked rares in zone. Another PH, so we killed that one, and I went to take a nap(3 hour 20 min spawn cycle) and decipher had another ph come up while I was sleeping. I logged on in time for next spawn, another PH. After eliminating this Ph I went to work on faction, while decipher roamed zone and such as he needed. Inarius moved in, about 45 min before next claimingthe spawn was his, and even though we returned right away, and explained we had over 15 hours straigh already (more for decipher) in this spawn, Inarius called a high level guild druid, and then as live grim spawned, he promptly ksed it. Is this kind of thing legal? Under VI's rules it technicaly is, but what kind of person would blithely ignore 3 other ppl who have spent over half a day on a camp to get it to spawn (and Grimrot WILL NOT SPAWN unless triggered, which Decipher and I where doing)<br>
<br>
Irarius took advantage of a technical rules, and used it to twist a situation into his KS advantage, and the fact another guildie was so willing to help him do so gives me NO respect for his guild. Lastly, think on this, why would a SK feel so strongly he must KS 2 clerics of a mob who has items needed for a cleric / pally only shield? This sort of thing shall not be tolerated by me<br>
<br>
Lemmings, sorry, but due to these cowardly actions, you are all on my shit list (no ress/no grop invites), and I shall make sure all of trib knows about this kind of viles deeds. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/alphagm/pics/oath1.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoathhipacraticus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oath Hipacraticus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/01 11:12:34 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/alphagm/pics/MD2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dishonorable Lemmings</span><hr size=1> No appologies, but perhaps I did go a little heavy handed in my wording of this, but due to the lack of editability in this area, what is said is said. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/alphagm/pics/oath1.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/01 12:24:04 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/mairya/images/ladidadwarf1.jpg height=215 width=193></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dishonorable Lemmings</span><hr size=1> DUde, if you are gunna fucking camp a spawn, camp it.

Now, steping back, and counting to 10, yes, I really should have done that before posting. To all COL members not involved in this incedent, I sincerly appologize. I personaly feel that as a member of a guild you represent that guild's good name, and by your actions show it (thusly I am for the sake of my own guild postingthis, not just for them, but also cause I mean it=P)<br>
<br>
I myself have already killed the live Grim, and I wasn't even the one who needed this item, but the other cleric did, and I had put over half a day into this. It's just about common courtesy. You move into a camp, that you find out has been being worked for HOURS upon HOURS, and that those neededing it are still there or nearby. So you simply move in and claim the camp so you can farm an item you don't even need? Just very poor judgement on thier part I'm afraid.  <p><img src="http://members.home.net/alphagm/pics/oath1.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwittlesvaseel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WittlesVaseel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/01 6:29:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dishonorable Lemmings</span><hr size=1> what incident regarding diamond circle are you talking about?  <p>Vaseel Doomherald 51 minstrel<br>Wittles Woodfurfun 50 warrior<br>

This happened in Lake rathe, and in not so many words, as our group camped the inlet, thier group first asked camped (we told them ours in ooc like normal), then they came over and started killing the mobs as we camped it. Quite literaly, they said, what are you going to do about it? and when we showed we had sufficient skills to hold them at bay, they brought in a high lvl wiz and just started killing all pops, to spite us. Now, at that time, as I was guild leader, I took great offence to this, and as I stated above, I do really feel guild members represent a guild. in my first tried talking to a officer of dc about this, I was basicaly given the brush off, and things didn't go well from there(so I just basicaly avoided them when possible myself, and recomended guildies do the same). After several months I made a good friend in DC, and we talked about those members, and he helped hash things out from their leadership in appology to me, which is all I really needed at that point, knowing the members who had done the deed where no longer in DC.<br>
<br>
This whole issue boils down to, how do you want others to see your guild? How about your guild's members? Are you considered &quot;pricks&quot; or &quot;nice guys&quot;? (or other=P) Your actions, in every issue like this, show not only your personal stance on an issue, but yours guild's in extension. However, I am past holding a guild responsible for a few members bad judgement, those members have done what they have done, and it is for thier own guild to live with that, not for me to criticize the guild. <br>
<br>
To sum up this whole mess, I am sorry lemmings, I badly mispoke myself, and for that I appologize. As to those two members involed in this, think, and know your actions have effects on the perception of your guild as a whole, and actions like yours today, were very uncool. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/alphagm/pics/oath1.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/9/01 8:01:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/mairya/images/ladidadwarf1.jpg height=215 width=193></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dishonorable Lemmings</span><hr size=1> Hey Oath. If ya would have stayed at the spawn, would this have happened? Usually, that is what people do when they camp crap.<br>
<br>
Once, when I was campin an epic piece in Lake Rathe, I was asked by a guildmate if I could come res his twink in Guk. The spawn was 30min, so I booked it there. I ressed him &amp; gated back before the PH or Rare had poped. If I had found another cleric there, I would have said, &quot;Damn my luck.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know I wouldn't have argued with him, even though I had been there 10 hours straight. I sure as hell wouldn't have come to cry about it on the boards, even if the rare had popped.<br>

I mean, honestly, why should you HAVE to be there when you KNOW when the next spawn/PH is going to pop up and there is something you could be doing other than sitting with your thumbs up your arse?<br>
<br>
That's my 2cp. Granted, there's nothing better I can do when trying Grimrot, but I know I can't solo the live one myself, so I don't bother trying to camp it unless someone like Myr is also there. In which case if something was needed one of us could physically stay there to &quot;hold fort&quot;.<br>
<br>
I guess the concept I'm espousing is... if you're killing the PHs and you know the timer, and you're in the zone... you can call the camp.<br>

They've been there for anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours, and you show up and say you've been camping it for 10 hours?  Yah, 10 hours except for the past 2 hours.<br>
<br>
In such a situation, at least shout that you're camping Grimrot every 15 minutes or so, and don't talk to people who think you're out of line when you come back to kill the PH.  Just kill it and ignore their cries of foul.  They should've been paying attention to the public channels.<br>
<br>
Anyway, whining about such a gimpy spawn makes you look like a gimp.  Suck it up and go camp it again, and be glad its not Stormfeather.<br>

Joo fuck duck truck... you try steal my spicey rice noodle&quot; or some shit like that. ANYWAYS, I try to explain to her that she left the spawn and that I had been camping it for almost 2 hours, and basically got a &quot;piss off&quot; response.<br>

<br>
As you can see it was an intellectualy stimulating conversation. I'll give credit to the officers of The Comps I talked to, they were quite a bit more helpful than talking to Sansnom herself.<br>
<br>
But at least you can see the other side of the story... not like Stormfeather really spawns anyway, he's just a fucking myth created to trick us into sitting on our asses for hours killing greens.<br>

Rylok  &quot;  You leave a camp, you lose it.  Simple enough ? &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As much as it pains me to say this.. I am in complete agreement with Rylok.<br>
<br>
<br>
If for example...<br>
<br>
Some guild pulled out of fear and left the Shissar Up..  It would be REDICULOUS to expect some other guild not to go and kill it.  Because  &quot; You leave a camp, you lose it &quot;..<br>
<br>
<br>
You are right on the money with this one Rylok..  good show..<br>

<br>
We engaged grimrot first he attacked me  Inarius nuked we nuked he got the kill and came in with Xercum and sat on body til he could ninja loot it out from under Ainea course we all know petitioning doesnt help otherwise Ainea would have her Aegis of Life  she is still lacking the dead grimrot piece <br>
I don't know about the rest of their guild so can't judge them <br>
