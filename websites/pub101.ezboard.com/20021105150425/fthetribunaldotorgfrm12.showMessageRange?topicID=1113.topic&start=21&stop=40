    <br>
Prostate cancer is diagnosed every 2 3/4 minutes, approximately 190,000 new cases each year. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in America among men.<br>
<br>
More than 30,000 American men lose their lives to prostate cancer each year, one death every twenty minutes.<br>
<br>
Prostate cancer incidence rates increased 192% between 1973 and 1992.<br>
<br>
One in six American men is at lifetime risk of prostate cancer. If a close relative has prostate cancer, a man's risk of the disease more than doubles. With two relatives, his risk increases fivefold. With three close relatives, his risk is about 97%.<br>
<br>
In the next 24 hours, prostate cancer will claim the lives of over 80 American men.<br>
<br>
Prostate cancer represents about 30% of all new cancer cases in American men.<br>
<br>
This year, more cases of prostate cancer in men under the age of 65 are expected than the combined number of men of ages who are victims of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease,  and brain tumors.<br>

My dad has never smoked, drinks only occasionally, swims 2 miles ever other day, works full time, has low cholesterol, great bp (blood pressure, for you eq addicts not a piece of armor) is very active at age 68.  But...prostate cancer will most likely kill him. He did not have surgery to remove the prostate and neither did a good friend of his.  His friends has spread to his bones and he has a short life expectancy left at this time.  Another friend with the cancer had his prostate removed and is doing fine at this time.  My dad was given one year by some asshole doctor recently which other doctors do not agree with.  If not at least controlled he has 2-3 years to live.  Sorry If I don't agree with ALOT of the bullshit I see here.  My mother also died of breast cancer when I was 21.  I find it hard to believe if there was a cure it would be hidden away.    <br>

Cancer all starts with something fucking up your DNA...Wich leads to bad replication...Ever tried making a copy of a copy? Ever tried it when the original copy is already fucked up? The error gets worse and worse and worse.<br>
<br>
I do understand the prevention of free radicals by anti oxidents has been proven to prevent cancer however divin I have never heard of it killing cancer....The actual cause is still in the DNA structure not in the cell itself....Most doctors agree the only way to deal with that is to eliminate the faulty DNA structure.<br>
<br>
I am very curious as to the reasoning behind why the cancerous DNA will begin to replicate itself normally from an abnormal state once your PH lvl goes to 8.5....Our knowledge of DNA is crude at best however at out current tech lvl besides, some crude changes, We can,t alter DNA very well at all.....And from most studies we've seen the body cant alter it either.(wich makes sense considering the DNA is like the base programing :P).<br>
 <br>
Infact besides radiation/poison messing DNA up its amazingly difficult to alter it at all (alter it in a controled way)....In the past few years great leaps have been made in the DNA therapy field however again its still  crude at best...Even the best technology can,t put DNA back together again, So I am really curious as to the reasoning behind why your PH lvl can.<br>
<br>
I am not being sarcastic I am very curious is there a link or a book I can get with more info on this?

<br>
1) again, I never said antioxidants kill cancer...I said oxygen oxygen oxygen kills cancer...oxygen which fosters a high alkaline blood pH in which cancer cells CANNOT respirate...they die<br>
<br>
2)<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Most doctors agree the only way to deal with that is to eliminate the faulty DNA structure.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Exactly.  Welcome to modern medical science, treat the symptoms not the ailment.  There is no 'faulty' DNA, there is DNA in such an environment that it cannot repair itself.  <br>
<br>
3)The high pH level doesn't alter DNA...it makes it unfavorable for cancer cells.  Go back to that Otto Warburg piece I posted about how cancer cells are products of fermentation, not aerobes like normal cells.  That's why they're cancerous...make fermentation impossible and the cells cannot live<br>
<br>
4)I said 98% of men will get prostate cancer, and that's a fact.  That's what all your statistics are saying in a roundabout way, it's not a high oxygen tissue.  And also like I said as long as it's contained within the prostate it causes no harm.  Unless, it's operated on.  Let me ask you...did his doctors biopsy it?  Sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Alkaline foods...no sugars, bring his pH up.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I am talking about 'prevention' of cancer...not curing.  As I said, the only thing I know that remotely works are antineoplastons. Best advice I can give anyone is, research it yourself.  I mean, if it was my life I wouldn't entrust it to a guy who studied for 8 years out of a text that a pharmaceutical grant provided.  And I don't.<br>

Some believe removing it before it spreads will stop it, but all it takes is one cell to have escaped.  My father's cancer had already spread outside the prostate before anything was done.  So that point is not valid.  The rest I don't know all that much about but my father does.  Thankfully there are still a few options out there and new things coming everyday.  I'm glad my father is such a fighter.  He won't give up until it makes him.<br>

<br>
You're so damn fulla shit D its pathetic.  You want us to believe that your concoction of &quot;self evident truths&quot; is the only possible answer.  You want us ... no screw that, you want ME to believe that there is a conspiracy of not only the top 5 pharmacutial companies, but in the whole world, to surpress your little gem of knowledge just to continue to let millions of folks die to protect some mythical product.  All this while the market for a proven preventative  (check the word proven), would far surpass all the current &quot;cures&quot; and procedures put together.  The secret and all powerful They who surpress this knowledge and comb the world paying off every one that &quot;sees the light&quot; to keep them quite.  Next you'll be telling us that 57.4% of all &quot;accidents&quot; are murders; They did it to bury the truth!<br>
<br>
<br>
So here's what I'm betting.  You have come to believe everything you are saying here is the absolute and only truth and have based your small and pathetic life on it.  I'm betting you spend all your awake hours adhereing strictly to everything you are preaching here.  And as in all crackpot cases like this, the more people you can get to think the same way you do, the more &quot;self evident&quot; that your believes are the true and only ones.<br>
<br>
Why cant you just say, &quot;..we dont really know, but there is some evidence that this or that might help...&quot; ...  I think most of us can work with that; maybe give it a try or not.  Just dont try and convince me I'm gonna die unless I take the same magic elixer you are convinced will save you.<br>

I hope it is. But even so I'm pretty sure that higher oxygen has its own side effects, some of them extremely dangerous.<br>
<br>
Oxygen is not such a nice element as most any chemist can tell you. Without it we couldn't make energy to keep our bodies alive, that is true. But higher then 20 something percent and &quot;bad shit&quot; starts to happen. Submarine sailors make their own atmosphere and there is a high limit to oxygen % allowed. I seem to remember it was for biological reasons, not just increased metal corrosion.<br>
<br>
Also, divers everywhere are aware of oxygen toxicity that is swift and fatal, caused when total saturated oxygen levels in your tissues are too high for the body to expell.<br>
<br>
You say that oxygen prevents the cancer, but cell mutations can easily happen from any high energy radiation that bombards a cell and destroys a peice of the DNA chain. We are constantly assulted by high energy radiation, esspecially at higher attitudes, so it's safe to assume that these cell mutations happen regularly but most all mutated cells die. Yet it only takes one cell mutation that is viable for a cancer to start. If I'm interpreting you correctly high oxygen and high blood PH will kill all cancerous cells before they can mutate? I find this a little hard to believe. Why wouldn't this high blood PH also destroy normal cells as happens in extreme radiation victims?<br>
<br>
Sorry if I am misunderstanding you, you might have already answered my questions but to be fair you are a bit hard to read. Conspriacy theories and ferverant single-minded diatribes cause my eyes to glaze over and I sometimes miss valid pionts in an otherwise rabid foaming at the mouth overly sensitive defend the Alamo at all costs style of writing. <br>
<br>
Many large pharmacutical companies also do not prescribe (haha, get it? <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> prescribe</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->! Ah, screw you to!) to the possibility that accupressure, faith healing, or magnet theropy are helpful other then the placebo like results they can create. Are they just doing their duty to ingore snake-oil quakery or is the oxygen cure for cancer conspiracy part of a larger sinister plot of pure evil? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Kittenslayer</a><BR>

<br>
First off bakamoron...wow.  Again you stun me into silence by your horribly inane statements.  I just want to address a few of your genius points before I try to answer Areleanna, who makes a good post.  First, I would just like to say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'You use all the big pretty words'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> causes me to chuckle.  You realize they're common parts of everyday speech right?  I mean, if you had to look up in the dictionary anything I said you're only reinforcing what I said in my last flame towards you.  Buy a vocab calendar man.  Then there's this gem: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'You quote obtuse text from obscure and contriversial &quot;professionsals&quot;'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Now seriously, I gotta know what constitutes a real professional to you.  I mean, if 2-time nobel laureates (that means awardees or winners, put the Webster's down) are not professional enough for you, then I don't know what to offer who would be.  Obscure papers? You know I was being sarcastic referring to JAMA as a rag-tag magazine?  Did you click on the link I provided to see where it took you?  Are they obscure? You can't look up Warburg's submitted work for the Nobel prize, or search out his name in any medical journal?  Hell, I gave you the exact speech that excerpt was from.  Are you really this inept?<br>
<br>
Or are you really this delusional?  '<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you are some how Right because your posts have so much information' </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so I should've talked from my ass like you without a shred of any coherent thought and then I'd be right?  Heh.  I like how you contradict yourself next by saying that there's a conspiracy to suppress this great knowledge...when first you said 80% of what I said was 'common knowledge' -- so which is it? Common or suppressed.  The fact is, it's not suppressed if it's out there for everyone to read is it?  <br>
<br>
Of course, you just can't be a total fricking idiot and avoid it out of turn - opposing all common sense - because it shuns the current medical dogma.  Cause we know they're always right.  From Nero's lead-lined Roman pipes to asbestos to DDT to LSD to cocaine in our soft drinks whatever the 'experts' tout as correct has to be right.  Conspiracy?  No.  The fact is, it's common business practise.  I'll outline it quickly cause I know you're a kindergarten teacher and you're used to talking to people smarter than you all day.  Pharmaceutical companies don't care to enforce the idea of prevention because guess what...they make their money by treating EXISTING CONDITIONS.  They're not gonna say 'oh hey, truth is we don't need your $40 billion a year because you could just prevent cancer from ever starting'.  Are you this much of a closet-idealist?  Most people are scum, motivated by selfish greed...how many false charities and scammers made money off of the hugest tragedy in our nation's history, september 11th?  Or don't you believe that that happened either?  For hundreds to thousands of dollars they juked honest sympathetic giving people...hundreds to thousands.  With pharmaceuticals, we're talking $40 billion.  I guess it's kinda hard for you to imagine the power one could command with $40 billion+.  So instead, just bask in your naivety.<br>
<br>
Finally, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Why cant you just say, &quot;..we dont really know, but there is some evidence that this or that might help...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Perhaps you glossed over that warburg speech...let me bring this back to you yet one more time.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> It is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>indisputable</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> that all cancer could be prevented if the respiration of body cells were kept intact.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Nobody</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> today can say that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>one does not know what the prime cause of cancer is</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.

<br>
Tidal - yeah, don't forget the constant toxins we introduce..through our food (pesticides, drugs given to animals), the way we prepare it(microwaving), the plastics and stuff we produce, which never decomposes into the soil to replenish nutrients, the addition of more rays from the sun through our ozone hole.  Hell, the biggest cause is probably the fact that in the 1920s (back when 2% of the populace had cancer and some had even heard of it) our oxygen content in the atmosphere was 40%.  Today, thanks to logging, extinguishing of the rain forests, pollution, I think it's down to something like 15%, may even be lower around 13% or so.  70% of it is now nitrogen.  Put all that together and I'm surprised the rate isn't higher than 50% today.<br>
<br>
Intrigued - if you don't mind talking about, I'm curious -- how did they come to diagnose your dad with cancer?  Routine check-up, he was complaining of symptoms?  <br>
<br>
Arleanna - I think I can answer most of what you wrote right here: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it does seem a bit far-fetched to my uneducated self that increased oxygen is a cureall for all forms of cancer</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Again, I never said it cured cancer...I said it prevents it.  Prevention is the name of the game...'dig the well before you're thirsty'.  <br>
<br>
As for submarines and oxygen limits, I'm not sure on this (any divers wanna chip in) but I think what you're referring to is that anything under a certain depth the oxygen is mixed or cut with helium...but that's a pressure issue and not to limit their oxygen intake.  Oxygen's too heavy or something so they need to mix in something lighter.  Oxygen toxicity as you call it is again I think pressure, not level.  When they surface too fast divers get the 'bends' and change pressures before the body can adjust.  The treatment is to oversaturate their cells WITH oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber, bringing them up to normal pressure at even rates.<br>
<br>
As for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ...correctly high oxygen and high blood PH will kill all cancerous cells before they can mutate?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it doesn't work quite that way.  You're right in that cells are constantly damaged or mutated, but as I said DNA normally edits these chains out and/or repairs them.  Everytime.  In fact there's 'checkpoints' in the cell cycle where the cell determines if the DNA sequences are all viable for mitosis, and if not it stops until they are.  It's when the cell fails to repair the damaged nucleotide sequences that the cells mutate beyond control and become cancerous.  Specifically, without getting into the whole cell cycle theory too much, there's several different DNA sequences that must fail before cancer arises.  Like the p53 protein (which plays a part in 2 parts of the cell cycle) forces damaged or bad cells to commit 'suicide'.  It must mutate (in both instances) until it can no longer keep damaged cells from mitosis.   There's a bunch of checks and balances the cell uses, but it all comes down to oncogenes, which control growth rate.  When the growth rate goes awry, there's too many copies being reproduced at once and complete DNA strands can't be assured for every cell.  So more cells are growing, but they're not cancerous. Then mutations happen in the cells themselves due to imcomplete or faulty nucleotide sequences, and then they replicate...now you have cancer.  As I understand it anyways.  This all happens when the conditions as was previously described are present, that of low oxygen high acidic pH.  High blood pH is inducive to aerobic reactions, which is what normal cells need.  Cancer as you recall is anearobic, an entity that relies on fermentation to survive.  That's why highly alkaline blood pH doesn't allow the growth of cancerous cells but in no way harms normal cells.  So, without an environment suitable for all those things to fail, they won't.  Of course, if you're talking about ultra-high levels of radiation sure you'll overpower the cells by damaging so many sequences at once.  Akin to promoting free radical damage by ingesting easily avoidable toxins, like cigarette smoke.<br>
<br>
As for pharmaceuticals not 'prescribing' to other homeopathic alternatives...again why they should they?  They're in the business to make money, not ensure the health or the public good.  There is no profit in curing, only treatment.<br>
<br>
Damn these things get to be too long.

<br>
In many states, doctors don't tell low income patients of procedures that may save them, because they are forbidden to by the insurance companies.<br>
<br>
Many doctors routinely prescribe medicines that are not the most effective for a patients symptoms, due to kick backs from pharmacutical companies.<br>
<br>
Healthcare is a multi billion dollar business and when you are talking in numbers that big, I don't see why it's hard to believe they will manupilate conditions to better serve profits.<br>
<br>
Look at the oil business. Is there anyone who doesn't know that there have been systems developed that get well over a hundred miles to the gallon? Did the oil companies have any problems buying up rights to those devices?<br>
<br>
I am not saying it's a giant conspiracy, but it is in most healthcare providers interest to make people who have inexpensive cures look crazy. I don't know enough about chemistry or biology to know whether Dvinn's case is strong, but I know of other areas where legitimate practices with proven results are shunned and ridiculed by western medicine... and I believe they do it for self preservation. <p><br>

It really becomes a question of how you would like to die...Of hunger because with preservatives/pest control we could not possible supply the food demand of every portion of the country. And if we could many people would not be able to afford to eat as much as they needed.<br>

Sharks have never gotten cancer, and experiments in laboratories to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> give</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> them cancer have all failed.  That's why they sell shark cartilage in health food stores.  The idea behind the cartilage though is that it prohibits tumors from growing new blood vessels to feed itself.  Not really a preventative thing in my book and I don't take it.  Plus the cartilage works for the shark because it is all cartilage; sharks have no skeleton.  <br>
<br>
Second point, uh we pay our farmers not to produce.  They use toxins and pesticides because they actually overgrow food still, which depletes minerals and nutrients from the soil that plants need.  Without those nutrients and minerals, the plants cannot defend themselves naturally and become more of a target for insects and disease.  Again we treat the symptoms by spraying chemicals on our crops instead of addressing the cause by planting wisely to replenish the soil and return the plant to its natural balance.  I don't see that without these toxins our life span would be shorter, no.  But the pesticide companies sure do see it that way.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uintriguedbyu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IntriguedByu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.homegame.org/Ironf/Littleangel.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 3:17:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.homegame.org/Ironf/Littleangel.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Dvin....<br>

Interesting story on how he found out actually...He was having symptoms, (without too much detail...a change in the way he pees) His doctor told him it was nothing he was &quot;just getting old&quot; and that he did not need a PSA test. (simple blood test to determine whether you have the Prostate antigen in your blood-a reading over 4.0 is considered trouble).  A few months later he joined the local Veterans hospital just for a back up to his medical plan and went for a physical there. When he told them of his symptoms and upon a simply exam his prostate was enlarged.  They ordered a PSA and it came up about 64.  After a biopsy it was determined he had advanced prostate cancer that had spread outside to the seminal vesicles.  <br>
<br>
My dad finds it hysterical we are discussing his prostate here, lol  I told him its better than the usual in my opinion.  I hope he don't start calling me a loot hoor too :/<br>
