<br>
you've heard the phrase &quot;born again christian&quot; .  even though its an overused term.  why do you think people break down in tears  after they &quot;convert&quot;.  I never broke down in tears, but nothing compares to the feeling you get after you finally accepting christianity.  people dont fake these emotions.  and I have never seen people's lives change so radically after choosing buddha.<br>
<br>
its nothing to say to yourself &quot;buddha, I believe in you, enlighten me&quot;<br>
<br>
but its REALLY hard to say for the first time &quot;jesus, I believe in you, I want you to be a part my life&quot;  and mean it.<br>

I'm sure it IS nothing for you to say anything about Buhdda to yourself, you don't know anything about that fat bastad except to believe that he's a heathen God.  You are assuming that your experience is unique to your religon without trying any others.  There are many many wiser men than me who have explained the use of mass hysteria to induce what you experienced.  Check out some Evangelists who make people faint by touching them.. it's mostly either faked or suggestively induced using mass, extreme emotions.  Similar to a coach whipping his team up for a big game.<br>

Arnon, dunno what bible you found, but that's a complete out of context paraphrasation of 8 verses...  here is the king james version of the 8th verse.  There are no qualifiers to this statement in previous verses.<br>

Revelation 21:8<br>

If so, then I think you are extremely close-minded.<br>
<br>
If not, then how do you express this as proof that your religon is the correct one?  Instead of just the one you happened to get the most exposure to.<br>
<br>
I think it's arrogant to assume that THE Bible is the right one versus all the other bibles and bible-like books out there with no knowledge of any but one.  I think it's foolish to assume that God forces you to choose the correct Bible on faith, much less which existance he actually is.  I prefer to believe that he doesn't really care which religon you follow and instead will judge you upon your acts versus their morality.<br>
<br>
I think that there is a lot that most christians don't know about their own Bible and it's history much less have any knowledge about books like the Koran.  Choose??  I don't think you've made a choice.  I think you've been fed a belief and accepted it blindly as true. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

You have to read what is leading up to that.<br>
<br>
All dead will arise, people will be judged and pay, the book of life will be read, those not in the book of life will be cast down to the lake, &quot;How do ya get in the book of life? I got lazy and quit researching there.&quot; God will make a new earth for the happy go lucky peeps who will follow him, everyone will not have to worry cause the bad people will go poof in the lake. <br>
<br>
The book might be read before judgeing. If ya take it in order it seem to say every on the new earth will be thrown into the fire if they are bad. &quot;I read in order but who know it's an ancient book altered to fit the political times over the years to establish power for kings and pope. Who knows what or how it originally read.&quot;<br>

Why are you guys arguing about one verse in the book of Revelation?  I mean, besides the fact that even Protestant Christian theologians can't agree on what it means, the book is filled with more symbolism than the rest of the Bible combined; with the exception perhaps being the book of Daniel, which is also filled with prophecy, though not quite as much as Revelation, and MUCH easier to understand than Revelation.<br>
<br>
The interpretations of Revelation and Daniel are just like hearing scientists try to explain one of their theories that has absolutely no hard evidence; only lots of guesses.  Listening to people argue about Revelation who haven't even studied the Gospels is sorta like those Holiday Inn commercials.  You know the ones... Some guy is explaining everything about this virus and how it can't get to them since they've got their suits on and they're airtight, and somebody asks him how long he's been studying the ooga-booga virus.  He answers, &quot;Well, I'm not exactly a scientist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night.&quot;<br>
<br>
You guys are the same way.  You have no validity, no certification.  You can't even form conclusions and cite similarities between 2 different books of the Bible.  You can't even figure out what the context of one single text means by reading the entire chapter.  No sir, can't waste your time with the whole chapter when you only care about one text.  Of course, you make your assumptions on a religion by quoting under 20 verses or by trying to relate verses together which are talking about totally different things.<br>
<br>
Its like a level 45 druid who has solo'd their entire EQ career trying to explain that the 50+ game isn't really any different than the 1-50 game.  If you're 50+, you'd laugh at him for being a total n00b, but then you come onto a messageboard and do the exact same thing.  <br>
<br>
Funny thing about this analogy, though.  See, if the druid actually takes the time to learn how to group, and learns that he shouldn't nuke and run around trying to kite, and learns that a raid isn't nearly as fun as he thought, and learns that during said raid he has to buff and med about 90% of the time, and only gets to fight 10% of the time (if you consider healing as fighting), then his earlier opinion of the game being &quot;the same&quot; at higher levels will change.  But his &quot;knowledge&quot; will only reflect his current level, so if he's a clueless n00b, he can't understand what the next step is like... not until he experiences it himself.<br>
<br>
Wolvar, stop being a clueless n00b.  If you want to argue, go get your facts straight.  Here's some pointers in your quest for knowledge:<br>
1. the Bible doesn't read like a novel.  Its not there to entertain you, and they don't sell these things to make the author any money.  Study it, and use your brain to unwrap what its talking about.<br>
2.  even if you think its a load of crap, and don't believe it at all, its still an excellent brain exercise to practice your translation skills, your research skills, your referencing and cross-referencing skills, and your deductive reasoning.<br>
3.  don't read Revelation and Daniel unless you're prepared to talk to a ton of Bible-thumpers.  Alone you will never figure out what they're talking about, so if you can't handle being around those crazy preacher folk, don't waste your time.<br>
4.  read the gospels first, THEN start at Genesis.  Even if you aren't planning on being converted, you need to see the love of God in the gospels to understand his character (real or imagined, doesn't matter).  If you don't know his character, you won't understand why God is so vindictive in Genesis and Exodus and Joshua and Judges and Samuel, etc etc.<br>
<br>
bah, enough points.  I've wasted too much time on somebody who's going to tell me I'm &quot;better than this&quot; even though he doesn't have a clue who I am.<br>

Have you seriously studied any other religons?  If not, then you were fed a belief and haven't been exposed to any others.  Of course you made a choice, but it wan't a choice of which religon, but a choice to believe what everyone else die, or go look elsewhere for your beliefs.  The belief you asked if i were &quot;fed&quot; was one of my own devising after being steeped in christianity and forced to study the Bible so much that I realized that the Bible isn't consistant.  This led me to look into other religons... not as many as I should have, but more than a few and definitely more than the one my parents and family exposed me to.  I'm just merely trying to point out the arrogance in the claim that THIS (whatever) religon is right, especially when said claimer knows squat about any other religon.<br>

Arnon, there are 7 previous verses to the chapter, none of which say you can find redemption during God's return.  The book of life that is mentioned has the names of those in it that are granted entrance to heaven; all of those names were written in that book &quot;before time began&quot;.  Meaning, there is already a list, and you might be on it and you might not... but it doesn't seem to mean that you can get put in it at the last minute which is what you were trying to argue with me about.

1. the Bible doesn't read like a novel. Its not there to entertain you, and they don't sell these things to make the author any money. Study it, and use your brain to unwrap what its talking about.<br>
2. even if you think its a load of crap, and don't believe it at all, its still an excellent brain exercise to practice your translation skills, your research skills, your referencing and cross-referencing skills, and your deductive reasoning.<br>
3. don't read Revelation and Daniel unless you're prepared to talk to a ton of Bible-thumpers. Alone you will never figure out what they're talking about, so if you can't handle being around those crazy preacher folk, don't waste your time.<br>
4. read the gospels first, THEN start at Genesis. Even if you aren't planning on being converted, you need to see the love of God in the gospels to understand his character (real or imagined, doesn't matter). If you don't know his character, you won't understand why God is so vindictive <br>

1. Of course it doesn't read like any novel that you've read.  Why don't you explain for the crowd Mr. Meorah what a 200 AD novel &quot;reads like&quot; and how you can tell anything about the bible as compared to other writings of it's time.  <br>
<br>
2. Of course it is, but what's even better is to see the similarities in completely different religons, some of them so blatantly obvious that you can't help but wonder.<br>
<br>
3. The bible thumpers can't agree on what they think it means in many cases.  Most of them, the ones that are worth discussing it with, will tell you that straight out.  It's not that hard to follow, and what's great is how people try to make revelations so figuratively and symbolic yet try to make other parts of the Bible so literal.<br>
<br>
4.  The Gospels cover about 30 years of a Man named Jesus' love.  The old testament covers about 2000 years of an impulsive, vindictive, jealous and destructive God.  The only correllation implied is that God, under the new covenant of Jesus' sacrifice, is a much more benevolent God.  Jesus is the image we see when we think of God.  Yet Jesus is not God and Revelations doesn't sound like God has changed much from his old testament self... except that he's not around causing destruction and doom these days.  <br>
<br>
I actually think it's interesting that people's perception of God changed with the New testament books.  However, I think that perception was changed largely because many of the new testament books didn't make it into the Bible.  I think that's because the author's hadn't picked up on the change and some of the unknown prophet's missives were distinctively old-testament styled writings, so you've never read them.

<br>
Taken from the official site of the Israeli Defense Forces.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Following are excerpts from a sermon given Friday, October 13, 2000 in the Zayed bin Sultan Aal Nahyan mosque in Gaza, broadcast live on the official Palestinian Authority television. The speaker is Dr. Ahmad Abu Halabiya, Member of the PA appointed &quot;Futwa Council&quot; and former acting Rector of the Islamic University in Gaza:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;None of the Jews refrain from committing any possible evil. If the Labor party commits the evil and the crime, the Likud party stands by it; and if the Likud party commits the evil and the crime, the Labor party stands by it… The Jews are Jews, whether Labor or Likud… They do not have any moderates or any advocates of peace. They are all liars. They all want to distort truth, but we are in possession of the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;O brother believers, the criminals, the terrorists are the Jews, who have butchered our children, orphaned them, widowed our women and desecrated our holy places and sacred sites. They are the terrorists. They are the ones who must be butchered and killed, as Allah the Almighty said: &quot;Fight them: Allah will torture them at your hands, and will humiliate them and will help you to overcome them, and will relieve the minds of the believers…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;O brothers in belief, this is the case of the Jews and their habitual conduct, and what happened yesterday, and has been going on for two weeks, and before that for many years, and which will be repeated in future years unless we stand up like men and unless we have the known Muslim position, [the position] of those who wage Jihad in the path of Allah, those who defend their rights and who sacrifice all that is dear to them.&quot;<br>
&quot;O brothers in belief, the beautiful bride has a costly price and dowry… Our bride is paradise, o brothers in belief. …The cost and the dowry of this bride, the dowry of this paradise, is that we fight in the path of Allah, and kill and be killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Allah has purchased from the believers their persons and their property in return for the promise that they shall have paradise, for they fight in the cause of Allah, and they slay the enemy and are slain. This is a promise that He [Allah] has made incumbent upon Himself, as set out in the Torah, and Gospel and the Koran&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We say to the Jews, and we say to Clinton, and we say to all those who supported the Jews and still cooperate with the Jews, we say to them, that this will not shake us, we are the Palestinian people, who are positioned in the land of the Isra' and Mi'raj. It will not shake a single hair of ours. Our determination will not sway. We will raise the banner of Jihad…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;America and Europe and the world were shocked by the kidnapping of three tramps, the kidnapping of three wretched soldiers, and the killing of two in Ramallah. But their feelings were not moved, and they did not shudder when they say the children Muhammad ad-Durrah and other women, and men, and youths - being martyred by cannons and missiles, and all the barbaric instruments and the Jews possess.&quot;<br>
&quot;They were moved, for the sake of five persons, and the world went into turmoil and it will not stop for Clinton or for the old hag Albright, they will not be relieved, and they will not cease to be concerned, and they will not rest until the Jews return to their families. But as for the Palestinians, as for this pure blood, it can go to Hell in the eyes of the Americans and Europe and the Jews&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the truth, O Brothers in belief. From here, Allah and almighty has called upon us not to ally with the Jews or the Christians, not to like them, not to become their partners, not to support them, and not to sign agreements with them. And he who does that, is one of them, as Allah said: &quot;O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies, for they are allies of one another. Who from among you takes them as allies will indeed be one of them&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Jews are the allies of the Christians, and the Christians are the allies of the Jews, despite the enmity that exists between them. The enmity between the Jews and the Christians is deep, but all of them are in agreement against the monotheists - against those who say, 'There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger,' that is they are against you, O Muslims.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if an agreement of Gaza is signed - we shall not forget Haifa, and Acre, and the Galilee, and Jaffa, and the Triangle and the Negev, and the rest of our cities and villages. It is only a matter of time. The weak will not remain forever weak, and the strong will not remain forever strong… If we are weak today… and we are not able to regain our rights, then at least we have to pass on the banner - waving high - to our children and grandchildren…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;None of the factions is allowed to stand on the sidelines at this stage, or not to think well of avenging our pure martyrs and wounded. …Our people must unite in one trench, and receive armaments from the Palestinian leadership, to confront the Jews. By Allah, the Jews, O brothers in belief, do not know, nor have they ever known throughout history, anything but force and Jihad in the path of Allah. The Jews are like a [gas] pedal - as long as you step on it with your foot, it doesn't move, but if you lift your foot from it, it hurts you and punishes you. That is the case of the Jews.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country. Fight them, wherever you are. Wherever you meet them, kill them. Wherever you are, kill those Jews and those Americans who are like them - and those who stand by them - they are all in one trench, against the Arabs and the Muslims - because they established Israel here, in the beating heart of the Arab world, in Palestine. They created it to be the outpost of their civilization - and the vanguard of their army, and to be the sword of the West and the crusaders, hanging over the necks of the monotheists, the Muslims in these lands. They wanted the Jews to be their spearhead&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us put our trust in Allah, close ranks, and unite our words, and the slogan of us all should be, 'Jihad! Jihad! For the sake of Palestine, and for the sake of Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa!'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We will not give up a single grain of soil of Palestine, from Haifa, and Jaffa, and Acre, and Mulabbas [Petah Tikva] and Salamah, and Majdal [Ashkelon], and all the land, and Gaza, and the West Bank…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Allah, deal with the Jews, your enemies and the enemies of Islam. Deal with the crusaders, and America, and Europe behind them, O Lord of the worlds.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
<br>
Now. In my mind if during the commision of his &quot;Jihad&quot; someone puts a bullet through this jokers head, it's nothing close to murder, it's simply taking out the trash. He's preaching to his country's children who are listening to kill Jews, Christians, Americans, Europeans (if anyone didn't get it the first time, anyone who isn't Muslim) because they're distasteful in the eyes of his god. This guy doesn't represent the average Muslim, but he is in a position of power and if people actually did what he calls for it would be worldwide chaos. This is the sort of idiocy that is bred when people are allowed to force their ideas on others whether it be religion or otherwise, however religion is the motive in a vast majority of cases.<br>
<br>
This is an example of why people ignore overzealous religious extremists.<br>

Say wut? Well, that explains New York cabs. <br>
<br>
But seriously, this is a prime example of religious fanatisism. And, I want to point out that this is NOT a specific ISLAMIC brand of loonacy. This has NOTHING to do with islam at all, it is just religion. At this point in time, islam has a LOT of power in that region of the world, and that is why islam has gotten so crazy. Here in the west, we have managed to subdue religion a little bit, and taken away its power. So you don't get quite as much craziness. <br>
<br>
Islam is no more wrong and crazy than any other religion. Xenophobia is based on ignorance and fear: the very same building blocks upon which all religious foundations are built. The stronger a religion gets, the dumber, and more dangerous it gets. <br>

And people will actually blindly listen to him.

It would be the equivalent of one of our senators making that speech. I don't know of course but I bet Yassir wasn't too happy about this speech either, seeing as he's trying to secure land for his people while trying to keep his people and the Israelis from killing each other. Despite what some people think I don't think he's a bad guy, he's just protecting his interests. Not that he hasn't done some very bad shit in his time.

<br>
I have only one firm belief about the American political system, and that is this: God is a Republican and Santa Claus is a Democrat.<br>
<br>
God is an elderly or, at any rate, middle-aged mate, a stern fellow, patriarchal rather than paternal and a great believer in rules and regulations. He holds men strictly accountable for their actions. He has little apparent concern for the material well-being of the disadvantaged. He is politically connected, socially powerful and holds the mortgage on literally everything in the world. God is difficult. God is unsentimental. It is very hard to get into God's heavenly country club.<br>
<br>
Santa Claus is another matter. He's cute. He's nonthreatening. He's always cheerful. And he loves animals. He may know who's been naughty and who's been nice, but he never does anything about it. He gives everyone everything they want without thought of a quid pro quo. He works hard for charities, and he's famously generous to the poor. Santa Claus is preferable to God in every way but one: <br>
There is no such thing as Santa Claus.</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I guess it depends on how important that choice is to you.  A child can choose what he wants to drink, but his choice is limited to the drinks that his parents have available.  If a kid grows up in a house where the only thing to drink is milk, tea or water, then he's making a choice on his favorite drink from limited options.  When he becomes an adult... he can either refuse to even consider other drinks, confident that his choice of favorites is correct notwithstanding his limited experience; or he can begin trying new drinks until he finds a new favorite or is satisfied that his favorite is correct.<br>
<br>
That analogy is much more frivilous than a religon choice, but I think it gets the point across.  My point was that I don't think you have done ANY investigation into other religons; most people don't.  There is nothing wrong with telling people that you think that your way is the best way (in any situation) however, doing so with little to no knowledge of any other way is pretty funny when applied to any other situation.<br>

I started reading the Bible with comprehension before I was 3, I understood KingJames english before I knew the some of the appropriate modern terms.  By the time I started school, I had read the entire bible and could quote passages from memory and relate them to real world situations.  I didn't have the strength of will or the bravery to &quot;question&quot; anything till I was well into my teens.  At first, I thought that there really WAS an answer to my many questions.  I questioned everyone I knew in a church with over 10,000 members.  Invariably, I came to realize that no one has the answers.<br>
<br>
The answers to my questions were usually &quot;God is/was testing the person&quot;.  Which is inexplicable given the omnipotence thing.  The whole all-knowin/all-seeing/all-powerful thing makes for a TON of fallacies and duplicities and contradictions in a book that large.  So, I concluded that either the Bible is false, or that large portions of the Bible are false or misrepresented.  Since almost every version of Christianity basis it's entire belief off of the premise that the Bible is completely true and it's obvious to me that the Bible CANNOT be completely true; I couldn't follow christianity.<br>
<br>
I haven't scoped out every religon, but I haven't found one that is consistant enough for me to follow.  Some religons are easily ruled out...  <br>
Catholics believe that the pope is infallible, some new Catholics qualified that to mean only when interpreting the Bible.. Catholics pray to Saints, God says to pray to no one but him.. etc.etc.etc. /bye Catholics<br>
Christian Scienctists believe that there is no need for Doctors and that death and disease is God's will. LOL /bye ChristianScience<br>
...some require a lot more in-depth study than I'm willing to devote to this decision.  Although I'm told by people that I respect that the Koran is more believable than the Bible.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wasn't trying to criticize your research nor compare it to mine, I was merely trying to raise the point that research should be a part of any decision as important as this one.  Do you think that I'm going to hell?  Do you think alla muslims are going to hell?<br>

It reminds me of the joke tour of heaven where the catholics were partying and the baptists were dancing and all the christians were in there own special, seperate area and God said &quot;SHhhhhhhh, tiptoe... they think that they are the only ones here.&quot; <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0">

I know the basic beliefs of the other major religions, judaism, catholicism, islam, buddhism.  And I DO believe that the feeling I was talking about earlier is unique to christianity.  For example, buddhists and muslims practice a very strict religion.  Such as days or weeks of meditation, and having to kneel and pray towards the sun every day or something along those lines.  The difference between that and christianity is, you wont be &quot;cursed&quot; if you dont do a certain thing, or if you do something wrong, because every sin (except one) is forgivable.. nothing you do is going to condemn you for eternity, as long as you believe Jesus.  unlike islams who.. are seen as heretics if they don't visit meccha once in their lifetimes to walk in a big circle around a monolith??? ya.. that makes sense.<br>
<br>
And if followers of these other religions are just as convinced of their own religion, why are there no Buddhist or Hindu missionaries coming to america to show us the light?  But there are thousands of christian missionaries going to india etc..  I feel lucky to have grown up with christianity.  If I grew up in India, I would probably practice hinduism like my parents..  but Im sure I would hear about christianity in my lifetime.  and I remember a bible verse saying that he wont &quot;judge&quot; anyone who hasnt heard the message of christianity.  So, if a hindu practices it his whole life but never heard about christianity, he wont burn in hell.  but once he is introduced to christianity, he has a choice to accept it or reject it.
