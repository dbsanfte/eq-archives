<br>
Domination/Unforgiving, I won that one, though I didnt have as many chin rolls, mine was large and filled with excess fat, that if I had a dimple on my chin that my chin would like a pot belly attached to my face, though with my goatee it does look like a fat woman's genital area.<br>
<br>
I think I have established the fact that I weigh 900 plus pounds, live in my parents basement, have the computer right near my bed to post when I dont pass out from exhaustion of breathing. Yes, I am fat, ugly and a total loser, and I hope that is all you guys ever know of me, because I dont need to impress ya telling ya how many girls I fucked * in my mind *, or how I go to all the fab parties * when I say parties I mean the bathroom * and how I drive a huge car * well its my parents and they drive me around and to burger king *.<br>
<br>
What the fuck do I gotta impress you fuckwads for? So for record I masterbate constantly ( when I can reach that damn thing over my fat rolls ) thinking about you, I dont go outside at all, I only roll out of bed when my mom needs to wash my ass with a hose and change my sheets, and I enjoy living in my parent's basement, eating my nacho chips and jolt cola ( do they even make the stuff still ? ), I am unemployed, have mental problems, love PORN, and have some sort of fungus growing on my ass. <br>
<br>
Dont be jealous.<br>

I'm of the opinion that when hell was set to spit out the ultimate Quote Flamer, the server burped and satan hit the &quot;POST&quot; button twice, thereby generating two of us.<br>
<br>
Our styles divurge widely though, aside from that notable similarity.<br>
<br>
DM,<br>
<br>
It was just a clue to my little friend.  I was momentarily annoyed at the thought of him posting a reply, hitting refresh about 6 million times, and dancing around in victory when an immediate reply from me was not forthcoming.  I should be above such thoughts, but unfortunately I'm still not perfect.<br>
<br>
It's a poor habit of mine not to just ditch a flame fest if I was unable to continue it at the time.  If I want to let everyone know I'm banging a chick, I'll say so.  &quot;I'm heading out&quot; doesn't exactly ring with fantastic images of running the town and commiting scandalous debauchery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think you're reading an awful lot into such a small and meaningless phrase.<br>

Ladmo, stroke it to someone else's pic, eh?<br>
<br>
Estevan, go outside and talk to a real girl, dude.  All your sitcom female knowledge from TV is off mark.<br>
<br>
Seriously, you heard of that movie &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; and immediatly remembered the delicate scent of vaseline.<br>
<br>
Fyrestorm...  it's okay, bud.  I thought that fat fucking midget in your sig was you at first. <p><CENTER>

(I) Is there anything so bold
   as an honest person?
think on this....
when your body is pierced
and the draining blood
makes your fingers numb
is it easier to be honest
and face that,
or hide away for a few more minutes...? <>

(II) she stroked the white mane
traced the sacred horn
with her fingertips...
she lightly licked the red smears
from her fingers...
it burned like it was supposed to.
she smiled sadly at the glazed eyes...
a touch less beauty in the world <>

(III) He knew it was time
and hence, he knelt...
pain in arms
and pain in head
he bent his mind in circles
as the blood dript
in circles...
and set his life
upon his lips... <>

(IV) it didn't take a lot
he thought
to fill it up...
and dipping finger
baptised one and all
making sure to save
the rest
till he turned them all
away... <>

(V) She slipped further...
into
the lake...
and the wetness
was mostly from her eyes.
what she thought was best
was being afraid
and in that
she turned away
her every wish... <>
