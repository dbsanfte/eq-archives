We need more flames. I notice whenever a good flame war gets going and one of the &quot;nice&quot; people starts getting hurt all his freinds will come out of the wood work and say &quot;this thread is lame..&quot; Well, fuck that we need more flamage!<br>
<br>
Let me throw some gasoline on this if can. Don't worry if any of this is true of not, just run with with it. Remember, be angry!<br>
<br>
- This whole feud started because Bowynn posted some stupid shit about Concealer and Zomad a long time ago. He was a little newbie with an inferiority complex. Now he's a big newbie with the same complex. Concealer is still more beautiful than you and you can't handle it!! Grow some self respect!<br>
<br>
- OK, I'm an asshole enough to say it: E/V is better at killing uber mobs than anyone one else, and this makes some of you guys green with loot whorish envy! But, we do suck at roleplaying. I'm trying to change that though. But it's hard work and I may need some roleplaying pointers from one of you eternaly sub 50 commandos. I don't normally respond to anyone less than 50 though, so we'll have to work something out.<br>
<br>
- Kreese is a giant asshole. I hate clerics in general, but him in particular. I wouldn't get a rez from him if he paid me. That goes for you other clerics too.<br>
<br>
- Bowynn, what did I tell you about bragging about your epic weapon, newbie? Go buff 50 people on a raid then sit in the corner while the Real damage dealers do their job. Do this for a year and see if you still feel important. WTG dumbass, you are now like every other 50+ enchanter!!! (but I am jealous, and I wish you dead)<br>
<br>
- On the subject of importance, why would you even think your amazingly lame accomplishments list would impress Zomad (or anyone else for that matter) in this arguement? I made choclate chip coookies last night and everyone at work this morning said they were fab!! GO ME!!! WOOHOO!! Yeah I see you chocolate chip cookie people breaking a smile.. WELL STOP IT! BE ANGRY JACKASS!<br>
<br>
- Zomad has a very small dick. Most Vagrants are asian and they all suffer from RL tiny dick syndrome. AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT! HAH!<br>
<br>
- Loveseeker bought Bowynn's account on ebay. I know this for a fact becuase Lumaden told me so himself. I have screenshots.<br>
<br>
- Krickett is not just a newbie, he's a fucking newbie!! Can I get some roleplaying pointers please? I'm trying to make friends in EQ! And your sig is stupid as fuck. Let me post another sig to show you how funny yours isn't (but makes as much sense... if you can call it that): &quot;A dog going to a human veterinarian is like taking you car to a mechanic who's never owned a car&quot; Wow! My sides hurt...<br>
<br>
- STFU Bacris! That was a preemptive STFU, I know you are thinking of responding. DON'T DO IT! The 80's are gone man, and Guns and Roses will never be what it was... Let it go!<br>
<br>
Remember, if anyone says I owned everyone else with this post, then this thread rocks. But if you attack me in anyway, I'll have a dozen of my friends do a &quot;This thread is lame...&quot; post. <br>
<br>
In conclusion, you are all jealous of me because I'm more beautiful than you. Losers... you probably talked about the prom queen behind her back, too. GET OVER IT! SHE WON! YOU DIDN'T! <br>
<br>
Damn, the things I do to amuse myself sometimes... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 546<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/01 12:06:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=182.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visveres.com/ezboard/members/bowynn1.jpg width=118 hieght=191></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kreese Unveiled!</span><hr size=1> Yay.. I was worried my day was gonna be boring!<br>
----<br>
Zomad, lemme clue you in on a few things:<br>
<br>
I am #1 Enchanter in my guild, and #1 Int Caster as well.  You *were* a 4th rank Necromancer...  Tell me again, what exactly are you trying to say?<br>
<br>
I had my guild in Hate 3 times for the Vampire Essence.  At no time did I push the puller to pull nothing but Revenants.  The other 20 times I was in Hate that month was as a guest with other guilds.. you dig?  Comprende?<br>
<br>
That new community I spoke of was an out of game community, not a guild, you moron.  It also has several members of YOUR guild in it.  Suck it up.<br>
<br>
That Tribunal leadership commitee included Koshy (though a bit late heh) and Khaldan as well.  Funny that you say &quot;Tribunal Leadership commitee which does nothing but trying to benefit the lesser guilds, and creating a bunch of restrictions on planar rights.&quot;  Here's a clue, idiot.<br>
<br>
&quot;In conclusion, all your accomplishment is nothing to glorious.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said they were.  I was accused of having no Accomplishments, and simply offered proof to the contrary.  Again, I ask you, what are YOUR accomplishments?  You got an Item drop?  WEEE!!  WHOOO!!  Someone allowed you to loot an item, AWESOME!<br>
<br>
&quot;you think you are EQUAL to tier1 simply because you paid the same amount of money and you are being nice. What you failed to realize is that the ppl in tier1 often are the same as you, but simply they put more time and effort into EQ.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's a crock of shit, and you know it.  Just because someone isn't in one of the leading guilds on the server doesn't mean they haven't put in MORE time and MORE effort than you.  I've busted my ass to be good, I've busted my ass to outfit myself for some survivability WITHOUT the benefit of treasure just being handed to me.  I worked my ass off for meager shit.  Through some hard work, luck, and saving every plat I got my hands on, I made it just as far as most of you.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I have nothing against Bowynn until he started to attack my friends with false information (events and image).&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh really?  So, you didn't just randomly post your little bullshit jabs at me on every post of mine you found?  You're an idiot and a liar.  I posted a funny pic and called it Kreese.  I'm sorry if that made sex between the two of you a little stressful:<br>
<br>
Zomad: Honey?  What's wrong?<br>
Kreese: Nothing.<br>
Zomad: Come on, sweetie, I know that look<br>
Kreese: it's... that darn Bowynn.  <br>
Zomad: The cute one i always flame for no reason cause i'm a moron?<br>
Kreese: yeah.. he posted a fake a libelous picture and said it was me.  I'm hurt, and my wee wee is just not feeling up to it tonight.<br>
Zomad: With God as my witness.. I'm gonna get that bastard!<br>
Kreese: I love you honey<br>
Zomad: I love you too, snookums<br>
Kreese: Practice your dood speak<br>
Zomad: OK r u sure u r alright?<br>
Kreese: I'll make it, love... Call Darkmask to come flame him for no particular reason... he likes defending Fuckwads like us and he hasn't stuck his nose into an issue to talk about dicks in a long time.<br>
Zomad: U got it.<br>
Kreese: kiss!<br>
Zomad: Kiss!<br>
<br>
UNF!!<br>
<br>
&quot;Did i bring up the &quot;powerful&quot; issue? No, Bowynn did.&quot;<br>
<br>
heh, read your own post, asshole.  You're the one who accused me of have no accomplishments or skills.  If that isn't a pompous display of your own ego, I don't know what is. <br>
<br>
&quot;Did i come here first to start shouting? Bowynn did, with his fake pic to do a personal attack on Kreese.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry about that.. Did he quit crying yet?  I feel just awful.<br>
------------<br>
<br>
Darkmask,<br>
<br>
&quot;Bowynn, why do you have to play &quot;dick size&quot; with everyone?&quot;<br>
<br>
It seemed the game Zomad and Kreese were playing, so I joined in.  If you're too fucking blind to see what arrogant cocks your guildmates are, don't come pissing at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;those accomplishments are nice Bowynn but seriously, dont do that crap, you wont win a dick size match with an E/V&quot;<br>
<br>
1) Those accomplishments don't mean dick, DM, I listed some things I had accomplished because your Jackhole buddy said I hadn't accomplished anything.  I didn't enter a dicksize match, I made a point.  Don't make it into something it wasn't, seriously, don't do that crap.<br>
<br>
2) Are you telling me that because someone is in E/V they are unequivocably better than anyone else and beyond compare?  Have you lost it?  I'm laughing here as I think of Kreese, who is disliked by FAR more than just me, Vohzd, whom if you've been absent from your guild's events, likes to pull giant dwarf trains on his own guild in Icewell, Vasdenjas, who was Far superior to almost all of your clerics BEFORE he was in E/V.  <br>
<br>
Or are you just talking about me?  Are you trying to tell me that by the very NATURE of me not having an Elitist or Vagrants guild tag above my head that I will never amount to anything?  Is that your point?  I'd honestly like to know.<br>
<br>
&quot;I like ya Bowynn but trying to prove how uber you are is just sad, be content in what you are&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't give a shit if you like me or not.  I also have no desire to show anyone how &quot;uber&quot; I am.  I let you do that with your &quot;dicksize&quot; comparisons.  I am who I am.  I'm content with who I am, because I worked my ass off to be who I am.  Fact is, I'm as capable, if not more so, than any E/V enchanter.  That's not a dick contest, DM, so calm down, that's simple truth...  get used to it.  I don't need a guild tag to know my own worth and ability, so suck my &quot;asian dick.&quot;<br>
<br>
Does this mean I'm &quot;better&quot; than anyone?  Not at all, I'm no better than anyone else on this server, but then again, neither are you or anyone else, I don't give a fuck what you think in terms of dick size...  We're all people wasting a huge amount of time on a game.  Some of us are good at a game because we are, and some of us think we are good at a game because we are labeled in with the people who are.  Sad thing is when someone who THINKS they are something special because of this label insults someone who doesn't need a label to play well.<br>
<br>
&quot;This thread is lame, its gonna be another bash E/V uber guild cause someone feels left out...&quot;<br>
<br>
Blame Zomad for that.  I posted a funny picture and called it Kreese.  Zomad came in here in typical fashion and made it about something else.  You come in here under the guise of wise guru, when all you really say is &quot;Unless you are in E/V, suck it, because you will never be as good.&quot;  I like ya, Darkmask, but it's the truth.<br>
<br>
&quot;there will always be someone better then you...&quot;<br>
<br>
No truer words were ever spoken. <p><center>

This statement is only true in your fantasy world. You shouldn't state your opinions as facts, esspecially when you are addressing people who know better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 548<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/01 12:46:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=182.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visveres.com/ezboard/members/bowynn1.jpg width=118 hieght=191></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kreese Unveiled!</span><hr size=1> Tatianna,<br>
<br>
(Btw, nice post, had me laughing)<br>
<br>
I'll say it again.  Fact is, I'm as capable, if not more so, than any E/V enchanter.<br>
<br>
Don't believe me?  Prove it.<br>
<br>
Skill:  Well, as Zomad said, it doesn't take much skill to mezz mobs.  What it does take skill is timing, spell choice, and your spell combos.  I got all that. *yawn*  It also helps if you are attentive to buff requests.<br>
<br>
Spells:  True, I'm missing some.  I'll have those soon.  I do, however, have the ones that really make the difference.  I really don't think another DoT is gonna make a ton of difference.  <br>
<br>
Attendance:  Well, at a little E/V get together recently in Icewell Keep your own guild enchanter couldn't stay.  That left just me.  I was ONLY there because Oneton asked and I have a few friends in E/V.  I died several times due to Vohzd pulling before Oneton was ready, the Senchenal being tough and me getting on the hatelist by chain-runing when Vasden was low on mana.  I didn't complain, I got back to it.  I wasn't there for loot, and I certainly had no interest in FUCKING my dwarf faction.  I recieved one &quot;thank you&quot; from False and that's it... which brings me to<br>
<br>
Integrity:  I've never been about loot.  I don't bitch and whine about what should be mine and when do I get stuff.  I don't fuck people over no mater what the rewards are.  I don't talk kindly to someone and then rip them up behind thier back.  I don't ditch raids because there is nothing in it for me.  If someone needs an item more than I do, I pass it to them even IF I'm ranked higher.  <br>
<br>
So.  What exactly do YOU judge an enchanter's ability by? <p><center>

<br>
He Started it!  Oh my, how EVER will I over come this starteling defence... If posting a silly ass picture is some sort of grevious insult, you and your buddy need a thicker skin.  Sounds like an excuse to stir up shit to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did i bring up the &quot;powerful&quot; issue? No, Bowynn did. He wanted to compare his status to mine. You might wanna re-read this thread again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actualy, you did bring it up by saying he's accomplished nothing.  YOU might want to re-read the thread, paying particular attention to YOUR OWN POSTS.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did i come here first to start shouting? Bowynn did, with his fake pic to do a personal attack on Kreese.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah I can see how hurtful and venomous such a picture could be... You're buddy must have the self esteem of an over-weight 13 year old in gym class if that gets under their skin.  Lucky they've got such staunch defenders as you to jump forward and diverte the thread from them by proving repeatedly your a fucking idiot.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, tell me, if your goal in EQ is not to kill critters, what exactly is your goal?&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said it wasnt my goal.  I just stated, that I could give a shit what YOU'VE accomplished.  I, myself, enjoy mowing hordes of critters and hording items to my my character better.  I just, truely, dont care what you or anyone else has done, killed, gathered, ect, ect...<br>
<br>
&quot;Show how u can type, spell, and display ur effeciency in your writing and reading comprehension? If that's your goal, I think you should look at other places like university&quot;<br>
<br>
When you try to put someone else up for public ridicule, you shouldnt be surprised when someone points out the fact that you talk like a retard on Qualudes.  Dont point out someone else's faults and then be shocked when someone looks as harsly at you.<br>
<br>
But hey, its ok, He started it, right?<br>
<br>
&quot;If your goal is to meet friends, I think it'll be better for you to goto some university clubs, or local clubs, where you can actually meet these ppl in person, oppose to imaginary characters and ppl who you have next to zero chance of meeting in RL.&quot;<br>
<br>
How touching.  Hey thanks for looking out for my social wellfare, no really it means alot to me.  I do just fine, thanks though.<br>
<br>
And hey, you make me glad I have zero chance of meeting most eq people in real life.<br>

I dont need to show how uber I am, but let me tell you I am as good or better then any of you......<br>
<br>
Seems ya are trying to prove it little squirt.<br>
<br>
Ya can revel in the glory of being a star in a small guild or a team player in a power house, either way, it dont matter really, but for all its worth, you play on a losing team, ya you may be the best they got, but no one cares cause when the super bowl rolls around, your team is still fucking 1 - 10 for the season.<br>
<br>
Its time for a reality check Bowynn. You aint shit, check your situation. Check how you want to join the comps cause VV isnt what you want it to be, you know you want to see the bigger shit, do the shit we have been doing for years, you are starting to realize you aint worth shit. <br>
<br>
Yeah a bunch of no name guilds can have a shit load of 60 players farming gear 24/7 or ya can have a guild of people who actually kill new mobs, conquer shit, and dominate the zones you are too afraid to walk into.<br>
<br>
You saunter into the zones after they have been broken and proven by E/V, your little pissant skills couldnt save you. You bitch about Icewell the other night, how no one appreciated you, well fuck you, welcome to the world of a raid enchanter, thats how it is every fucking night for a typical enchanter, we buff, we spend our money on dots, and we die a whole fucking lot and do we get blow jobs to thank us!! NO, this isnt your small world, where the group thanks you for saving them from a train of 6 frogs, this is the world where no one cares about you until they need a buff, that tashing that mob, is uesless but you do it anyway and take the death...You have no fucking clue, so try this shit Bowynn, you are playing in the minor leauges. <br>
<br>
You may be a star to nobodies, but what does that get you? Nothing, false friendships, empty hearts..I was where you were little man. I have been you, been the king of a nothing special, and ya know what, it aint worth jack shit. <br>
<br>
Would you rather be a god in hell, or a servant in heaven? Seriously, ya can blow your own ego up, saying how everyone says you fucking rock, jesus I dont think you go two posts without saying that, you say it more then anyone else does. You are part of a small nothing, a spec on an atom of the universe I have seen and enjoy. Dont believe me, ask a certain someone why they didnt want to play in the minors anymore.....<br>
<br>
Watch your guildmates flock to the power houses....see people realize that there is a whole different world and to get there you have to become less involved and more team focused. When you realize that the game doesnt revolve around you then maybe you can play in this world, but until then you are just a child who wants to be a big boy..........<br>
<br>
No more fucking posts how you fucking rock, and how everyone says you are the greatest and your skills make you super, cause that dont mean shit to me. The more you blow yourself on these boards, the less respect people have for you, the more you try to flaunt, the dumber you look.<br>
<br>
You speak of Zomad kitting Ogres in the Karanas, the bitch was 60 before you were 45, he was fucking slaying mobs solo that you have to plan whole raids around.<br>
<br>
Shall I drop some truth? Your guild has to have three man teams to do the HOLE, for your epic??? thats the garden, take a 5 man team, no, your skills are so deft that you need three teams....oh wait, I know what your excuse will be...they wanted to be with you, around your luminscent personality.....<br>
<br>
Oh and then how many people were there to help you turn in your bundle of staves? couldnt handle the mobs by yourself!!! hahahahaha Yeah tell me more of your skills.....you are the best Bowynn.... keep typing it Bowynn maybe one day it might sound believeable.<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHA<br>
<br>
I live in the glory of what I know and what I have now......<br>
<br>
<br>
And by the way we can discuss dick size if ya want..... I heard all about it...... <br>

Everything else is *monkey targets mob and presses button*. Even my small brain is big enough to mez and stun stuff. But I do suck at buffing people. Especially clerics, never give a cleric clarity. They just abuse their mana pool and start nuking or healing people other than the enchanter. What a bunch of dumbasses.<br>
<br>
The stuff you listed is nice in a My Little Pony sort of way, but most E/V suck at roleplaying and playing nice with others. I already explained that, I thought.<br>

So, let's see now...<br>

E/V &gt; Bowynn<br>
<br>
Equipment:<br>
E/V &gt; Bowynn<br>
<br>
Connection:<br>
who knows, but most E/V have broadband. I'll give you the benifit of the doubt and say Bowynn = E/V.<br>
<br>
OK, I plugged all this into a logic calculator and it gave me the answer: E/V &gt; Bowynn. <br>
<br>
Sorry hun, but I see more psychoanalysis in your future. Thats a nasty chip on your shoulder and you will need more help than we can provide here to remove it.<br>
<br>
If you had said, &quot;I'm just as good if not better, than SOME E/V enchanters&quot; I might agree. But the statement you made is false, untrue, erroneous, incorrect, inaccurate, unsound, counterfactual, illogical, and just plain WRONG.<br>
<br>
Let me state My opinion. And this is in no way a fact, although I realize the teaming hordes of people (BACRIS) who adore me do, in fact, think it's very true:<br>

if you insist *sigh*<br>
<br>
&quot;I dont need to show how uber I am, but let me tell you I am as good or better then any of you......<br>
<br>
Seems ya are trying to prove it little squirt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, I said I'm as good or better.  Read: I'm on an equal plateau.  I don't consider anyone on this server as terribly Uber, therefore putting myself on the same level as NON-UBER people isn't exactly proving myself to be uber, now, is it?<br>
<br>
&quot;you play on a losing team, ya you may be the best they got, but no one cares cause when the super bowl rolls around, your team is still fucking 1 - 10 for the season.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not exactly true.  I'd say the star player on a losing team still has more pride than the 3rd string QB of the superbowl team.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its time for a reality check Bowynn. You aint shit, check your situation. Check how you want to join the comps cause VV isnt what you want it to be&quot;<br>
<br>
*laugh*  exactly when did I say I was joining the Comps?  DM, you're made of the same shit as me.  You're just name brand and I'm not.  Deny it all you want.<br>
<br>
&quot;You saunter into the zones after they have been broken and proven by E/V, your little pissant skills couldnt save you.&quot;<br>
<br>
oh, i'm sorry.. when is the last time your oh so mighty skills saved you without all your buddies backing you up?  You sound like a retard.<br>
<br>
&quot;You bitch about Icewell the other night, how no one appreciated you, well fuck you, welcome to the world of a raid enchanter, thats how it is every fucking night for a typical enchanter, we buff, we spend our money on dots, and we die a whole fucking lot and do we get blow jobs to thank us!! NO, this isnt your small world, where the group thanks you for saving them from a train of 6 frogs, this is the world where no one cares about you until they need a buff, that tashing that mob, is uesless but you do it anyway and take the death...You have no fucking clue, so try this shit Bowynn, you are playing in the minor leauges.&quot;<br>
<br>
The difference is, oh wise one, I'm not E/V's bitch raid enchanter, YOU are.  I don't mind this when I'm doing it for my guild, but when I'm doing it for YOUR guild when you're off busy with some fucking darkmood and angst needing a break from the trials and tribulations of being so damn uber.. (oh the pains of power, save me!) then fuck yes I expect at least a thank you.  If you'd get off your fucking twink maybe they'd have you there to treat like shit, or did someone else get a picture then quit talking to you?  Want a fucking cookie?<br>
<br>
&quot;You may be a star to nobodies, but what does that get you? Nothing, false friendships, empty hearts..I was where you were little man. I have been you, been the king of a nothing special, and ya know what, it aint worth jack shit.&quot; <br>
<br>
Little man.. *laugh*  You're right about what it gets me, it's true.  Unlike you, I didn't sell out.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Would you rather be a god in hell, or a servant in heaven?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll be the god, thank you, drive through.<br>
<br>
&quot;saying how everyone says you fucking rock&quot;<br>
<br>
Did I say everyone?  Tsk tsk, Darkmask, this is beneath you.  This is what we refer to as exagerration.  It is usually employed when you are speaking from a weak standpoint and have to strengthen it.  It's akin to lying.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are part of a small nothing, a spec on an atom of the universe I have seen and enjoy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah.. and now you get to tell us how much &quot;you fucking rock!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You speak of Zomad kitting Ogres in the Karanas, the bitch was 60 before you were 45&quot;<br>
<br>
heh.. you gonna talk about leveling now, Darkmask?  Funny, seems we're the same level.  Oh wait.. I forgot.  Being the angst ridden artist and object of affection of every female on the server, not to mention cyber slave of Nerple, was too tough and many breaks were taken.  Save it for one of your &quot;harem&quot; cause that shit don't impress me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall I drop some truth?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kinda late to start now isn't it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Your guild has to have three man teams to do the HOLE, for your epic???&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, we had 5 rangers along who were heading to Jerel or whatever his name is to get a thingy for thier epic.  I had ONE group there for mine.  Might wanna think before posting.<br>
<br>
&quot;no, your skills are so deft that you need three teams&quot;<br>
<br>
Truly.<br>
<br>
&quot;they wanted to be with you, around your luminscent personality&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, whenever I lead a raid, we typically have twice the people we need simply because they want to come along.  Take from that what you will.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and then how many people were there to help you turn in your bundle of staves?&quot;<br>
<br>
A cleric and a mage.<br>
<br>
&quot;couldnt handle the mobs by yourself!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Of course I could, it was just a few sarnaks.  Are you trying to insinuate that I NEEDED someone else?  Sad.  I had friends who wanted to be there, including the person who sadly misunderstood WHY I had anyone else there with me.  <br>
&quot;you are the best Bowynn&quot;<br>
<br>
Why thank you, DM.<br>
<br>
&quot;keep typing it Bowynn maybe one day it might sound believeable.&quot;<br>
<br>
I hear it from a certain someone all the time, DM.. suck it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;And by the way we can discuss dick size if ya want..... I heard all about it...&quot;<br>

VV &gt; Tatianna<br>

Well, DUH.. it's a fucking guild vs. a single player.  So, it would follow that INDEED E/V &gt; Bowynn.  I don't think this point was ever in doubt.<br>

Aww.. can't I just have you do it?<br>

<br>
While I truly do appreciate your opinion, I must disagree.  No offense intended, but until I see evidence to the contrary, I must think of you as just another enchanter with a spiffy guild tag.  Please don't hate me because I'm beautiful.  Love ya.  *primp* <p><center>

I have to take back a few things I said about you, that was fairly intelligent.  For the record, I wasn't ever about flaming E/V.  I respect them for thier abilities and as a guild I think they're cool.  My opinion here means nothing to anyone but me of course, but that's my opinion.<br>

<br>
You are a your own spin machine. You are your own biggest fan. Your worship at the temple of yourself, where you pontificate on the greatness of yourself.<br>
<br>
You say how you are the number one enchanter of VV, WOW!! STOP ME NOW.......Watch me fume with jealousy....<br>
<br>
<br>
Yah you talk how it sucks to be a third string quarterback on a superbowl team....apparently you dont get it. Its all about the big show, the final game, the SUPER BOWL. It doesnt matter if you were the best on the losing team, you still lost.<br>
<br>
That third string QB has a ring, which as a first string receiver ya aint getting, that QB now has the experience of the playoffs and the pressure of the end game, while that best reciever aint seeing, oh wait, he is, from the sidelines.<br>
<br>
See Bowynn thats what you are, you are on the sidelines of the end game. You are one of those fat naked guys with shit painted on his body, you so want to be on the team, you dream of being on the team, scoring the winning goal, but when we are done doing what we do, you have to go home, alone, still a loser.<br>
<br>
Its such an accomplishment to be the best of nothing.<br>
<br>
I am trying to explain to you, that you wont understand the end game until you stop making it all about you. When you stop being so self centered and realize what it takes. <br>
<br>
Bowynn ya allude to things only one source could of told you, apparently you dont think I have the same source...thats how I know of the Comps and many other things.<br>
<br>
I would simpily like to see you deflate that ego of yours where you want to pretend to be as good, or even with some of the power house players. You arent, dont get carried away with yourself.<br>
<br>
Shit have you even seen TOV? Or are screen shots all you know? are you living through our glory, or do you actually want to create some of your own?<br>
<br>
See I know all about your trip to the hole, so dont lie to me man, dont try to make it sound better then it was, you had to use an overrush of players because you dont trust in small teams, You can paint it anyway you want, but I got the truth man, the night you did it, I laughed as I saw it.<br>
<br>
I thought for a short time you might be close to me, I thought I could respect you as a peer, but I was misled by all your posts blowing your own ego up, seeing you in action has destroyed all respect I have for your skill. Seeing you whine and bitch that no one cares about you in Icewell let me know you are but a baby in this world, protected by the hordes of the unskilled and untested, who say you are the god of the nothings....<br>
<br>
If thats your choice, so be it, King of the Losers, Champion of the Raiders of Guk!! You stand there and watch as my guild takes down CT, stand back, shut up and try not to create lag while we do what a team of enchanters does.<br>
<br>
What did I tell you that night? I told you to stop trying to run the show, to work with the other enchanters, watch each others backs, see you lacked that, you kept looking at yourself, and not to your team, you only care about yourself. You have a very selfish attitude, when ya drop that maybe ya can become more then you are.<br>
<br>
Its always about you Bowynn, ya have to let that go.<br>
<br>
This belief that you are as good as some of E/V enchanters is a misconception. The patience of E/V enchanter is something that is earned and shows unselfish attitude, you havent gotten there yet.<br>
<br>
You want to compare gear, say you are same level.....fine, I am sure your robe of smothering from Veeshans Peak...oh wait ya dont have that.....You got your epic, I guess that gives you the belief you are equal.....how is your crown of rile.....oh shit nm....from VP again....Nifty mask of Dragonkind from Sleepers....OH CRAP....once again...not you.....nice Dazzeling Robe....fuck...sorry once again didnt realize.....oh ya got a netted kelp tunic....whoo....a good month after most of our casters......more? I could go on......I think the funniest thing is your disbelief of the uberness of the Zlandicar Heart....I know you would give your right nut for......but hey......You got a brain of CT dont ya....OH FUCK....nm, not you again...<br>
<br>
And as for levels, no we arent equal, ya can believe we are, but ya havent check, but like I said, ya can farm gear and levels 24/7, I will be doing the things never done, or even thought of by you, I will be dying to some dragon you will be downloading screenshots of.....You aint as great as you believe you are.....fuck man, everyone is tired of your ego.....when is it ever not gonna be about you?<br>
<br>
And my Dark angst is well earned, but that Icewell thing ya did the other day, that you wish to gloat you were there. One it was a spur of the moment exp/faction raid, alot of enchanters take the day off after large raids, or were getting exp somewhere else. It wasnt a required raid, it was a small fuck around team, but apparently with all your uber experience you feel any time you go into Icewell ya need a full raid team involving your 90 plus person guild.<br>
<br>
It was a few people fucking around for exp/faction, but it gave you a taste of what it was like, ya can stop playing it off like you actually raided with E/V. That was an exp group if you didnt understand that, grouping with an E/V in sellibis, icewell, velks, and other places is no where like a full raid, but will let you understand how insignificant you are.....once again your dreams of being uber give you a belief you actually did something of importance.....<br>
<br>
that this exp group was a raid and that you saved the day...hahahahahahahahaahahahahahahah you are so fucking pathethic....<br>
<br>
I would love to group with ya, cause if we got into trouble, we could pop that head of yours and fly to safety on all the hot air in ya.<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHAHAHA, you hung out with E/V on an exp day and you want to believe you are uber....HAHAHAHAHHAAHHA only a person of your ego would do that....What next, hanging out in TOV at the zone while we are deep in the zone will make you the #1 enchanter I guess hahahahahahahahahahahaha<br>
