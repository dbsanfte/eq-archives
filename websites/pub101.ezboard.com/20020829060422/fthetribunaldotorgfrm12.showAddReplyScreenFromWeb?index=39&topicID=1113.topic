<br>
Interesting story on how he found out actually...He was having symptoms, (without too much detail...a change in the way he pees) His doctor told him it was nothing he was &quot;just getting old&quot; and that he did not need a PSA test. (simple blood test to determine whether you have the Prostate antigen in your blood-a reading over 4.0 is considered trouble).  A few months later he joined the local Veterans hospital just for a back up to his medical plan and went for a physical there. When he told them of his symptoms and upon a simply exam his prostate was enlarged.  They ordered a PSA and it came up about 64.  After a biopsy it was determined he had advanced prostate cancer that had spread outside to the seminal vesicles.  <br>
<br>
My dad finds it hysterical we are discussing his prostate here, lol  I told him its better than the usual in my opinion.  I hope he don't start calling me a loot hoor too :/<br>

You are so wrapped up in your own believes, that any other concept is completely foreign.  How many people are gonna die now because of your bullshit!  How many people are gonna pop an &quot;E&quot; and a &quot;C&quot; and a couple of Tums every morning and feel &quot;protected&quot;.  No need for checkup screenings or physicals because they are Protected!  Dvinastat said so and it sounded so good its Gotta be right.<br>

If all the deaths from bad doctors were balanced with deaths from Quacks and unproven remedies such as you spout here, I'm thinking quack remedies would settle first.  I see nothing worse than some fool spouting inane drivel as the absolute truth in an attempt to convert otheres to his partially true, but totally whacked beliefs.<br>

I have an idea... how about when you tell somebody who has posted a well thought out argument with links to documents to support that argument, that they are full of shit and don't know what they are talking about... how about you back that up with something more than &quot;You are full of shit because I think so&quot;.<br>
<br>
Poster - Here is my argument, here are documents showing why I believe this way and here are some articles that also favor my argument.<br>
<br>
Backamon - Here is my counter argument and it is based on my opinion and nothing else. BTW - you are full of shit and ego maniac and stupid to post such garbage.<br>
<br>
I am not saying Dvin is right, because I am smart enough to know that I don't know. I am also smart enough not to attack a supported argument and the poster who makes it with nothing at all to back me up except a shitty attitude.<br>
<br>
So fuck off Bakamon.<br>

For the last time...I said P R E V E N T cancer from ever happening, not 'cure' it once it does.  Didn't I tell you to have your kids explain it to you?  I'm guessing this 'simple' question was what is the cause of cancer...and I think that was explained in detail.  Of course, you had to read what I posted, not stutter across my big pretty words and give up when you don't know the meaning.  By the way, judging from your last 2 posts there's a fevered ranting idiot here alright...you probably don't want to hear who it is though.<br>

Hayzen - according to my physics teacher in high school, the moon never does orbit the earth entirely.  It's orbit is affected by the earth, but it never actually completes a rotation about it.  The moon's orbit is like a serpentine curve, weaving back and forth between the sun and the earth, with the earth passing straight through the middle of it.  Thus the moon appears on different sides of the earth, but never fully rotates about it.  The only body it fully rotates about is the sun.  I'd draw a pic of the orbit cause it's easier to understand once you see it, but I don't have anywhere to host it so maybe someone else could. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1188<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 9:46:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1113.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Loegan - I am not saying Dvin is right, because I am smart enough to know that I don't know. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

In a roundabout sort of way anyways...I still don't know what Ladida wanted but my name was mentioned, then speculation on the cause of cancer was stated, to which I replied.  Is that too easy to swallow, you have to invent some grand story of me and my religious crusade which I hope to sell only to those who play a computer game?  Cause that's believable???<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Anyone came come here and quote obscure and completely unknown professionals and call it maple syrup.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  You know, I'm sorry that you're such an ignoramus that because you've never heard of a person, he's unknown and therefore of no consequence.  Nevermind the guy was intelligent enough to be awarded the highest achievement in science which celebrates 'the greatest advancement of mankind in research annually'.  I got a question for you Bakamoron.  Actually a little story.<br>
<br>
You see, there's a man who's arguably the greatest inventor known to man...except that he's obscure, untaught in schools.  However, every invention of his is still used today, or based off of his work.  Stuff like the vacuum tubes in the monitor you're looking at, the ac current that runs it.  Small time inventions like radar, radio, lasers, helicopters, the fluourescent bulb, x-ray machines.  He paved the way for world-wide wireless communications, fax machines, radio-guided aircraft and missiles.<br>
<br>
Do you know who he is?  Very few do, not edison, not westinghouse, not marconi.  He's pretty obscure, yet he's easily the greatest inventor of all time.  So I guess because he's obscure and not celebrated we shouldn't believe anything he says, and we shouldn't use anything he gave us.  That's it, tell the power company you no longer want their 3-phase alternating current power, cause you've never heard of the man who invented it and are therefore skeptical of its existence.<br>
<br>
There, I told you enough you can look up who that man is, or you could have one of your kids do it cause you've already revealed how inept you are at such things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <!-- .. -->
