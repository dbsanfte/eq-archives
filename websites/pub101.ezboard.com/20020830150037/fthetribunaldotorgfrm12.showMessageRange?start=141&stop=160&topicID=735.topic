<br>
 You see, I didn't say what you are implying, what you are doing is called &quot; Projection&quot; you have some subconcious guilt and are trying to read it into my posts. That is your problem, not mine.<br>
<br>
 I'm sorry that even my oversimplified scenario was still to complicated for you to understand. I assume english isn't your native language, let me see if I can break it down a bit for you. <br>
<br>
  Rennat not say Companions bad<br>
  Rennat not say EV bad<br>
  Rennat not say Uber guilds bad<br>
  Rennat not say Loot whores bad<br>
  Rennat say lot of complicated stuff<br>
  Rennat say you need Loveseeker as an interpeter<br>
  Rennat say Loveseeker and Lovelily &gt; Walkabout<br>
<br>
  Anyway, enough about you. My point is and as I believe Tuwene even alluded to in a different post, Loot is a major factor in guilds and is and should be used as a motivational tool. There is nothing wrong with that, that is called MANAGEMENT. There is nothing wrong with someone wanting loot nor is their anything wrong with Guild Leaders using loot as a reward to their members participation. I don't think anyone can show me a guild that can do anything bigger than Kael Arena, that doesn't pretty much do the same thing.<br>
<br>
  Krazmos is right, Comps, like about every guild has had it's ups and downs, and what keeps it were it is is it's core players, a lot of which have been in Comps since I can remember seeing the guildtag. Same as with EV. If you have 50 players that you can depend on, everyone else is interchangeable. SP, Requiem , Legendary etc face the same problems, so it isn't just the Ubers that go through that.<br>
<br>
  Ok, now for Walkabout , let me give a condensed version.<br>
<br>
  Walkabout is saint<br>
  Rennat is Devil<br>
<br>
  I mean hell, that is how you will read it anyway, might as well simplify it for you.<br>

<br>
&gt;Wow Walkabout, pretty sensitive there<br>
<br>
Very. I'm usually hugely affected by people who were in a guild I joined before I joined. I usually get pictures of the founders to worship too. In fact, I adore every idiot who once were in the guild I joined. I assume you know a lot more about the companions than I do too - since after all, you were a member before I were a recruit. I must value your opinion very highly, due to being an ex companion.<br>
<br>
&gt;You see, I didn't say what you are implying<br>
<br>
Maybe you should go back read your own post. If you don't see it, reread till you see it. If you still don't see it, you might have a serious comprehension problem.<br>
<br>
&gt;what you are doing is called &quot; Projection&quot; you have some subconcious guilt and are trying to read it into my posts<br>
<br>
I have no guild whatsoever, nor do I have a reason to have one. Prior to you, noone have tried telling me I should be guild of anything either. Maybe I should put may faith in YOU, an EX COMPANION - who, above everything, were a member before I was a recruit.<br>
<br>
&gt;That is your problem, not mine.<br>
<br>
I don't even have a problem.<br>
<br>
You attempted to describe something about feeder guilds, hardcore players and lootwhores - but failed miserably. Unless, of course, your 20 hardcore players and 100 lootwhores only applies to all other guilds than companions, just forgot to mention it. Yes, maybe you meant that but just forgot to say so. Highly likely.<br>
<br>
&gt;I mean hell, that is how you will read it anyway, might as well simplify it for you.<br>
<br>
Maybe it was good you left comps before I joined then. Cause you do sound like yet another fucking knowitall. <br>
<br>
Good luck analyzing feeder guilds, hardcore players, lootwhores, hardcore players and lootwhores actions and their influence of the EQ environment in the future.<br>
<br>
You just declared 100 companions lootwhores you fucking idiot. I assume that's how you say &quot;hello old friends&quot; to the guild where you were a full member before I even were a recruit. <br>
<br>
Your attitude is pathetic at best. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
That is what differentiates uber players and uber guilds from the rest. To have an uber guild, you need 20 hard core players who want to face new challenges and 100 loot whores. If your lucky and do it right, the 20 adventurous players will be the officers and the loot whores will be the cannon fodder. I could list the guilds that have attempted to be Uber but have gotten the mix wrong, but no need, anyone that has played 2+ years on Trib will know who they are.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 That is the entire paragraph, taken completely in context. Now please feel free to point out were I said COMPANIONS had 100 loot whores. Show me were I said any guild on the Trib server was made up of 100 loot whores. <br>
<br>
 I said to have an Uber Guild you NEED &lt;--- do you understand what that word is ? It is used in sentences like Walkabout NEED'S counseling. Walkabout NEED'S to learn how to read. Walkabout NEED'S to get that stick out of his ass. <br>
<br>
 That is an ideal projection like saying to have a good main tank he NEED'S X armor and Y weapons. He might not have either and still be a good tank. My post (half in jest and overlysimplified) stated my opinion of what an Uber guild needs. <br>
<br>
 Now I know you are trying to work with the mental faculties of an amobea, but try to understand it this way. If I had called 100 companions loot whores, I would think that a few of them would shoot me a tell saying &quot; Hey, what do you mean we are all loot whores&quot; .<br>
<br>
  I have known several comps for 2 years or more and talk to several almost daily, so any of them would feel free to bitch at me if I had said what you seem to think I did. <br>
<br>
 When I was in the Companions it wasn't uncommon to see people pass on loot upgrades for themselves when they felt it would be a bigger upgrade for someone else. I assume that hasn't changed much. So were the hell do you get off I am flaming my ex guild. In fact go back and find were I have ever flamed ANY guild.<br>
<br>
 In closing take this as a rule of thumb. If a bunch of people read something and interpet it to mean A, then it probably means A. If everyone reads it and thinks it means B, and you alone thinks it means A, then you are paranoid. <br>
<br>
 I wish I could make that a simple poem so you could remember it easier and then Ladida would flame me for it, but I can't. No more than I can make someone as simple minded as yourself understand english.<br>

<br>
First you lecture me about the use of the word NEED :<br>
<br>
&gt;I said to have an Uber Guild you NEED &lt;--- do you understand what that word is ? <br>
<br>
Then you ignore this sentence :<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;To have an uber guild, you need 20 hard core players who want to face new challenges and 100 loot whores.&quot; <br>
<br>
This sentence says you NEED 20 hardcore players *AND* 100 loot whores.<br>
<br>
And then you claim I'm quoting you out of context hahahaha. Lol, you're fucking retarded. Geez, this is funny.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;That is the entire paragraph, taken completely in context. Now please feel free to point out were I said COMPANIONS had 100 loot whores&quot;<br>
<br>
Well duh, it may be hard to realize for you, but by the first quoted sentence you accuse everyone who joined Comps and EV say the last year of being lootwhores. You also say that uberguilds are made up of lootwhores. Or are you incapable of understanding the implications of your own words ? You don't have to include the word COMPANIONS in the sentence, because it's a given. <br>
<br>
&gt;In closing take this as a rule of thumb. If a bunch of people read something and interpet it to mean A, then it probably means A. If everyone reads it and thinks it means B, and you alone thinks it means A, then you are paranoid. <br>
<br>
This is giving yourself too much credit. Just because everyone doesn't respond to your shit doesn't mean they agree with you.<br>
<br>
&gt;When I was in the Companions it wasn't uncommon to see people pass on loot upgrades for themselves when they felt it would be a bigger upgrade for someone else.<br>
<br>
Yes, such as some had two rangers on the same account, both with epics, before all primary rangers in the guild had their epic /nod. Passing on loot is a good thing /nod.<br>
<br>
It's people like you that are the true trash, the true lootwhores of EQ, feasting on other peoples effort. Good thing you left Companions in disgust over the loot system being changed.

Again, show me were I said you quoted me out of context. You see, if you will read that I didn't say that nor did I imply it nor would any sane person with above a 2nd grade reading ability think that I said that.<br>
<br>
 I plainly stated that I was quoting the entire paragraph in context ( the implication there was ,here is the whole paragraph and I hadn't just quoted part of it) how the hell you get from an obvious statement of fact to an accusation that I am saying you are quoting me out of context is beyond me. The only conclusion I can draw is that your stupid.<br>
<br>
  You ignore everything that is said and go off on some tangent ranting about what you &quot; percieve&quot; is being said. I can't honestly believe you are as obtuse as you appear to be. You must be trolling because you have yet to make a single coherent argument. Best I can figure is you want to turn this into a Comps flame since you were the one to bring their name into it . So I tell you what, you start up a post titled &quot;All I know about Rennat &quot; and put in all the stuff that happened BEFORE you were even a recruit ( back when you were just a wannabe )<br>
<br>
 As far as 2 people on the same account having their epics, did anyone ever point out to you ( since you weren't even around at the time) That there were periods were those 2 rangers were the ONLY active rangers in the guild. The only rangers that played 7 days a week ( and sad to say about 16 hours a day between the 2 accounts )for the entire time they were in the guild ? No, I bet you didn't know that now did you. Oh, sorry I forgot, during that time you were trying to learn the various points of pulling the Window Room in Sol B werent' you. <br>
<br>
  Here is a little history lesson for you. Check and find every player that was in the Comps while Trenea and I were. Every one that got an epic during that period ( and asked for a hand in guildchat ) either she or I were part of it, we have both been part of as high as 4 epic raids a day ( even after we had our epics ). Any one that was in the Companions at the time knows this, but then again you wouldn't know because at the time you were just wanting to be all uber.<br>
<br>
  If you are indictive of what the Companions are now then it would truly be a sad state for one of the better guilds on the server. Hopefully though, you are just someone who slipped through the recruiting , like Telymon , and they will soon rectify their mistake.<br>

Passing on loot is a good thing /nod.<br>
<br>
It's people like you that are the true trash, the true lootwhores of EQ, feasting on other peoples effort. Good thing you left Companions in disgust over the loot system being changed. My my, and you were a member before I even were a recruit.&quot; - Walkabout<br>
<br>
Walk, you do a few things here...<br>
<br>
Your first sentance implies that they were two rangers, on one account but that they were one entity, as if the second was a twink. They were 2 people who played the account, each with their own characters. Trenea making the same class to play that her spouse played as an easier way to pick up the gameplay.  Back when this happened it was not common for people to have multiple accounts, nor was splitting characters possible, so they alternated play times and there was almost ALWAYS one of them online playing. <br>
<br>
Also, Rennat is very truthfull when he says that if help was asked for, and either he or trenea were on, they were there without question and without any sort of personal gain.<br>
<br>
Rennat even took himself out of all loot tiers and asked for nothing, and trenea didnt ask for much either heh, please get rid of your ignorant implications otherwise you have no reason to get upset at Rennat's. <br>
<br>
He was not saying that every uber guild has 20 people that are hard core, and 100 loot whores. He is saying that is all you would need to have an uber guild. Get the difference in there?<br>
<br>
20 hard core people and 100 loot whores CAN be an uber guild<br>
an uber guild DOES NOT have to have 20 hard core players and 100 loot whores....<br>
