 For indication of a superiority complex, you don't need to look at Muse's guild tag, but rather her Sig. Hell, I'm not even saying straight out that she DOES look down on other people- Don't know her enough to be sure. The sig does, however, ooze &quot;I'm better than you, people grovel at my feet&quot;ness. <br>

<br>
Our Muse is NOT the Muse who does the maps on eqatlas.  However, she constantly gets mistaken for the mapmaker, Muse, and as a result has received all of those tells complimenting her on her fine work.<br>
<br>
She humorously added them to her sig.  They were not posted in a Romi-esque manner to show off how cool she is.<br>

I am the guy that has earned every piece of equipment I have. Unlike you I have not spent countless hours camping Ebay and Playerauction for that special character or that special piece of armor.<br>
<br>
Everytime I read one of your posts I cant help but laugh to myself. I laugh because you present yourself to be some kind of credible person with knowledge of the game. When in fact if it wasnt for Ebay you would be nothing at all. If not for the wonders of Ebay you would still be a level 4 character standing around East commons begging for trinkets and getting trained.<br>
<br>
The latest patch was for losers like you Rynnia. Maybe with the ease of the game now you will actually be able to get a character to level 10 on your own. No more fear of loosing your l337 equipment because you cant remember if you turned right or left out the gate and your corpse rots because you are unable to find it.<br>
<br>
I still want to know Rynnia. Were you born gay or were you sucked into it?<br>

<br>
He hasn't been playing much lately because as a cleric of Brell, he has to keep the streets of his city safe from evil!<br>

I just hope he doesn't get shanked lost in caves near his home like that poor guy who thought he was his D&amp;D character years ago.<br>

Hey! i know, meet me at the bike racks after school!!!<br>
<br>
Guess if you can't fault what someone is saying you just gotta resort to calling them names, eh? Good strategy.<br>
<br>
Anyone else noticed.....<br>
Some of the people on this board only make themselves look worse every time they post? Rather amusing, isn't it? <p><p><hr>

Fend, let me ask you this, do you honestly think that reputation matters on this board?  Truthfully, most people really don't care how you look at them, otherwise no one would post.  I sure hope you're having fun, because your post seems a little bitter.  I'll pray for you and make sacrifices so that you'll lighten up.  <br>
<br>
Now if your name was on the pieces of monkey feces list, that might be a different story.  In so far as this board is a good place to discuss burning issues on the tribunal or just be a little saucy (/saucy purr), it's a great resource.  <br>
<br>

/saucily pours milk into his bowl.  Ooh, aah!<br>

I am not the Muse they think I am, yet I continue to get at least one of these tells for every single day that I have played &quot;Muse&quot;. (I actually didn't know about the other Muse when I chose the name over 2 years ago.)<br>
<br>
Nyrkl used to shout &quot;OMG, it's the Muse from EQAtlas!!&quot; everytime he ended up in the same zone as me and that sure didn't help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It used to actually piss me off when guildmates would perpetuate the joke because I had heard it so many times before.<br>
<br>
Now I find it amusing, and if I'm in a rather mischievious mood and I have time on my hands, I tend to play with the poor newbies, like a cat with a mouse. I once had someone offer to map the bottom of Timorous Deep for me...<br>
<br>
Occasionally, people send me tells wanting to send me a map of a certain zone. I usually just give them my *cough* email address, muse@eqatlas.com of course, so they won't be too disappointed with the truth. I sure hope the EQA Muse doesn't mind that. lol<br>
<br>
I've even had people create a character on the Tribunal solely for the fact that they heard I play here, and want to talk to me beleiving I am &quot;the Muse&quot;. Most times I explain to people that no, I am in fact not the same person, but can you blame for toying with the occasional clueless person? <p><center><b><a href="http://darkmask.windsofstorm.net/images/ladies/fullsize/muse.jpg">Muse</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.the-elitists.com">Elitists and Vagrants</a>>
