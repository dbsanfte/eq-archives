SOE has all his information. Then all they do is conduct a search for Beta testers in his area. The # of Beta testers is still low, it wouldn't be that hard to figure out who this friend is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Minus, of course, several main systems that will not be working when it's released. Several things got cut.

<br>
Let's see. What got cut from release but will make it in within the first few months afterwards?<br>
- Player Cities: At this point I'm going to call you a dumbass if you think this will actually make a difference in the first couple months after release. Hah! That's all I'll say to that. Hah!<br>
- Player vehicles: If you started EQ over today from scratch, would you be able to afford even the cheapest horse right away? No? Though so.<br>
- Player Missions: If you read the dev post about the delayed freatures, then you would realize that the devs discovered that under certain situations that the player giving the mission could grief the hell out of the people doing it for them. Personally, I'd rather them work on the getting the game out the door than try and work out the kinks in this system.<br>
- Dark Jedi: Hah!<br>
<br>
I love the idiots who rant about those features not being in at release and go on to say that they won't buy the game until they go in. 'Cause when they are just picking up the game for the first time, I'll be sitting comfortably in my two-story town house out in central Rori. And riding around in my landspeeder waving at them as it dawns on them what idiots they truly are.<br>
<br>
Fanboi? Hardly. Baseless insults? What do you think calling someone Fanboi is? People usually fall back on it when others defend a product, and when they can't really say anything else.<br>

The guy had issues with what he saw, and to go attacking him on some NDA thing is sort of deflecting the point. Not everyone is going to think whatever-game-comes-out-next is God's gift to us.

<br>
And yes, if you are going to bring up them talking about this and that system for 3 years then I certainly will bring up that it wont be in the release...when for quite some time people thought it would be. Sure, it might get put in later. That can be said about every MMOG out. Kunark will be put in later. Horses will be put in later. Housing will be put in later. Until its in, it's not in.<br>
<br>
I never said I was going to wait until those features went in to buy it. But I'm not blind. I know any game coming out is going to have positives and negatives, and wont be perfect. To get all ruffled over someone daring to criticize a game is insane. The game you love is going to have problems. The games out now have problems. Get over it.<br>

The game isn't finished yet, but some people do take such ramblings to heart and go off the deep end. Not to mention the idiot in question talks about a death system that doesn't even exist unless you have a Jedi character. But, someone who doesn't know that by reading up at the main website could browse by and see his post and decide right then and there that he won't play SWG because it has Permadeath, which is untrue. Then he goes and tells all his friends about this post and the fictitious Permadeath and they decide not to buy the game, and so on and so on. Reviewing a game in Beta is like cutting the meat for a steak, heating up the grill, but serving the steak without actually grilling it. And I don't believe that SWG is gods gift to gaming. It's a mere half-step forward and two steps to the side from the current games out there (and the devs will admit as much). The only thing that blows other games out of the water are the visuals, which you'll see a plethora of once the NDA is lifted.<br>
<br>

The devs did say they were planning on the delayed features for release, but overall I commend them for not putting them in so that they could focus on more prevalent issues. The delayed features could be delayed because it wasn't necessary for a smooth launch and wouldn't be a factor for a couple of months at the least. But you're right, until it's in, it's not in.<br>

And while I loved playing that game for pretty much the entire time, I moved back to EQ after a lot of the people I hung out with gave it up. I have recently dropped EQ as well, but for personal reasons. Both games are solid, but not without their own problems. I do not begrudge anyone who plays them, and I certainly won't hold their flaws up and scream out why they suck. I also hold no illusions that SWG won't have problems. It's certainly a known fact that for all the Beta testing done, the game can't truly ever be finished upon the release date, and that it takes up to six months of live servers to work out the kinks. We shall endure.<br>

<br>
Yes NDAs are rather toothless when it comes to legal enforcement.  The worst they can do to you is *gasp* ban you from playing.  Provided they even find out who you are.  I hardly consider that a severe consequence.  Can they sue this person?  Well they can try but it wouldn't amount to much good.<br>
<br>
NDAs are assigned for a wide variety of things, not just to avoid bad press.  That's a very limited understanding of NDAs you have there.<br>
<br>
Oh and I love how you refer to yourself and &quot;your level&quot;.  Here's a hint; you sound like a raving lunatic of a highschool dimwit.  So excuse me if thinking &quot;your level&quot; isn't so high and mighty.  Since you so proudly announce that you are several levels above this but in actuality don't know anything, I'll just have to assume that since you aren't young, you are instead just a natural dumbass.<br>
<br>
Anyways, back to the subject before Mr Fanboy opened his clueless trap;  I have always wondered if they are going to have big boss mobs and how they would resovle conflict with mobs.  For example, EQ uses a MUD type system and thus we have a predominantly melee combat system in place, along with mob AI that goes along with it.  So since SWG should have more ranged attacks in place, how do the mobs act?  And are there going to be huge armies of people going off to kill a single whatever mob? <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

Oh this reminds me, do you have to use ammo for weaponry?  Or how about do you have to manually aim your weapons ala quake? <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

Yes, their melee is stronger than their ranged, but when you aggro them they'll fire arrows as they charge to stomp you.  Caster mobs do the same thing, since until like Seb-type casting strength their casting is merely an augment of their melee attack.  Take it one step further: if mob_00's ranged attack is stronger/more effective than its melee, could we have mobs kiting PC's?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The other thing I was curious about, is that the healing system seems more involved and less efficient under stress (i.e. big nasty thing beating on someone).  In EQ, healing a person from barely breathing to full health happens in the space of a few seconds (yay for CH chains which can keep tanks up indefinitely with enough clerics/druids/shamen), but in SWG, you've got the three different damage aspects, and the kits and stuff required to tend to wounds.  Is main tanking with healing chains out?<br>

Oh, and to Moonwhatever, the rabid little she-bitch, calm down for once in your life.  First you claim that you can get someone in trouble for releasing beta information, then you claim you don't have any interest but raise the point that Sony could do it.  Sounds like you have some emotional issues with the game.  Did the game break your heart, turning you into a spiteful, hate-filled person?  It's drops in a bucket for the flow of information, so don't get all high and mighty about people breaking a non-disclosure agreement.  I've seen more from a review on gamespot, and they just watched a dev play the game while interviewing him. <p>Venerable Jaggedspine Infinitelysad, Retired<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->63 Barbarian Shaman, The Tribunal<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97215">My Stuff</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.umr.edu/~clloyd/Sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moontaylesilverleaf>Moontayle Silverleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/23/03 4:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SWG Info &amp; Thoughts on EQ</span><hr size=1> I've been pwnzored by the kiddies.

There is no perma death for normal characters, just people that find the way to open the jedi slot will come accross perma death.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>6.18 How are you going to keep Jedi rare?<br>
<br>
Jedi characters suffer permadeath unless they reach Jedi Master status. You do not lose the Jedi character slot, but the character in that slot is deleted. Upon reaching Jedi Master status, Jedi become &quot;blue glowies&quot; rather than permadying when they die. In order to compensate for deaths that are completely out of control of the player (such as ones caused by network latency) each Jedi will be able to die a couple times before death is permanent. The life of a Jedi is extraordinarily difficult, and successfully making it all the way to Jedi Master should be considered the most difficult challenge in the game.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
