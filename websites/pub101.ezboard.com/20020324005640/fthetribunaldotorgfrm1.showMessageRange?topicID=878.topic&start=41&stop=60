DAoC is a different game?<br>
<br>
I've never played it but its a Level&amp;Class based<br>
High Fantasy game, just like EQ.  The classes<br>
arent exactly the same, but its basically the same<br>
kind of game.<br>
<br>
I can understand people going to DAoC cauz they<br>
are bored or sick of EQ, but going because its<br>
different is kinda like moving to Canada from the US. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Frequently in EQ porting into Butcherblock mountains I have fallen through the world, only to be placed at the &quot;safe point&quot; 10,000 damage above a mountaintop which you cannot reach without GM assistance, and died, oftentimes having to wait 6+ hours to get it back.<br>
<br>
I've gotten stuck in the world geometry 3x in DAOC.  (usually on stairs)  I use /stuck.  It logs me out, moves me a few inchest and I am free again.   I've gotten stuck in world geometry in EQ many times.  I use /petition and wait sometimes 6+ hours.<br>
<br>
I don't know why you are falling through the world so often as you say.<br>
<br>
Being disbanded on zoning is really not an issue since zoning is so infrequent.  I find it to be a non-issue really once it is gotten used to, which takes only a couple times of it happening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/3/01 5:10:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.truepath.com/jadae/Blue.JPG width=102 height=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Its usually a video card issue if theyre repeatedly falling through the world. <p><center><img src="http://members.truepath.com/jadae/bunclover.jpg"><br><font size=2 color="#00FA9A"><a href="http://sacredfire.orionsafari.com" target="resource window"> The Sacred Fire</a></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uadxo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ADXO</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://adxo.homestead.com/files/DarkIcon1.JPG height=20 width=20" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of Illusions</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/3/01 5:38:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://adxo.homestead.com/files/DarkmaskResplendentFinal1.JPG height=220 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shift in power, changing face of high lv guilds on Tribu</span><hr size=1> seriously bitching about the mace, or any other shit that dropped this week and will continue to drop is lame.<br>
<br>
One, the mace is very nice, fine, but it is also very nice to get an item that is unique, none of these items will drop again it seems, they are new, and so people are feasting on them, not only are they rare but they are good, not great but good, why wouldnt you want to get one?<br>
<br>
I see alot of complaining that ordinary folks dont get a shot at god loot, well, ya are getting shots at loot which ya normally wouldnt, this is a rare oppurtunity.<br>
<br>
What I think verant didnt expect was to make Rathe unsolvable thus making the event almost non stop, and the items flow like water.<br>
<br>
Every few hours a snake pops in North Ro, drops some great items, even for high level players, and then ya have to wait a few hours, in the commons the werewolf lord was asked not to be killed because as long as he stays up so do the other werewolves. That is sorta sad, kinda keeping up to farm em, but it gives more people a chance to get something special, which I am all for.<br>
<br>
Little level five players are getting great items, now this rocks for some because this is there first character, and they see all these twinks and now they feel, wow I can compete a little. <br>
<br>
The game became unbalanced when Kunark was released and regen tunics became easy to aquire, from the iskar bp to the fungi, ya can solo to 50, even 54. But then ya go to vellious and ya get a reality check ( not velks but say DN, SG ), it is harder if yer not prepared. Yes players are getting stronger and smarter and the game is losing its challenge to an extent.<br>
<br>
I dont think having 30 bards with these new maces will unbalance the game, like the 1000000 new monk twinks with the exact same gear, fungi, haste, sos, netted kelp/panther/wus, because people also get bored and eventually try something new, I would say out of 30 bards that get flameweavers at level 10, only 8 might see 50, and 1 might want to be 60, it wont radically change the game, none of the items that dropped this weekened will, it is just like a twink bonus.<br>
<br>
I say enjoy it, would of been nice to get a leg up when first starting out, and instead of looking back and going, fuck you for having a better weapon then I did, say, I did it without your weapon and I can be proud of that.<br>
<br>
Just stop complaining about events or we might stop having them entirely, everyone has a complaint, everyone bitches about them, about the loot, how gay it was, how it wasnt cool enough for them, well screw that, I saw some very happy players so excited to get something special, I called out loot drops this weekend and shouted locs and could see the joy, they didnt loot and just move on, some people were honestly excited and I was excited for them.<br>
<br>
Because you arent having any fun, dont ruin it for those who are. <p><center>

<br>
A PC that will run DAOC effectively costs about $500 without the monitor.  Just because your P2 400 and 16MB Voodoo2 runs EQ, doesn't mean it will run a game that is 3 years newer.  (My oldest PC is a P2 400 with dual Voodoo2's and wont run DAOC, but my second oldest, a P3 600 with A Voodoo5 runs it just fine, and my newest P4 1.7Ghz Geforce2 64mb runs it flawlessly.  ALl of those machines run EQ.)<br>
<br>
Every improvement has it's price.  And it can be expected that the next-generation of games will require a PC that was top of the line last year or less.  Also consider that the 'minimum' requirements are just that... the minimum that will allow you to run the game.   Suggested requirements are better looked at if you seek any degree of playability.  No $$$ to keep up with the upgrades?  Stick with EQ or seek a less expensive hobby.  Upgrading a computer every year or two is a large expense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utrindletrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle Trueheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pally Chick :)</span><br>  Posts: 423<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/3/01 8:54:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shift in power, changing face of high lv guilds on Tribu</span><hr size=1> Heh, i kind of like the fact that i can jump off the 2nd story of a castle in Camelot, fall through the earth and insta port to my bind point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Pikel, like they're saying.. sounds like a video card issue.  I'm running a *very* shoddy system (still waiting for my upgrade).  400mhz and a voodoo3...the only thing saving me is the 192 RAM.  With such a crappy set up, i'm not having any trouble getting stuck or falling though the earth (unless on purpose).  Do you have directX 8.a installed?  By the way.. they're Not supporting voodoo cards whatsoever.  Any bugs you have with Voodoo are there to stay, i'm afraid.<br>
<br>
On the issue of this Bard weapon.  Call me crazy.. i'm spoiled with playing with one of the best bards on the server (Safaa).  From what i've learned, a good/great weapon does not make for a great bard.  It's like putting flashy wheels on a car.... the car doesn't run faster or more efficient with them.  Same with a &quot;decent&quot; mace when you're talking about a Bard.<br>
<br>
If SoL is geared for smaller raids, that is a step forward in my opinion.  Personally, they can keep all the shiny loot... i'd rather see the expansion be all dungeons and some neat big mobs that are just there for the ~Challenge~ and ~Fun~ not something that is required to defeat and kill for a stupid armor or weapon quest.  I'm tired of killing stuff over and over, in the same spot, with two groups and seeing very little in  results for experience, faction or drops.<br>
<br>
  Give us more dungeons like The Hole, Keasora, Sebilis, Chardok, Howling Stones, etc.  and *Don't* make it all about loot for a change.  I'd enjoy that.  I'd also enjoy easily accessible dungeons... not just one, but a couple near each other.  Traveling a half hour to an hour to hit a dungeon that's packed is such a waste.<br>

I'm all for it, but the vast majority of these people oocing and looting these things are lvl 10-20's with full lambent/SS.  The majority of the true newb's don't even know how to get to RM.  Besides my problem with these events are the items they give out.  I dunno I just think they are kind of unoriginal.  I'd like to see more thought put into them.  Like why does the loot always have to be some great weapon/armor?  Why can't we have a great utility piece drop.  Like a MNK/RGE/WAR only pair of boots with 0 AC, but has permanent effect SoW or something.  This is an item that none of these classes would use for fighting obviously, but it sure would be handy for them running across WK or whatever.  Unless you really make to make one of these fellas happy and throw Selo's Accelerando on it.  I dunno I just kind of think the stuff that comes out of these events should be a little more unique then an above average weapon or BP, not every item in game has to relate directly to battle.   <p>Now truly I am king of the world <BR>

I liked yer last post, it was input and thoughts and some good ideas not just bitching, I know how ya feel though, I heard a ton of spam asking for robes, to maces, to sk drops, everyone wanted a piece and I was more then happy to tell them when something dropped, just didnt like the spamming, when something dropped it was usually announced if the person couldnt use it.<br>
<br>
True not many true noobs made it to RM, or EK for great items, but still a few levels 20s, or 15s with this aint gonna hurt either. Also most of the items were lore, so a few class pieces and they were gone :) Though some of the epic battles with the super regen dark elf were fun and exciting and a showed alot of cooperation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I like how ya are thinking, dont make it an all around piece, kinda like a utility piece, those items are rare but come in handy, a few examples are, Mana Robe, Goblin Shrunken Earring, Jboots, Bracer of the Hidden, stuff ya might not wear constantly but do wear when ya need the effect, I dont know if I would go so far to say boots with spirit of the wolf, maybe have jboots drop rarely during an event.<br>
<br>
I saw a few cloak of flames, fungi tunics, among other god loot, but the thing is, as godly as it is, nothing was cooler for me then seeing a new item, or having that young player run over to your kill and say Thank you, this rocks.<br>
<br>
I saw alot of good in some of these events, I saw alot of bad nastiness, but most of all it seemed like alot of fun, the one thing I would like to do, is thank all the clerics for rezzing so many bodies in various zones over the past few days, most have dont it out of compassion, so have only asked for donation, but it was nice to see the kindness, I think that is a very good reward that can be taken from this, social interaction between high and low levels in a good fashion.<br>
<br>
Maybe an uber will stop and say, I was once a noob, I shouldnt be so stuck up, and maybe a young player will say, not everything I heard about such and such or their guild is all true.<br>
<br>
Many clerics, druids, wizards spent their time moving players back to their bodies, and those unnamed people who sat in rathe mountains zone lines getting trained, but always ready to rez deserve alot of thanks.<br>

It has to do with slowdown, I can recreate it when I want, and it's pretty lame. Just a matter of slowing down the system at the right time. Calling it a computer problem is a copout. I have slowdown anytime I hit the EC tunnel in EQ, I have yet to fall through the world, it's not a computer problem, it's a design flaw. Seige equipment doesn't even display the right items in the item list apparently from the uproar I was listening to. Having my group disbanded every time someone trains the zone at any of the various dungeons is lame. Being unable to trade with the people I came across all day the other day, lame.<br>

<br>
Let's put it on the table, YES, EQ greatly advanced the level for which we now associate with a great MMORPG.  It had it all.. great graphics, some cheesy quests, lots of friends... a good effort on Verant's part.  So much, that some of us have dedicated over 3 years of our lives to playing it.  But after spending the last week in DAoC I've seen just how Everquest got to where it is today.<br>
<br>
Why are you people here defending it?  Because, you've invested yourself into the game.  At the time, there was nothing else available.  Everquest was top dog and there wasn't anything anyone else had out there that could compete.  So we put up with the BS that Verant spoon fed us at the rate of $9.89 a month.  Game released chock full of bugs, but we paid for it.  CS department sucked nut.  But we paid for it.  And we paid for it month after month after month after month.  LoL.. get a grip people.  DAoC is kicking EQ's ass.  If you sit here posting your unfounded BS crap about how &quot;they'll be back from DAoC&quot; you're deluded.  DAoC's opening day blew EQ's first year away.  Opening with more than 20K peeps online the first night and recently breaking over 30K online simultaneously in this past week.  Not to mention that DAoC has already sported more than 100K active accounts since release and have initial orders of up to 200K more copies to be shipped within the next six months.  You can sit there thinking that EQ is the end all be all, but you're dead wrong.<br>
<br>
Need we be reminded how EQ went live?  Three freaking weeks of shoddy connections, dozens of patches, and a CS department who was constantly chanting their emblazened mantra of &quot;SOOOOOOON&quot;.  DAoC's release was as flawless as you could expect.  LoL, of course they can't compete with initial content when you judge a product like DAoC next to a mature title like EQ which has been developing over the past few years.  Give me a break.  But I just look at the systems in DAoC and shake my head at EQ.  The Guild system alone in DAoC puts EQ to shame.  The much more defined chatting system is sweet.  And my god people, look at the quests in DAoC and ask yourself &quot;Why call EQ EverQUEST?&quot; when the quests in EQ suck ass.  Three years into a game and they STILL havn't improved upon the quest system.<br>
<br>
Naaa.. I'll be honest with you, Verant got cocky.  DAoC will prove to be a much better game than you all give it credit for.  Mythic did alot of things right.  And yes, there is a list of bugs to work out, but the system is still hundreds of times more stable than EQ was on release.  If you think Luclin will help EQ, you're dreaming.  EQ's potential has been realized and achieved.  They've already announced that profits in the 4th quarter are starting out much lower than was previously anticipated.  All the players on the servers can spout gosple about EQ till your lungs burst, but the bean counters in the accounting department at Verant are already seeing the trend.<br>
<br>
Long live EQ.  Long live DAoC.  And long live any other form of entertainment that keeps me happy for hours for just a few dollars a month. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uyawgmothdaemon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YawgmothDaemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/4/01 10:01:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=878.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> warlight </span><hr size=1> d00d, all games come to an end<br>
mythic did alot of things right because they learned from the previous mistakes of companies like Verant , Origin and Turbine. but ppl will come back to EQ when the new expansion is released out of pure curiosity alone. EQ might be dying but its not dead yet &lt;courteous post ends here&gt;<br>
<br>
are you a dumb fuck? seriously you sounded halfway intelligent untill you started comparing numbers at release date. <br>
<br>
when Ultima Online was released the amount of players who signed up was probably miniscule compared to EQ's release so whats your fucking point, numbnuts? <br>
<br>
the market GROWS for fucks sake. teeny boppers who couldnt get creditcards before alone would account for a large number of players gearing up for DAoC. let alone the fact that DAoC is absorbing the disgruntled player base of not only EQ but all the other MMOrPGs that came before it.<br>
<br>
seriously if you are going to waste our time spouting statistics proving how your dad's penis is bigger than our penis at least post the right statistics goddamit.<br>

<br>
Damn, a flame.  I'm impressed.<br>
<br>
Actually, the post speaks for itself.  If you have been following the posts on this message board, you would remember how many people kept saying how much DAoC sucks.  Noone will play it.  It has nothing to offer.  EQ is god.  But look now.  DAoC is out and how many people from EQ are there?  Now the masses are saying &quot;Just wait, everyone will return.  EQ is not dead.  Wait for Luclin.  Verant knows all.&quot;  ROFL.  Who is the actual numbnutt here?  The statement that I made in regards to actual numbers is actually quite impressive.  Mythic has claimed many records for initial product release accomplishments.  Origin, nor Turbine, can even hold a bic lighter to what Mythic has accomplished.  Don't give me crap that EQ's been out this long and blah blah blah.  EQ was out for some time before AC was released.  Turbine had a chance to change a few things and chose not to.<br>
<br>
What prepubescent male teet suckers like yourself fail to realize is just how tired the entire populace of EQ is currently.  While you stumble about in an ethereal stupor believing that Luclin will somehow revitalize EQ enough to bring the veteran players back, I'm laughing my ass off leveling in DAoC.  Because without a shadow of a doubt, DAoC has something that EQ will never be able to regain; a sense of newness.  People have put up with Verant's BS for solely 1 reason and I clearly stated that.  Only because at the time EQ was the only game in town that was worth a damn.  It was quite humorous to read all of the negative posts about DAoC before it went live with dozens, if not hundreds of people prophesizing DAoC's death ahead of time.  But now that DAoC is here, EQ players are taking a look.  And the numbers being flaunted by Mythic show that they have taken a chunk of the online pie.<br>
<br>
What does that say about the future of the game?  Dunno.. as we come upon the first month of DAoC's release the sheer number of user accounts that are flooding into the system will serve to bolster Mythics position.  Mythic has already released a schedule of planned expansions to the game that it says will be made available within the first 120 days of DAoC's life.  Have you even taken a look at those?  Quite an impressive list considering how lame EQ has been at providing new content to it's users.<br>
<br>
But to return to your post, WTF are you actually trying to say?  I've read it a few times now and it's quite confusing to me.  The market grows?  Damn, that's quite insightful of you to say so.  If you need anymore examples of how bad EQ is doing just look at the recent changes.<br>
<br>
1)  Player counts were removed from the game.  Why for?  DUH<br>
2)  EQ's sudden interest in Customer Service.  Have you been asleep thus far and forgtten the rash of fuck ups that have taken place?  Actually, don't respond to that.  After reading your post again I'm merely going to assume you have been.<br>
3)  EQ's rash at going back to GM events.  ROFL, gimped lame events at that.  The sad reality is that the really good events happened for one reason; GUIDES.  Not sure how many of you actually know this, but those quests you like so much were primarily run with the help of the Guides.  A GM came, gave you the items to hand out and it was up to our illustriuous volunteer staff to make things happen.  My hats off to the many guides who put up with player bullshit and still gave another 100% to try to make the events a worthwhile time.  Not to mention those people who put in the time to actually come up with the events in the first place.  In the 3 years that I've been in EQ, the major reason I've seen events fail is because of twit idiot players screwing them up.  That's right, GREED.  How many times had there been an event planned and some twit level 60 peon had to come in and rape the event staff ruining it for those levels it was actually intended for?  It would have been nice to see those morons actually stop thinking of themselves for a change and let the little guy have a crack at it.<br>
4)  The early release of horses.  Come on, lol, how plain does it have to be made?<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not sitting here saying to pack up your bags because EQ will be gone next week.  My initial post was pointing out the irony of how people continue to modify their predictions as DAoC continues to make ground up on EQ.  &quot;DAoC sucks, there's nothing to do there, no high level content, game sucks&quot; .. which lead to &quot;Well people have to try a new thing but once they get into DAoC they'll see how bad it sucks, nothing to do, has nothing on EQ, blah blah&quot; ... which lead to &quot;DAoC is ok, they did a few things right, but Luclin will make it all better.  Verant is my god&quot; .. which leads to even more bullshit.  LoL.  Pure irony of it all.  What the real reason behind all the DAoC bashing is pretty simple.. people have invested alot of themselves into obtaining some self-deluded sense of superiority in EQ.  And when people invest that much time and effort it hurts to see it start crumbling away into nothingness when an equal rival steps up.  DAoC doesn't threaten EQ... it threatens your sense of security in EQ.  hehehehe  You can be that cocky bastard in EQ all you want, but it's alot harder in DAoC since you do kinda have to work with your fellow realmmates.<br>
<br>

I played DAoC for a while. If I had a choice between starting over on a new server in EQ and starting out in DAoC I'd still pick EQ. DAoC just doesn't do it for me. It obviously interests you, so go play it. But there's nothing anyone can say about the current state of DAoC to make me want to play it over EQ. Maybe in 6 months I'll check back and it'll rock because they implemented more things that are the reasons I like EQ.<br>
<br>
But for now they are two completely different games. Might as well argue about how the network code of Quake 3 rocks over Simcity 3000's. Any sim buff wouldn't give a shit about Quake 3, so your preaching to um... nobody. <br>
