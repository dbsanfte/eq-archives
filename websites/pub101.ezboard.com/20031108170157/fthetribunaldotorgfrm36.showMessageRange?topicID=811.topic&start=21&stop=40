<br>
It doesn't take a sociologist to see that broken families, single parenthood, teen parenthood, etc. are a huge problem right now.  No doubt the recent &quot;sexual liberation&quot; has had many positive effects on our society, but it has certainly contributed to the problem with our marriages as well (among other things, of course).  Should not gay marriage by viewed similarly?  From a purely objective standpoint, denying gays marriage is not &quot;fair&quot;... but what would the cost be of rectifying this situation?  Even if people like Andrew Sullivan are right, and most gays really don't want to destroy marriage and &quot;queer&quot; society like the radicals, even the best of intentions can go astray... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 924<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/30/03 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> Comparing women's lib to gays marrying is like apples to oranges, though.

Yes, things like this *change* society, but it's pretty damn hard to determine if the change is going to be for the better or the worse. <br>

If so, I can only say &quot;I disagree quite strongly&quot;, and can look at societies where homosexuality WAS acceptable (even standard) practice, and note that they did JUST FINE.

And note that I did not say women's lib caused more harm than good - I said that when examining any proposition of change, one must carefully examine both the good and the bad it will cause, even that which may be unintended.  Of course, in the case of gay marriage, there are those who even *do* intend for some of the worst outcomes to take place, which only makes for even more worry.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if gay marriage would result in the fiasco Kurtz predicts, but his case sounds convincing to me.  *shrug*  And I have yet to see a convincing counter-argument.  Thus, my position stands against.<br>
<br>
This argument isn't even about gays, its about *marriage*.  I honestly don't think that allowing gay marriage would cause more people to somehow become gay.  I do think that I would not want to live in a society where marriage ceases to have the widespread meaning that is now does (something which is peculiar, in several ways, to our society - the Greeks dominated their era, but they were Greeks, not Americans, and they certainly had problems of their own - and lacked some of ours.  I find comparisons of such widely divergent civilizations unconvincing.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 7/30/03 11:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=largthemiserable>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 602<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/30/03 11:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> Though I'm not normally so vocal on a gay topic, let me just address one thing:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Would you be against a man and a woman marrying with absolutely no plans to create children? Should woman or men that are unable to have children be disallowed the ability to marry anyone? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A man and a woman who have no plans for children can marry, because you can always change your minds, and their marriage isn't averse to what nature does.  A sterile penguin still has a lifelong mate, even though they have no eggs.  A man and a woman who can't conceive can be married because a natural defect prevents children, instead of the situation where you're just sticking your organs in the wrong gender person.  Albinos, and minorities in general, can be married, because they have a genetic code that makes them look a certain way, instead of having a choice to look a certain way.  And until there's clinical evidence of a set of genes that determines your sexuality, it's still just a conscious choice.<br>
<br>
*edit*  By the way, how many congressmen and senators are gay?  If even 1% of the population is gay, then there should be 5 representatives in the house, and 1 senator, that are gay.  Society, as well as carefully pitched mud, puts people in office.  If society has no problems with gay representatives, where are they?  (I'll give you the freebie for the San Francisco area, but where else?)<br>

Let's suppose the U.S. becomes flamingly gay, where the majority of the population practices gay sex in addition to any hetero action.  Are we the powerhouse because we're gay, or because we've got the best armies due to technological innovation, sexuality aside?  Check the time scale that the greeks were &quot;powerhouses&quot;.

Such a situation would not make MORE gay people.  It would only allow more gay people to come out of the closet.  So it would APPEAR that there were more gay people.  Though, a great majority of the friends and friends of friends that I've met, whom are gay, don't &quot;look&quot; gay.

A man and a woman who can't conceive can be married because a natural defect prevents children, instead of the situation where you're just sticking your organs in the wrong gender person. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So if science allowed the ability of two females or two males to have a child, generated from their own DNA, you'd then support gay marriage?<br>

That which is wrong, in a Darwinian sense.<br>
<br>
It's not about marriage, it's about gay sex.  Gay sex isn't natural, gays aren't natural, so gay marriage (the mainstreamining and condoning of that which is not natural) isn't right.<br>
<br>
Least that's how I understand his argument.  Thus, his comment that he might change his position should proof be offered that being gay is the result of biological composition, as opposed to decisions made by individuals regarding who they're going to stick their organs into.<br>
<br>
Wenin:  changes made to biological construction, through drinking, surgery, bioengineering, or anything like that are controllable and environmental.  An amputee isn't handicapped because he was made that way, he's handicapped because someone cut his arm off.  Someone born with a birth defect may have experienced a developmental problem resulting in that defect, or it may be the result of his mom taking heroin, causing a similar problem.  The former is not an environmental factor, the latter is.<br>
<br>
If gays are gay because their brains are hard-wired that way as a result of their genetic coding, fine.  They're &quot;normal&quot;.  But if it's anything else, it's either conditioning or choice.  With either of those, the underlying reason for &quot;gayness&quot; is not the biological construction of the person, but actions taken by, or around, them which resulted in changes to their biological construction or thought processes.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know which it is *shrug*<br>
<br>
Wenin - I think we need to define what we mean by &quot;natural&quot;, then.  Birth defects occur when the &quot;natural&quot; process screws up for some reason, resulting in something &quot;unnatural&quot;. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 7/30/03 12:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

Who knows, maybe getting plowed up the ass (which is supposed to be a prostrate gland thing) and not having a nagging woman around is worth it for gay men.  But it's still a choice.  Why do so many people do hard drugs?  Probably the pleasure aspect.  But does the pleasure of something make it right in any sense, based solely on that aspect?  Hell no.  (Due, probably, to the Puritanical influence that goes through the history of this country)<br>
