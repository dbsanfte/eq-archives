By the way, I have a question Panolas...in your little 'confession' there, you make reference again to A scale...not two, but one scale.  So how many did Poladara actually give you?  Cause as far as I know it was confirmed she ninja'd two (go with the stuck /loot hotkey hon, just do it) -- so did she give you one to give to chutoi and you tried to sell that, or was it two?<br>
<br>
And speaking of page 8, it should've taught you people if you're going to lie, make a timeline of events and a story background to refer to so you don't constantly contradict yourselves...like you just did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 1:42:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> Not only does he say one scale, he says that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> he</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the one that looted it (well his character being played by a &quot;friend&quot;), not Poladara, which is contradictory of the GM report as presented by SI. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/upanolas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Panolas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 1:43:50 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~cyclonis/_uimages/eyes1-3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> She said she looted it, what I had posted was her account on what happened.

There were two red scales looted onto my account. By my character Poladara, from the SI ragefire kill. One scale poofed was dropped or a number of other things that might of or could of happened. I only had one scale in my bag that night in the nexus when I contacted the SI officer Chutoi. I tried to return it waited about 20mins and was told no one could come meet me in nexus to pick it up. I then got a list of officer names from him that I added to my friends list. I came on the next morning there was not one officer on. I was leaving for vacation later in the day when I contacted Panolas, a good EQ friend to see if he could return the scale for me. He said he would. <br>
When I got back later that week, thing's did not turn out as planned.... I did everything I could that day to fix what I had been trying and thought would have already been fixed. Chutoi was on and I talked to him yet again about all of this. I offered my FT3 boots.. not because I was trying to buy them off and have this all hush hush. But because I knew what I had done was wrong and that I should never been around the corpse in the first place. I figured they probably wouldnt accept an item worth say 30k which is equal to the scales and sense I didnt have the scales I figured it would only be fair of me to offer something of more value. <br>
I know a lot has been said about me and Dark Virtue on this POMS.  Dark Virtue is a very good guild and I was happy to be a member of it. I really only enjoyed playing EQ after I joined the guild. I deguilded myself today from Dark Virtue because I dont want the reputation of the guild to look bad as having me for a member. I would like to appologize again to SI and any of my old guild mates, Podaman etc. For having to put everyone through this. So I am sorry. <br>
Now for everyone else on this board, feel free to write whatever you want... It really doesnt bother me. I only feel bad I couldnt make the situation right the first day I had the scale, so this would not have happened. Again im sorry about looking at the corpse being around your kill of ragefire and looting the scales, no matter how you think I looted them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 2:54:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> That only took seven pages.<br>

Maybe if you had made this post this weekend none of this would have happened and you could have saved part of your reputation.  Who knows if you truly are a decent person maybe you can rebuild it.  But letting your guild take the heat for three or four days wasn't really a decent thing.  You also probably should have deguilded yourself a lot sooner because the only thing your presence did for your former guild was to make them look like a bunch of idiots. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usorran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/25/02 3:22:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Poladara Saga Thread!</span><hr size=1> I don't know Lilum - if Poladara had posted at the start, we would not have found out that Podaman is a guild leader who will defend a ninja-looter by firing off all sorts of accusations against those involved *except* the ninja-looter. It also let us learn that DV would seem to have a fair number of Ebay'ed toons in it. On top of all that, we learned that the guild leader is a refugee with a *potentially* shady past. According to Estevan, this Offbeat fellow was the leader of a fairly top end guild on some other server who wanted to move because he was tired of leading a top end guild. And yet now he is running Dark Virtue, which although it is not a top end guild by any stretch of the imagination, it is definitely a raiding guild. Why did he have to leave the server to get a fresh start? It seems pretty clear he has no problem with account swapping and/or buying, so why not just do it on his own server? And why Tribunal - random chance? And Estevan tells us of something very fishy happening with Offbeat while he was in Transcended. And Thinkness, normally one never to shy away from flaming Estevan, especially when it comes to Transcended, merely distances himself Offbeat instead of calling down the heavens on Estevan for daring to talk about Trans. Anyone know exactly which server Offbeat/Podaman came to us from?<br>

Bullshit. What happened to the second scale? GMs said you had it. Even Panolas said the second scale was &quot;on a twink&quot;. You know very well what happened to the second scale.<br>
<br>
When the new Bazaar went online, I spent a lot of time there with my character Morven. I became quite familiar with what was being sold at the high end. I watched for a few weeks, and I saw Panolas selling TWO red dragon scales. Are you going to tell us he sells them all the time?<br>

Panolas says you gave him a story about someone else being at the controls when the scales were looted. Your guildies seem to think you went LD and accidentally looted them. Now here you are confirming that you did in fact loot two red dragon scales. Exactly how many stories have you told people?<br>

now some personal thoughts. if someone is an evil ninja looting bastard, they're gonna ninja lewt their lewts, say &quot;fuck you&quot; to the guild, and not try to repay. they're going to go frollicking in the eq lands happy as a goat. they dont try to fix things. i cant believe that just after they ninjad theyd go &quot;omigawd i made a huge mistake!&quot; people think before hand, in most cases.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Kowie, you are one of the people I was referring to when I said there were plenty of good people in DV. And there ARE plenty of good people in DV -- the people that are criticising the entire guild are wrong.<br>
<br>
But I think you're wrong about ninja-looters. What almost always happens is they try to clear their name. They try to make amends because their greed got the better of them, and they realise that their reputation will be shot... and they still want to play EQ and be in a guild.<br>
<br>
I think it's fair enough to give someone a second chance if they ninja-looted and were genuinely remorseful. However, Poladara's case is not that simple -- there are several layers of deception which have not been fully resolved.<br>
<br>
Poladara looted TWO red dragon scales, which is clearly deliberate. One of them is unaccounted for, and her excuse for this is lame (surely you have to suspect something?). The other one was given to a non-guildie who sold it (did he give Poladara the cash?). There are so many pointers to a money-laundering effort gone wrong, beyond the ninja-looting and reparations. Having seen Panolas selling two red dragon scales in bazaar, I'd guess that there is more to the story.<br>
<br>
Poladara remains likely to have gained financially from all of this. Then there's the mosquito leg earring given in good faith by Enzo, that is apparently missing from Poladara.<br>

You ninja-loot and you are gone. Any guild that keeps a ninja-looter in their midst, let alone defend them to the level being shown here need to seriously look at their officership and ask WTF is wrong with them.<br>
<br>
Weather people want to admit it or not, guildtags mean a lot in this game and anything done to sully the reputation of a guild sullies every member of that guild.<br>
<br>
Ninja-looters are the worst peice of scum in this game as there is no way to get reparations from them if they don't want to really, the only thing that can be done to them is by the community in regards to letting as many people know as possible what is happening. Ninja-looting is even worse than tradescams as they effect up to 60 people at one go and don't rely on people's naivity due to corpse timers and no /army loot implemented yet.<br>
<br>
Reading all these posts so far, the only thing that comes to mind is the old saying &quot;It's easier to get forgiveness than permission&quot; as that is all that is happening here. Poldara decided to ninja (though would be interesting to know if there were anything else but the scales on RF at the time that was tradeable) and then try to get forgiveness later  on if they got caught. During this time the server tranferee's of Podaman and Kowee are also trying to get forgivness too, though for what reason I certainly don't understand while also trying to use so many instances of smoke and mirrors (such as the attacks on Mulberry and CT) that even David Copperfield would be impressed.<br>
<br>
Now I am sure that there are some good people in DV, not sure but seems to be some agreement there, but I certainly know I will be wary of any of them from now on considering the fact that their leadership will do nothing but support them in any actions.<br>

<br>
This is just a total flat out lie, Poladara. The GM confirmed you not only looted TWO scales, but that there was a confirmed transfer of TWO scales between you and Panolas. If you want, I'll post the log again that Charsi made of her conversation with GM Breghn. Unless now you are saying that Verant is lying...<br>
<br>
What Panolas did with the scales, that is his own business. YOU were the one responsible for returning them to SI since you were the one who ninjalooted them. While what he did with them certainly isn't good, who's to know exactly what you told him? It would be like a thief who just robbed a bank and knocked on some person's door and handed them a million dollars and said...&quot;Here ..give this back to the bank.&quot; You wouldn't blame the people from using the money or keeping some themselves? They didn't explain that they stole the money. That's what you did.<br>
<br>
Please just give it a rest. You keep making yourself look worse every time you try to come up with another lame excuse for what you did.<br>
