Your skill is not good enough to create this item! (or somesuch)<br>

I had missed the blasted boat, and so Aerick ported to BB to pick me up and take me to the Dreadlands instead.  I was 24, with a well known tendency to get lost.  He was 35.  The entire time we're running through there he's telling me to stay on the wall, keep an eye out, HE is scared to death we're going to get killed. ;p  There's nothing there that isn't tombstone to me, and my guide/protector is scared *eep*.  <br>
<br>
The graphics were amazing, and I remember thinking that the ice tunnel was gorgeous!  <br>
<br>
Then he drags me to this undead city to kill red to me mobs; between his snare, dots and heals they really prefer him to me and I'm scared to death he's going to die because I can't get the stupid things to turn on me instead.  It was an amazing rush when we won. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1.  Encounters in fear and hate where mobs just kept adding and adding and somehow we managed to win.  The fight probably only went around 10 minutes but it felt like hours.<br>
<br>
2.  Getting my ass kicked in CT alot trying to get decayed armor for darkforge.  One day Grunth (when we were in Pactum) decided to come help me (I was level 30 and he was 49 or 50) and I was worried we might get killed when he pulls a train and we had no healer (I didn't know about single pulls depending on your level back then) and he just ripped through it.  I thought he was so uber.  After 2 hours we got nothing but it was heaps of fun for me, probably boring as hell for G :P<br>
<br>
3.  I heard an FBSS was an uber item back in the day and would help me kick some ass so I decided to try and get one.  I stayed up with Leriche for 2 days straight in Frenzy groups and we both kept losing rolls to an_enchanter_rep_06 that had just joined the group.  The swearing on guildchat when we kept rolling 7, 12, and 19's was funny as hell.<br>
<br>
4.  Killing Trakanon for the first time after several failed attempts.<br>
<br>
5.  Most recently, getting my epic after Lhranc ripped through us in 20 seconds.  I was shaking in real life thinking that after the 10 months hard work and waiting I and my fellow friends had put into getting my epic had gone to waste.  Fortunately we regrouped and asome Companions came along and helped us zerg his ass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Our group had already split and I was low on health. Managed to drop the first doggie but the second one looked like it was going to finish the job. I'm swinging away and what does this crazy little gnome wizard does in the middle of combat? Instead of nuking, he is bending down to bandage me. We ended up dropping the last dog but I had only about 10 hitpoints left and was blown away by the bravery of the gnomish wizard. Without his oober bandaids, we both would have perished at the hands of those dastardly kobolds. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://jafo1972.homestead.com/files/barb1.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usorran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/19/01 2:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most memorable moment in EQ?</span><hr size=1> I have definitely had many, many memorable moments in my time in EQ, but if I had to pick one that stuck out it would be the first time I zoned into the Plane of Fear. All I knew about the place was the rumours of 10 hour CRs, how the uber guilds could get wiped out, how the break in was a nightmare, how tough each mob was, and presiding over all of it was a GOD.<br>
<br>
I was only just safely into lvl 47 at the time, having worked my ass off all week to get there so I could go, but when the time came to zone in I remember being truly afraid. Afraid of not knowing what lay beyond that shimmering portal, afraid of losing my corpse (this was before corpse summon went in, iirc - I may have my timeline a little messed up there tho). I was literally in a cold sweat and I almost turned around and camped right there =). But, I zoned in for the run to the north wall camp with my heart threatening to leap out of my chest as I ran through this otherworldly place, desperately trying to keep as many people around me as possible. I saw strange, nightmarish creatures making a beeline for our force, saw brave rangers and monks training them away so as many people as possible could get camped (including me thankfully =). It was such a rush and I will never forget it. Every time I zone into a fully-popped Fear, I still get a little uneasy.<br>
<br>
I think the big reason it scared me so much at the time was that there was no way I could self-rescue myself. As a druid, I am used to being very self-sufficient. Used to be able to get my corpse from anywhere, etc (this was before I had been to Sebilis =). The Plane of Fear represented the ultimate place you cannot get your own body back from and corpse loss has always been my biggest fear in this game. I have to take my hate off to VI for making the Plane of Fear a place that I truly feared. I went back many times of course =).<br>

<br>
First Plane of Fear with Emperium (invited by Kylemall, thanks to Lejina), we zoned and *poof* i LDed...i was really worried because i didn't know if i had to log back quickly or to go to the chat room. I logged back, found me near a wall, not so far from the goal point. And what amazed me the most is i was alive. Point is : 90% of Emperium LDed when they zoned and a lot of them ran throu the Temple...no need to say CRs were painful while we were waiting in the chat room but &quot;draggers&quot; made a good job.<br>

First impression was &quot;WTF I've zoned into EC&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then I turned around and say that bloody great big fire wall. I personally think its the name &quot;Plane of Fear&quot; that inspires so much awe.<br>
<br>
I was completely awe-struck when a group mate of mine in Oasis when I was in my teens logged on their level 50 mage to buff us etc. She summoned a humongous Earth Elemental in a huge rain of green stuff (my summon particle effects could hardly even be seen at the time) and proceeded to take apart the Spectre isle for fun.<br>
<br>
/drool<br>
<br>
My most memorable experience of all time was during the first time I logged on though. Nabo and Xalbus and Durien made twinks and jumped on to guide me through the n00ber stuff with me in freeport and we eventually moved into EC. I was huddling with them in this tiny pool of light in the dark (human) wondering what was waiting out there in the night to jump me when Nabo started screaming at me to &quot;GET UP, HOGGIE - MOVE MOVE! NOW!&quot;, and everyone was suddenly gone.<br>
<br>
I got up and ran to them, turned around to see a massive Griffin cruising over the space where I had been only a few seconds before.<br>
<br>
At that moment I knew it was all over for me - instant EQ addict <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font face="tahoma" size="3"><b>Hogfather</b><br><br></font>

I've had so many it would be way too hard to do :)<br>
<br>
Off the top of my head the following moments come to mind.<br>
<br>
-Participating in ToT3 (My first ever)<br>
-Freeing the Sleeper<br>
-Participating in many, many server firsts especially the first Lord Nagafen slaying on Tribunal<br>
-Entering Plane of Fear when I used to play on Xegony with my Barbarian Shaman named Skywalky<br>
-Creating my first guild on Xegony named Burning Blade<br>
-Being the first level 52er on the server as Blix<br>
-Deleting my first character ever who was an Erudite Wizard haha<br>
-Obtaining level 60<br>
-Playing with my friends (Online and RL)<br>
<br>
Those are definately my best EQ moments :)<br>
