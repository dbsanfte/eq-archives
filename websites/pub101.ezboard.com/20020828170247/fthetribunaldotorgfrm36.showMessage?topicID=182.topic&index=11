Our current airport security is a farce.  As Israeli security experts have noted, out system looks for weapons, their system looks for terrorists.  We are shackled by political correctness.<br>
<br>
&quot;The prison system is another example. Instead of spending money on rehabilitation, we say that it is too expensive and instead pay more money on the backend to house repeat offenders.<br>
<br>
Rehabilitation does not work.<br>

<br>
Why should I have to have a larger portion of my paycheck to go to housing non-violent drug offenders (who make up the majority of our prison system) than goes to the school in my neiborhood.  Everyone has different priorities on how to spend tax money.<br>
<br>
He didn't have to answer your question,  Cal answered your question.  Your elected representatives voted on how to spend your tax money.  Don't like it?  Too bad, vote someone else in.  If ypu can't well to bad also that you have to live with the decisions of the majority in this country in most cases.<br>
<br>
Reahbilitation DOES work, just not in most cases.  But it is cheaper to rehabilitate the 5% or so that can be than to house them in prosons for the rest of thier life.  And there is the fact that our drug policy actually creates criminals more than anything.<br>
<br>
Welfare and other social programs are there for a dman good reason.  Started during the great depression and greatly expanded in the 60's they were actually great successes in thier time.  However they don't exist in a vacuume.  Other social problems undermined their goals.  There needed to be a change and one was made.  My mother needed child care help when she was raising us.  And I DARE you to call her an under-achiever or irresonsible.  She was married to a good man with a solid job when we were all born but then he died on the job.  Now how the hell was it her fault that she was left with 4 kids to raise alone?  In her defense all she ever took was ADC help and social security survivor benifits, not welfare itself.  But the lack of childcare was ALWAYS a problem.<br>
<br>
Hell you can probably thank the social programs that started in the 30's for savering the US democracy.  It is not a stretch to say that we were in great danger of falling into a totalitarian state in the Depression.  FDR's efforts to help those affected by the depression, re-instituted faith in the system. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Where is this proof? This is your opinion, it is not fact. That second statement can't even BE proven. It's impossible. <br>
<br>
Basically, you are saying that spending money on rehabilitation to save 5% of the people is chaper than not spending it at all? So, the other 95% that we just throw the money away on is made up by the 5%? This makes no sense whatsoever. Prove this with dollar amounts below.<br>

That was me. Who is to say the welfare money even goes to these kids? Again, I stated earlier, welfare should be a safety net. Not a way of life.<br>

You want to bring up families? My family comes from nothing. My father had to drop out of school to support his family in the 8th grade. He worked 2 jobs most of his life to raise his own family.

And then the kids are the one that suffers. Then we he grows up and becomes a criminal, those who denied him welfare will be the first to condemn him to prison with no rehabilitation.<br>

The mother should get no support whatsoever.  She behaved stupidly, without forethought.  She is an adult, and should live with the consequences of her decision.<br>
<br>
The children should be given a chance somehow... but I honestly have no idea how to go about doing this, short of what we are already doing (giving money to the mother), which is unsatisfactory imho.  Doing that encourages the sort of adult dependency on welfare that we see far too often, as well as the &quot;pop out a few more kids and the dough rolls in&quot; mentality.  I honestly have no idea what a good solution would be... and until somebody comes up with one, the status quo reigns. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

There is a big difference between not judging someone and killing them, and not helping someone who has brought ruin upon themselves through poor decisions.

The quote is inappropriate anway. Cal isn't persecuting her or condemming her, he just doesn't want to give his hard earned money to her. If you want to, that's fine. But, by doing it through a coersive government through taxation, is not fine. I don't think not wanting to help someone who is self-destructive and will not even help themselves is casting stones. It's using common sense. Helping someone like that, by giving them free money they don't have to earn, creates dependency. Adults living in dependency off the government doesn't help anyone. It makes the situation worse.<br>

There are (or at least was) programs that are being implemented that will put a huge dent in welfare fraud. One of them is the welfare card. Instead of taking food stamps to the store, the person slides their welfare card through the scanner. This is like a debit card for food stamps and is a good way to keep participants from selling them for cash.<br>
<br>
I would like to see this implemented for the cash as well. Enough places take credit cards now that almost every mom and pop store has a scanner. If you received debits instead of actual cash, the state would have a record of EXACTLY where every dime was spent. It does invade privacy, but if you are on welfare, than I think giving up your privacy should be part of the deal so we can see where our money is going and what it is going for.<br>
<br>
As to whether poverty factors into a person becoming a criminal, the evidence is has been presented constantly in the media. Why do you think blacks are so highly represented in criminal statistics? Could it be that as a race, blacks have the highest number living in poverty? Or would you try to tell me that it's just a black thing?<br>
<br>
How many middle class people do you hear of mugging people? How many rich people are in gangs? Ask any police officer where the trouble spots are in his beat... I bet he doesn't include any well to do neighbourhoods. I mean, c'mon, this is common sense. <p><br>

I did not say that poverty is not connected to criminal behavior, I said that giving welfare does not keep people out of prison. There is a difference there.<br>
<br>
Do you think that giving someone welfare brings them out of poverty? I don't. Again, it creates a dependency on thge government. The card idea is a good one, but we will have to see how and when the government implements it. Also, how well they track it - we all know how well the government does things. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

I believe when it's done right that a majority of people would rather be independent. Welfare income is below poverty level and I think few people like living on low income. <br>
<br>
The problem is, when you get a job it has to pay enough for medical insurance (huge expense), child care (another biggie), rent and food before you even break even. People are afraid to get off welfare due to the medical insurance and child care for the most part. These 2 expenses alone can easily take 65% of your wage at a minumum wage job and that leaves 35% of your check for rent, food and utilities.<br>
<br>
I know there is a percentage of people who are lazy and wouldn't work for 1k a week, but I honestly believe they are the minority. I think alot of people are just afraid of becoming one of the working class poor who are actually worse off finacially than those on welfare. <p><br>

But once they are born, children are everyones responsibility imo. Every child deserves to have a decent home, be clothed, fed and educated. Anything less is just unacceptable in my mind. Adults are are often responsible for their own life situation, children are not. <p><br>

You can't accept that, while I accept it as a sad fact of life that even the United States Government can't change.  The welfare system does help many of these children, but in the process it is abused so much (and actually hurts so many people by making them dependent on it), that I believe it should not be in place. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">
