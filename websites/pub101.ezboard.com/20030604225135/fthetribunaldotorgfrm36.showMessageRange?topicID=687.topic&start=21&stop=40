You are under the false assumption that my statement of fat Americans is wrong.  Ok, then explain to me why the US is the most obese nation in the world, smartass.  Yeah, really offensive there even though it's true.<br>

We have already established that there are plenty of people here who are not fat.  But you can't argue with the fact that the most obese nation in the world is the USA.<br>

<br>
Tuwy, I've been harping on the SUV thing for years too.  However, regarding food, my words were little thought to the consequences.  You are right, it does symbolize the rushed lifestyle of americans, but also Americans don't think about the consequences of eating this high in starch, salt, and fat food.  And why is this food high in starch, salt, and fat?  Because this is exactly what the people consider delicious. (Read Fast Food Nation)   They gobble it down and the highest percentage of obese people in the world is born.  They then spend Billions of dollars on the diet industry, and the Billions of dollars on the health care that results from high blood pressure, heart disease, etc etc.  That is not thinking of the consequences.<br>
<br>
But perhaps you are right Tuwy, it might not fit into exactly what I want to say.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Btw, I forgot to add, some people here are under the false impression that the governement does not already tell you what you can and cannot eat.  And equating it to Communism?  I guess America is a Communist state then due to the existence of the FDA. <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

food control being a euphemism for starvation ? (just kidding)<br>
<br>
Kino  : just FYI the UK is rapidly on the way to overtake the US on obesity ratios, and the rest of western europe hasn't been looking too slim for the last decade either... it's not so much &quot;fast food&quot; burgers that are the problem, as it is industrial food with ready made products of very questionable quality (you guys ever saw the story of saw dust used in kids fish finger sticks ? - i need to dig that one up if not...)<br>

Also good for debates on the meat industry, the obesity problems in the western world (Australia's seen nearly a 1:1 increase in the # of McDonalds to the percentage of Obesity in the last 10 years...)<br>
<br>
Not to sidetrack things too much, though.  It's important to add that America has been &quot;disliked&quot; by non-americans for at least a generation, if not two.  But I use &quot;dislike&quot; in quotes, because it's the same &quot;dislike&quot; that people have of the French (the last 6 months notwithstanding, you freedom-fry eating rednecks!)  It was never &quot;I cannot associate with you, you're an american&quot; or anything like that - it was more of a general dislike of our demeanor and cultural dominance.  <br>
<br>
Admittedly, since Herr Bush started running our International PR Campaign, some of that anger briefly turned a whole lot more &quot;real.&quot;  My sense, however, is that that is slowly passing (just like you no longer hear anger toward the French in America, like you did before the war - its back to making fun of them for being cheese-eating surrender-monkeys).  One can *only* hope, because far too many of my friends live outside the borders of the USA (thx EQ, interestingly enough), and I hate the idea that someone like Walkabout would think less of me because I'm an american (I believe in spanking bad kids, though, so hate me for that *grin*)<br>
<br>
I think that the vast majority of America's bad reputation came from the 80s... a fairly different time, culturally, for us.  I think that's where the stereotype of lawsuit-friendly,  self-centered, wealthy, loud Americans came from, and I think it was probably a pretty fair label.  I get the sense that the 90s were a much more likable America overall, until 9/11 - where a resurgence of 1950s paranoia (&quot;better dead than red!&quot;) cropped up.  Again, fortunately, 9/11 anger and fear has mostly worn off.  I don't think Bush will be able to ride its coattails any longer, now that this war is over (he certainly used it to justify this war, but I think the lack of WMDs means that if he tries to use that again, his credibility will be seriously challenged).<br>
<br>
A bit of a ramble, but overall I think Americans are fat as a side effect of western culture in general - it seems to originate from here, but as it spreads around the globe, the things like obesity go with it (so it's NOT just an &quot;American&quot; thing).  We really just need a return of the moderates to power - the conservatives are fucking everything up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>If post accidentally read<BR>

Well, on the money front I wont argue with you, but I will say it's none of your god damn business how I spend my free time and money. If I like to build igloos out of stacks of twenties in my backyard, it really shouldn't concern you. It doesn't hurt anyone. As for gas or emmissions, The car is used once or twice a month, has less than 500 miles a year on it since new, and has passed CARB every year I was in California, well below the state average. <br>
<br>
Instead of attacking the American infatuation with sports cars and SUVs, which have better safety, emmission, and power/weight standards than in any european nation BTW, you should concentrate on the number of people who refuse to live close to where they work or go to school. People all seem to want a job in the cities and yet want to live an hour away in suburbia. This is the biggest waster of gas, and causes traffic and accidents. People work where they do in order to afford that big house an hour away, and then pat themselves on the back for owning a honda that they fill twice a week. Then on the weekend they gas it up one more time in order to drive into the city and march in a &quot;NO war for oil&quot; parade or protest against SUVs. If they really gave a shit about anything they evangalize, they would move into the massive amounts of deserted countryside that we have and farm for a living behind the ass of an ox. You know, substance living. Instead they are consumers just like me who think that thier way is the only way. Well, go fuck yourself, your bratty consumer driven MTV children, and your shitty overpriced disposible Honda.<br>
<br>
Now, back on topic, why doesn't anyone give this much energy towards welfare recipients? I hear all the time from haughty bitches about how fat america is, but then these same liberal pricks will give money to uneducated, ignorant, baby machines, in exchange for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>nothing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Now that's excess! I don't understand fat people, but I dont hate them. Many are intelligent, hard working, and ambitious, you know, average Americans. If they have a medical condition, or they just like eating food, great! It doesn't affect me <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>anywhere near</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as much as some jackass who thinks taking free government money is his job. Let's talk shit about these people, please, and leave the &quot;typical overwieght American&quot;, as overly sensitive people like to label them, alone.<br>
<br>
I know now why a libertarian party would never get enough votes to do anything, too many people think thier way of living is right, and anyone who doesn't fit that mold is wrong. This whole arguement is about Makino's dislike of someone's personal lifestyle choices not how it affects her taxes, time, or freedoms. In my opinion, you're the problem with America, Makino, right up there with the starter of this thread's frivolous lawsuit. I would throw Enzo and his obsession with other people's cars into that &quot;problem&quot; group with you and the fat lawyer (because, like you, I need to label and group people in order to understand them) but I have a feeling he isn't an American. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 948<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 3:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=687.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &gt;which have better safety, emmission, and power/weight standards than in any european nation<br>

And just as an aside, I hate the homeless people in San Francisco, and made special arrangements last november to make sure I got to the polls to be able to vote for the proposition which would finally take away all the handouts the city gives them.  It passed nicely, but amazingly last week some judge ruled that the voters don't have the authority to dictate how the city spends its money.<br>
<br>
WTF?<br>
<br>
I thought that was the whole *point* in america... *sigh* in the meanwhile, the guy who uses my apartment building as a urinal every morning will continue to get his monthly stipend from the city which is more money than you'd imagine, considering the only qualification is saying you're homeless and smelling like urine.<br>

Shehb - the east coast isn't like California, public transportation is actually decent and fairly well-used.  New York City is the polar opposite of LA in that regard - more people live there, but the subway is the primary means of transportation.  It's part of the California Culture for some reason to be so addicted to driving - leading to LA's massive freeway mess.  Surprisingly, San Francisco's public transportation system is really quite good and fairly often used, but I suspect that's because you don't WANT to navigate the city in a car 'cuz of all the hills and lack of parking, if you can avoid it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alajan>Alajan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sly Rake</span><br>  Posts: 679<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 4:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=687.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;This whole arguement is about Makino's dislike of someone's personal lifestyle choices not how it affects her taxes, time, or freedoms.&quot;  <br>

Anywho, Arleanna is correct about the suburbs and major city relationship. Portland plays out the same exact drama which is why we put in a mass transit system a few years ago (sorta like an above ground subway). I remember at one of my society meetings where this woman was teaching us about the new park plans (this was a few years back) due to this issue. My city was buying up land to put in parks in strategic locations to buffer the raise in traffic. Oh and just for future reference, I drive a Mazda pickup for loading things and a Geo Metro for travel. The pickup gets great milage but really sucks up the old gas tank when hauling gravel! Oh well. I also love burning up shit loads of gas for fun trips all over the freakin state. Hope no one has a problem with that =p If ya do, send me your address and I'll write ya a card. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=largthemiserable>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 7:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=687.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> How come every time I read an Arleanna post I wanna find some money to send to him/her?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enzoblueksies>Enzo Blueksies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/14/03 7:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=687.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Sorry for the nerve hit arleanna, wow.

I myself dont' drive, (to the delight of my family and friends and other drivers), haven't since the last accident I had put the girl sitting next to me in a hospital for 6 mo's.  I live a 5 minute walk from work that I enjoy very much, especially as a winding down after work.  I also heartily enjoy the suprlus income I have from not owning a car, man it does add up.<br>
<br>
If any of youse have the means I reccomend abandoning the automobile altogether.  It's the largest stress producer that I've managed to shrug off to date.  It's amazing what it'll do to your constitution too.<br>

Agreed.  I don't hate Americans to the point I will disassociate with them.  But I can deeply frown down upon it all, just like plenty of other people around the world.  Liking it to the dislike of the French is pretty much perfect.<br>

Back to the original point of this post, is the lawsuit a bit extreme?  Actually it is very extreme and I don't think it will win.  But what it will do is bring people's minds conscious to the fact that these hydrogenated oil products are worse for you than you think, hell even the mere existence of them and food labels will be implemented to reflect as such.  That's the good I see out of this lawsuit.<br>
<br>
Also, you are not offended that food companies purposely didn't tell you about this stuff?  They kept it a secret from you so that you wouldn't freak out?<br>
<br>
Constitutional Rights has yet to be addressed regarding the federal governing of school nutrition, even by Soprena who should be raring to go to disprove me wrong.<br>
<br>
A signifigant portion of the US population is medically overweight or obese.  I think it is somewhere close to 50%, but my friend is borrowing my FFNation book, so I can't give you the % right now.  So if you take offense at me calling American people fat when so many of said Americans are indeed fat, then perhaps you shouldn't even be discussing here.  <br>
<br>
Should we, the rest of the world care how America eats?  Well yes, since said American food companies open up shop in overseas markets, thereby projecting American culture.<br>
<br>
Sheh, no argument from me with what you said.  But Fast Food encompasses more than just the burger stands, it also covers all the frozen food or industrialized food.  I also think Ireland by % is ahead of the Brits in terms of obesity.  And you are right, they are quickly aproching the US, but the US still remains king. <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>
