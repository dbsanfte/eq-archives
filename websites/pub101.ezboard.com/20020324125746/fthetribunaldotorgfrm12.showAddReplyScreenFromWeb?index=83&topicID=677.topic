Serious question.  Her whole response was one big kiss ass.  If i got into the companions and they gave me 300k in loot, i'd give it back if they wanted it.  Suuuuurrrre.  Coming from someone who hasn't seen 300k in their entire EQ career and could only dream of getting in a guild as capable as the Comps.  So please Krickett, as much as we love your amazingly educated opinion, stfu.  Go post on threads about incest in Hickville, Alabama, you might be a little more of an expert in that category.<br>
<br>
My opinion on Guild loot is it's a pain in the ass.  most the time, when guilds give out droppables, they are pretty much ready to take it in the ass if said person leaves the game.  And guild loot being given out by the player just pisses the guild off.  Custom is, you give it back to guild and let guild dispense it as they see fit.  How many people follow that custom...not many.  Hell, EV is missing God knows how many Trak BP's and even an SoD from jack ass's leaving the game and handing out their shit to their friends.  My advice....don't give jo shithole who was PL'd to 60 any droppable loot, cuz guess what, he's gonna stretch your rectum.  <br>
<br>
These 2 are obviously involved in some kind of scam, and i give sashanna props for logging the whole conversation.  Definitely incriminating.  So, i see either of these 2 applying for membership, fat fuck no from me.  Go fuck someone else over for guild loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujasmeralia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jasmeralia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Finally planar, FFS!<br>[Pickup P00ns]</span><br>  Posts: 1043<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 6:26:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.circleofpride.com/members/jasmer/jas_buffed.jpg height=110 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is pretty sad</span><hr size=1> Works for me, toss 'em both up there.<br>
