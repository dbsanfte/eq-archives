Living in the Greater Cincinnati area, we've had more than our share of police shootings and even a riot from one earlier this year so this is kinda hazy to me.  But, if I remember correctly the big stink was that the police shot this kid 41 times right?  Excessive force or some crap like that?<br><br>I dunno, how many cops were there shooting at this guy?  If it were you, and you were one of those cops, and you are in a situation where you believe you either kill this guy or he's about to make a damn good attempt to kill you... What would you do?  <br>A)  Wait a second or two more and see if he REALLY means to try to kill you?<br><br>B) shoot him in the leg because you're THAT good or mebbe shoot the gun out of his hand.  You watch a lot of movies and realize that this is possible.... /nod<br><br>C) Shoot him once, because once again you're that good and can be certain that you're one shot will be enough to stop him<br><br>D) unload about half your magazine or more because it's you or him, and you damn sure don't want it to be you?<br><br><br>I can understand when people get upset because a cop makes a bad judgement call and shoots some unarmed kid, somewhat.  But most of the time you're talking about someone who was running away to start with, then got cornered and did something stupid like made a sudden move.  Now if YOU were the cop and you have this guy/girl/whatever that was running from you, you're prolly gonna think he must have done something wrong or else he wouldnt' be running right?  Now you got him cornered and instead of doing the smart thing and just putting hands straight up in the air and holding still, or even better lying down on the ground face first with hands behind his head, he turns around to face you with a hand in his jacket or something... What thought's gonna go through your head?  I don't buy all this victimization bullshit that the media tries to spin on these CRIMINALS.  Sure, there are times when the police screw up and majorly, but the majority of these stories are twisted by the media so that everyone is thinking, 'oh that poor boy just got shot for trying to grab his wallet, DIRTY FUGGIN COPS!'  <br><br>It's pretty simple, if you have NOT done anything wrong, then why would you run down a dark alley just because some cop says, &quot;hey you&quot;???  When was the last time a story ran where some cop just shot someone dead who did NOT run or resist or make some stupid quick movement when the cop told them to halt or whatever?  rant rant rant, and so on but it bothers me the way the media twists the situations to make the cops always look like they're the brutal murderers when there's always a LOT more to the story than just &quot;Cop shoots unarmed!&quot;  Hell, even the Rodney King case was skewed IMO.  Did the cops beat the guy too much?  Yeah, I think they wen't a bit overboard.  BUT, when the cops tell you to lay down, and stay down, and you you move then they hit you... Don't you think you'd get the idea pretty quick that you'd best lay down and hold damn still, not keep trying to get up on your feet?  <br><br>So, in summary... Bruce Springsteen can piss off with his bullshit song.  Tell the WHOLE story or STFU.  I don't see a complete story/picture in this vague song.  Besides, what fucking difference does it make if the cops shot him one time in the head and killed him or 41 times.  Either way, he's dead. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9151">Sciek Spellbottler</a><br>Scaled Luminary - Tribunal Server<br>Master Alchemist, Smith, Brewer,  & Drunk!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usciekspellbottler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sciek Spellbottler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/31/01 6:32:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1170.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.onyxdragon.com/rol/sciektn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: American Skin, 41 shots</span><hr size=1> Did a little research since I just opened my big mouth about this and I think I have the basics of this case now.  Diallo was followed by 4 plain clothes cops to his appt., told to stop and continued walking to his appt. where he went inside? and reached for his wallet or something.  Cops then pulled guns and let loose with a hail of bullets...<br><br>Ok, big issue here is that he was black and being followed and stopped with no true &quot;probable cause&quot;.  I agree with that.  Most of the articles I read were about him being black and that if he were white he'd be alive because he wouldn't have been profiled the same.  Bad Policy for NYPD at the time, which was changed shortly thereafter... DUH.  <br><br>Now on to the next point, all the protests about the cops NOT being convicted of murder since Diallo was an innocent and unarmed man...  Now mebbe the cops lied or held back on part of the story and they did kill this guy in cold blood, I dunno.  BUT, from what is known/reported of the incident, I can't say most people wouldn't have done the same thing if they were in the cops place.  You're following someone you suspect as a rapist (a fucking lowlife, violent, detestable crime) and you tell the guy to stop.  He keeps going and reaches for something out of your view....  What do you do?  I dunno, from what I've found out so far I'd say it's yet again a case of someone being stupid and not simply stopping when told.  Today's lesson is:  If a cop says, &quot;STOP&quot;... STOP.  Don't reach for your wallet, don't run around the corner into an alley, don't spin around real fast with your hand in your pocket, STOP.  If you haven't done anything wrong, chances are the next few minutes may be annoying but you'll almost certainly live beyond them...<br><br>Anyone know more about this?  Am I missing some vital details here?... <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9151">Sciek Spellbottler</a><br>Scaled Luminary - Tribunal Server<br>Master Alchemist, Smith, Brewer,  & Drunk!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucogito.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cogito</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of the Whacky Woondarland</span><br>  Posts: 1571<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/31/01 10:59:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1170.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/Sgean/fullsize/green-face.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: American Skin, 41 shots</span><hr size=1> If it wasn't for Springsteen and Sting, I wouldn't know WHAT to make of all these strange and confusing issues.

We had situations ranging from your the passenger in a unit pulling over a van, you are back-up and the driver of your unit goes up on the traffic stop.  Then van's back-up lights come on and they slam on the gas, running over your partner and then the driver of the van bails out running back at you with his hand in his pocket of his jacket screaming he was sorry.  From here, it branches to either<br>a.  he pulls out a wallet while running at you full speed<br>b.  he pulls out a gun while running at you full speed<br>c.  doing either a. or b. and a passenger bails from the van  with a fully automatic weapon firing at you<br>d.  a. or b. and passenger bails out screaming and crying with both their hands in their pockets<br><br>and all this and you have barely seconds to react.  Makes you really think about officer safety whenever you engage the public.  I graduated from the police academy December 15th.  I am a certified officer in the state of Va, and i live in southwest virginia.  We dont have many police shootings at all (or shootings for that matter)  but still always have to be prepared for what happens.  For the most part, people here will obey and listen, especially if you have the time to tell them its for your safety as well as theirs, that usually makes them understand your point of view.  <br><br><br>Oh yeah, and we are taught to fire 2 rounds and scan left and right, then holster.  In Va, we have had police shot because they fired 2 rounds and reholstered before the subject was down, simply due to the fact that in that stressful situation your mind reverts to what you have been trained to do.  In our academy we were lucky to have an ex-state police trooper as our academy assistant director, and he had taught officer survival for the state police for 10 years and was on the tact team for 15.  Its amazing how much 18 weeks can change your view about everyday life.   <p>Cornisolis Lioneater, 55th Myrmidon<BR>Corniul, 52nd Wanderer<BR>Cornweil, 39th Rogue<BR>Guild Officer<BR>Eternal Heroes<BR>Tribunal Server<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46024 >Magelo</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 491<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/2/02 3:06:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1170.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: American Skin, 41 shots</span><hr size=1> Actually, I should have qualified that statement...

I'm not an expert, but I have had training in Naval SORT (Special Operations Response Team) and NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) Shipboard Security Engagement Tactics.  <br><br>Apparently the standard sidearm most often issued by the government is the Baretta 9mm.  The reasons are because the 9mm round is cheaper and is the NATO standard (for military it's supposed to work like this:  I'm on a battlefield out of ammo, but luckily the Italian NATO peacekeeper corpse next to me has the same bullets my weapon uses), and because the Baretta offers a combination three safety features most other weapons, such as the Glock (the most popular law enforcment brand, but not issued), don't offer.  <br><br>The funny thing about a 9mm round is that it often goes right through a body without causing all that much damage.  It's a small, high velocity round that will go right through flesh with ease without causing the damage due to fluid expansion that larger, softer rounds do.  We learned that because of this tendancy to pass right through flesh, a human can take as many as NINE rounds around center mass and still keep coming.  Knowing this, if I had to shoot someone, you can bet your ass that I would make him look like he was peppered with 9mm buckshot.<br><br>Incedentally, in the time it takes some of the fastest draws in the U.S. to draw their sidearm, an agressor can travel as much as 21 feet.  This has been tried and tested repeatedly to help detirmine a safe distance from which to subdue a potentially armed suspect.  If that guy had even pulled a knife and he was within that distance, he could potentially have stabbed a cop before a shot was fired.  That's pretty scarry.  <br><br>P.S.  I don't like most cops, but they have a shitty job, and I absolutely hate the media!  News agencies today lead the sheople of our nation around by the nose and it makes me sick!<br><br> <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14983>Tinuviel Elvenstar</a><br><img src="http://www.solarflare.tv/sigs/ezbrdsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 498<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/4/02 3:45:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1170.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: American Skin, 41 shots</span><hr size=1> The idea when you shoot someone is to transfer as much energy from the bullet to the target as possible. The reason being, a person may bleed to death from a bullet wound, but that takes time, during which the person is still a threat. If a bullet goes straight through a person, then my guess is you are using full metal jacketed slug.<br><br>The best shells for energy transfer are hollow points. Instead of cutting through on impact, they mushroom. Last I knew, police use +p+ hollow point ammunition for downing suspects. When hit with these shells, it's like being punched by a battering ram from what I have heard. Civilians can buy +p, but +p+ is police only issue.<br><br>FMJ shells are good for shooting someone through glass or other non-hardened objects (a 9mm will most likely have a hard time fully penetrating a car door and hitting the passenger/driver unless at close range though).<br><br>Of course, small ronds can do a ton of damage. a .22 shell will often penetrate and than bouce around inside the body causing massive amounts of damage, but again, it can take timne for that damage to incapacitate the subject.<br><br>Anyways, this is all assuming you are not a sniper, who can put a FMJ shell pretty much where they want it. FMJ shells are fine if you're good enough to hit the spinal column of a target <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><br><center> <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1146">Loegan Wolfheart </A><A HREF="http://www.the-elitists.com/">(The Elitists)</A> <br><center>Druid of the 60th Ring <br><center> Resident of The Tribunal <br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 499<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/4/02 4:04:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1170.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: American Skin, 41 shots</span><hr size=1> Note - I did it again... police is far too general.

I use a 115gr, +p jacketed hollow point. It's subsonic and builds up alot of pressure, so make sure your firearm is rated for it.<br><br>I like it because it has the best expansion of any 9mm round I know of (commercialy availible that is) and even does pretty well on maintaining some accuracy/energy when passing through barriers.<br><br>It's clean ammunition and I have never had any jamming problems with it. Basically, it's great general purpose round when a handgun is required for self defense.<br><br>If you are the type that wants to have all your bases covered, you can even keep a clip of FMJ ammo on you in case you need to fire through barriers. IMO though, if you have a barrier between you and the target then escape is probably the best course of action, since we are talking self defense and not law enforcement use.<br><br>If you do use a firearm and haven't taken at least a gun safety course, than please get into one. It's best to get into a firearm self defense course though, as they give you much more info, including the best ammunition for your purpose. There is alot you need to know about mentally preparing to defend yourself with a firearm (don't pull it if you can't commit to using it when needed, because chances are your target can and will) as well as being aware of your background and knowing the range/penetration of your ammo. A reputable firearm instructor can teach you about all this and alot more.<br><br>If you haven't prepared yourself to use a firearm, then you could well be more of a danger to your family than the person(s) who you are trying to protect them from. <p><br><center> <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1146">Loegan Wolfheart </A><A HREF="http://www.the-elitists.com/">(The
