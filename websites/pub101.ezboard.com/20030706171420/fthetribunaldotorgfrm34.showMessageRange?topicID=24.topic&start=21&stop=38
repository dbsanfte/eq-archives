<br>
The reason is simple:  Yes, the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; says you'll be doubling your money so that you have 2 18s and can lose to the dealer's 19.  However, statistically, it is *FAR* in your advantage to do this... without going into the math, safe to say that 18 is a statistically &quot;winning hand&quot; - in other words, with an 18, even with a dealer 9 showing, you will win more often than you lose.<br>
<br>
There is exactly ONE reason why the casino makes money on Blackjack.  They go last.  Gives all the people who WOULD have beaten them a chance to bust, first.<br>
<br>
Always split aces and 8s... aces because 2 21s &gt; 1 12, and 8s because 18 is a winning hand and 16 is a losing hand.  Don't even look at the dealer's card unless you're counting.<br>
<br>
Never take insurance unless you're counting (and if you know how to count, you know when to take insurance :) )<br>
<br>
Craps has better odds than blackjack but only if you only play the line :)  Blackjack is the only game in the casino that you *can* make money on, though - but you have to count cards to do it.  This is perfectly legal in Atlantic City but will get you booted in Vegas :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uyawgmothdaemon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YawgmothDaemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/30/01 5:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> standing and 16 is just dumb</span><hr size=1> standing at 16 with the house showing a 9 is just dumb =P<br>

Math doesn't lie, but you can choose to ignore the hard numbers.  In fact, the casinos want you to ignore it because they make their money off of the idiots who do so. <p>Cathol Chevalier <BR>

Yes, and no. In my experience, no. I've never had any problem with counting. But I never were any good at it, and never played all that much. I think they really only boot counters who win. <br>
<br>
Once, a guy mosey up to the table and explained that he had been practicing card counting on his computer all week, so he was really excited to play -- dealer just smiled and wished him luck. <br>
<br>
And myself, I would make make huge changes in my bets, when the count went high, I mean I'd be really obvious about it. I'd play the first seat, bet $5 (yeah I pretty much always played the low end, heh), maybe win, leave the original bet and the payoff there, but then plonk out an extra $40 cos a shitload of 4, 5, 6 etc left the deck when the dealer delt the rest of the table. And then, if they shuffled the deck on me at that point, I'd grab the chips and go back to a $5 bet again. I never had a dealer nor a any pit boss hassle me over it, Vegas, Reno, Tahoe, Atlantic city. I would lose, but I would lose only a little. I think they only hassle people who play a lot, and win consistently. <br>
<br>
The main programmer behind Quake, John Somethingorother -- I forget his surname, not Romero -- he once had a neat story in his .plan file. Said he'd been asked to quit playing Blackjack, I think it was a Vegas place. He counted, and said he'd problably won a total of approx $30,000 (can't remember what time period). He wasn't outraged or anything, and 30k wasn't a big deal to him anways. The pit boss was polite and courteous, saying he was more than welcome to stay around and play any other game, but could he please not play Blackjack, heheh. <br>
<br>
Only problem I ever had, was at the Peppermill in Reno. This place had female dealers only (dunno if this is still the case, they've probly gotten sued over it or something by now), young ones, hotties as far as the eye could see... This dealer wasn't paying attention, and neither were I <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Well, she started shuffling the deck without playing my hand. I wasn't covering the card up or anything, she just spazzed out I guess. So I said hang on you haven't dealt me yet! And since she's shuffled the deck, and players never think of the deck as being random, she didn't want to deal me. Well, I'm sure there are procedures for this that they have to follow, of course. So she brought the pit boss over, and he took a quick look at this, and told her to pay me as if I had won the bet, collect the card and continue. <br>
<br>
No problem, I thought. But then, after the dealer had dealt only a single round, a new dealer showed up. Our current dealer had only done about 5 or 10 min of her shift (shifts are about 20-30 min or so), so this was totally unusual, I'd never see them do this before. And this dealer was totally unusual also. She was middle aged, and stood out like a sore thumb, compared to the rest of the Peppermill babes. And she the most foul, sour expression I had ever seen on any damn dealer. And, she was REALLY good, the fastest dealer I ever saw. Her movements were totally minimalistic, the cards just flew off the deck like bullets. And when she delt me, she sent the cards right into my fingers! You know how you hold your hand on the table, and scrape or shake your hand to indicate hit or stand? BONK, card hit my fingers, I thought it was a coincidence. BONK again. WTF. Third time, I start picking my hands up off the table, wondering what the hell is going on here? And then I realized -- they fucking well thought I had palmed that goddamn card, that I had taken it out of play, and hidden it, to cheat... So they brought this nasty hag in to give me a hint to please fuck off. Obviously, I hadn't cheated, and if they had looked at the surveilance tapes, they could have seen this, so I guess this must have been just a decision the pit boss took on the fly. <br>
<br>
That hag had a streak of 21s, like I have never seen before either -- just wiped us all out. I lost nearly every single hand out of 20 or so, just sitting there in a kinda shocked state... I think it makes no damn sense at all, that this dealer would have cheated, because casinos stand to lose a shitload, if they get caught cheating. But she just had had 21 after 21 after 21, it was nuts. <br>

<br>
I remember looking around a lot to try find single deck games in Reno, and also remember always picking the game with the fewest number of decks. But I also remember reading that the only difference between a single or multi deck, is that it's easier to count a single. With multi decks, you have to remember how many cards have been delt, in addition to how the actual count. Also, a multi-deck can get much richer in tens, than a single deck. <br>

There is indeed a high demand for single deck games.  However unless you are counting, the shoe is not going to change your odds.<br>

If nothing else, they put on a really experienced dealer who would be more likely to catch you :)<br>
<br>
The house wouldn't cheat - they don't have to.  They win by playing by the rules :) under no circumstances would they chance it, IMHO.<br>
<br>
Nobody playing $5 blackjack is ever gonna get booted for counting.  As long as you're not obvious about it (and don't use any sort of computer aide or take notes on paper or what have you) they'll leave you alone.  Card counters DO win - but not by a huge margin.  20% maybe - so if you play $300/hr and win $60/hr by skillful play - that's nothing to them.<br>
<br>
Real card counters (people who make a difference to the casino bottom line) generally work in teams and will have about a $100,000 bankroll when they walk into the casino.  The same 20% now will yield them $20-30,000/hour ... you can see why they rapidly get banned.<br>
<br>
I card count for &quot;sport&quot; and have never ever made money off of  it :) but it makes the game a bit more fun than just sitting there following basic strategy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utrindletrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle Trueheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pally Chick :)</span><br>  Posts: 412<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/1/01 5:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blackjack Problem</span><hr size=1> My Personal Blackjack rules.<br>
<br>
1.  Always assume the Dealer has a 10 Down.<br>
<br>
2.  Always split 8's and aces.<br>
<br>
3.  Always play the same way the house does.  <br>
Um.. they usually win, there's something to hitting on 16's or less.  I'm superstitious about 12's though... that damn number almost always burns me. <br>
I once heard the average dealer's hand is 18.93 or something like that.  Play to beat it.<br>
<br>
4.  Never play Blackjack in Tahoe.  Just don't. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5.  Tip your dealer, Tip your dealer, Tip your dealer.  <br>
They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> take care of you if you pay attention.<br>
<br>
6.  VERY IMPORTANT.  Starting off at a new table, If you lose more than 5 hands in a row, LEAVE and find another table.  Always hit a table with happy people, Never sit down at a table with quiet negative people.<br>
  <br>
<br>
Call it luck, call it sticking to the rules, i <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> usually</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> come away from a night of black Jack with chips to cash in. (profit)<br>
<br>
I love seeing nervous pit bosses *grin*<br>

<br>
1. Always assume the Dealer has a 10 Down.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Don't assume that the dealer always has a 10 down. The dealer is only as likely to have a 10 down, as any other player on the table. But be aware of the fact that 10s are four times more likely to be the dealer's downcard -- and your downcard. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
2. Always split 8's and aces.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Agreed. Unless you are counting -- and are good at it, heheh. I never were. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
3. Always play the same way the house does. <br>
Um.. they usually win, there's something to hitting on 16's or less. I'm superstitious about 12's though... that damn number almost always burns me. <br>
I once heard the average dealer's hand is 18.93 or something like that. Play to beat it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No! Don't play the same way the house does. The house has a huge advantage over you: they play last, and thus if the house, and the player busts, the house still wins. The advantage the player has, is that 21 is paid 1.5, rather than 1, for the player -- but not for the house. This means your strategy should be quite different from the house strategy. I don't know if the average dealer's hand is 18.93, as I never got into the number; the actual mathematics. It sounds quite intimidating, 18.93, but then again I do not know what a player's average hand is. <br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
4. Never play Blackjack in Tahoe. Just don't.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I agree. Enjoy the scenery instead <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
5. Tip your dealer, Tip your dealer, Tip your dealer. <br>
They will take care of you if you pay attention.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I agree. But make sure you make your tip in the form of a bet! I enjoy tipping, and tipping well. I never tipped a blackjack dealer except in the form of a bet. Sometimes, I made their tip as big as my bet. I don't think it influenced my wins, but well, I read yer average dealer were as much of a gambler, as yer average casino visitor, and having a bet on the table riding on you, makes you sorta feel like part of the action. I do wish tips went to dealers personally though, and not into some community box. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
6. VERY IMPORTANT. Starting off at a new table, If you lose more than 5 hands in a row, LEAVE and find another table. Always hit a table with happy people, Never sit down at a table with quiet negative people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I do not believe that a dealer is hot or cold. There are no such things as streaks, except in retrospect. I believe I will do equally well, or badly, at a table where people are happy, or sad. Those are just cards, coming out of the shoe, people. Not divine karma. However, I do realize that this is a hobby, and not a job. So if you want to have fun, yes stay away. <br>
