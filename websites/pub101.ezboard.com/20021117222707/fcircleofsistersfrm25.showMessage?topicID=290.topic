It was time he finally let everyone know what he was, what he wanted. With the &quot;Frozenheart&quot; in his hands he began to write Feverishly, later posting in the guild halls and quickly running away, it was better to talk now, then later.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dearest ......No.....Dear MY family,<br>
<br>
It's time all of y' learned of my lineage....it's time all of y' learned of what my last name really means, Frozenrose. It wasn't but a few decades go when m' eldest walked about, Married to a fine fine young lass with ill tidings. A typical barbarian household everyone was of the white rose. That was our life. T' b' the very thing that defended halas itself. We were respected beyond compare, and spoiled of course along with it. But, people, get jealous. M' gran'father took m' father out one day fer a hunt along the outside o' the blackburrow dungeons. That was when it went wrong, A tier'dal showed up, at least that's what they thought it was, and drawing weapons a battle emerged, pig headed, they never thought it might have been an image of illusion....and aye it was...it be a bit of the demonic thin' called a vampire I think they called it. None the less she wielded magic far beyond compare. An' I dinae what happened that day, but I remember the words through the time line, passed down. &quot;She made y' into cursed folk lad...folk that thrive on the blood o' their victims, that be savage that be insane...best y' go now.....yer not wanted her no more&quot; ....that was my best mate.....and m' dead mate for talking to me.... They slaughtered the lot of m'' family cept fer mum, she managed to be away. But, somethin' strange happened, m' mum had a crystal show up in the middle of th' night, pure, and frozen, likea  heart shape...very fragile. it happened before I was born when another showed up of a blue nature, takin to a shaman of ogres, who now treated us as family, even as a young boy I remember their words &quot;Dey be guud, n dey be bad, dunne brek deez, or yer soul will belon tu whoever brokeded it....in oder words...dis be yer essense...&quot; ...my essense...in a jewel....a pure jewel....M' mother ....was attacked by a clan of Teir'dals seeking out t' destroy us after talkin' t' the ogres, just a single assasin, who killed m' mum after..... &lt; the ink is blotchy here...as if the pen was tapped hard &gt;&gt; after th' bastard broke her jewel and enslaved her for disgusting rituals tha' only a tier'dal scum could come up with. As fer me.....I was a young lad, reading, I was alone from m' mum fer the longest time, and the assasins could not find me, I read with the Euridites, the Sylvians, The Tier'dals taht dinae know who I was, the humans, I read all around, the theories o' norrath and luclin, until, in the shivering cold, back home I sat reading a book under the light of a willowwisps lightstone...that's when the tier'dal female found me. <br>
<br>
T' bring a romantic story short..and to not make the young ones blush and learn more then they should. Instead of killin' me, she, pitied me, and held m' t' warm me, I dinae think any tier'dal could ever be so loving. She treated me as a babe, and even one day caught my essense jewel fallin from m' shirt, smiling she kissed it, and placed it back in my hands. I loved this gal, with all m' heart...and in the same...she t' mine....we wed under a red harvest moon...me in m' vampiric form, her as the supposed tier'dal she was...until about 2 year later ..she died.... That's when I remembered m' books from the dark ones.<br>
<br>
&quot;A succubus cannot fall in love....to do so goes again innorruk our lords very being....therefore...within an amount of alloted time, they will die...very quickly....but not painfully....to be ...deprogrammed...in a sense...in our lords chambers...his faceless heart be praised....&quot;<br>
<br>
Tears ran down meh cheeks....and from then on I suffered this curse..nev'r really having a home, wanderin' from place t' place...until....Nollani took m' away....and I found y'...my new family....I din feed like my kin folk did. I nay be a savage, t' abide my hunger I have the vials that drop from the things I slay that hurt his world.....in all goals formed....I want to save this world...give it love...which be so hard for me to find...And protect you..my family...who which I love now so dearly...as I would gladly shatter this single Heart of Ice for.....<br>
<br>
Eternally yours,<br>
<br>
Vlaye Frozenheart<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Some sort of a symbol laid on the bottom..the same which is the wode on the side of his face....below...lies a strange symbol of a heart with some sort of fangs around it....tacked onto the board  with a stray fine steel dagger&gt;&gt;<br>
