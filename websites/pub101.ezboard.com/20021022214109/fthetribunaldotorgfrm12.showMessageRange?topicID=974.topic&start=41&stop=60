<br>
I am not asking for more coverage of Jesse Dirkhising, i am asking for less, much less coverage of Matthew Shephard type incidents.<br>
<br>
Each was a murder.  Each had an evil motive.  The only difference is that one could help push the gay-friendly media's agenda, and the other could not.<br>
<br>
On a similar note is the catholic church scandal going on atm.  95-98% of the abuse was NOT pedophilia.  It was homosexual men molesting teenage boys.  This crimes are  something the left (NAMBLA) wishes to make legal.  The media has kept this story about the evil of the catholic church and NOT about the real issue--gay men abusing their positions to prey on young men.<br>
<br>
&quot;This world cannot support an infinite population. Perhaps homosexuality is Nature's way of trying to remove a portion of the population from the breeding pool.&quot; <br>
<br>
The population bomb is a myth perpetrated by the left in order to advance their anti-capitalist anti-growth agenda.  The earth is no where near it's capacity.  I won't even touch the whole removal from the breeding pool thing, you left yourself wide open there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sex is not only for reproduction, but it's also a way to create a bond.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gays seem to have trouble with the bond thing.  As reported in the statistics i quoted above, gays are very, very promiscuous.  <br>

<br>
Also, to say that the nature of sex is to reproduce, then I am guessing you believe people shouldn't use protection? I mean, that doesn't encourage reproduction really. Natural selection factors very little into the lives of most people so enormous amounts of offspring aren't needed. And even if tons of offspring were needed, at worst you can say homosexuality could be a genetic flaw, in which case it doesn't matter because it is weeds itself out. And, you say the population boom is a myth? Look around you, polution is at its highest and if the human race survives another thousand years I'd be surprised. It isn't a matter of if humans could be supported by earth any more, it's a matter of if humans can live on the planet without fucking it up to badly.<br>
<br>
So far, I have seen nothing to prove homosexuality is in any way a bad thing. You say homosexuals are wrong or whatever because of some of these incidents? Are all of use who are heterosexual horrible people because Hitler was heterosexual or because Stalin was heterosexual or because of &lt;insert random streight male here&gt; was a jackass?

<br>
As far as Gutterpup goes..<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And Krickett, there are now over 6 billion people on this planet. If you've ever studied algebra, you might have been taught that population grows exponentially. This world cannot support an infinite population. Perhaps homosexuality is Nature's way of trying to remove a portion of the population from the breeding pool.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Along those same lines I could retort that AIDS is natures way of removing the portion of the human population that goes against the laws of nature. Sure Aids affects heterosexuals too because its a disease that kills humans and whether you are gay or straight your are a human. The fact remains that the largest percentage of people dying/dead from aids are intraveineous drug users (these I call degenerates) and homosexuals. (i dont use the term degenerate here)<br>
I could have a decent discussion about this with you Gutterpup until you start lashing out blindly like Snibbs then it becomes nothing more than you trying in anyway possible and pulling shit out of the air to justify your life style. When you said &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I can't help it that person happens to have been born the same gender I was.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; , Thats all you need to say. I dont hate you. I will only hate you when you try to force your life style on me (as in try to make me your lover). I will only hate you if you are parenting a child and you are trying to raise this child to become what you are. There is a vast differance between accepting homosexuality as a possible cruel twist of fate/nature and preaching that it is a normal lifestyle to live. My children are taught to accept people for what they are regardless of race or creed. But acceptance only means respect. It does not mean to live that life style.<br>
<br>
Snibbs, when you learn to accept yourself for what you are let me know. You will know when you have accepted your fate because you will cease the bullshit rhetoric and actually attempt an intellectual conversation. One example of what I am talking about is this line from you. &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> at worst you can say homosexuality could be a genetic flaw, in which case it doesn't matter because it is weeds itself out</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; . Reccessive genes do not weed themselves. The only way to weed them out is to end the life of everyone that carries the reccessive gene before they can pass it along. Yes I could very well have the same reccessive gene in me that you do in you. Only differance is yours came to dominant and mine is still mainly reccessive. Accept yourself and think before you speak.<br>

<br>
Nature is not an entity. What we call &quot;nature&quot; is replaceable by &quot;some inexplicable reason,&quot; because we use the word to explain things that we honestly have no fucking clue about.<br>
<br>
Honestly, people - do you *really* think that if nature had an &quot;intent&quot; for the way things work that we would be able to defy it?<br>
<br>
People talk about humans having free will. Well, do you think a &quot;higher power&quot; would have created us - or any other creature - endowed with free will and cognitive abilities if they expected us to do EXACTLY what they had intended?<br>
<br>
Do we create computers that are capable of doing anything other than what we want them to? Fuck, no! Now, some people create programs within those computers to warp them, but the computer itself is created to do exactly what its maker wants. If anyone ever decides that they want to program a computer to do what *it* wants, then maybe that will change.<br>
<br>
It's a loose analogy, but the central idea is correct. If nature had a specific, unalterable way of life for living creatures in mind, they wouldn't be able to deviate. All birds would fly.<br>
<br>
Now, as to the original subject of this thread - gayness. Homosexuality is - like many other points of controversy - simply a different way of life. Who am I to say whether it is right or wrong? If everything in this world came down to right and wrong, black and white, then this flameboard wouldn't really exist, because it thrives on difference of opinion - the &quot;grey&quot; area.<br>
<br>
And the whole &quot;crime&quot; section of this thread. Everybody commits crimes. Gay people sodomize little boys, straight people rape little girls. Both are violating (no pun intended) the rights of an individual, and both are guilty of a heinous misdeed. Why is is that you care about the coverage of the story as related to a different one, rather than caring about the kid? Even if it IS some media conspiracy... homosexuals aren't the first one.<br>
<br>
Oh, and here's one for you people trying to figure out what defines &quot;gayness.&quot; A strong percentage (if you really want me to, I guess I could bother to look it up) of straight men admit to having a homosexual fantasy at one time or another. It's usually brief and passes. A lot of gay men may still (and have still) had sex with women. Not to mention the existence of bisexuals! <br>
<br>
So could it really be defined as genetic? Because then it would have to work on more than one pair of genes (trying not to dip in to too much technicality as far as what of genetics this burgeioning med student knows) because there's more than 2 outcomes. In that case, like height (for which there are quite a few genes), it would then tend towards a middle average - bisexuality. But bisexuals are the *smallest* group, as far as we can tell, AND the lines between the behavior of the groups blur. That hurts the credibility of the genetic theory. A lot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udvinatsat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dvinatsat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 2:11:53 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.sinz.net/slurpeekingdom/movies/dan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: With all of the topics sharing this theme:</span><hr size=1> <br>

Let me put it this way. People who have an unfounded belief back it up by saying that their belief is the way that &quot;nature intended&quot; things to be.<br>
<br>
What the statement that you called into question meant was that people who are dumb enough to say stuff like that should really say: &quot;I don't have a fucking clue WHY I'm right, I just am too fucking stubborn and self-righteous to admit the possiblity of not being right.&quot;<br>

<br>
You're stating that people who believe in unfounded beliefs (like those who believe in quantum physics right?) do so under the authority of 'that's the way nature intended.'  So, like in the case of quantum physics, because particles appear to operate in a dual-nature way we state that they do...but under the caveat that our only proof is we think 'that's the way nature intended'. <br>
<br>
Therefore people too dumb to explain why this happens form a working theory from the empirical data at hand and then resolvedly claim 'We are right!' and 'We have no idea why we're right!'  <br>
<br>
In essence you're embodying your own arguement but from the other side of the coin; your rationalizations are unfounded in categorizing nature as a 'non-entity'. You are the one claiming this, yet that you 'don't have a fucking clue' about how it could be right. Ah, but alas you're not looking at the empirical data at hand.  You're a med student you said...then you can probably name the characteristics of a living system.  Apply these to the earth as a whole.  Better yet read that Gaia theory, cause it's already been done.<br>
<br>
After you do that, I ask again, why is it that you're too fucking stubborn and self-righteous to admit that you could be wrong about the earth being a self-contained living consciousness?  Why is it that your statement that nature is not an entity is a fact and not an unfounded belief as I suggest?  Because this really invalidates everything you said about nature not having an intent or control over the species that populate its world.  You view it only as a system where 'this must happen, or these must be do this unalterably' such as your 'all birds would fly' statement - and since this isn't present then we're not in this type of system.  So what if instead it's more like a checks and balances thing, such as 'hmm, penguins lost the ability of flight, we'll adapt them to sub-zero temperatures so they don't have to fly to avoid the weather' kind of thing.  And with these attributes penguins were naturally suited towards the polar region of the earth, so in the event of the continents breaking up that's where they remained, suited to their ecostructure and having no need to migrate.  Not that events like this have to occur on some conscious level, just that nature's machinations even alterations and evolutions out.  A system that is aware and adapts to its envrionment, but not necessarily sentient.<br>
<br>
But no, that can't be right can it.  Nature's not an entity, it didn't 'intend' to adapt to changes.  It was some inexplicable reason that did it. Yeah.<br>
<br>
The rest of your arguement is just as inane.  'Do we create computers that are capable of doing other than we want them to'?  No...because we can't yet.  It's called artificial intelligence and they've been trying to develop it for over 25 years.  'Why is it you care about the coverage of the story...rather than caring about the kid' ?  Uh, isn't trying to call light to the story caring about what happened to the kid?  This received almost no national media coverage, and had it it would've been shrugged off by NAMBLA or similar organizations.  Probably something to the tune of &quot;well, if man-boy relations were legal to begin with they wouldn't have had to drug and gag him, would they&quot;.  You'd rather ignore it huh.  As for your whole genetics essay, who said homosexuality was genetic?  I've yet to see that in this thread.<br>

Did you not *read* the argument? I was pointing out how &quot;nature&quot; is NOT sentient! The closest that we can come to categorizing &quot;nature&quot; is a series of patterns, both evolutionary and metaphysical, that have &quot;steered&quot; the development and evolution of living organisms.

<br>
How is it unfounded? We are aware of the systems, the laws of physics. They never change. They aren't subject to any mood swings or reversals of decisions by this supposed consciousness. And with the theories of how things came to their present state, the Gaia theory is not needed to fill any gaps in logic. It's simply a less-accepted idea. The goal of science is to logically explain this world, not to come up with how a &quot;more powerful force&quot; or &quot;higher consciousness&quot; or &quot;sentient planet&quot; simply said &quot;Let there be penguins.&quot;<br>
<br>
The point I was making is that people who lack a decent argument state that &quot;nature intended&quot; for their idea to be right simply BECAUSE they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  cannot think of another, decent argument! </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

sentient (adj.) conscious, capable of sensation, responsive to stimuli.<br>
<br>
So it's aware and adapts... but it's not aware and doesn't adapt.<br>

I guess you're right. Trying to save peoples' lives is such a menial and dishonorable profession. Remember earlier when I said that I was hoping you wouldn't still sound so stupid? If all I cared about was big bucks, I wouldn't be setting myself up to go into debt for 10+years of school at Vanderbilt so that I could be a doctor, when I could go to the UT School of Business for fucking free and be an investment banker that can make a whole hell of a lot more than an entry-level, unspecialized doctor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugoshozalsansmerci.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goshozal Sans Merci</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 6:00:34 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.animatedgif.net/violent/sbvorpal4_e0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: With all of the topics sharing this theme:</span><hr size=1> You shouldn't work your mind so hard on the Sabbath, Dumai.

I said this to him:<br>
I hope your mom labels your sneakers so you get them on the right feet.<br>
He interpreted this as a slam on his mom. Amusing.<br>
The slam was on YOU not grasping simple ideas like left and right. Looks like it was very appropriate too.<br>
Krickett when I sqaid similar atrocities were commited by straight men (note the word straight) I meant on young girls.<br>
Or would you presume to state that no crimes of this nature are commited by straight males?<br>
Dumai, once again the reason the Shepard case got more media attention is because of the motive of the murderers.<br>
These were not guys running around in general commiting crimes against other individuals. They saw a gay man, perhaps he did or did not approach them.<br>
If he did I suspect if they'd showed no interest in his advances he would have probably gone on to greener pastures, just as Straight men of average intelligence will do when a woman expresses no interest in them.<br>
As to degenrate Dvin, I'm supplying you with a definition since you don't know what the word means.<br>
Degenerate<br>
having declined (as in nature, character, structure, or function) from an ancestral or former state b : having sunk to a condition below that which is normal to a type; especially : having sunk to a lower and usually corrupt and vicious state<br>
Let's look at each of the three and see if we can help you with this word.<br>
First, if your nature is to be gay, which many believe it is, being gay does not fit this definition.<br>
For those who believe being gay is an acquired taste I challenge you to give me the day you woke up and said to yourself..Hmm..guys or girls? They both sure do look good and make me sexually excited. Which should I choose? Talk about your tough questions. i can tell you no such issue ever arose with me, perhaps some of you are different and went through that. When did you choose to ignore the sexual stirrings looking at a man gave you Dvin?<br>
The second definition doesn't fit too well either, if your type is a gay male, you've declined from nothing.<br>
Now the third one does fit the guys that killed Jesse, but not simply because they're gay.<br>
It fits any vicious murderer.<br>
And Dvin, you can claim to be calm, but go back and look at your earlier posts, looks kinda venom-filled to me.<br>
I'd love to know how someone can work up anger like that and claim they were calm. <p><center><i>
