Learn these basic facts and note how I string them together oh so logically and eloquently into a cohesive theory and projection.  You wont find it in your textbooks.<br>
<br>
Stalin came to power in the early 1920's.  After spending those early 1920's solidifying his power base, he then embarked on a massive program of industrialization (The first 5 year plan was set forth in 192<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  USSR which was still by all means and respects about 200 years development-wise behind its western counterparts in the early 1920's, practically caught up to the western powers development-wise by the mid to late 1930's or so.  Stalin was an exceptionally strong and charismatic leader who did what he thought was necessary to maintain his power.  Such as letting Ukrainian people starve from famine in the early 1920's(to force them into submission) or the mass purges of the officer corps in the late 1930's (to remove opposition).<br>
<br>
Just so we dont make any qualms about numbers and stats, I'll quote to you the rough number of casualties right off the bat.  Hitler killed about 25 million USSR soldiers and civilians(although some historians quote the number as high as 40 million), while Stalin killed about 30 million of his own people.  Most of the Soviet casualties came in the first 2 years of the war.<br>
<br>
If Stalin had not mass murdered or starved the opposition into submission and maintained his iron grip on power while quickly using that power to bring up USSR's economy up to the production benchmarks established by western powers, USSR would have never won the Second World War.  If USSR allowed Germany to win, the entire Second World War could have very well been won by the Germans and the world would be a much different and less populous place than it is today.<br>
<br>
There was a study done about 8-9 years ago or so that calculated if USSR would have lost the war, it would take almost 100,000,000 casualties by the time the Germans finished sweeping through it. With the rest of the population escaping to Southern Asia and Siberia.<br>
<br>
There was simply a colossal amount of patriotism and faith in Stalin among the Soviet Armed Forces and without the respect and confidence that the soldiers had for Stalin, USSR would simply crumble under the German onslaught, especially in the summer of 1942.<br>
<br>
The ends justified the means.<br>
<br>
Got that?

<br>
The ideal of Communism was long dead, retard.  Only the peons and your average russki farmer Ivan (which incidentally comprised the majority of the Soviet population) believed in it because they didn't know any better.  The reason people got sent to the Gulags is not because they opposed the great ideal of Communism, it is because they were politically dangerous to Stalin's power base which are two completely different things.<br>
<br>

<br>
If you want to play that little game of fallacy, we can also pin every person who died due to effects of imperialism on U.S.  See how well that works when reversed?<br>
<br>
For the first 2 decades of his rule, Stalin focused entirely on domestic problems and turmoil.  It is only after USSR was attacked in 1941 and won by 1945 that Stalin began to make overtures towards foreign land which led to formation of the Eastern Bloc because he felt that USSR was being dicked by U.S..  Whereas Germany and Western Europe received monies (Marshall Plan) to rebuild, USSR got practically nothing for all the sacrifices it made.<br>
<br>
Or actually, if you want to blame Communism for those people who died, shouldnt you be pinning the original blame on Karl Marx who came up with the refined theory of Communism?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This lesson is free, by the way.  You can thank me later.<br>

<br>
they starved because he had all the kulaks taken out and shot. He ruined the farming production of his nation in his war against the smallholder. <br>
<br>
tell me the officer corps had great faith in stalin. come on dude, the only faith those poor guys had was faith in the bullet in the head they were going to catch if the had even a minor setback.  <br>
<br>
the reason the russians got their ass whipped in the first 2 years of the war was because stalin had shot all the Officer Corps before the war even started. ask yourself how the Russians would have faired if stalin had not directly caused the death of 20-40% of the entire population of his nation before the war started? if he had not killed all the Capable officer corps before the war started? If he had not murdered all the industrialists and scientists? <br>
<br>
you cannot state unequivocally that the ends justified the means because you cannot prove that a different and more postive outcome would not have come into being if STalin had refrained from his murderous urges. <br>
<br>
you have no idea what the situation would have been like if Stalin had not turned his rage onto his own people and murdered them. You cannot ever justify the murder of 20-40 million people by their leader and tell me that if they had not been murdered the russions would have lost the war. that is idiocy. sheet if the officer corps had not been decimated and overtaken by pandering simps perhaps the germans would have never even made it to stalingrad.<br>

You sir, are on crack.  Perhaps you mean the most numerous since by 1941, the Soviet tank forces numbered around 20,000 tanks.  Most capable?  HARDLY.<br>
Most modern?  The case for this could possibly be made since USSR was introducing a new tank line in 1937 right before the purges, the chassis was subsequently used for heavy tanks and 122+ mm fixed turret tank destroyers.<br>

They didn't beat the Finns per se.  The war in 1940 was one of the biggest embarassments that the USSR ever endured.<br>

They might have been politically competent but militarily they were incompetent - they were throwbacks to the times of cavalry charges.  I've said all along that they were a threat to Stalin's power base, however, their military prowess left much to be desired.<br>

I wont.  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is a good indication of Stalin's mindset at the time.<br>

<br>
Correct on the first count, dubious on the second one.<br>
<br>
Its hard to say whether the war would have been easier or not.  However, the fairly certain thing is that if Stalin did not have the iron grip on power like he did (thanks to the purges), USSR would have been unable to stand strong even in direst times such as Dec. '41 when Wehrmacht was roughly 10 miles away from Moscow and Stalin refused to leave Moscow with his entourage to Kuybashov.  The political stability of the country at times like Dec. '41 and Summer of '42 would have been undermined to such an extent, that any semblance of order and organization would utterly crumble.<br>

<br>
If it wasn't for those sacrifices that had to be made by the Soviets to preserve Stalin's power (admittedly, not willing sacrifices), it is very possible that Germany would prosper quite well after it defeated USSR, since it no longer would be forced to wage war on 2 fronts and would have access to USSR's vast resources.  Hence, you can thank those very same commies that you villified since the 1950's who fought tooth and nail for survival and ended up saving Europe as you know it.<br>
<br>
The mass murders were justified by the victory.  30 million was a small price to pay compared to the projected casualties if there was political upheaval in USSR during the war which would result in defeat.<br>

Learn to read.  And read up on the history.  In the early 30's just before the purges in the army began the Soviet army was the envy of many INCLUDING the germans.  Who adapted many of the things they saw.  <br>
<br>
Before the purges the Soviet Army's order of battle very much resembled what the Germans would later use.  Mass tank formations, Aiborne units, combined arms.  etc.  You are selling the Sovirts short.  It was there competency AND the loyalty of the soldiers to the generals that made them such a threat to Stalin.  Once the purges were under way the army reverted to a far more conventional set up.<br>
<br>
At the begining of the war the Russians had perhaps the beast tank in the world at the time, the T-34  It could run circles around the german tanks and was very hard to kill.  But with the officer corp gutted they no longer had the men who knew how to implement them.   Those purges while securing Stalins personal power nearly cost his country the war.<br>
<br>
As to Stalin's thoughts.  Yes he THOUGHT he was going to be ousted this comes from both advisors and the few confidants he didn't turn on.  But he did not realize just how successful his purges had been.  There was no one to take his place.  It is all that saved him.  <br>
<br>
There is no doubt in my mind that Stalins efforts to secure his personal power, cost the soviets a lot of additional tragedy when war with the germans came.<br>
<br>
Also the only reason there was NOT mass upheavals during the war was because the germans treated the people in the conquered territories if it was even possible worse than Stalin had done.   There was nothing to be gained by them turning on Stalin.  <br>
<br>
One last thing.  Do you really think that 30 million people ALL posed a personalthreat to Stalin?  Only a minor fraction of those killed were actually political threats.  Most weren't even threats but were simply in a position to potentially be a threat.  (that is what happened to the army.  There had been no rumblings of rebellion but Stalin saw a power base he didn't utterly control and was afraid.)  By far MOST of those killed were killed based on rumor, unfounded suspision or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Or they opposed the collectivation policies (which in itself was a disaster.  Soviets had one of the largest and most fertile farmlands in the world but had to import food because of that mindnumbingly stupid policy)<br>
<br>
Oh and one last thing.  Are you telling me that the first 6 months of the war that saw the army collapse and the germans knocking on the gates of Moscow and Leningrad were the best they had shown?  Who is smoking the crack?<br>

We have no idea what the USSR would have been like if Stalin had not succeeded in squeezing out Trotsky and then murdering Kaminev, Zinoviev and Bukharin.<br>
<br>
<br>
One can only speculate, but speculation is not historicity. We can say what happened, and if we study Trotsky's history and doings we could speculate as to what type of leader he might have made, but we cannot determine with authority that Stalin's purges where any type of necessary evil that lead directly to their ultimate success in the war. <br>
