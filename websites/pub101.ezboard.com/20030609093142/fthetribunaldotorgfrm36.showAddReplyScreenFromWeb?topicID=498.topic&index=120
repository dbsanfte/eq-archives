Keep on telling yourself the guy is not at fault for knowingly running over a person because he was tired of her or whatever<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did I say tired of her?  No.  Considering this was an order given by Israel's government (to bulldoze all terrorist houses), it makes a point-don't think for a second that you can throw your tiny little view into a big situation and expect to be able to play the &quot;well you wont kill me so therefore i can prevent you from doing what you want&quot; line which has to be &quot;checked&quot; every once in a while with proof that &quot;no, your not the most important person in the world, so important that its going to stop a government from doing what needs to be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess handcuffing could have occurred...but then again you don't understand how the Israeli army works do you?  Sometimes, when the enemy is so near and willing to hurt you, you dont have the time nor resources to treat them with 100% dignity and respect.  Sometimes, in SOME countries, the time you spend trying to be nice is time that the enemy has to pound you in the face...therefore its not even on your priority list.  Now, that doesnt mean that enemy soldiers were just about to run around the corner and blast away at the bulldozer.  What it DOES mean is that the people that live in that area (on both sides) are put into a mindframe to think like that 24/7 and when a nieve little American girl goes over to the country she very well might get smacked up and learn her lesson about the world.<br>
<br>
Now, for a clear understanding for all you nieve kids out there:  When you go to another country don't expect to automatically have &quot;certain rights&quot; because you don't.  You have NO RIGHTS except what that country designates.  And actually, despite what everyone thinks (about everyone being their own God) nobody has a single right in this whole world and indeed only try to press their strength to obtain certain &quot;rights&quot; as long as they can maintain them.  It is YOUR responsibility to make sure you know the laws, cultures, attitudes, and opinions of the countries that you go into-NOT that country's.  It was her fault for not taking special care of her own life.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lets put the situation differently : answer honestly to yourself - would you have driven a bulldozer over someone who was not threatening you in any way ?

<br>
HAHAHAHAHA way to try to change the entire discussion, so very poorly I might add.  That question has no relevance.  Changing the person who does the job does not, in any way, effect whether or not it was an &quot;ok&quot; or a &quot;bad&quot; thing to do.  Thats like asking me &quot;if you were a soldier in the middle of a war fighting the enemy, would you shoot back?&quot;  Its the guy's job to bulldoze.  Sitting here in America if I were bulldozing, heck no I wouldn't.  If I was in Israel and lived under those circumstances, heck she should know better than to piss around in Israel-and I would hold no moral guilt on myself if she didn't move her own ass.  They live in an area where their instincts are &quot;save my own ass before even thinking of being courteous&quot;.  Unfortunate.  But true.  <br>
<br>
Btw, that girl threatened that guy.  You are too blind and nieve to even *think* that she could have had a bomb strapped to her chest, or in her shoe, or a concealed gun ready to be pulled out.  By pulling ANY sort of act like that you are automatically threatening the safety of those around you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Count, your analogy is flawed. The bank manager would be the one holding the gun, not you. The girl didn't commit suicide, she was killed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I gave a different situation, but did not change the concept.  There is no flaw.  Who holds the gun is irrelevant.  The reason that is irrelevant:  The girl openly placed herself into danger and was willing to sacrifice her life for it.  She was the one that pulled the trigger.  She placed herself into a situation where a bulldozer was already in a chain of events that she could have clearly avoided.  Do you really need my situation to be changed? fine, here you go:  Instead of me running into the bank with a gun, I run in and say &quot;this is a hold up&quot; and a security guard pulls out his gun.  I then get to him, grab his gun that is in his hand, and put the gun to my head and say &quot;ill make him shoot me if you dont give me the money&quot; and then squeeze his finger so it shoots me in the head.  Now you have an EXACT copy of what happened, happy?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In every civilized nation on this planet, including the USA, protesters (even rioters) are never killed except in extreme self-defense, and are rarely even intentionally injured (say, with rubber bullets or a good nightstick beating) without a LOT of mitigating circumstances.

<br>
Yea and in there you somehow forgot to mention that Israel is in a state of war no?  Every country that is in a state of war either A: shoots protestors or B: doesn't have protestors.  Btw, when riots occur, there are usually about 20-30% injuries and about 1-5% death occurences.  Most of these protests and riots are from militant protestors in which case they deserve every ounce of punishment they recieve in these past cases.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not sure how anyone can say or imply that this girl's death is her own fault.You can call her stupid, for betting on the morality of a stranger when the wager was her life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You mean besides the fact that she had DIRECT and COMPLETE control over what she was doing?  You mean because she LITERALLY PLACED herself in a path of destruction?  Those aren't good reasons?  Sound good enough to me.  You mean to say if I go to a firing range and randomly &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; by running out infront of targets at random intervals that if I get shot its not my fault because I didn't pull the trigger on the gun that shot me?  You sir are a fool.  Her bet was on &quot;calling&quot; the bulldozer out, my bet would be on the chances that every single shooter has fast enough reflexes to stop shooting when I run out there.  She didn't know the operator, I wouldn't know the shooters.  She didn't know her situation, and went with the risk anyways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What should be obvious tho, is that her death was not her fault<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, I think I already pointed out what exact &quot;rights&quot; we have, none.  Its a matter of &quot;who has power at that place and time&quot;.  Regardless, she didn't have the right to interfere with a government operation now did she?  Oh yea, you forgot about that one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's absolutely no different from the 4-year old kids that get shot in the crossfire, except the 4-year old kids don't have a choice about where they're going to be that day.

<br>
You forgot a little part:  A 4-year old who knows/understands what happens in a crossfire, has complete knowledge ahead of time of where every single bullet in that crossfire goes, and also complete ability to easily keep himself from getting hit by any of those bullets.  Throw that in there and then you have two situations that can at least start to be compared.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but if you really believe that she deserved to die because she stood in front of a bulldozer moving 5mph and it didn't stop, that's just WRONG.

And yet every single time every one of you has said this, you have not given a SINGLE ounce of justification to this concept EXCEPT because thats how you feel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 749<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/18/03 7:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange</span><hr size=1> &gt;HAHAHAHAHA way to try to change the entire discussion,<br>
