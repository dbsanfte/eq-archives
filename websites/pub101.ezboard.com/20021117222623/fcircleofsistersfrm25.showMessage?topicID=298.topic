<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Dearest Sisters and Brothers,<br>
<br>
At the stroke of midnight separating Saturday, September 28, and Sunday, September 29, I am to be wed and bonded to Vivienne and Dawninglight Lileath.<br>
<br>
The ceremony will take place on the ancient cyclops island directly to the west of the island home of the Sisters of Erollisi Marr in the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
I know many of you feel that I am making a mistake.  There is no way I can change your mind, and there is no way you can change mine.  We must learn to accept this difference of opinion if things are to remain civil in these guilds.<br>
<br>
If you wish to show your support through attendance, I ask that you leave any hostilities at the door, so to speak.  If you cannot, then I would rather you not come.  I don't need or deserve that sort of heartache on my wedding night.<br>
<br>
Also, be aware that, from this moment forth, any unprovoked attack on Vivienne or the Sisters of Myth will be considered an attack on me.  Please do not test my resolve.  I have given up much already.  I have lost at least one friend because of this; I do not wish to lose any more.<br>
<br>
I love you all dearly.  I have said it before, and I will say it again: I will remain in the Circle until the day I die or I am no longer wanted.  The first choice cannot be helped by anyone.  It is for the gods to decide.  But sometimes I feel the second choice creeping ever closer, and I do not wish for that day.<br>
<br>
I love you all, and I hope that you can attend the ceremony.<br>
<br>
Be safe, my friends and family.<br>
<br>
Jaranna<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Jaranna straightened the note on the board, and then walked out of the guild hall.<br>
<br>

(( OOC: That's midnight PST.  It's pretty late, we know, but it's sort of a special time for &quot;three witches,&quot; as Dawn called us, and will allow our European friends to attend in their early morning.  It'll be 2 a.m. for me.  I won't be offended if you can't come for any reason, be it RP or the time or whatever.  So, no worries about that. )) <p><P>Jaranna<BR>

Seeing a new notice on the bulletin board, he steps closer to examine it. His smile slowly fades and his features darken as he reads the invitation in its entirety. He quickly scribbles a reply on a spare piece of parchment. Taking a nearby candle, he seals the document and sets off for Neriak, scarcely stopping to wave goodbye to his guildmates.<br>
<br>
The sun had set by the time he reached Nektulos woods. Easily slipping past the guards of the city as they are distracted by a young warrior being chased by an orc, he enters the Tier'Dal city, cowl pulled low to disguise his wood elven features and tanned skin. He navigates the streets unnoticed, seeming almost to blend in with the very ground he walks upon, until he reaches the Halls of the Sisterhood. The guard scowls at him, pulling her sword from its sheath. With a brief flash, the ranger's own blade flies from beneath his cloak, neatly disarming the surprised Tier'Dal before disappearing back into the folds of his garments. Thrusting the letter into her now empty hand before the look of shock passes, the Feir'Dal speaks softly.<br>
&quot;I did not come here to start a fight with you. I've a message for your Ilharess's fiance, Jaranna. Please see that it gets to her.&quot;<br>
Before the guard can protest, the ranger turns and departs, disappearing into the night.<br>
<br>
The letter reads:<br>
<br>
Dear Jaranna-<br>
I doubt I could remain civil. I'm sure the same goes for your new family in the event that I did choose to come. We don't have the most cordial of relations. I'm sorry, my Sister. I will not be attending.<br>
-Kelthalas Gwendyll<br>
<br>
ooc:<br>
Things would probably end up getting ugly. Kelthalas despises the Sisters of Myth. Plus, 2AM for you means 3AM for me, and unless I don't work until late the next day, which is unlikely on a weekend, there's no way I'd be able to function all day on a couple of hours of sleep. Sorry, Jaranna.<br>

I had already spoken to Jaranna about her wedding with Vivienne, but it came as a surprise to me that she would be wedding Dawninglight as well.<br>
<br>
I managed a nod twards the Sisters and Brothers that sat in the hall, slumping into a chair to think on this. <br>
<br>
I had always supported Jaranna and Vivienne. I had considered giving my soul to Vivienne to prevent her from hurting Jaranna. All of that worry proved false, to be sure. I had seen and heard Jaranna and Vivienne together, there was little doubt that Vivienne would hurt her now. <br>
<br>
Milling over a thousand things at once, my main concern was to Dawn. I did not know her but I did not think Jaranna loved her. <br>
<br>
I looked up, spoting Eviah across the Hall. As she turned to me, I pushed the thoughts from my head. I would go to Jarannas wedding, no matter what may happen once I was there... <p>Warden Wildrunner

My permanent bed so to speak. The trees are buzzing about a wedding, but they arent clear about who is getting married this time.<br>
<br>
I wearily walk into the guild hall and hear musings of this same wedding, the one between Jaranna and Vivenne. I sit in my chair and ponder things. This wedding is set the same day as when I am to conduct my final test for sisterhood by teaching everyone what it means to be blind and to open their eyes to a whole new world. Two things occur to me. One is that I would like to attend this wedding. Two is holding this final test of mine would more then likely interfere with those who would like to go to the wedding. Knowing this, and knowing what I have said about ensuring Jarannas happiness, I walk over to the board and ask someone to find my note. I scrawl the best I can:<br>
<br>
Due to a conflict of events, I regret I need to postpone this event until October 4th. Same time and same place though.<br>
<br>

<br>
I then sit in deep thought and hope everything turns out right and good, for Jarannas sake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujorlik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jorlik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#660000>(9/23/02 10:29:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wedding announcement</span><hr size=1> Jorlik looks at the wedding announcement in the Sisters Guild hall and shudders.

Running to the Gnomish Telegram Service for fear of being late for his hunt, he sends a quick note to Jaranna:<br>

In No faith in no book of mine have I ever seen nor heard of any kind of love that goes thrice of the same sex, love is love and that is of one person, I cannot and will not bless the wedding with my presense, I'm sorry but it goes against all faiths that give the guidelines for ..bondage or what have you...I'm sure you will find happiness somewhere....<br>

Another note was attached more toward the rest of the sisters:<br>
<br>
I hope you know...no matter how much you can deny an alliance...this will seal it...period..you cannot very well shun out one person and be done with it...Jaranna said it best in her own &quot;cunning&quot; words....you attack Vivienne, you attack her...My dears...in my books that I've read and in the scriptures I have written ...that's called be an ally....and thus...you cannot deny it anymore....if you want my honest opinion about what you should do....do ask me in person...beacuse it is a bit cruel &lt;&lt; the ink was dabbed ihere.....in some sort of anger it seems....his signature scrawled somewhat harshly&gt;&gt;<br>

<br>
&quot;Mira, I dinnae understand.  Is this note fer a wedding?  But I dunno how.  I've seen Vivienne, and Jaranna, and Dawninglight.  An I may nay know elves very well, but I think they be women.  What kinda ceremony does one women marry two others?  and what does it say here about bonding?  I've heard the human farmers sometime brand their animals.  Be this the same thing?&quot;<br>

<br>
Mirabor smiles softly, and whispers for several minutes to Kalelce explaining the ceremony.  All the while Kalelce's face turns several shades of red, while he asks more detailed queries.  Mirabor patiently answers all his questions and there is a brief pause before Kalelce shakes his head, &quot;Oh no.  I dinnae think that be a thing fer me ta see.  Perhaps it'd be better if'n I stay home an work on making some fishin lures&quot;<br>

We have reason to believe the void may not cooperate with us at the previously mentioned time.  In this case, we are postponing the ceremony until Sunday night at 10 p.m. (Pacific.  12 a.m. Central.  Monday, 6 a.m. GMT, I think).<br>
<br>
Hopefully those of you who planned to come may still do so.  Thank you very much.<br>
