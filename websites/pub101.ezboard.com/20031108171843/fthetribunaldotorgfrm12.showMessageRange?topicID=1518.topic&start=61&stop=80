The only thing I think he downplays too much is the involvement of Israel.  I believe Israel is the main influence behind Bush's push for this war.  Bush basically is killing a flock of birds with 1 military...he gets his oil, he gets the guy who went after his father, he betters his bid for re-election, he takes the focus away from the economy and the big corp scandals, he gets to indulge every privacy obliterating bill/amendment he wants, and he does the deed for Sharon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I will now insert the obligatory Ladmo response for him, to save him the post:  &quot;Yeah, well yur just a stoner, go smoke some drugs you dirty hippy&quot;.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Back to the topic at hand:  I was really disappointed by Powell's speech.  Why 'disappointment'?  Well, it's a given we're going to war...there's no chance in hell Bush will pull out now. First off he won't be able to justify the money already spent over there with no result, and secondly he'll lose face before the world.  (In his eyes and the muslim world that is).  So I was really hoping there would be some concrete evidence Powell would present to justify our imminent invasion.  <br>
<br>
No such evidence was forthcoming.  The drawings were pretty, the satellite photos nicely captioned, the tapes dubbed just sub-par quality enough to be believable.  But that's about it.  I can't see anywhere or anyone that 'evidence' he declassified would have endangered anyone.  The meat of it were those satellite photos (and it was nice of CNN to add the text 'XXX weapons facility, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>disguised</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from inspectors' on each, since the inspectors that were there obviously can't tell but we can from 20,000 miles above the earth) and you can't endanger a satellite now can you?  My question is, if we have all these photos of such apparent facilities, why not give them to the inspectors?  Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
Those tapes?  Would have been nice if they could have named some names.  'High ranking general, high ranking officer' tells us shit.  And it's not like we've faked tapes before, have we (osama tape anyone)?  But the drawings were pretty though.<br>
<br>
I was hoping for concrete evidence...film of them moving stuff ahead of the inspectors, actual gas/chemical construction facility elements, or even the toxins themselves.  None of that was forthcoming.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">&quot;He did have it!  Where is it now?! Huh?! HUH?!&quot;</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is not evidence. The report Powell cites from the British that provided a good bit of information for his presentation?  It was plagiarized from a grad student heh.<br>
<br>
About the only thing I could agree with in that whole speech is that Saddam does appear to be hiding what he's doing, i.e. he's not coming completely clean.  What I don't understand is why we just don't take him out?  Assassinate his ass, Bush revoked the CIA restrictions that held them back before.  But doesn't beget us oil fields does it.  But I guess our intelligence agencies would have to know where he is huh?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dont mis-trust our governments intentions. Our Intelligance agencies are pretty much on the ball.

<br>
Yeah...the british intelligence agencies pull their stuff from grad students and our agencies can't put 3 reports together to figure out planes are going to be hijacked and flown into buildings.  Or could they?  Remains to be seen if they had a hand in that.  Mistrust?  Shit, I think it's the only viable option at this point.<br>

<br>
LOL...I find that amusing considering the original poster already clearly pointed out how foolish you are for thinking this way.  Sorry bub, some people ARE evil automatons-altho usually bent on power which directly leads to others' deaths.  Don't believe it?  Talk to the hundreds of defectors that came to the U.S. from Iraq that say otherwise....they actually lived there.<br>
<br>
&quot;I WILL NOT FORGET that 70% of American people are AGAINST the war on Iraq and therefore the American government does NOT reflect the will of the people.&quot;<br>
<br>
I beg to differ...where you get this number?  Are you polling college students or something?  Because Bush's approval rating was above 70% when he first announced the war on terrorism...and even though it has dropped it is STILL well above 50%....and expect that to rise up with the recent evidence given to the U.N.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;I WILL NOT FORGET that we LOST the vietnam war and accomplished nothing but death and awesome movie material.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh, the only part about the original post that didn't suck was that line, Enzo. Soldiers did catch the flak that the politicians should have.&quot;<br>
<br>
Word.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am so sick of the Clinton bashers who want to blame all the nations woes on him. If I could go back to the 8 years under him as opposed to where we are at in this 3rd year under Bush, I would gladly go back.&quot;<br>
<br>
You really want to die?  Who knows how many more years of ignorance are required for an enemy to have the means to annihilate America.  Clinton, a liar, a manipulator, and an absolutely horrible foreign policy leader...completely ignored the threats to America around the world.  Clinton cut our defense funds by 50%...how do I know?  I have an aunt that works for McDonald Douglas (now merged to Boeing) and she worked on the JSF contract (Joint Strike Fighter....airplane that can hover like a harrier, break the speed of sound, bomber AND air to air combat fighter that can be used by the navy, airforce, AND marines....huge deal) and talked about how their efforts to creat an awesome machine were drastically cut due to the fund cuts to the department of defense.  If there was any time that a country could have defeated America...it was when Clinton was president...and that is a person that I do not want to live under.<br>
<br>
&quot;70% are against war with Iraq as it stands now and the government is 100% for war.&quot;<br>
<br>
You may want to edit that post as of today....considering the evidence released to the U.N....which by the way has supported the idea of war on Iraq from the beginning (they just asked that they be given a chance to find an alternate mean first).  Regardless, that statistic is wrong even before today.<br>
<br>
Telkandore...thanks for actually looking the stats up on polls instead of throwing shit out there like most of us do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, so 62% of American's feel we shouldn't go to war as it stands (no war + no war w/o UN reso polls). I was 8% off. Blow me tools&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you stupid?  Or just that plain dumb?  GO BACK AND LOOK!  Those stats say SHOULD go to war, not shouldn't...oh my bejeebus I think I'm in lala land.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cant believe anyone with half a brain can think for a second that Iraq is a threat to anyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I can't believe that anyone with half a brain would think that another person with half a brain couldn't pose a threat to them in some form or manner.  nuff said...go back to your hole you nieve twit.<br>
<br>
&quot;notoriously hard to use and require a sustained campaign to kill thousands of people&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong.  Notoriously easy to use.  You spray/dump and run.  Technically you don't even have to blow them up in the sky...its just more effective that way.  Chemical weapons were designed to be used by troops in the vicinity of combat....not long range firing.  I.E. your troops have to wear protective gear (which doesnt protect 100%)...or suicide in the process.  Its main use is to take out large legions of infantry...not civilians...but is not restricted to just military.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember it was with our support and consent that Saddam used bio/chem weapons against the Iranians and the Kurds, since to Reagon he was &quot;our kind of guy&quot; We even provided him with deadly pathogens with government approval, some even from the army's center for germ research in Fort Detrick.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd like to see a little evidence for that.  Please do, I want to see where the U.S. government gave approval to the mass genocide of the Kurds by using chemical weapons.  I want to see the documentation...film clip...whatever.  Why?  Because there is none.  The U.S. never approved it.  Chemical weapons on the Iranians...that was a war...its almost buyable to see approval if its used on military units.  I still don't tho.  I want to see the documentation/clips for that too.  Until then, you are fluffing air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and it is widely known that the press is very conservative.&quot;<br>
<br>
ENH wrong.  The press is overwhelmingly liberal, constantly making conservatives look bad until they show proof for their beliefs...and even then they try to cast doubt and suspicion...why?  Thats what makes their money.<br>
<br>
As for your posts on all the weapons/chemicals sold to Iraq by the U.S. or Brittain...EVEN if its all true without good motives (and thats a big EVEN)...that doesn't make the U.S. or Brittain bad guys.  Not one drop.  Iraq is the one that misused them.  Don't for one second try to swap blame.  It just means that U.S. and British intelligence aren't 100% knowledgable and smart about the outcome of the future, isn't that right?  Sorry that you expect our governments to predict the future...they can't.  Humans are fallible like that ya know?  Its Iraq that misused these...not our countries.  I'm sure they are kicking themselves in the butt now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ritter has also alleged that the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons emits certain gases, which would have been detected by satellite. 'We have seen none of this,' he insists. 'If Iraq was producing weapons today, we would have definitive proof.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh now come on, you gotta be brighter than that right?  So somehow you think that the chemicals were made outside in open daylight?  I do believe its 'not that hard' to confine gases.  What about the Iraqi defectors that claim that Iraq DOES have all these weapons?  What about all the documents they brought back to the U.S. showing the numbers of weapons that Iraq has?  Oh yea...lets not talk about that.<br>
<br>
In the end...I STILL offer the challenge for any of you who argue against me on this topic to move your asses to Iraq and live under his regime.  You seem to want to defend it so well...why don't you swear your allegiance to him.  I'm sure he would treat you so well...especially when you start having doubts about the 1,000s of people he orders you to kill.  Until you move to Iraq, live there for years under Hussein, and come back to tell about it...your argument is fundamentally flawed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Calling him a monster for gassing the Kurds is BS when we ENABLED him to do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
What planet are you from?  I hand you a gun to kill a guy...don't pressure you to do it...its simply up to you.  You shoot him.  Who's fault is it?  YOURS.  YOU pulled that trigger...YOU are the monster.  I mighta thought for a second that handing you that gun was so you could defend yourself against some rat on the floor trying to eat your foot...I guess I was wrong.  You telling me you can't see where you are completely 100% wrong in your logic?  You have no brain then...or slightly less then half I guess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look back to the places that the U.S. is ignoring<br>
<br>
to the countries in africa, where the people are suffering worse atrocities then Saddam has done<br>
<br>
we say we're fighting a war on terrorism, but why are we ignoring the countries were terrorism is taking place this day?&quot;<br>
<br>
Because the U.S. is not God, now quit talking like it.  The U.S. does what it can, while protecting its own interest...quit expecting perfection.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're worried about Iraq's &quot;supposed nuclear weapons possiblity&quot; yet ignoring N. Korea's admitting their's and flaunting it in our face.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats because its the mind behind the operation that matters...not the resources to create that operation.  Every situation is different...quit comparing two different situations.<br>
<br>
&quot;We deplore the Palastinians bombing of innocents, yet ignore Israels killing of innocents.&quot;<br>
<br>
We do?  Every Israeli attack so far has been against Palestinian military officials.  Casualties of war are bound to happen, and some of those are innocent civilians.  Blame the Palestinian officials for holding their offices in residential neighborhoods...not Israeli soldiers for resolving their problem.  The Palestinian terrorists are the ones that kill civilians on purpose. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is exactly why I think we should NOT support France in any way. Because 20 years from now when we are at war with them, I don't want Greenland and Peru laughing at us about how we were dumb enough to help the French. It is our own fault if we help them now people.&quot;<br>
<br>
And Ladida puts it all into your heads EXACTLY why you can't blame political leaders in the past for their decisions solely on what happened in the future.  Its just not that simple.<br>
<br>
&quot;No such evidence was forthcoming. The drawings were pretty, the satellite photos nicely captioned, the tapes dubbed just sub-par quality enough to be believable. But that's about it. I can't see anywhere or anyone that 'evidence' he declassified would have endangered anyone.

My question is, if we have all these photos of such apparent facilities, why not give them to the inspectors? Uh-huh.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, since you asked and seem to not understand...allow me to explain.  Firstly, the UN announced that the evidence given was MORE than sufficient for the U.S.'s claims against Iraq..what makes you think anyone is going to believe your argument that its not?  Here is why the U.S. did not give this information out so freely...you give information-you lose contacts.  Giving information out is very dangerous to those that were able to retrieve that information.  Its not so simple to just hand top secret information over.  The U.S. has tons more of discriminating evidence, but each drop that they leak means that much more for the Iraqi intelligence to use as a lead to find spies.  With no spies...we have no information...and Hussein is free to do as he pleases...there is a middle ground.  That is the answer to your question.<br>
<br>
&quot; But doesn't beget us oil fields does it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I really don't care for this constant accusation that people keep throwing out there.  Not once has anyone who has said &quot;the reason we are invading is for oil&quot; given any evidence to support this claim.  Sure, you got accusations of &quot;well he wants it&quot; or &quot;he can make money off it&quot; or whatever...but really, you have no evidence AT ALL other than motive...and motive is not evidence...sorry.<br>

<br>
Do you have any idea how much our government knows and doesnt share about the inner workings of other societies, cultures, and governments?<br>
<br>
Do you honestly think , and want to expound ideas that we support Genocide? <br>
<br>
No fuckface.. I dont think so.  Sorry.  Thats not what America is about.<br>
<br>
What your ignorant ass needs to RECOGNIZE is that we have covert operations, intelligence, and a network of information dating hundreds of years back....<br>
<br>
And it is because of this that things happen that you dont have a god damn clue about.<br>
<br>
Yeah.. Guatemala.. we gave the government some guns to kill harmless natives because they said they where &quot;communist&quot; .. yeah...... right.<br>
<br>
I strongly beleive that you grew up comforted and isolated.  I strongly believe that you form your opinions upon what your dad, uncle, television, or the media lead you to beleive.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you even consume yourself a bit with it.<br>
<br>
Kind of like the guy at the office that knows everything about everthing... splurting your knoweldge base at every given opportunity to compensate for what you lack in personality, sex, prowess, or self-esteem.<br>
<br>
Please.. dont pretend to think that things like Guatemala happened because the United States just wanted to make a symbolic gesture against communism.<br>
<br>
Hell even Veitnam wasnt symbolic.  People actually considered it a dire need that we stop the spread of communism back then.<br>
<br>
So much shit happens behind the scenes.  I am willing to bet that many.. lives.. countries.. massacres and so forth where stopped behind the scenes, or stopped but put on public display as a government fuck up <br>
<br>
*but really wasnt*<br>
<br>
Please dont go parading around that you know all about Guatemala or other similar incidences.<br>
<br>
People loose lives to keep your worthless ass safe on a daily basis and you wont read about it in the fucking paper or hear it on the news.<br>
<br>
Move to France fuckface. You will like it there.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
When this shit goes down.<br>
More Americans will end up loosing life on American soil.<br>
And it could potentially be in the thousands, to millions... <br>
<br>
Wake the fuck up....  America isnt such a cushy place as you grew up with.<br>
<br>
We have some problems.....  We need to fight them.<br>

<br>
does anyone see my last post twice? Like 12 minutes apart or something? Cause I do for some reason...<br>
<br>
Secondly, Ladmo I already spoke for you. I know the closed mindset that's grown up with cops as family and cops as friends all their life so I automatically included it in my post for you -- I'm that kinda guy. No need to thank me.<br>
<br>
Now for some actual debate -- did the U.N. announce that? What I heard them say was that Iraq was in violation of resolution 1441 in that they appear to be not cooperating and not submitting full disclosure. Thus they gave them another week to come lay it all out. I didn't hear them give support for our war or anything else, so apparently my argument has validity. And as I stated above, satellite photos do not endanger any assets or 'spies' we may have in Iraq. Maybe the tapes might (assuming they're genuine) but if so, wouldn't they have given the names of the actual people talking? Instead they label them 'high ranking officer', 'HQ', 'Field' -- besides from what I understand they were intercepted radio/telephone transmissions. Who are we endangering by releasing that, the Iraqi ma bell worker?<br>
<br>
Oh, you meant we would endanger our crack field agents (who can't find 30,000 weapons and 700 tons of chemicals) if we released our other tons of information. I would just like to know what makes you so certain we have 'tons more' secret intel though? Because Powell said so? Oh, well that's fine for me then. I know my government doesn't lie. /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
As for the oil field accusations, I've already posted at least 4-5 articles on this board about how we're planning to capture the fields; we're going to deem them 'spoils of war'; we're going to 'take care of them' for the Iraqi people. They're not accusations, they're impending facts. You're right though, I have no evidence.<br>
<br>
Try as I might I can't travel into the future as of yet. Damn space time continuum keeps flinging me back to the present. Maybe I'll take Ladmo's advice and the next time I try I'll do exponentially more drugs.<br>
<br>
Oh wait I don't do drugs, I just smoke weed.

You are actually for an invasion of Iraq?  You certainly haven't said that you are against it.  My read is that you just want someone else to do the dirty work, since, according to you, the United States' doesn't have the moral foundation it needs to proceed.<br>
<br>
What is your opinion on the matter?  All you've posted so far is argument against other people's information or perspective.<br>
Or are you merely bashing the United States and it's current administration so people will read your posts?<br>
<br>
Do you really dream of the United States grovelling in front of the world community, apologizing because it's past allies turned against it when their original fights petered out and they needed a new enemy to remain in power?  Pretty convenient that there is also a Republican government right now.<br>
<br>
I can't tell where you stand on this issue, because you have yet to take a stand.  You are acting like many other liberals have in the recent past.  It is disheartening to see the left completely lose sight of its principles and ideals.<br>

<br>
Such an informed individual and expert in intelligence you are sir. You're correct about one thing, you can't endanger a satellite! That's the beauty of those things. But, Mr. Powell is not just going to show us pretty pictures of stuff and tell us what the US government, and only the US, assumes is going on. Great effort was put into collaborate all of this sir. To collaborate, you need sources. &quot;Solid sources&quot;, as Powell said yesterday. He stressed the sources 'cited' to add credit to each image. Sources that are involved and know what the hell is going on, that are on the ground, that are right smack dab in the middle of it all. Yes, sources can be compromised by satellite evidence made public because sources needed to be mentioned to stress the importance and valididity of the images, otherwise the entire world would be in your uninformed mind set right now and it'd all be useless. Slightly more obvious images could certainly exist, but the source that would have been needed to colloborate it could have been in a more risky situation if it were to go public. Who knows.<br>
<br>
It's also been reported that officials went over Powell's speech with a fine tooth comb in the days it was being created, forcing Powell to remove some evidence that was to be presented and change the way that other evidence was to be presented. View that as just scripted moves to add to the lies if you wish.<br>

ah, I see. That would be nice. It's not necessary. You're one of the few that's not convinced yet Dvin. It's fairly widely accepted now that they do have this stuff, the topic now is whether we should go to war, wait for Iraq to come clean, or wait til we actually get our own hands on the stuff so we can take their toys away and start the process all over again in a few years. Stop talking about the evidence, it's now irrelevant. You're behind the times, it's time to either support the war to take Saddam out or don't support the war because we'll kill millions of civillians or our soldiers will die or it's all for the oil or the sleeper cells will blow up the Gaps in our malls or whatever you might choose.<br>

<br>
Enzo, you're twisting things around. But it doesn't matter. With Powell's speech yesterday the statistics have changed. That was the point of my posting the entire poll. It's not precisely accurate obviously but simple logic tells me that support for war is now around 65-70%, and that's a conservative estimate given that so many people said their opinion on if we should go in or not was going to be decided on Powell's speech, and that early polls(non scientific internet polls that is, CNN etc, things could be quite different but quite doubtful) indicated that many had thought the evidence was good enough to start the ball rolling. I'm not attacking your views or saying your opinion on the matter is not justified, but American public opinion has shifted towards war if war was to begin within the next couple of months. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 2021<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/03 10:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We do?

I'm sorry.  If you have a better explanation for US funding and arming the Guatemalan ruling party to exterminate 200,000 civilians - I'd like to hear it.  But I know what your response will be.  It will be something like &quot;the CIA knows a lot more about it than you do and they must have had good reasons!!!&quot; which is a great excuse for your own ignorance.  You have no fucking clue about the subject matter at hand and you don't even know what you are arguing about.<br>

Some parts I had to skip due to boringness or utter stupidity. Some were quite well formed and informative.<br>
<br>
I am in the US Marines stationed in Japan. I will go fight in Korea or Iraq if told to do so. I signed the contract and I will do what is ordered. Do I feel we &quot;need&quot; to? No. Do I feel that it is &quot;evil&quot;? No not really. <br>
<br>
I feel that Bush is a good president that may be taking this a little far. The only thing I see that could happen to make this stop is Iraq coming out in the open with what they have and disarming. It is a large dick measuring contest between him and Sadamm. Unfortunately for the people in Iraq I have a feeling Bush is going to win. <br>
<br>
One thing that bothers me however is tha attitude of the American people. Bush has made this decision. It wasn't put up to a vote or a poll and I think he could care less. He may have made a very large mistake. I do not however feel that he should be bashed as hard as he is being bashed. I guarantee every president has made some large mistakes. However you see this decision he is still the President and we still voted him into office. (Before I get all the replies that Gore really won I want to clear something up. Gore won the popular vote yes. Bush won the electoral vote. Electoral &gt; Popular and if you want to change that then call your congressman and have him put a motion in to change that. Until then just accept the fact that Bush was voted and did not cheat because that argument is old and has been argued by better people then me.) <br>
<br>
I feel that if the people of the United States are so adamant about this not happening then they need to do something more then protest and send stupid absurd chain letters. If you want to do something and you really think that Bush is as psycho as everyone is claming then pull him out of office. If 62% of people actually feel like war is mistake then they have lost confidence in the President. Well then call your congressman and you can see about having him pulled out of office. This bickering and debating is very informative and has helped me learn a lot but it gets nowhere in the end. (Please someone do not post that Special Olympics kid.)<br>
<br>
These are just my thoughts however and I know they are different then everyone else. I am not here to change anyone elses opinion but to add my own to the pot and stir up some serious debate.<br>

<br>
No, still wrong.  There is ZERO responsibility for it.  You fail to recognize that countries all the time say &quot;we won't use it for this...or that...even if we did before...we promise this time...&quot;.  Take a look around big guy, its happening RIGHT NOW.  Hussein is sitting in hiding claiming, ONCE AGAIN, that he is doing what he is asked...that he has no weapons...etc etc....and yet YOU ALL (that have been footing the argument against me) STILL want to give him another chance and YET you have the nerve to be a hypocrit and say the government is to be blamed?<br>
<br>
&quot;did the U.N. announce that? What I heard them say was that Iraq was in violation of resolution 1441 in that they appear to be not cooperating and not submitting full disclosure. Thus they gave them another week to come lay it all out. I didn't hear them give support for our war or anything else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you know what 1441 is?  It states that if Hussein does not disarm...then there is no peace treaty.  TECHNICALLY we are still at war with Iraq and war can be declared and the UN recognizes this.  That alone is the UN's support.  Then, to add to it and reconfirm it...the UN declared full support to the U.S. going to war if Iraq does not show proof of disarming within some date which I can't remember off the top of my head...but its somewhere in February.  <br>
<br>
&quot;And as I stated above, satellite photos do not endanger any assets or 'spies' we may have in Iraq.&quot;<br>
<br>
And satellite pictures weren't all of the information that was given was it?  No.  Testimonies of defectors was also given.  That is endangering assets.  Spy documents were also given.  That is endangering assets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, you meant we would endanger our crack field agents&quot;<br>
<br>
You mean the UN inspections teams?  No, I do not mean them.  Flat out wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would just like to know what makes you so certain we have 'tons more' secret intel though? Because Powell said so? Oh, well that's fine for me then. I know my government doesn't lie. /sarcasm off&quot;<br>
<br>
Yea, because he said so, and the fact that he already yielded part of it.  I am amused at how distrustful you are of our nations leaders (who by the way have a hard time of bribing every single high ranking member of congress, the house, and countless important officers to keep their mouths shut about the fact that we apparently DONT have information...because thats what it would take...a bribe...to keep every single mouth shut...because despite what you think its almost 0 possibility that every single person in the entirety of our government is ill-hearted to the bone) and how trustful you are of a regime lead by ONE MAN who has that ability to hide information because he doesn't have to bribe thousands of people in order to keep that information safe...instead he just has to threaten their lives.  You are a fool sir, you do not deserve to speak out if you think the way you do, lucky for you its your right.  Any wise man chooses to believe those that can at least provide evidence, and claim to be doing the right thing without having other high officials showing evidence that he is wrong.  Where is your evidence that proves that the information given to the UN is made up?  Where is the information that proves that the weapons have been destroyed?  There is none.  Only fools give crooks who lie and cheat to gain power another chance...and they are the ones who die from it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've already posted at least 4-5 articles on this board about how we're planning to capture the fields; we're going to deem them 'spoils of war'; we're going to 'take care of them' for the Iraqi people. They're not accusations, they're impending facts. You're right though, I have no evidence.&quot;<br>
<br>
And not once in there did you mention how this is &quot;wrong&quot;.  What is wrong with showing the Iraqi people how to run their oil?  What is wrong with &quot;spoils of war&quot; to recompense for the costs of the war?  THAT IS NORMAL AND FAIR.  Until you pay for the entire military cost of our government...you can't claim otherwise.  Keeping security and peace requires the resources and funds to do it.  Its not free.<br>
<br>
&quot; just thought it would be nice if they could've presented some evidence of the need for it&quot;<br>
<br>
What?! I don't understand you at all.  The evidence is overwhelming.  Hussein has killed 22 MILLION people already...that is not enough?!?!?!  Quit posting...I hate having to read shit for posts.<br>
<br>
&quot;You keep bringing up this 'threat' of us being doused with chemicals on our own soil like it could happen. I have to laugh&quot;<br>
<br>
And you are a fool.  (I think I stated that once before??) It was already done, fool.  I think the anthrax that went through our mail system proves you wrong?  It even occurred a week after the attack...during peek high security times.  Go away fool.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stats were:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As it stands now, 33% of Americans think the United States should proceed with a military invasion even without U.N. authorization, 40% believe the US should only begin a military invasion if the UN votes that it is necessary, 22% say troops should not be sent at all at this point.&quot;<br>
<br>
You add horribly.  That means 33% think go to war regardless.  It means an additional 40% think we should go to war if the UN authorizes it....for a total of 73%.  The way to justify this claim is the fact that IF it meant 40% flat (not in addition) then the 22% would be MUCH higher at around 60% saying troops should not be sent at all.  The other reason for justifying this claim is because the poll was a multiple choice poll.  That means a person picks one out of 3 answers.  That means that anyone who chose go to war regardless would ALSO fit with the category of going to war if we are authorized by the UN (because they were not able to choose the second choice...but would have chosen that if their first pick wasn't up there).  Maybe next time think about how it works before talking?  Oh btw...i JUST saw on tv another poll....63% agree that we have shown enough evidence to use force.  31% Disagree...the rest were undecided.<br>
<br>
&quot;What bull. Israel has systematically been marginalizing the Palestinian population, destroying their settlements, bulldozing down their villages and intentionally terrorizing the civilian population of Palestine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Great.  Now if you could show some documentation on that.  I'm sure I would have heard about it on the news...the way they like to talk.  Until then, you speak fluff to me.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh I see. You are thinking that since the government's intelligence collects a much greater information of data than I could ever hope to see - that it is justified in whatever it does. Idiot.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, what it means is even though you have grounds to question the actions, you don't have the grounds to claim that the government did something wrong (which is what you are stating).<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh ok. Those Mayan farmers were a hell of a threat to me. God forbid they would invade US with garden hoes and shovels&quot;<br>
<br>
Take away the guns supplied to a nation...and thats exactly what you have...a threat with hoes and shovels.  Hoes and shovels are good weapons for killing...you don't think so?

Count16, if that is your real name, we actually do hear this on the news all the time.  However, they hear about it far more often in other countries of the world.  It is very rare in the US to see the images of tanks rolling through occupied Palestine where people are being kept like prisoners of war.  However, the rest of the world sees these images all the time. <br>
<br>
It would seem for some strange reason that the American media doesn't like to show Israel in a bad light.<br>
<br>
The truth of the matter is that over 6 million Jews needed a home following World War II and the US didn't really want them.  So, we strong-armed Britain into allowing more and more into Palestine and eventually helped them carve out their own nation once Britain gave up the nation of Palestine.<br>
<br>
Since then, US support has been what has allowed them to keep their country and to push their neighbors farther and farther back.  It is one of the strongest reasons we are hated in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
For facts that I am sure you would feel are untainted by bias (snicker) here's a link to the US Department of State's report on the status of Israel and it's occupied territories <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/nea/8262.htm#ot">www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/nea/8262.htm#ot</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
