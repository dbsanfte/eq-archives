WTH were you doing there with 75  people anyhow?  Nothing else up to Zerg?  How you all keep that many people on line that late is beyond me as well.  By the way your guild acts you appear to be no more that 14 years old, well past your bed time by then.  You all KSing us really wasnt surprising, it happens so often.  Pretty much from the sight of the first piece of crap in the same zone as us during a raid we are pretty much guaranteed to see you all running to us. Since everything is cleared there is no need for you all to med, since there is only a couple respawns to deal with.  What really suprised me was the guide/gm watching it as it happened only to hear a reply from our guildleader telling us the guide said more or less tough shit.  Could you imagine if they actually paid the guides.  Wow that would be the shit, fuck around all day on a computer and not do shit, nevermind guess they already do, just call em gm's.  Speaking of GMs, you all must either be one or not have any skin left on your knees with the crap you get away with.  Also would like to say &quot;Hi&quot; to all my friends in EV now that think its ok to walk over the rest of the guilds on the server, will be looking out for ya.  As for you all saying you had permission to be to take the kill if we failed.  That might be true, but i doubt it, since the name you gave hadnt been logged on in nearly a week.  Feel free to debate anything here, isnt one lie here.  And before you type anything that you think we KSed from you, you are probably wrong.  I have been with SI now for over a year.  Rynnia, Mang and Aric have got to be the guild leaders with the most integrity i have seen on the server.  Since being with them I have never seen or heard of us running over anyones camp.  Will admit that there has been times where people die from Named Mobs being pulled.  But, after the crap you all pull I would just be spending $12.95 a month just to train anyone with a EV flag, but I am better than that.  Could happen, but I doubt it.  And for the EV that say, &quot;Not all EV are like that&quot;, well you are.  <br>

I'll bet your face got really red when E/V killed the mob that you spawned.  I'll also bet that your blood pressure rose, and I'll even place a third bet that you have added heart stress as a result of their ganking the AoW.  <br>

It's not enough that they gave you five minutes (the thing was going to depop eventually, so someone had to kill it), and they claim that they didn't even pull the thing, it was trained on them.<br>

When we found out you were going for it, we were told &quot;No one is to go NEAR the arena.  If they lose, we're within our rights to kill it, or else it will despawn anyway, but no one is to go near the arena or even up the ramp till that time.&quot; and no one did.  We're standing around waiting the 10 minutes you took to pull it, when suddenly AoW is on our crew, slaughtering our clerics, breaking our incredible paladin healing wave chain, and nearly wiping us out.  Sure we could have let it wipe us out, but why the hell should we?  I seriously doubt you think letting an entire raid force get wiped out so that we don't kill a mob some moron trained us with.

Always best to talk to the raid leader, and/or to the pullers - it makes us feel important and shit.<br>

news flash, most ueber guilds have that many people for raids.  2 reasons,<br>
<br>
1.  people like to raid.  <br>
2.  some of the shit in the game actually does take that many people to kill.<br>
<br>
did you know that fires of heaven takes 60-70 people to vex thal?  i read it on a message board somewhere =x. <p><p>
