He lived long enough to get my armor to serve me for as long as I want...was killed by the folks of Kelethin when he was framed for a murder of a family of wood elves..  He was accused because he was found near the bodies when the people of Kelethin came to see what had happened.  He had heard the screams and jumped in the window and had gotten the Shadow knight and had been knocked unconscious...I was with him...the SK came out before anyone had managed to get there.  He pulled a dagger out of his pocket shoved me against a wall and proceeded to say if I told anyone I would be next.  <br>
<br>
I ran back to the inn where I stayed and hid.  I had forgot about my brother in my scramble to leave this place.  If I had only dragged the body back it would have been okay.  I will never get over it.  He had woken up and was checking the bodies when the door was burst down...a guard came in and saw the blood on his sword and threw him in the elven jail.  he escaped by nightfall sold his armor and bought what he could for me.  He left it by my dresser...I found the body the next day and it was written in the Kelethin newspaper that he was killed by the people of Kelethin.  I was only 4 then.  So maybe I couldn't have dragged the body of my brother back to the inn.  Pineren knew I was going be a bard since my talent for singing and writing poetry was scary.  <br>
<br>
Then on No one ever talked to me again in Kelethin when I grew up.  It was that I had to raise myself because my mother was killed giving birth to me and my father, had run off with a wood elf... I have no idea where he is now but I do not care. Now since my brother was dead I had to pay for myself.  Though I had the armor and 200pp I knew it wasn't enough for long.  My brother was actually the one to have named me.  Now, I will get on with my story.  <br>
<br>
When I was 16 it was time for me to choose a deity to learn.  I chose Veeshan.  It was a rarely praised god but I saw what powers she might have.  I lost even more respect for that.  It was that night something happened that would change me forever.  <br>
<br>
I was very shy at that time, since the murder I never really spoke to anyone except vendors and myself.  I had my armor on and my weapons.  I looked quite mean...Okay well meaner looking then a thong....I was always made fun of for my white hair and purple eyes.  People thought it was funny, I did forget to mention I am a Half elf...As was my whole family. Anyway.  I take trip every night to watch the sun rise and set.  That is when I travel back to my inn to rest.  <br>
<br>
I was walking back when I passed a bar when a drunk unarmed gaurd staggered out...he saw me and pushed me into an empty house.  I was petrified...Since then I only had 8 songs (at age 16) I had very little power.  He pushed me on a bed and started to rip at my armor.  He threw it over in a corner and proceeded to lay on top of me.  I Struggled to get away screaming with all I could...I began to cry.  The guard of Kelethin was going to rape me then kill me after so I wouldn't tell anyone, I just knew it.  He forced his mouth over mine his tongue lashed into my mouth.  I couldn't stand it much longer, but there was nothing I could do.  He was crushing me with his body. I had no power in my punch but I tried anyway...<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Want to play do you?&quot;  he slapped me...<br>
<br>
I Snapped.  I punched him like a monk punches when knowing his life was in danger.... He rolled off stunned by my power, I was also stunned in the effectiveness of my punch...I was naked but really i didn't care.  There was no way in hell I was going to let this fool ruin my life.  I took my Ice tooth's claws an jabbed them into his neck and killed him.  I put on my armor and ran to the inn I stayed at grabbed the stuff I owned and shoved them into backpacks, then ran to the bank.  Grabbed the little money I had and bought all the songs that could only be purchased in Kelethin and ran for Freeport...I knew they would find the guard soon and know it was me because I was missing.  <br>
<br>
On the boat to Freeport I felt like something had lifted from me....Like a monster had taken a leave from my back and had gone away.  I was glad to no longer be a shy elf, but a confident, don't mess with me, kind of elf. <br>
<br>
  When I reached the docks I got bound at the gates and dropped everything off at the bank.  I ran to kill the orcs that infested the east common lands...I half dessert half plains it was what I called home till song 12...I headed to the sandy dunes of North ro to hunt dervishes...  It was not at song 16 that something else had happened...A man came up to me and asked, &quot;Pardon me M'lady, but by any chance are you Stellarr?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am.&quot; I replied shortly...after the Kelethin thing I had little tolerance for men.  Though Now I was 18 in age.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I was one of your brother's friends...I have something you might want.&quot;  He handed me a topaz where these words were showing in the middle....It read, &quot;Fight, what you can fight.  Be who you are, and live life the way you want to...Do not stand down to the people who hate you but step up the ones you love...For it is only them who should matter in life.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you...&quot;  Were the only words I could get out.  It was very beautiful and would treasure it forever.  The man took a bow and walked away...I watched him go until he faded away in the light.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I knew then that I would take revenge on the people that had once caused Pineren great sadness...It was time to find my father...The one who abandoned the family when Pineren was born...The who had not cared what happened to the mother...He had betrayed her...I would now have to find him, and Kill him.  Then I realized my quest had just started...<br>
