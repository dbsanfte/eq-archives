I was sitting idle outside of Lord Nagafen’s Lair one day, having been summoned there by friends to help take care of the recent overflow of Kobolds that seemed to stream forth from the Great Dragon’s humble abode, when out of the blue my thoughts turned to my old friend and companion, Solanthus, the founder of Nexus. Well, it wasn’t really out of the blue. Lately I had been forced to think back to times gone past and reflect on what they meant to me. Solanthus was my first true friend in the world of Norrath, and I found myself missing him dearly, and prayed that his spirit was safe. It was then that someone poked me.<br>
<br>
“Hey Ig,” said the wood elf in front of me. I didn’t recognize her but I did recognize the tattoo on her left shoulder that marked her as a guildmember of Nexus. Knowing I had a companion in all of Nexus’ members I smiled and greeted her a good day.<br>
<br>
“How are things?” I asked.<br>
<br>
“Good,” she replied in such a way that prompted me to believe that our meeting was not unexpected. I raised an eyebrow and she smiled. “Galand has been looking for you. He says it is the utmost importance that he speak with you as soon as possible. He didn’t say why, but he has the whole guild on the lookout for you. Please, contact him as soon as you can.”<br>
<br>
“I have been away for a while. I wonder what he needs me for.”<br>
<br>
“No one knows, but all I can say is that he has this desperate look in his eyes when he asks a guildmember if he has seen you as of late.” She shook her head. “I have never seen him like this.”<br>
<br>
And neither had I. This worried me more than anything. I stood up and bowed. “Thank you for letting me know. I shall search him out immediately.”<br>
<br>
“He’s at the temple in Freeport.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you.” I waved and made my way to Freeport.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A week later I arrived safe and sound in Freeport, and after checking in to the local Magician’s guild to keep abreast of current events, I headed to the local temple to seek out Galand. After a bit of a hassle (the temple people never liked me much) I made my way to the top floor, a space reserved for meditation and thought. It was here I found Galand.<br>
<br>
As soon as I saw him my jaw dropped. The proud High Elf I had come to know as a stout companion had become gaunt and hollow. His eyes were encircled with rings of black and he had the look of someone who hadn’t slept in some time. He was deep in meditation and didn’t seem to have noticed my entrance. Next to him was a plate of cold and stale food, untouched save a nibble off of one corner of bread. I cursed silently for not making better time on my trip and took the tray out into the hallway. Then, using magics I had known since my earliest days as an apprentice, I summoned forth some bread and water and brought them into the room. Galand was still in meditation when I entered and set the food down. Not knowing what to do I waited.<br>
<br>
Half a turn of the sun later Galand opened his eyes and offered me a haggard smile. “You made it,” he rasped. I motioned to the right of him where the food and water lay and he hungrily wolfed it down, confirming my belief that he hadn’t eaten for a while. We sat in silence as he ate, and when he finished I asked the obvious question. “Why?”<br>
<br>
“I think you know my friend.” He gave me a look that puzzled me. “Or maybe you need a hint. Let’s see… If I am correct, your thoughts have been dwelling on a friend from your past. More so than any other, he invades your thoughts and it puzzles you as to why.”<br>
<br>
“Solanthus?” It was true, after that day almost a week ago when I had first thought of him he had been among one of the chief things in the forefront of my mind. “What about Sol?” The next answer chilled me.<br>
<br>
“I have seen him.” <br>
<br>
I shook my head. “Solanthus is dead Galand. I saw the body myself and was there when they laid him to rest in the Ocean of Tears. You must be mistaken.”<br>
<br>
“I am not mistaken my friend. I have seen him, but not as a physical manifestation, no.” He leaned forward and tapped at his temple. “I have seen him in here. My dreams have been of nothing but him for the last month. Each one is the same.” He closes his eyes, then opens them again and looks out the window of the room at the setting sun.<br>
<br>
“I am traveling towards Felwithe, no reason really, just going home for a bit I guess. I get onto the boat from Freeport and it sets out as normal into the Ocean of Tears. The day is like any other, less the rains that seem to be plaguing Freeport as of late, and the wind is true. About halfway through the trip I am standing up near the bow of the ship and I get this cold chill running down my spine. I turn around and there he is Ig. Standing there clear as day, like nothing had ever happened. He’s even wearing the guild tag. I am shocked, of course, and as I approach him he appears to be trying to tell me something, but the words never seem to manifest. I reach out to touch him… and then I wake up.” He looks at me once again. “Nothing more than that and nothing less.”<br>
<br>
“What does it all mean?”<br>
<br>
“I didn’t know so I took the trip out to his burial site. Druids that levitate are great aren’t they? And you Mages with your water stones..” He shrugs. “Using the water stones, me and two other guildmates dived down to see what we could find.”<br>
<br>
“And?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing. No bones, no body, nothing. Not a trace of anything.” He shrugs again. “It could mean any number of things really, but I was intrigued enough to bring it up with my Clerical advisor. He pointed me to a book on dreams.” He glances to his left and I notice a book resting on the nightstand. “Using it, I analyzed the dream. What I found is… disturbing.”<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes and thought for a moment. “His spirit wishes to tell you something.”<br>
<br>
“Right. At least that’s what the book says.”<br>
<br>
“What do I have to do with this?”<br>
<br>
“I lied when I said the dream was the same all the time. After about a week I started seeing you in it as well. Your part is unknown in all of this, and the dream book cannot explain your presence in anyway. All I can think of is that he wants to talk to you as well.”<br>
<br>
“Then why am I not having a dream as well.”<br>
<br>
“This one is easy. You are not attuned to the sprits of the other realms. As a cleric, I am a very spiritual person and therefor am easier for the otherworld types to talk to.”<br>
I sighed. “So what do we do?”<br>
<br>
“I have been preparing for a speaking ceremony.” He held up a hand at my coming question. “We will call his spirit and talk to him and see what he wants.” He gestures to another book by the window. “That there says we need his two closest friends and five of their closest friends in order to form a circle of binding. Then, once the proper words are spoken, his spirit will come forth and answer one question for each of the persons in the circle. No more, no less.”<br>
<br>
“And when will we do this?”<br>
<br>
“Soon, that’s all I can say. The moons… they have to be in a certain position before the spirits are close enough to this realm to be called. Soon is the only answer I have.” He pauses. “Gather your friends Ignitz. and stay in Freeport. I feel the time drawing near.”<br>
<br>
“And then?”<br>
<br>
“We see what our dearly departed friend has to say. And hope it’s good.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Part Two-<br>
<br>
The Iksar Necromancer looked carefully at the book in his hand. “Are you ssure thiss iss the one I am looking for?”<br>
<br>
Klok Jessith nodded dutifully, the fear that gripped him not allowing much more.<br>
<br>
“Exssplain to me how you came about thiss tome.”<br>
<br>
Klok Jessith swallowed and started talking. “A member of the Sswiftailss brought it with him from hiss lasst trip to Kurn’ss Tower. He ssaid he found it on one of the upper levelss in a bookcasse. It looked ssimilar to the desscription I had received through the network and offered him a fair price in exchange. It wass then I let my ssuperiorss know that I may have found the tome being ssearched for.”<br>
<br>
The Iksar Necromancer nodded and again looked carefully at the book. It was scale-bound, typical of the tomes of the ancient Necromancers, and was riddled with protective charms to deter the uneducated from opening it. It eminated a feeling of pure evil that only another Necromancer would be able to feel. Yes, this was the tome he had been searching for all these years. He looked up at the Klok. “I thank you Klok Jessith, for your help in the attainment of thiss tome.” The fear in the Klok’s eyes diminished, and he allowed himself the Iksar equivilant of a smile. “But I am afraid that your help will do you no good.” The smile disappeared. “You have posssesssed the tome and from now on it will call to you. I cannot have you interrupting my sstudiess with your criess for the posssesssion of the book.” The Klok began to tremble. The Necromancer began to cast a spell. “You musst now die.” The Klok screamed.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Iksar Necromancer left the tent of Klok Jessith a few minutes later, the ancient tome secured snugly against his scales by use of a curscale strap he had acquired as a broodling. Thoughts started to overwhelm him as he made his way back towards the center of Calibis, where the temple of his brethren rested. The Elders would indeed be pleased at this discovery. For years, he and his brethren had searched endlessly for the ancient tome of their greatest Necromancer, Hexscion, and now it had been found, practically right in their back yard. Kurn’s Tower was within walking distance of the city and it was amazing that it had not been found before this.. The Iksar Necromancer shook his head. Amazing indeed.<br>
<br>
But now that it had been found, things were going to change, and their grip on the city of Calibis would tighten even further. The Iksar Necromancer hissed. Yes, things were definatly going to change <p>- Ignitz</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.showMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm8">Cogito's Whacky Woondarland<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm4">Events, Parties, Weddings, etc.<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm13">DarkMask's Illusions<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm14">Bowynn's Playsure Palace<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm2">Admin Stuff<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm15>The Dark Traveller's Tavern</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <table border=0><tr><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
