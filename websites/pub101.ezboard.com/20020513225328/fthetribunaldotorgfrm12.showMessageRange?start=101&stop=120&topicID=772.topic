<br>
Really?  I think you just can't find any.  This reduces your argument to:  Dumai is wrong and the Tax Foundation is wrong because lilum says so.  I yeild to your superior powers of debate.<br>
<br>
&quot;The only reason I brought rushes name into it was because you stated that since it was from a conservative columnist it had to be fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did no such thing.  READING COMPREHENSION.  I said that the tax foundation was more reliable for the simple fact that it was NOT from a conservative columnist.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I was only pointing out the falability of conservative columnists, by using the most well known. Sorry that flew over your head.&quot;<br>
<br>
You hardly did that.  Lets take a look at your claims about Rush Limbaugh.  First of all you failed to provide a source to any of them.  Not to mention the fact that you have attempted to prove Rush wrong without providing evidence that what he said was incorrect.<br>
<br>
&quot;1991 he claimed styrofoam was biodegradable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Styrofoam may or may not biodegrade.  It could just take a very very long time.<br>
<br>
&quot;In his book See I Told You So he said &quot;There are more acres of forestland in America than when Columbus discovered the continent in 1492&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
No one knows how many acres of forest there were in the US in 1492.  Liberal claims (Forest Service historian, Douglas MacCleery) amount to approximately 1 billion acres.<br>
<br>
Rush says:<br>
&quot;Enormous tracts of trees were destroyed by settlers in this country, without being replanted. Today, reforestation is a critical component of the U.S. lumber industry. Furthermore, with increasingly sophisticated measuring methods, the more sure we are about the rapidly increasing rate of forest growth in the continental United States. These are the current facts: In 1952, the U.S. had 664 million acres of forest land. In 1987 the number had climbed to 731 million acres, according to the most recent numbers available in the U.S. Statistical Abstract, 1993-1994 edition. <br>
<br>
&quot;According to the U.S. Forest Service, annual timber growth in the U.S. now exceeds harvest by 37 percent. Annual growth has exceeded harvest every year since 1952. In 1992, just 384,000 acres -- six-tenths of 1 percent of the National Forest land open to harvesting -- were actually harvested. As a result of growth steadily exceeding harvests, the number of wooded acres in the U.S. has grown 20 percent in the past twenty years. The average annual wooded growth in the U.S. today is an amazing three times what it was in 1920. In Vermont, for example, the area covered by forests has increased from 35 percent a hundred years ago to about 76 percent today.&quot; -- Joseph Bast, Peter Hill and Richard Rue, Eco-Sanity: A Common Sense Guide to Environmentalism (Madison Books: 1994), p. 23.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Also in his book he claims there are more American Indians alive today than when Columbus arrived.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quoting Rush:<br>
As for Indian population in the New World, Robert Royal, author of 1492 And All That: Political Manipulations of History, writes: &quot;Estimates of pre-Columbian population figures have become heavily politicized with scholars who are particularly critical of Europe often favoring wildly higher figures. High starting points make Indian deaths by disease, warfare, and mistreatment all the greater. David Henige has dubbed this Native American Historical Demography as Expiation.' Yet despite their mistreatment by Europeans and devastation by European diseases (large numbers of Indians died as disease passed along trade routes, 80 percent without ever seeing a white man), some Indian groups are more populous today than in 1492. There are now more than 30 million Indians in Latin America alone, and there are several times more Iroquois in North America than at first contact.&quot; -- Robert Royal, &quot;Hello Columbus: America Was No Paradise in 1492,&quot; Policy Review, Fall 1992, p. 44. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He has also said that there is no conclusive evidence that nicotine is addictive.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quoting Rush:<br>
&quot;My point, made over and over again in recent months, is that if nicotine is really a terrible drug then Congress should just call it a terrible drug and ban it outright. The fact is that nicotine's addictiveness and whether or not it is a drug is, contrary to FAIR's assertion, a source of tremendous controversy -- so controversial that The Washington Post's lead editorial on July 2, 1994 dealt entirely with this issue. &quot;[F]ood and drug commissioner David Kesslerhas begun an effort to determine whether nicotine- containing cigarettes meet the law's definition of a drug. If they do, the Food and Drug Administration has the duty to regulate them if cigarettes are a drug, and if they can't be shown in their present form to be safe and effective -- which a drug would have to be in order to be sold, and which is not very likely -- then what does the government do?&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW I have refuted your facts by pointing out that your numbers come from potential voters not actual. Again sorry you seemed to miss that little fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
How does that refute anything?  My intial point was that the dems are attempting to buy votes through taxes and welfare (as opposed to the tax cuts, returning money to those who earned it, which is definately not buying anything).<br>
<br>
&quot;Reading comprehension is a wonderful thing, maybe you would have learned it in school if conservatives hadn't been so busy cutting the education budget.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our public schools don't work, not because there is too little budget, but because teachers and parents suck.  Today in our schools teachers are afraid to tell students they are wrong when they give an incorrect answer for fear of emotionally damaging the child.  That might be why you have made it through your life so far providing such weak arguments.  I'm not afraid of hurting your feelings.  Your arguments suck, and provide no facts or support.  I am correct and have provided facts.  You are wrong.<br>

<br>
I paid over 84k in Federal taxes last year and proud of it, a small price to pay to live in such a great country compared to what it has given me. Americans are so spoiled, we pay some of the smallest taxes in the world and bitch about it more than anyone. I don't know about you, but taxes have allways been a part of my paychecks, even back when I was a carryout at a grocery store. It is not like a scam they just came up with to cheat you, it is investing in your country.<br>
<br>
I should follow my own advice and not join in such pointless arguments, especialy when they are so far off topic. Not that I didn't like the topic, I think that televangelist and missionairies in general are a virus that should be eliminated. Only thing I like about religion through the ages is that It made some nice monuments/art possible. Otherwise I believe that it's the lead weight tied around our necks, continualy dragging us into the abyss of ignorance.<br>

So much more could be done if folks were allowed to keep their money and to spend it as they see fit, america donates more money to charity than any other nation in the world per capita, all of this despite the coerced charity known as welfare. local people make more efficient local solutions than the federal government can even dream of, the very nature of federal government is corrupt, its a parasite and its only motivation is to grow and grow and grow and bleed money left and right. <br>

That means that even though there may be more poor in the country, and they have the POTENTIAL to put somebody in power.  They typically don't.

To be honest I haven't even attempted to look up charts, numbers, and graphs to support my side of the argument.  Why because I wouldn't believe them either.    Statistics don't mean shit.  If you ask any question in the right way you can get the answer you want.  <br>
<br>
Once again the numbers you have provided may be correct.  They just aren't the right numbers for your argument that Dems are buying votes, since the poor do not regularly vote.  You have taken taken tax payer numbers and extrapolated them into voter numbers with out taking into consideration voter turn out.  I don't know how to point out the flaw in your argument anymore simply than that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 656<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/8/02 10:31:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Billy</span><hr size=1> You know what I find interesting?<br>
<br>
Almost all colleges are considered 'liberal' as almost all college professors are democrats. I don't have the numbers for this, but I do know it is a very high percentage.<br>
<br>
The press is considered liberal by most.<br>
<br>
Most of the major metro areas are liberal.<br>
<br>
So let's see, the more educated you are, the more likely you are liberal.<br>
<br>
If you live in a highly cultural enviroment (cities), you are more likely to be liberal. If you live in rural areas, you are more likely to be conservative.<br>
<br>
If you are in the tech fields, you are likely to be liberal. If you are in the business field, you are more likely to be conservative.<br>
<br>
Anyone see a trend here or am I just imagining things? Take a look at states that voted democrat vs states that voted republican this last election and I think it shows a pretty strong trend. <p><br>

<br>
What I think this suggests is that the more eductaed you are, the more likely you are to be lberal. I think this is because the more educated you are, the more sides you see to issues which is a liberal trait. Conservatives are more apt to see things in black and white, right and wrong, good or bad.<br>
<br>
I also think that people in diverse enviroments, such as cities, are more prone to be liberal due to that exposure. Cities expose people to a much wider range of stimulus and complex issues that are not easily labeled right or wrong, good or bad. <p><br>
