<br>
You're asking me an indirect question that MUST contain a &quot;what if&quot;.<br>
<br>
By stating that you had no idea that it would get out of hand, describes yourself as naive.  I know you realize that you are talking about abortion, to think it not to get out of hand is naive.<br>
<br>
No you never did address the funeral question.  As for your 39 points, most of them are based on the assumption that a human fetus is a human &quot;being&quot;.  No where has that assumption been proven to be true, hence any conclusion based off that assumption is false.  I got that right out of those 39 points (I actually bothered to read it.).  Many of them mirror statements already made in this thread.   So are we to answer questions repeatedly, while you are allowed to ignore them?<br>
<br>
You know exactly why I started in with the war thing, and I will continue to do so as it runs on the same principal that you wish people to watch your video.<br>
<br>
Ok, so the Free Speech thing just won't sink in for you.  How about gun control?  I'm for the right of everyone to have the choice of owning a gun, but I'm not for a woman to shoot her husband with that gun.  Will that sink in?<br>
<br>

Huh? &quot;Taxes&quot; covers a lot of expenses.  We are still paying &quot;taxes&quot; that were put into place to pay for WWII I believe.  So I guess since the war is over, it never caused taxes to increase.  See the loss of logic in that?<br>

That premise is based on the idea that some amount of those abortions that are instead brought to term would either be placed into a family where their welfare status would increase, or would be placed into the adoption agency programs.  Both situations would cause more government money to be spent.  That money has to come from somewhere, unless you are suggesting that those agencies aren't currently over worked, under funded, and could take on the additional burden.  Would taxes necessarily increase?  That's up for our politicians to decide.<br>
<br>
As for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> whole thing about welfare.  Well it's a known fact that while abortion was illegal that women went to back ally doctors to have the abortions anyway.  My goal would be to save these women from having to do this, to give them an alternate option that doesn't involve a coat hanger.  My suggestion was something that would meet in the middle, allowing the pro-lifers to save the baby, and allow people like myself to protect the rights and life of the woman.  I figured that whole line of thinking would have been self evident. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Thanks for finally answering the funeral question.  But your answer brought up another.  Now you've always talked about the fetus being &quot;human&quot;, we all agree with that.  So do I have it right that it doesn't matter if it has a soul or not to you?  That all unique human life, no matter it's stage of development, should be saved?<br>
<br>
Thanks for finally answering the BCP question.  So you are for the use of BCP, even though you know that it can cause abortions of fertilized human eggs.  So then there is a line you draw, on when it is acceptable for abortions to occur?  At how many days after conception is that line drawn? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Morning after pill.  Since you are for the use of BCPs, are you also for the use of a "Morning After Pill" by a woman that is willing to accept the health risks involved?  Both pills are designed to prevent pregnancies in very much the same manner.  Though I will agree that the morning after pill has a more immediate desired effect, but in the end both pills accomplish the same effect on a fertilized egg, during the same stage of development. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

As I said before, hormonal birth control <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> only used as a contraceptive!  It has a myriad of other applications.  It also <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> used as a form of abortion.  Women do not take hormonal birth control pills specifically to abort children.

&quot;The matter of a soul isn't something that falls within the discussion of abortion, for you.  It doesn't matter if a fetus possess a soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hormonal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>birth control</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is used as a contraceptive.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should make your position on this a little more clear.  Are you for the use of Hormonal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>birth control</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> only in situations other than for a means of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>birth control</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<br>
Women do take hormonal <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>birth control</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> pills specifically to prevent pregnancy.   One of the methods it uses to prevent the pregnancy is the abortion of a fertilized egg.<br>
<br>
But from your response, I can assume that your answer to the morning after pill is a negative, since they are taken specifically to abort any fertilized eggs that may or may not exist.<br>
<br>

Bad premise. The only outcome of being pro choice is the fact of abortion. There are many more outcomes relating to the legality of guns. What you are basically saying is that people should have choice and abortion should be illegal. Is it not illegal fo a woman to shoot her husband? You are for the choice of owning a gun (like the choice of having an abortion), but against killing a human with it (against abortion which is killing a human).<br>

Where are these known facts? How can you prove this? You said known facts, not me. Prove it now. You claim to have read the 39 arguments, evidently, you did not, and is why I keep directing you to them. See, PART FOUR: ARGUMENTS CONCERNING HEALTH AND SAFETY.<br>
<br>
Oh, I'll just paste one part for you since you had trouble the first time...there are more if you want to look.<br>
<br>
“If abortion is made illegal, tens of thousands of women will again die from back-alley and clothes-hanger abortions.” <br>
<br>
24a. For decades prior to its legalization, 90 percent of abortions were done by physicians in their offices, not in back alleys. <br>
<br>
24b. It is not true that tens of thousands of women were dying from illegal abortions before abortion was legalized. <br>
<br>
24c. The history of abortion in Poland invalidates claims that making abortion illegal would bring harm to women. <br>
<br>
24d. Women still die from legal abortions in America. <br>
<br>
24e. If abortion became illegal, abortions would be done with medical equipment, not clothes hangers. <br>
<br>
24f. We must not legalize procedures that kill the innocent just to make the killing process less hazardous. <br>
<br>
24g. The central horror of illegal abortion remains the central horror of legal abortion. <br>

<br>
That's not fair Kellianne. I don't feel a person should be forced to use their body against their will. Look, we aren't talking about inconvience like having a wart removed here. We are talking about 9 months of morning sickness, swelling up like you have a watermelon in you, hormones going nutso and then the extreme pain of child birth.<br>
<br>
Besides, it's a Pandora's Box. If we open the door to force a woman to use her body to incubate a fetus on the basis it will die otherwise, then we also open the door to being forced to donate body organs or blood because a child would die otherwise. Then once it could be forced for a family member, how long before it can be forced for a non-family member?<br>
<br>
Once you change the law to take away control of a woman's body, it lays the foundation for all sorts of legal theories concerning what a person can be forced to do with their bodies.<br>
<br>
Control of ones own body is very sacred. I just can't see messing with that. <p><br>

What I said may be blunt, but you know it's true. You equate a human life with body parts, I do not. You try to link seperate arguments together (organs and such), I do not. Along those lines, one could logically argue that abortion devalues human life, and does so to such an extent where you will be able to one day murder your child as long as it is within 2 months or 9 months old or whatever age. I mean, it certaintly cannot support itself, and if you don't want it, whats the difference if you kill it at 9 months of pregnancy or 2 months after birth.<br>
<br>
I am NOT making that argument, just showing you the Pandora's box theory doesn't really fly.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 759<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/27/02 1:48:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion, how many support this..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Perhaps you need to re-read my &quot;absurd&quot; what if?  I created a question that would put my stance to question.  In order to create that question, a &quot;what if&quot; had to be created.  That what if scenerio, had to involve a method that we were able to deduce the existance of a soul within a living organism.  After that, I had a little fun with the whole idea.  Why you become so offended by such a thing, is behind me, but the original &quot;what if&quot; scenerio is valid, for without it, the question couldn't be asked.<br>

<br>
24d. Women will die from illegal abortions preformed by doctors in their offices, just the same.<br>

It's like the siamese twin thing. Two people sharing the heart of one. If the one with the heart wants to be seperated and the other dies because it is dependent on that heart, is it murder? I don't think so. The death is a side effect of the seperation.<br>

Anyway, once a child is born, it is self sustaining and in no way infringes on the mother's right to control her body.<br>

That isn't exactly what I just said.  You seem to be missing a key point, perhaps I shouldn't have congradulated you.  I believe abortion should be legal when a mother's life is in danger by a human being.  All other situations where an abortion is involving a human being (the fetus), it should be illegal to kill the fetus.  Doctors should be forced to preserve the life of the human being, if doing so would place the mother in danger, than it is her choice to accept that risk, in order to save the human being inside her.<br>
<br>
Apparently you didn't address it well enough, just as the article failed to do.  A human being has a soul.
