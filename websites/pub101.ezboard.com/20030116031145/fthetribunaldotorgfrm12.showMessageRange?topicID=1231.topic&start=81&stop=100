We do not have to abide by the judicial rules of the US. So, we do not require material proof to put people up there. In fact, I would rather not set a precedent of having people up there do to material proof because screenshots can be easily manipulated by anyone halfway decent in photoshop, and logs can be manipulated by people with Oct’s IQ.<br>
<br>
The thing I require on most of all is the credibility of the accusers. If Merton or Rynnia or Darkmask or someone I know of posts something, then they are obviously weighed higher than people with a 4-post count and a name I don’t know. But, I do require more than one person coming forward against a person. And I require details. And yes, as one poster said earlier, I am not an idiot and do check IPs, the source of the IPs, as well as account history.<br>
<br>
People are allowed to come forward and make their case here and let others call BS on it, and then you argue their credibility, whatever. One person has been taken off because his friends came forward and said he was not an alias of one of the peeps up there. We listened to them, they made sense, I apologized for the inconvenience and took his name of the POMS list.<br>
<br>
1. Lots of people came forward against your friend. In fact, when the first person made their post, I immediately interrogated this person’s credibility &amp; to make sure she wasn’t just some anon out to slander someone. That I definitely remember. A Companion I know well vouched for her. Then others came forward. So the name was added.<br>
<br>
2. He never came forward in defense of himself. Again, this is not a real court, and the real rules don’t apply. Not coming forward to defend yourself is never an admission of guilt. But here I consider it a probable admission of guilt. Even now after Judeis has realized that the POMS list IS actually effective, he still gives a half hardy defense here, but to you guys, I imagine he defends himself just fine, after all, you all seem to know everything. Well, everything he tells you.<br>
<br>
Unless there is a serious “page 8” later on, it is looking like he is staying up there. Or if someone can come up with something more convincing than anything that has already been stated.<br>

If he is, it certainly makes Raylar's reasons for trying to get Judeis off the PoMS even more suspect - hell, at this point I'm even think we should put Raylar on the PoMS, for being such a massive idiot =).<br>

I was in OoA, and IW, with Raylar, Judeis, and Sendri when all this shit came down the pipe.  It caused alot of problems. People chose sides etc, the usual drama that always follows crap like this. I chose to believe Jude because I saw no proof.<br>
Now I get to have some fun.<br>
Raylar you fucking IDIOT!<br>
You are such a fucking waste of space and air it is absolutely unbelievable.<br>
Why not tell all these good people how you left IW? HMMM.... wanna? No? Ok I will I can understand that you would not want to. Let's see you decided for whatever reasons to leave the guild hmmm.. then at an officers meeting or in tells decide to ask every officer or anyone else that you could get ahold of to leave the guild to go with you,( upstanding isn't he &lt;cheer ) Fucktard.<br>
Let's see if I am not mistaking and on several occasions I have spoken to Jude about you, he couldn't stand you, couldn't say enough bad things about you.  I find it highly amusing that after all this time goes by and you sucking up to his ass you are now again his bestest little buddy! LOL<br>
I personally think you are a backstabbing fuck!  You are an idiot ingame and by your posts here out of game as well.<br>
You at one point had your head up Sendri's ass so far you could see thru her eyes, but now you want Jude in your guild or whatever your little game is now, and you want him off the PoMs list. You were one of the ones that couldnt wait to tell people he was ON it!<br>
I would ask that you all keep the IW out of this they have suffered enough, thru the trials of the whole Jude Sendri thing.<br>
They do not deserve to even be  brought up except by association that Jude was the former GL, and is now an officer. My rl husband Slamminjack is now the GL and I can assure you Jude is not pulling his strings, he may be  still trying to have his little kingdom behind the scenes since he cannot handle the job atm lol. whatever.<br>
BTW Raylar when you use my name asswipe SPELL it correctly it's Fabienki you dumbass and just to clarify it was my wizard at that meeting, get your shit straight if you are gonna spew it. <br>
Get off your soapbox go back to your soap opera of an existance, and we will all change the channel.<br>
As far as the Jude Sendri thing goes I have chosen to distance myself from the whole thing because it was a total waste of my game time not to mention a worthless endeavor, because they are all freakin drama queens to the core.<br>
Well flame away, say your piece, you have wanted a chance to for along time I would imagine, lol.<br>
Thank you for your time<br>

What's up with random capitalization and properties that don't make sense?<br>
<br>
The last two sentences is what I am referring to.  Not everyone can have a lot of 'standing up for a friend', but apparently you do? I guess...<br>
<br>
I guarantee in &quot;real life&quot; you would not stand up for a friend who was thought to be attempting to have sex with 14 year old girls (or whatever, I just skimmed over this dumb shit) so shut the fuck up.  &quot;Hey my buddy's ok, he just tried to have sex with a 14 year old like 6 months ago so he's a whole new person now!&quot; <p><img src="http://server17.hypermart.net/catacomb/sig.jpg">

I know that I am putting myself up to be flamed but so be it if that is what you choose.

I don't know why Raylar won't shut up and let it drop. people are gonna decide on their own  wether or not judeis did it so why the big drama? all it is doing is making it worse on him. now i'm not gonna act like i know what all is going on all I know is that a friend of mine is getting attacked all over again in game and on this board when everything had died down and raylar brought it back up. all I have to say is let each individual decide what they think about him..  if you don't like him, don't talk to him. No one forces you to talk to someone u don't like. This is just my lil two cents on the subject and you can take what I said seriously or you can flame me for I do not care. <br>
