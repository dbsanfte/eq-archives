Here are some links that say it's not. With the levels of energy applied to a round, i wouldn't discount a significant amount radiological emission after impact. Would need to check how the physics work out. Any of you military guys have a good guesstimate of the velocity / mass / volume of a round ?<br>

<br>
In the middle of the explanation - this caught my attention :<br>
==============================================<br>
At high speed, DU slices through tank armour like a hot knife through butter, triggering the explosive content and creating a fire hot enough to melt aluminum. The depleted uranium also burns on impact, creating flying bits and dust that are toxic and radioactive with a half-life of 4.2 billion years. <br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
The other article quotes radiation measurements showing contamination in villages and aquifers. And radiation is probably not the worse, since like all heavy metals, U is very toxic. Compound all this with claims of symptoms that are strikingly similar with radiation poisoning from thousands of Gulf War and Bosnia vets... i would think there would be cause to take a Geiger and some sand samples. Repost the links from the flame board if you still have them... i dont remember reading that stuff. <br>

-Good cut and paste job on the links, but where's the info? There is none of course, there's only conjecture, which is why theres no numbers. If you want info go to the link someone posted on that other thread a while back. There's at least some actual data there.<br>
<br>
-The impact energy is going to affect the dose contained in a round eh? Not on this planet. But you're &quot;going to use physics&quot; to figure it out lol. I have quite a few years experience in the field and I'd really like to see those calculations. Please at least post what you're intending to &quot;calculate&quot;, it should be worth a laugh. All guesstimations, but 1300 m/s, 10kg, 1000cc should be in the ballpark. What you're going to figure with them I have no idea, but I'll be waiting with bated breath.<br>
<br>

Many Industries did not continue to Rise, One being the synthetic oil industry.

<br>
From your own numbers the German Ability to produce tanks/planes/Trucks Was around 30% off from what they expected to produce.The figure also does not show industries that did suffer greatly, Speer helped the war Industry but what of oil, textiles, Medical suplies,Munitions,Rubber,Steel, Transportation (Trains/Bridges), and R&amp;D?  The air war was not as bloody, It was not as grueling, And it was not as fantastic as the Eastern front.

Honestly I am not sure if the Germans could have Held the Russians in Germany. I can only make conjecture on that point, However... <br>
<br>
Would the Russians have found the war diffrent had the Germans been using more then 60-70% of their military to fight them? Would the Russians have been as effective had the USAF/RAF not nullified much of the luftwaffe's Air power? Without Allied Suplies would the Russians been able to move as swiftly? Would they have been able to suply all their mens Munitions/Supply needs? Would they have had ample suplies to build all their Tanks/Planes<br>

Just how many times do you need to be educated on this to understand the truth?<br>
<br>
DU rounds are toxic like LEAD rounds are toxic.  Heavy Metals are TOXIC.  So instead of all those DU rounds, toss in Lead Rounds.  Now since DU is a heavier metal than Lead, I could be led to believe that DU is &quot;more&quot; toxic.  But in the end, toxic is toxic, especially when you are talking about the amounts of heavy metal munitions we are discussing.<br>
<br>
The Radiation concerns over DU are about zero.  There are miners that mine Uraninium Ore for a LIVING.  They are exposed to this ore in HIGHER concentrations, on a DAILY basis.  Uranium ore has HIGHER radiation levels.  These miners do have health problems, but they are no where near the levels that are being implied by Anti-DU activists.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; is NOT caused by DU radiation, nor Heavy Metal poisoning.  The reason we know why?  Cause we know what BOTH of those health concerns do to a human body.  What has happened to our vets from the Gulf War is NOT similiar in nature.  I would rather look to the biological/chemical weapons that Saddam may have used, vacination shots the soldiers received, or the burning of the oil fields.<br>
<br>
Sheh, if you want to compare the amount of knowledge we have now about nukes than we had back in WWII, you're a bigger moron than I originally thought.  <br>
<br>
Why are you so hung up on 2 nukes in WWII? You aren't even part of the two cultures involved in that situation!<br>

Inert and before it's fired, it is indeed less radioactive than naturally occuring U, because I imagine it's been purified. Naturally occuring U is about 70% U235, 30% U238 and something like 0.01% of U236 (quoting from memory - may be off by some), the natural isotope that emits alpha radiation. If you apply energy (electric, temperature, pressure...) in sufficient quantity, you are going to transform a certain % of your U235 into U236, that will be released by emitting radiation. Some of it is harmless (infrared - dissipates shortly), some of it is not (alpha, beta, gamma - dissipates at geologic scale). The question is : how much energy at impact is transfered to the rod (hence the mass / volume / velocity question) and how much radioactive U would you end up with. Maybe it's completely off scale, I don't remember my school books from 15 years ago. But all these texts seem to indicate some level of radioactive contamination.<br>
<br>
Why isn't lead  or iron transforming into a radioactive compound ? Because of quantum states that prevent lead from remaining into an isotopic state and "storing" that energy. As for how much more toxic lead dust is to U dust, no clue.<br>
<br>
Now if you have discussed the subject before, point me to that discussion instead of flaming and name calling.<br>

I can't find the link of a study report I'd found on DU though.  That completely sucks.  It had good information.  It discussed the radiological concerns with DU rounds.  Both used and unused rounds.<br>
<br>
Essentially the major concern over DU is the toxicity of the substance.  Someone will die from the toxicity of the heavy metal, long before any kind of radiation from the round kills them.<br>
<br>
As for the soldiers in the tanks that are hit with these rounds, the molten hot radioactive cloud of death that spews forth once the round his the tank, is about the last of their worries.<br>
<br>
The problem that recovery teams have to contend with when they go to recover these tanks or the people within them, is the dust that is created when the round hits the tank.  That dust, if inhaled, can cause health problems, because of heavy metal poisoning. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A> at: 10/15/02 12:07:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ushehbahn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/15/02 12:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=192>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: USA supplied Iraq with bioweapons :(</span><hr size=1> That'll teach me not to check a periodic table : U is naturally 238 - not 235.

As a case in point- your last post.<br>
<br>
&quot;A DU round is a rod of depleted U235.&quot; Wrong. Its over 99.9%U238, that's what &quot;depleted&quot; is. It's not &quot;depleted U235&quot; its &quot;depleted uranium&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;it is indeed less radioactive than naturally occuring U, because I imagine it's been purified.&quot; Purifying ore removes elements other than uranium from the ore, increasing its activity per volume. It's less radioactive because before it becomes ammo its exposed to conditions that artificially and exponentially accelerate the decay rate.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Naturally occuring U is about 70% U235, 30% U238 and something like 0.01% of U236 (quoting from memory - may be off by some), the natural isotope that emits alpha radiation&quot; -Youre not off by some, you're not remotely close. Naturally occuring uranium is less than 1% U235 and over 99% U238, with fractions of all the other isotopes. *All* isotopes of U are unstable, therefore by definition radioactive.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you apply energy (electric, temperature, pressure...) in sufficient quantity, you are going to transform a certain % of your U235 into U236&quot; -There is *one* way to make 236 from 235, which is neutron bombardment. If the 235 does not capture a neutron or the neutron causes fission instead it will never, ever, be U236. U236 is irrelevant in itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some of it is harmless (infrared - dissipates shortly)&quot; -Want to make something radiate infrared? Heat it. Sure it's radiation. Light is radiation.<br>
<br>
&quot;some of it is not (alpha, beta, gamma - dissipates at geologic scale)&quot; -Congratulations. As long as youre applying the statement to only long-lived sources, its the only actual fact in the paragraph.<br>
<br>
&quot;The question is : how much energy at impact is transfered to the rod (hence the mass / volume / velocity question) and how much radioactive U would you end up with&quot; - The question is irrelevant. You would end up with as much radioactive U as you started with. See a couple paragraphs above. Binding energy per nucleon is much higher than any mechanical, temperature, or electric force you could possibly put on the DU penetrator. As an example of how much higher, note the energy created by releasing the nucleonic binding energy of about 50KG of U235 1500 ft over Hiroshima.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why isn't lead or iron transforming into a radioactive compound ? Because of quantum states that prevent lead from remaining into an isotopic state and &quot;storing&quot; that energy.&quot; -Lead doesn't have isotopic states? It has 4 naturally occuring ones and *all* unsynthesized lead isotopes are stable. Lead is a radiogenic element, a final decay daughter of U235,238 and Th232. An element is radioactive because it's not in a quantum ground state, and gets itself to that state by emitting either mass (alpha rad.), charge (beta rad.), energy (gamma rad.), or a neutron (neutron rad.)<br>

Why exactly would the US do this?  DU rounds are made to pierce heavy tank armor and penetrate deep underground bunkers.  The ordinance does this well, without having to treat the ammunition.  The only reason that this would be said, is to paint the US as big evil doers of the world.  Also, I wouldn't be surprised that activists pulled this out when they were schooled in physics as to why DU rounds can't be as harmful radiologically as they keep harping on.<br>
<br>
Other than that, provide source data that shows these rounds are treated in some way that makes them more enviromentally harmful.<br>
<br>
Also, the US isn't the only country that uses DU rounds.  Britain, and Russia, along with a few others that I can't remember off the top of my head, use DU rounds.  Britain had used them in Desert Storm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urigadoondemortis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rigadoon deMortis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/16/02 9:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=197>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: eh...</span><hr size=1> Wow MaxaMail yer smart.
