Others also say they were scammed by Inasnum, who freely admitted this to a GM and said he didn't care. Azraelle says Razmuzx &quot;shared an account with Inasnum&quot;, but was too trusting and Inasnum stole everything. Azraelle notes that Razmuzx has a 34 ogre warrior called Ernold.<br>
<br>
DurHelm then posts that the guild Banished Heroes picked up a level 52 warrior called Olyn, shown by penguin.avernus.net to have been &quot;dusted off&quot; after a 19 month absence from Tribunal. Olyn told DurHelm &quot;he was hacked a while back and it took forever to get his character Olyn back from Verant. He also says that Razmuzx was hacked and has just about given up on getting Razmuzx back from Verant'. Each character was on a seperate account.&quot; I'm not sure if this means two people were hacked, or that Razmuzx and Olyn were owned by the same person before they were hacked.<br>
<br>
In the Velk group when Razmuzx said he had &quot;crap stuff&quot; and needed the book, I asked if the x meant he was a server transfer. He said no, he had come back to Tribunal after a very long absence and was not a transfer.<br>
<br>
The only record of Razmuzx on penguin.avernus.net is that he was level 60 in Legendary at the end of January this year. There is no record of a Razmuz (without the x). Ernold appears in late 2001 only. However, Olyn is recorded as having been in Justice Keepers, Vagrants and then Elitists back in 2000.<br>
<br>
I never intended to go beyond the Velk looting incident, but now there are a lot of unanswered questions ... Who controls Razmuzx? Is it the person who apparently hacked the account? Is it the same person as Olyn? What happened with this person in those guilds?<br>
<br>
Is Razmuzx really Inasnum?<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
P.S.  Proceed through the monkey shit thread, and &quot;Razmuzx's friend&quot; Azraelle gradually becomes the focus of attention. First he starts posting weak accusations against people for going LD with loot. Then he gets into a fight with everyone else in the thread about kiting etiquette in Cobalt Scar. By the end of the thread, there is a suggestion that Azraelle is trying to get himself added to the monkey shit list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrozzer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/02 3:30:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oops</span><hr size=1> A couple of people have already posted in this thread that Razmuzx does also play Olyn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxaralexialeisi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaralexia Leisi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I lived in NY for 8 years<br>You touch me, i breaka you face</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/02 4:01:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oops</span><hr size=1> Well now.

If it's the same character (that German guild looks hardcore enough to have generated a 60 Razmuz, and his new SB character is a mage type), our Razmuzx may have been picked up on Ebay and transferred here. The current player is definitely not German.<br>

Razmuzx, when I first saw him, had a Green Silken Drape and a bag full of Malachites, with about 200pp (this is a lvl 60 Mage?). My friend said he was in the process of re-equiping him. Makes me wonder now why he had to.<br>
<br>
Yes, Razmuzx is really Olyn. Yes, Olyn is really Inasnum (who is, therefore, Razmuzx). And yes, Inasnum is a known scammer, therefore leading one to believe that he would continue such things on Razmuzx and Olyn.<br>
<br>
My suggestion? Ignore this fucker. Forget him. Put him on your ignore list and make like he doesn't exist. IRL he's an asshole, and he's no different in the game. But that's just my suggestion, I know my rep on the flame board isn't great. Use your own discretion. I wouldn't wish this guy on anyone... <p>Azraelle Norgale <BR>

<br>
Let me tell you a little about who Razmuzx really is (or was) because I know the guy in RL. <br>
<br>
Razmuz started playing EQ a little over a year ago on the Tholluxe Paells (sp?) server. Me and some other RL friends were playing here on Trib, so after a while he decided to start a char on Trib. He created a wood elf bard named Razmuz - just like his mage on Tholluxe P. (which should still be on that same account). <br>
<br>
After playing Razmuz to about lvl 45 he decides to servertransfer his lvl 60 mage (Razmuz - which then became Razmuzx) to Trib. We help re-equipt him, but EQ seems to have lost its fun for him.<br>
<br>
I'm not quite sure what happened next, but next thing I know one of my other RL friends - who also plays here on Trib - tells me that he traded his account with a lvl 60 halfling warrior from.... Tholluxe P.<br>
<br>
So there you have it... Razmuzx (HIE mage), Razmuz (ELF bard) and Ernold (OGR war) are all the same person who traded his account - I can find out what the name of his warrior is/was on Tholluxe Paels if it's of any interest... <p><br>

Consider most level 60's transferring servers have help waiting for them to reequip.  In most cases a level 60 transferring servers that knows &quot;nobody&quot; on the server they transfer to, is running from a bad reputation on their old server.<br>

Azraelle knows what Razmuzx had because his friend (the one who gave the PW to Inasnum) gave him the password too.<br>
<br>
Azraelle is Azraelle and has no other characters above lvl 22.<br>
<br>
That said...<br>
<br>
No, Razmuzx is not played by the same person who played it on Tholuxe, unless for some god-awful reason Inasnum first transfered the character, gave the password to my friend, had my friend give him the password back, and then &quot;stole&quot; the character from my friend...<br>
<br>
My friend, btw, in case there is still any doubt of my role in this (I was observer, simple) is a lvl 50 Ranger named Itlum. Not bright (he does play a Ranger....) but a good guy.<br>

Re: Players To Avoid; Pieces of Monkey @#%$.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hate to add a name twice, but this is for a different issue.<br>
<br>
I've recently learned (like yesterday) that Inasnum is someone my friends know, in real life. My friend (a trusting person, the idiot....) was sharing an account with Inasnum. Of course...Inasnum hijacked it, changed the password, everything. He's currently being reported to Verant for doing it, but we're not quite sure if Verant will suspend his main account or not.<br>
<br>
So now Inasnum has been known to trade scam, and also is an account thief. He also has a friend who helps him doing this. The main character of this friend is Velociter.<br>
<br>
Uncertain on level/class/race of either of these, as they spend all of their time in /anon. My friend's characters are Razmuzx (a level 59 High Elf Magician) and Ernold, an Ogre Warrior who is about level 34.<br>
<br>
I will post back here to update if Verant gets off their asses and does something about these two.... <br>

Re: Players To Avoid; Pieces of Monkey @#%$.<br>

Interesting that you mention &quot;Razmuzx&quot;. Our Guild &quot;Banished Heroes&quot; just picked up a level 52 warrior named &quot;Olyn&quot;... Now Olyn appears to have been dusted off. That is to say, he was last seen on Tribunal almost 19 months ago as a level 52 warrior. <br>
<br>
I questioned &quot;Olyn&quot; about his Warrior... he says he was hacked awhile back and it took forever to get his character Olyn back from Verant. He also says that &quot;Razmuzx&quot; was Hacked and has just about given up on getting Razmuzx Back from Verant. Each character was on a seperate account. Now what truth is there into this? I honestly don't know /shrug<br>

DurHelm, I'll talk to ya in game about the whole Olyn/Razmuzx thing, if I can find you. If you want though send me an email with your address and I can do it that way too. <br>
<br>
The whole thing is related, surprise surprise.<br>

lright. This is quite a long story and its more @#%$ than I had truly known. Not sure if this is the whole story, but considering my friend told GM Aerendar this, I guess he felt the truth was worth his account being banned, if this is in fact the entire truth, but I know that much of it is as I have witnessed most of it, and have gotten the rest from those I trust.<br>
<br>
It started with Olyn. My friend, in real life, plays a Ranger as his main. Someone he works with played EQ as well, and had a lvl 52 Warrior who used to be in Elitists named Olyn. Well, his wife gave him an option, EQ or her. Suffice it to say, Olyn ended up in my friend's hands. He proceeded to strip all of the gear except the No Drop stuff (on an Elitists character, this still left Olyn quite well equiped) and now his Ranger is equipped better than most 60 Rangers I know. Anyway...<br>
<br>
He got bored with Olyn, mostly because we (his friends) told him that he would be an idiot to play it and miss out on the 40-50 thing. So, he gave it to another friend of his that I had never met before, that I knew of. Only now have I come to find out this &quot;friend&quot; is Inasnum, a well-known scammer (and someone my friend knows in real life).<br>
<br>
Well, this friend traded the Olyn account for the Razmuzx account and gave the password to my friend. They shared it until finally Razmuzx (Inasnum) changed the password again and now my friend is left with nothing. <br>
<br>
In a way, I am forced to kind of chuckle at the whole thing, barring where it involves your guild. I don't want any honest people to be compromised here, and so...there's the whole story. You all can decide to use it as you will.<br>

[My e-mail back to her]<br>
<br>
So let me see if I have this right...<br>
<br>
1. Olyn gave his account to a friend at work that plays a Ranger as his main (Ranger is your friend). Your friend now has 2 accounts Olyn and his Ranger.<br>
<br>
2. Your friend then gave the Olyn account to one of his friends (Inasnum = Scammer from Hell) and your Friend still has his Ranger on a seperate account?<br>
<br>
3. Inasnum then traded the Olyn account for the Razmuzx Account (who has the Olyn Account?)... so now, Inasnum = Razmuzx...<br>
<br>
4. Now you say that Razmuzx (Inasnum) gave your friend (Ranger) password to Razmuzx Account... which they shared until Razmuzx (Inasnum) changed the password on the Razmuzx Account...<br>
<br>
5. And finally you state &quot;my friend is left with nothing&quot;... What Happened to his original account with the Ranger? and what happened with the Olyn account?<br>
<br>
As you can see... there are still some unanswered questions... can you help me out? <br>
<br>
Thx,<br>

[Her response to my reply:]<br>
<br>
You are correct on most parts. He is left with nothing more than he began with plus the twink gear, so he's still quite well off.<br>
<br>
Olyn is in the hands of a person who has played a Mage for 60 levels.<br>
<br>
Razmuzx has the Olyn account, Inasnum has the Razmuzx account, neither have ever played either class for any serious amount of time.<br>
<br>
That a bit better? =)<br>
<br>
[My Final words on this matter:]  <br>
<br>
1. Her friend still has his Ranger account<br>
<br>
2. Inasnum (punk) now has Razmuzx account<br>
<br>
3. Razmuzx now is playing the Olyn account<br>
<br>
4. Olyn has not be straight up with this guild since he joined... lied to me on several occassions about the information I have provided you above...<br>
<br>
Recommendation... Get Rid of Olyn before he causes Serious Problems for Our Guild...<br>

P.S. Why am i concerned at all? Because I have ALOT of RL FRIENDS in this GUILD... That is Why...  <br>
