I was so happy, but at the same time was new to the game. I had no clue what this weapon was capable of. I know that I could have never received the hammer if it weren't for the Elitists, and to them I am grateful. The story goes something like this...Young hardolek was in Unrest when some bad arse mobs started killing everyone. We all knew the Elitists were on the way, but nobody knew what was going in unrest. Then if i remember correctly the fight went to Crushbone, can't remember if the fight went to Gfay then CB..oh well. I know that inside CB I was the only healer in the group It was Crush, Magnom, Drushala, hmm can't remember the bard, and myself..sorry if I missed names. We had a large group backing us up ( you all know who you are ) there must have been 5 lvl 50 GM's attacking or something lol it was crazy. I know Crush died a few times (lost count after 1) it was pretty scary. I remember after the battle then heading to Kaladim to meet with King Krazon (was being played by Ignaurus ) he said he needed something, or someone out of the dwarves to help him find a key.Crush said &quot;if anybody deserves anything, it is Hardolek&quot; he then asked me to step foward, and told me about a DE guard holding the key on the bridge in Nektulos Forest..hehe that was first TP i ever got, can't remember who did the teleport, but all of a sudden we were in lavastorm. We proceeded to kick the crud outta someone, and more came to help him..HAHAH Magnom either fell in the water himself, or knocked the Gm in lmao. Finally when the DE was down, after all that..someone Ninja looted he KEY! and tried to return it herself..haha what a shame, I was then asked to step foward and receive this Relic that once belonged to Brell himself, It was the Butcher Block Hammer..I know long story, but just to let you all know this is really me not an Ebay kid. thanks for listening, and i still think the Elitists are cool..well most anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubeltanebuttercup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beltane Buttercup</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://beltane.hypermart.net/pics/ezboardicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/18/01 5:37:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most memorable moment in EQ?</span><hr size=1> I have three most memorable moments.<br>
<br>
1.  I met Dral and Beened in lower guk to camp the arch mage.  I was so amazed that they were holding this spawn, back then it was a big deal!  Beened hadn't slept for like 24 hours, so of course, he was saying some fairly fucked up shit.  We just sat there on that spawn for a long time, chatting.. listening to Beened.  This was before Pigg really played, so he kept talking about his cousin doing all these crazy things.  It was just.. happy.  It was before spawns bored me to tears, when spawns were fun.<br>
<br>
2.  Meeting my boyfriend, every moment we spent online together was so much fun.  Falling in love with him in game and then eventually again in real life when we met.<br>
<br>
3.  Disbanding Goetia.  My heart was completely broken over that... but it is definitely my most memorable moment. <p><img src="http://server36.hypermart.net/beltane/pics/multisig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaeaolena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeaolena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/18/01 8:56:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most memorable moment in EQ?</span><hr size=1> Ok ill add a few of mine.<br>

<br>
Doing the Lang quests with Volkmar, running back and forth from wk to halas, getting the lion meat shipment, and getting all the way to halas and ready to turn it in and realizing i ate it on the way up...... My sirname is Lioneater because of it<br>
<br>
Same quest, with Volkmar again, following frostbite, and shooting him in the ass with an arrow by mistake, that cost us about an hour of running around wk looking for our guy with the head.<br>
<br>
Running down to Naggy's lair when EH was raiding with my 34 rogue, unbuffed and joining in the fight.  I got hit once, but was alive when he dropped.<br>
<br>
My first north wall run in fear, i made it a whole 10 feet, and as soon as i popped at my bind point, getting tells from Darkax CONSENT CONSENT CONSENT, and phatty savin my ass<br>
<br>
The old times in WoP, damn we had fun, people couldnt believe the guild chat, and i hate to even think how many peps we lost cause of it, but we didnt care<br>
<br>
thanks guys, for all of the fun times so far in eq <p>Cornisolis Lioneater, 54th Champion

We were in Seb and doing the necros in rapid fire style. I was like &quot;holy shit! These guys make this look so easy&quot;. I had been in two guilds before I joined in Elitists, but I had never seen how really effective an experienced, well equipped group could be.<br>
<br>
About an hour into it, Boggs gave me a pair GEBs. That doesn't sound like a big deal now, but they went for 12k back then, and to get a pair from a guy that had only known me a few hours... blew me away.<br>
<br>
During the night some SI people had a wipeout and were having probs with CR. Crush, without even being asked, tells them to consent us and we drag their corpses to zone in. Those who were around back then will understand the significance of this, because of how many flamewars were going on between SI and EV in those days. I learned that night, that while Crush was a hardass, he has a code that is pretty damn honorble.<br>
<br>
As corny as it sounds, I would have to say that my first week in Elitists was my most memorable time in EQ. I felt like a rookie in an all star team. I had heard alot of rumors and myths about how hard EV members had it and how much of a dictator Crush was, but my first week blew those misconceptions away. I got nothing but support during that time and Crush made me feel like family from day one.<br>
<br>
Since then I have seen and done alot of amazing things with my guild, but that first week will always be with me. <p><br>

Went down to tha third level of Befallen with a group that was much higher than me (all tha mobs were bloody red too), then goin LD fer over two hours.  Logged back on to find none of them on.  I hunkered down in tha spikes in tha room right behind tha third door, an called fer help.

<br>
I was sitting at the gfay spires just hanging out, watching the big guys porting to Hate and such.  I was pretty low level, bored, and just in the mood to watch the people I'd one day become, with the cool stuff I'd one day get, doing things I'd one day do.<br>
<br>
A member of the Elitists (whose name unfortunately escapes me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) did an OOC looking for a jeweler.  I tentatively sent a tell telling her yes I was a jeweler and had my kit on me.  I had 120 skill and had never touched a platinum bar, much less a diamond... yet she put both in my hands (and to those new to things, it didn't used to mention whether you succeeded or not, you had to trust the jeweler).<br>
<br>
I warned her... I might fail this and she told me &quot;It's okay, give it your best shot.  If you fail, I can always get another <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
After enchanting the plat bar, I closed my eyes and hit combine... I was afraid to look.  When I did, there was a shiny new Plat Diamond ring for her.  I happily handed it to her and refused any payment, considering I just hit one of those unforgettable moments thanks to her faith in me.<br>
<br>
If anyone remembers this.. whether it's the person I made it for or you know of them, lemme know.  Would be nice to make a connection now. <p><CENTER>
