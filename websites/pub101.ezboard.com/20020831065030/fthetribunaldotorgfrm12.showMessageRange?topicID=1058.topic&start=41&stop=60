Not 48 hours after the Legomaniacs fucked up Trans's rotation i had a long chat with someone from Lego's. During that conversation i did make a suggestion bout PoG since thats what we agreed to with Comps to get in. But, by no means did i say you MUST do this. Actually before Gimpendary screwed up the Trans rotation they had a 2 day shot at Aary on RNG's turn. But ooops you morons fucked that shot up. All said and done when its RNG's turn again, the Legomaniacs show up attempting Aary while RNG is gathering to Ntov. Hell if you fucking twats had 2 fucking brains cells to work with you woulda asked a couple days before that and got 48 hours to do him yourself. For the Love of God someone grow a pair of balls in that ghei whorehouse of a guild and work something out. Just goes to show you that &quot;Common Sense&quot; is not all that fucking Common.<br>

&gt; So I guess people that don't kill Aary and skip straight for the pinata dragons are border hoppers?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure you understand yet. The only way into NToV is through Aary's room. So unless you have some kind of gimp timesink craziness where you think you can bypass an ubermob in a small room acting as gatekeeper, you can only raid the pinata dragons if someone kills Aary. He pops before they do.<br>
<br>
And if a truly NToV-capable guild kills Aary, they are generally going to do a large batch of pinata dragons straight afterwards (if not all of them). So there is no skipping straight to the pinatas unless you happen to be Legendary a few weeks ago where one guild killed Aary and got some shut-eye, then woke to find Legendary had taken advantage of Aary being down.<br>
<br>
The rotation exists because nobody wants to clear a zillion flurry drakes (bit like fighting Vindi after Vindi) that will probably drop nothing, in order to reach one pinata dragon that is on track. So guilds opt for a rotation of full circuits of the zone, with the entry qualification being an Aary kill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugalendril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galendril</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/10/02 4:31:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legos and Roy?

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> OK people gittin in this rotation for notv isnt brain surgery.<br>
<br>
You ( guild who wishes to git in rotation) have your guild leader preferably, raid officer or officer send a tell to find out who is up for Ntov a few days in advance of when it pops( aary mainly) arry is a week spawn  if ya pay attention ya will know from the previous weeks aary kill when about he will pop.. not hard.<br>
<br>
After finding out who is up You (see above) being a powerful guild and *probally* able to kill aary send a tell to that guilds guild leader ( Lilwee for RNG, Thinkness for trans, Rynnia for SI,  no sure who is the AN guild leader at this time) and ASK for a shot at aary.<br>
<br>
Most likely none of hem will say no. You may even be afforded a 24 hour try or soemthing close if you ask soon enough so We (the rotating guilds) can give the guild up an extra day  if You fail to kill Aary. There may be some negotiation for a spawn or clearing pog liek we did for the companions.. was clearing pog worth a shot at ntov.. well lemme think about it and git back to you.<br>
<br>
What this does for You is such : If you do manage to kill aary and have gone about it in the right way (see above) you will get the rest of the 48 hours afforded the rotating guilds to kill off as many of the other ntov mobs as You can without the rotating guilds coming in and wiping them all out.<br>
<br>
And more importantly You will have Earned a spot in the rotation not *shoved * Your way in and in turn earned some respect for your guild.<br>
<br>
If you want in the rotation why dont ya try that method and see how it goes. Killing tormax and yeli are decent indicators of being ready to try aary i would imagine but not sure on criteria to be asking so you would have to ask someone else (maybe the guild leaders or raid leaders of one of these 4 guilds)<br>
<br>
good luck <br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> I dont *think* that SI has asked anyone to carry their books to get into NToV.  I don't know where that whole thing started, but Galen's analogy is dead on as far as I'm concerned.  But being required to carry books is one thing, and being 48 inches or taller so that &quot;they&quot; let you on the big roller coaster, even though your parents paid for your admission ticket, is another analogy.  If you arent 48&quot; tall, you ain't getting on that roller coaster.<br>
<br>
Rynnia's posts sum it up, and not surprisingly as he takes the lead on this for SI.  There is no *good* reason for a woefully inadequate guild to be farting around in there.  It's not like the only way you can go from (1) woefully inadequate to (2) being able to kill Aary and progress thru the zone is by trying and failing on Aary for 24 hours straight.  We all know that that is Lego's modus operandi; they try to brute force many things. (Some call it &quot;zerging.&quot;) One view of this game is that, &quot;If that's what they want to do, they pay the same $12/month so let them.&quot;  Well, that's not everyone's view of the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utarjman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarjman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 401<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/10/02 6:07:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legos and Roy?

The analogy seems to have evaded you.  Let's say that Aary is the border patrol and that NToV is America.  If you Aary is down and you walk right into America, you are a border hopper.  Simple.<br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> A lot of people are getting this all wrong, too.  If the current rotation guilds want a non-rotation guild to have killed certain mobs, there is a reason.  If Guild X wants in the rotation, but hasn't managed to kill Yelinak or Tormax, or cleared the Plane of Growth (except Tunare--she's another level of difficulty up), then they aren't going to be able to handle NToV very well.  Aary and Vyemm are relatively difficult.  Asking Guild X to show some minimum competency before they delay 4 other guilds doesn't seem that onerous.  Perhaps others disagree.<br>
<br>
This is NOT a bribe thing.  Clear PoG for another guild, or do a ring war for them--screw that.  Do it for yourselves.  Yes, the PoG has a purpose, too.  Some named Treant, Aoil the Elder maybe?, has a nasty silence.  He's very good training for NToV.  So are Tunare's pets.<br>
<br>
I didn't spend anytime watching, so maybe Lego didn't have 4 clerics or something, but Lego wiped twice to Iky in ToV last night.  Iky is probably the single easiest mob in NToV.  (He's in the north wing at least.  Some people only consider Aary and all the mobs past him as NToV.)<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to see the Lego's get 24 hours at Roy--especially if they'd agree to go away and not bother the other guilds for at least 2 full rotations if they failed--but that is up to others.<br>
<br>
Right now the spawn in NToV is so completely FUBAR, it's amazing.  The dragons are spawning over like 4 days.  We need a patch!<br>

<br>
Which is exactly why we have a 48 hour deal for the rotating guild. git in kill them and git out or let someone else in who can clean up the mess so it repops ASAP for the next guild up.<br>
<br>
ntov being a 5 day raid really makes for alot of hassle although it does let the rotating guild kill spur of the moment lendi, doze, telk amd gozz pops that the guild who caused it probally would want  since theres nothign in north to kill and yer there.. may as well coh to lendi for a freebie St key and phat lewtZ<br>
<br>
please patch for 5 mins today heeh<br>

Oh, and Legendary, you fucked up the raids of all the guilds in the rotation, you souldnt be surprised to see them asking you for some task to complete to get a shot at Aary.

<br>
And when one of those guilds is ready for a shot at north they will be pleased if the rotation still exists as they wont have to kill aary and then wonder what the other dragons are like for a week cus several other guilds are offing the others while they are ressing and rebuffing as it is on many other servers.<br>
<br>
As for RNG clearing pog for comps : We made an agreement with EV to try aary on their next turn. the server crashed a few times EV took their turn sometime in the mess and when we tried we were unknowingly on The Companions turn.<br>
<br>
But to our credit, We did not kill, attempt to kill aary until we worked out a deal with the companions  as we were there at the time we were willing to do whatever other than leave (but we would have left if something wasnt agreed to) as long as it was reasonable and we agreed to clear most of PoG for the Companions next tunare kill at the end of the week for a 24 hour shot.. which my guild did.<br>
<br>
After we made this deal we attempted aary several times ultimately killing him and earning a spot in the rotation and subsequently killing all dragons but vyemm on our first turn over 4 days time. then we killed off nearly all of pog on friday as we  offered and agreed to do.<br>
<br>
I know this is what happened because i was there.<br>
<br>
revenge:  you are da man  lol funny yet unsubtle post<br>
<br>
Maybe you are missign the point here people. find out who is up, ask several days in advance for a shot, make an agreement with the party involved days before arry pops, then bring in yer raid when Arry pops and attempt him as much as you can stand in your alotted time.<br>

Showing up in ntov a few hours before  a rotating guild  has their raid planned, killin pets and chickens and trying arry while the rotating guild is at the zone waitign for their raid to start cohing after you die isnt your best bet on winning friends, gaining respect, or entering the rotation if you do suceed. if ya kill arry without working out a time to try him on my guilds turn we will be coming in to kill our turns pops that are left if we came to tov for a north raid cus noone asked us for a shot we are gonna kill ntov dragons. all of them.<br>
<br>
As far as i know.. we (RNG) havent made any demands for guilds wishing to try aary other than they adhere to a time limit.. of course Legos fubared their shot we WERE going to give them by totally Gimping transceneded turn and totally messing up the ntov spawn in the process. However that does not mean my guild wont give legos another chance if they ask.<br>
<br>
That question should be directed to Lilwee by your guild leader  days before Aaryondar pops I would assume to be valid so our guild can make other arrangements other than sceduling ntov for that days raid.<br>

Did they get another shot?</span><hr size=1> normally i dont post here, but i would like to clear some points :<br>
<br>
&quot;Killing tormax and yeli are decent indicators&quot;<br>
<br>
my english sucks, so maybe im reading this phrase in the wrong way (forgive me if i am) but we have killed tormax if you dont know. multiple times. we have been the first guild of tribunal to kill Tormax clearing castle, and we did it 2 times before we switched faction and started to pull him at zone<br>
<br>
&quot; I didn't spend anytime watching, so maybe Lego didn't have 4 clerics or something, but Lego wiped twice to Iky in ToV last night. Iky is probably the single easiest mob in NToV. (He's in the north wing at least. Some people only consider Aary and all the mobs past him as NToV.)&quot;<br>
<br>
yesterday we have not even attacked Iki. it was 1:30 am for most of our players (euros), like 70% of our guild was sleeping, and we only had about 25 ppl. we could have continued, but we prefered to call it a day since we all were very tired<br>
<br>
&quot; aye the ntov spawn is fubared cus legos went in after trans killed aary and screwed it all up costing trans a day and trans had only killedarry and eashen and ikky&quot;<br>
<br>
