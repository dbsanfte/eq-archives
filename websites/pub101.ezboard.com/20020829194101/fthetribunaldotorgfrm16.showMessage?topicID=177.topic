Seing that these are PvP servers, it was deemed acceptable that players should be allowed to play as random, low-lvl NPCs, and attack players. Sadly, this awesome feature was abandoned. But I did get to have some fun for the brief period it lasted. <br><br>I even met NPCs that were controlled by other players, and fought them. This was especially fun because all of those I ran into were very obviously NOT native Vallon Zek players: They totally sucked at PvP, and all their strategies were based on fighting mobs, and not players. Ie., I could circle strafe around them very easily, and joust them to death; I could easily escape them by using the terrain to hide; and they would use completely inane methods to try escape me. Being a small, or short mob was excellent also, when fighting tall, or flying mobs, because it is very hard for them to see you: death-beetle vs. zomb in Unrest, or lava crawler vs. drake in Lavastorm. <br><br>Well, here's a log I found: <br><br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:34 2001] Welcome to EverQuest!<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:34 2001] You have entered Everfrost.<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] Players on EverQuest:<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] ---------------------------<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Solipse <br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Bacco  &lt;Myth and Magic&gt;<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Wiquet <br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Gadh <br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Calmon  &lt;Halas Empire&gt;<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [3 Rogue] Berlon (Barbarian)<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Shannaq  &lt;Alluring Spirits&gt;<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [ANONYMOUS] Narcev <br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [5 Shaman] Zondain (Barbarian)<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] [9 Warrior] a snow orc trooper (Unknown) &lt;-- Yours truly!<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:49:39 2001] There are 10 players in Everfrost Peaks.<br><br>Stupid undead cretins don't like anyone:<br><br>[Thu Nov 08 00:50:14 2001] a skeleton scowls at you, ready to attack -- looks kind of risky, but you might win.<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:50:18 2001] a snow orc trooper looks upon you warmly -- looks kind of risky..you might win.<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:50:26 2001] an ice goblin scout regards you indifferently -- looks like a reasonably safe opponent.<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:50:36 2001] a wooly mammoth regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>[Thu Nov 08 00:50:44 2001] a wooly mammoth regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br><br>Finally, after eons of wandering around Everfrost (lost as usual), I reach the spot where the mammoth hunters hang out.

I pop'd in as a water goblin in Lake Rathe once, and headed over to the Aviak ramp ( 3 spawn I think it's called, but I call it the diving board. ) I found a group there, and proceded to go try to make friends with them.  I got close and started jumping so they'd realize I was not a real NPC.  They got the hint and didn't attack.  So I proceeded to help them with the birds.  Needless to say they were laughing hysterically at an uncharmed water goblin helping them fight aviaks.<br><br>Another time I was a fire beetle in paineel.  Again I was jumping because that's the only thing you could do as an NPC that might give clues that you were a person behind the mob.  Anyway, myself and 3 other beetles formed a gang simply by jumpin in front of each other.  I was their leader, and we ganked every newb that walked into the zone.  They would try to train us to the guards, but we'd stay back together just waiting for them to come back out.  I was laughing my ass off at the idea of a newbie coming in , con'ing dubious beetles then wondering why the hell the were getting swarmed by them.
