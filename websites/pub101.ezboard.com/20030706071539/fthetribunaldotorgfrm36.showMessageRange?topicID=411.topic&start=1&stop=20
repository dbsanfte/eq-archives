Al-Jazeera just said they have no idea what he's talking about and that they have no such tape.<br>
<br>
The first thought I had when Powell said that before they showed it was that it gave them a chance to make him look stupid. How much you wanna bet the tape does exist?<br>
<br>
***EDIT***<br>
<br>
BTW - I think OBL was going to voice support for the Iraqi people against the US, but I don't think it was a tie to Iraq like what they were making it out to be. There is a difference between voicing support and joining forces. <p><br>

I'm not saying Powell isn't lying, but it just strikes me as odd that everyone usually thinks that the US is the one lying, and making up fibs or fabricating stories.

<br>
a) because it's been caught time and time again doing so (Watergate anyone?) and that general public trust in any politician is at an all time low. it certainly didn't help Powell's case that the british intelligence he praised was just debunked within days after the speech as being plagiarised from year old academic sources...<br>
<br>
b) because said government being caught in a blatant conflict of interests (at several levels even...) is the last one that qualifies to appoint itself judge, jury and executioner.<br>
<br>
c) because said government is currently trashing every remnant of civil liberties while pilfering the nation to fatten an overgrown military budget (*waits to hear the screams of all the posters in the service*). i just read recently that the US is spending on defense the equivalent of all other nations of the planet combined ? anyone can confirm or infirm this ?<br>

<br>
When the Soviet Union existed, it averaged 12%.  Great Britain averaged 4.8%.<br>
<br>
I got this from an article by Lawrence Korb, former Ass. Sec. of Defense under Reagan:  &quot;...the U.S. share of the world's military spending today stands at about 35 percent...&quot;<br>
<br>
From the OMB (Office of Management and Budget) 1998 forecast, the percentage of the national budget that is spent on defense was approximately 15%.  By comparison, the various entitlement programs account for approximately 50% of government expenditures currently.  This includes nearly all forms of payments made to individuals, Medicare, welfare, unemployment, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the issue of defense spending is one which is much more complex than Shehbahn would want you to think.  It's not just about funding some gluttonous military industrial complex... it's about maintaining the highest tech, most advanced, most prepared military on the planet.  It's about being so powerful, so far ahead of any possible adversary that they wouldn't even want to fight us, knowing that they would lose.  It's about performing one of the primary, most basic functions of the federal government, and doing it better than anyone else.  And when that function determines who comes out on top in global power struggles (more often than not relying on the military), the question is not why should one support a powerful military, but why would one not support it?  <br>
<br>
It was clear enough in the Cold War; we outspent the Soviets... it worked.  So people ask now, why continue?  It's even more obvious - we are far ahead... let's stay there.  Let's keep a few generations of technology ahead of all our competitors.  There won't ever BE another arms race of the Cold War sort... we'll be so obviously powerful that it will be pointless.  And even after that, we'll still have over a trillion dollars to spend on whatever the heck we want.  It's a good time to be an American. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

But just how many Switzerlands can we have in the world?  I don't know much about the country besides their banking system is apparently great for money laundry, they make chocolate, multi-use knives, skiing is really big there, completely surrounded by mountains, and there is mandatory enlistment in the military. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It gained autonomy (not independence) through the &quot;Eternal Alliance&quot; formed by the Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden cantons in 1291, which defeated the Habsburgs at Morganten in 1315.<br>
<br>
Under the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, European countries recognized Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality.<br>
<br>
In 1798, armies of the French Revolution conquered Switzerland. The Treaty of Vienna and the Second Peace of Paris in 1815 re-established Swiss independence, and the powers participating in the Congress of Vienna agreed to recognize Swiss permanent neutrality.<br>
<br>
The Swiss, of course, did not participate in either World War and have succesfully remained neutral since the Congress of Vienna, but this is due more to qualities unique to Switzerland than anything else - its particular geography, usefulness to varying nations, the prohibitive cost of succesful invasion vs. the benefits, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
In 1997, Switzerland spent $3.2 billion (1.2% GDP) on defense.<br>

Did Al-Jazeera have the tape all along and then lie? Or more interestingly, were they telling the truth but somehow Powell knew they were going to get a tape, but it arrived late? And if Powell did know, how did he know?<br>

As to military spending, I am a firm believer in having a strong, up to date military. All the moral issues, politcal issues and everything else won't mean shit if we are attacked and can't defend ourselves.<br>
<br>
Have the best military you can and then try like hell not to have to use it is my motto. <p><br>

I guess I did what Powell did, I was pointing out the fact that pacifists/the untrusting of the US, were going to cry about war, and say that the US is so horrid and war mongering, before they say/said it.<br>
<br>
From history, it shows us that a strong military is a necessity, plain and simple.  If a country, settlement (insert name) didn't have the means of defending itself, it would be taken over if someone felt like it.  Period.  Fact.<br>
<br>
It has been shown over and over again, history repeats itself, and those not learning from the past, will simply drown and die.  <br>
<br>
The US held the stance of staying out of war, believing that it was Europe's problem.  Russia, France, Britain and on and on were screaming, pleading that the US enter the war.  But the American public said no, we want THEM to take care of this.  And so, America stood by and watched Hitler's war machine devastate and show victory after victory.<br>
<br>
Then Pearl Harbor happened, and America screamed bloody vengance and war.<br>
<br>
Do we need this scenerio to happen again?  I'd like to hope not.  If we don't help (~HELP~ for the hard of hearing) other nations keep the peace around the world, many millions are going to die from these warlords and rogue dictators.  (I'm not for going in and pressing our hand on nations that don't want it.  Is the US perfect, hell no.  Deal with it, I have, and get over whining about how horrid the US has been, and past presadence of PRIOR administration's F-ups.  Shit happens, hell, we all got into EQ didn't we?)<br>
<br>
If you don't trust the US government, fine.  But how many more 9/11's and Pearl Harbor's need to happen for people to realize that there is evil in the world, and it must be destroyed, not talked to, not spanked, not scolded... no, destroyed.  I'm an advocate of peace when possible, but this is not a time to hem and haw about blowing peace rings out our asses.  The Japanese used false pretenses of peace to lull the American people for the ability to attempt their crippling blow at Hawaii.<br>
<br>
Oh...history repeats itself. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.rochester.rr.com/zentoco/ahxsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=411.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=411.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=411.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=411.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=411.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
