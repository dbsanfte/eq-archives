By “we” I mean as a citizen of a Western nation because, like it or not, we are now all in the same boat together.<br>
<br>
The problem is this:  the Coalition forces have seized control of the air and the deserts.  They have, to date, demonstrated a complete inability to seize control of urban areas.  The sole urban area currently held is Umm Qasr which is a very small port city with a population of around 40,000 people (please correct me if that figure is wrong).  <br>
<br>
The crux is that Umm Qasr is a major strategic objective for the Coalition forces because, as Iraq’s only deep water port, it will control access for both reinforcements and humanitarian aid.  On cnn.com it is reported today that there are still “pockets of resistance” in Umm Qasr.  This indicates to me that it is likely that Coalition forces only control a portion of the city, likely the area immediately around the port itself.  <br>
<br>
Given the importance of Umm Qasr to the greater war effort, its relative small size, and the difficulty with which Coalition forces have had in controlling it, this does not bode well for larger centres such as Basra (population 1.4 million) or Baghdad (population 7 million).<br>
<br>
We have all learned from Somalia that Apaches &amp; Blackhawks have limited utility in providing support to ground forces fighting street battles.  They are capable of blazing fire lanes and wiping out angry mobs but are ill suited to dealing with small groups of combatants, especially ones wearing civilian clothing.  Fighter jets are completely ill suited to urban combat for obvious reasons unless ones objective is to exterminate all life in certain city blocks.<br>
<br>
This war has been sold to the world as a “war of liberation” for the Iraqi people.  The Coalition forces cannot engage in wholesale bombing of the civilian population unless they can successfully convince the world that the inherent character of the war has changed.  This is not likely to be an easy sell.<br>
<br>
This means that, failing a massive uprising of the people of Basra and Baghdad, the Coalition forces are going to have to fight their way through these urban centres.  Somalia taught us that you need heavy armour to support infantry in house to house fighting – tanks can blow their way through walls and shoot at angles that helicopters just cannot reach.  That being said, heavy armour isnt necessarily the solution that one might have hoped.  The Abrahms tanks are too wide to fit down many of Basra’s and Baghdad’s streets and their exhaust (which vents at the rear) can reach 1000 degrees, meaning that troops cannot effectively shelter from small arms fire behind them.  While Bradley Fighting Vehicles are smaller and capable of providing shelter, they lack the punch of the Abrahms tanks.  <br>
<br>
Before a massive uprising of the people can occur, the Coalition forces must demonstrate their capability to actually win the war.  Many high ranking Iraqis are currently sitting on the fence waiting to see which way the wind will blow.  The problem is that the majority are currently more afraid of Saddam Hussein then they are of the Coalition.<br>
<br>
This leaves the Coalition in a Catch-22 situation.  In order to demonstrate their capability of winning the war, they must seize control of a large urban centre.  They cannot seize a large urban centre without the active support of the local population.  <br>
<br>
With approximately 185,000 troops in the field, the Coalition forces are technologically superior but outnumbered.  In house to house fighting, technology provides only a limited advantage, which, in my opinion, is insufficient to overcome the resistance that will be offered by the approximately 75,000 elite Iraqi troops and additional 200,000+ regular troops plus an unknown number of civilians and party loyalists in roaming militias.  <br>
<br>
A US General has admitted that the Coalition does not currently have enough troops in the field to besiege Baghdad.  While additional reinforcements being rerouted through the Suez Canal from Turkey will help, it will still not be enough.<br>
<br>
The Coalition faces calling up additional troops from the US, UK and Australia solely to mount a siege of Baghdad.  In order to actually seize control of the city through house to house fighting, the Coalition will need, at the very least, to have the same number of troops that it used to route Iraq from Kuwait (500,000).  <br>
<br>
I don’t know what percentage of US military assets are currently committed in Iraq but I suspect that the Coalition forces would have difficulty doubling their current numbers, let alone trebling them to reach 500,000.<br>
<br>
Where does that leave us as citizens of the Western world?  <br>
<br>
Well it leaves us in a stalemate in Iraq which would be a globally destabilising event.  A stalemate would be perceived as a loss by the general public which would likely mean the end of the Bush, Blair and Howard administrations.  It would also mean a long and protracted war with great civilian suffering.  The end is difficult to predict but it is conceivable that mounting public pressure could force Coalition troops out of Iraq without having removed Saddam Hussein.  This would represent a massive loss of face for the Western world and throw into question the current unipolar model.<br>
<br>
For the sake of all of us I hope that I am horribly wrong and that the war will be swift and just.  That being said, I have deep reservations otherwise.  <br>

<br>
I do see your point that it seems that the giant US and her allies can't take a simple little town.<br>
<br>
The big BUT...is the fact that if the coalition didn't want to rebuild the country and attempt to allow the citizens realize this time we WERE there to help, and weren't going to step aside, they would just level the city, not worrying about any civilian casualties or civilian structure destruction.<br>
<br>
Any urban warfare is probably the most costly (by life) and difficult that there is.  History shows this.  Germany was repulsed in Stalingrad... I'm not sure on numbers, but I'd imagine the Russians had far more, though the German's were far superior in technological aspects.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to today...paralels can be drawn of course between US/Germany Iraq/Russia.<br>
<br>
If things don't go the way we hope (Iraqi's realize we ARE there to help this time) then there are going to be too many of the worlds boys and girls sacraficing everything for what they fight for.  Heaven help us this isn't the case, but it is a possibility of course.<br>

We simply have no desire or need to utilize that capability until necessary.  Bypassing strongholds or positions which would cost significant losses (read: more than the 20 combat deaths which we have suffered so far) is a time tested and proven strategy.  When the time comes to take control of Baghdad, we will do so.  It will be costly (again, relatively - to keep some perspective, take a look at how many Americans died per day as an average in WWII and Vietnam), but we will win.  Don't doubt that.<br>
<br>
You are right in saying that we don't have the manpower to occupy every single Iraqi city, but we simply won't need to.  Once the regime is gone, we will have two things:  international support for any policing actions necessary, and a lack of significant organized resistant necessitating any extended military occupation.<br>
<br>
German technological superiority in Stalingrad?  It was largely nonexistent, what little they had was largely unimportant.  Our technological superiority is so overwhelming and complete as to  be almost ridiculous.  Our men are better trained, better equipped, better led, better motivated, and better supported, each to several degrees of magnitude.<br>
<br>
Everyone keeps screaming, &quot;Mogadishu!!&quot; when the only similarities between that situation and Baghdad is the fact that they're both cities.  There is no civilian opposition.  Umm Qasr?  Exactly how much difficulty have we had controlling it?  Of course there will be &quot;difficulty&quot;, to expect anything else in wartime is silly.  That doesn't mean that we aren't overcoming that difficulty effectively.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point is, pray for them, but don't worry about it.  Let the military do their thing.  At this point there's nothing we can do anyway but watch and wait.  But be confident.  Cost vs. benefit dictates that we won't attempt to capture cities like Basra while there is still organized Saddamite resistance, but that doesn't mean that we are incapable of doing so.  Personally, I think we've got a lot more up our sleeves as well.  =) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 1179<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/03 8:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=544.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.woc.org/public/oneirodynia/images/srllogo.GIF height=180 width=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We have a problem</span><hr size=1> wrong forum pls! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2759<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/03 9:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=544.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We have a problem</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Everyone keeps screaming, &quot;Mogadishu!!&quot; when the only similarities between that situation and Baghdad is the fact that they're both cities.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I think you misread my references to Mogadishu Cal. I was pointing to the fact that Mogadishu shows that the US public rails against relatively minor US losses when they are not completely behind the war/action. Right now the US is near 70% behind this, so it is not a problem. However if the war takes very long those numbers could be turned on their ear and they will be screaming to pull them out, without regard for the later consequences, just like they allowed them to be sent in without regard for future consequences to the region.<br>
<br>
That being said, Mogadishu was a failure in planning and execution, not a failure because we were unable to do the job. I don't think our urban war in Iraq can be compared to Mogadishu at all tactically, as these are completely different situations.<br>
<br>
As to the rest, I agree with you. I believe our failure to control the cities we are fighting in now is a matter of holding back, not because we can't. This matter of not harming civilians is making this a very, very difficult war to fight for our troops and one of the reasons I was so much against it. A soldier should only have to worry about defending themselves and their people and completing their mission, not fighting with kids gloves to avoid political fallout due to civilian casualties.<br>
<br>
I do think there will be much more civilian resistance than expected and I do believe civilians have been fighting already, despite the claims by US officials that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> combatant in civilian clothes is a soldier in disguise. But I also think that when they discover they can't take these cities with kids gloves, they will ramp up the force used and eventually take them, even though it will increase collateral damage and civilian deaths.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately that will also ramp up the unrest in Arab states, but that was the risk going in and Bush knew it. Now we are trapped in a war that should have and could have been fought under much different circumstances.<br>
<br>
Bottom line though - I don't like the idea of sacrificing US/UK/Australian troops to fight a mickey mouse war where we are being too cautious and too nice. I hate losing civilians in war as much as anyone, but when the war is justified and not fought under the microscope we put ourselves under by being the aggressor, it does not cause the sort of reaction we have to worry about now.<br>

The problem is this: the Coalition forces have seized control of the air and the deserts. They have, to date, demonstrated a complete inability to seize control of urban areas. <br>
<br>
Incorrect.  The Coalition forces have chosen to bypass fortified urban areas in favor of a fast approach to Bagdad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sashanna:<br>
On cnn.com it is reported today that there are still “pockets of resistance” in Umm Qasr. This indicates to me that it is likely that Coalition forces only control a portion of the city, likely the area immediately around the port itself. Given the importance of Umm Qasr to the greater war effort, its relative small size, and the difficulty with which Coalition forces have had in controlling it, this does not bode well for larger centres such as Basra (population 1.4 million) or Baghdad (population 7 million).<br>
<br>
True enough but, the reason there are still &quot;pockets of resistanc&quot; is the Coalition forces are being extremely careful not to inflict civilian casualties and to minimize exposing themselves to resistance.  This is a proven urban warfare tactic that uses time as an ally to break the will of the opposition.<br>
<br>
Sashanna:<br>
A US General has admitted that the Coalition does not currently have enough troops in the field to besiege Baghdad. While additional reinforcements being rerouted through the Suez Canal from Turkey will help, it will still not be enough.<br>
<br>
Yes and No, Sashanna.  The General said that we currently do not have the troops &quot;in the vicinity&quot; of Bagdad to &quot;fully besiege&quot; the city.  This means that we don't have the people/equipment needed to completely cut off the city from the outside.  This isn't neccessary in order to cut off supplies and force the citizens/military to surrender.<br>
<br>
I have no illusions that a house to house urban fight for control of Bagdad any urban area would be easy.  We do have the capability to cut them off from any reenforcements or supplies.  That is enough in that arena to force capitulation.  It may take weeks or &quot;possibly&quot; months but the end is certain once supplies have stopped moving.<br>
<br>
Let me also say, well done.  A very well thought through analysis of the situation.  You are absolutely correct on your overall view that either way this is not going to be an easy sell to the world community.  Unless the coalition comes up with some chemical and biological weapons of war to parade in front of the cameras.<br>

<br>
The numbers on Stalingrad are sketchy but it is an accepted figure that during the 6 month fighting in Stalingrad, over 1 million Soviets and Germans died fighting in the battle.  Soviets lost significantly more soldiers than Germans during the actual battle and about 200,000 more Germans died in the encirclement (Der Kessel) and 90,000 were taken prisoner by the Soviets which was about the same thing as being dead.<br>
<br>
Germans had a bigger technological advantage by far, not because the Soviet equipment was inferior but because the Soviets simply refused to send in massive reinforcements into the city.  The reason for this is that the factories were disassembled and moved to the Urals in 1941 and only begin to produce equipment by mid 1942.  Having limited amount of equipment (and when I mean equipment I mean primarily tanks and AT guns), they didn't want to send it in piecemeal and squander it in Stalingrad.  The planning for the Stalingrad counter offensive began as early as August of 1942 when the battle began and the prevailing opinion strongly reinforced by Zhukov was that it would be better to draw the Germans into Stalingrad and then encircle them, rather than repulse them out of Stalingrad with a head on assault.  There was also the consideration that a quick and rapid encirclement would cut off the escape route for Army Group B which was the Army Group that wheeled down to Georgia to grab the oil fields.  Assaulting the Germans head on would have taken long enough for Army Group B to return to Stalingrad and reinforce the 6th Army.<br>
<br>
Germans had the technological advantage at Stalingrad and air superiority, but it wasn't the sick and disgustingly huge advantage that the US military possesses currently in Iraq.  Also the Germans had no qualms about killing civilians while trying to take over the city, which is a latitude that US Military is not afforded.  When the battle started in mid August, Germans unleashed a 600 bomber raid over Stalingrad on Aug, 23, 1942 which killed over 40,000 civilians.<br>
<br>
And finally, in Stalingrad's urban fighting, technological advantage amounted to little.  After the first month of fighting and bombing, the streets were so congested with rubble that it was difficult if not impossible for tanks to get through.  Tanks were also incredibly vulnerable to ambushes and bazookas in city fighting because they are not designed for urban warfare, they are designed for field operations, rapid advances, encirclements, etc.  Artillery pieces mean little in urban assaults unless you have consolidated your defensive positions and merely using artillery pieces to level houses where enemy troops might be hiding.  Arguably, the only time that German technological superiority at Stalingrad made a difference was air power and Soviets lost huge amounts of materiel when trying to ferry troops, ammo, food and equipment across the Volga into the city.<br>
<br>

<br>
As for urban fighting in the 21st century, I have no idea.  I think helicopters are going to prove incredibly useful for troop extraction and insertion and providing accurate air support, something which was unavailable in 1942.  Dropping dumb bombs from a bomber flying at 300 mph into a smoke filled city in 1942, trying to eliminate pockets of enemy resistance isn't exactly accurate. However, the current helicopter track record of the coalition isn't exactly encouraging.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I don't think it will come down to nasty urban fighting.  I think the Iraqis will likely fold by the time the coalition forces encircle Baghdad, simply because they have nothing to lose by surrendering, unlike the Soviets who knew that surrendering to the Germans would mean death anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

Heh, I just had a thought when I wrote &quot;end of World War II&quot; in the last sentence and thought about the Soviet assault on berlin in 1945.  I think the Battle of Berlin is a much more fitting parallel for assault on Baghdad than Stalingrad is.  In both cases, it is the capital of the regime, in both cases it was heavily bombed, in both cases the Regime is on its last legs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 365<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/03 10:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=544.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Frankly, I don't think it will come down to nasty urban fighting.

However, do not seriously think that people in the Iraqi power structure view themselves as evil or bad or anything resembling it. Everyone will try to justify their acts, as will these people, and they will for sure think they are fighting for a just cause. It is also a fact that morally they have considerable support in the arabian countries, and they know it.

Arab League calls for Iraq withdrawal<br>
<br>
CAIRO, Egypt - The United States and Britain should withdraw their troops from Iraq immediately and without conditions, and the U.N. Security Council should hold an emergency meeting on the issue, the Arab League said Monday.<br>
<br>
The coalition attack on Iraq violates the U.N. Charter and threatens world peace, the 22-member league said in a resolution that did not receive full support.<br>
<br>
Kuwait entered the lone no vote because the resolution omitted any reference to the 10 Iraqi missiles that have landed on its soil since the conflict began Thursday.<br>
<br>
Several summit delegates chose their words carefully because their nations are hosting U.S. forces. But the chief Libyan delegate, Ali al-Treiki, received sustained applause when he spoke of &quot;Iraqi heroism&quot; battling American and British troops.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to raise our heads high and salute Iraqi heroism as proof that Arab individuals are capable of confronting the mighty, the coercive and the arrogant,&quot; al-Treiki said.<br>
<br>
Al-Treiki warned delegates at the session's opening, &quot;If Iraq is to fall, many Arab countries will fall as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
The remark touched on concerns by Arab leaders that allowing the United States to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could threaten their own undemocratic regimes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 2774<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/03 12:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=544.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The remark touched on concerns by Arab leaders that allowing the United States to oust Iraqi President Saddam therein could threaten their own undemocratic regimes. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Therein lies the problem... though in the end I guess it won't matter much why they opposed us, only that they did oppose us.<br>
<br>
Egypt has been particularly critical* to US actions in Iraq and that is a huge concern imo.<br>
<br>
I just hope this gets over quickly before this situation gets ramped up.<br>
<br>

I'm not talking about their regular army, but from the republican army and upwards - those the coalition forces is about to fight in great numbers from now on. It's worth taking into the consideration that given the high level of hostility towards the US in particular, Iraqi militaries fighting coalition forces doesn't necessarily mean they're defending Hussein, but could also be towards protecting Iraq from the invasion of the nation they hate the most of all, in particular because how the US has acted for 3+ decades in the Israel/Palestine conflict.<br>
<br>
The reason for the high level of support for Iraqi troops in other arab countries isn't because any of them thinks Hussein's regime is worth fighting for, but they're fighting a common enemy. Above all they're all arabs. <br>
<br>
But as I posted, I hope I'm wrong and that the gamble the US is taking on Husseins regime imploding is successful. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
