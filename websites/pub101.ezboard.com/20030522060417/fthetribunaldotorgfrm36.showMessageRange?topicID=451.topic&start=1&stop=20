<br>
The following short article <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=19652">www.vg.no/pub/vgart.hbs?artid=19652</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> is printed in one of our papers today, the headline is &quot;Weapon inspector calls US intelligence trash&quot;. I'm just going to translate the article as it isn't long, please ignore my typos.<br>
<br>
-- snip ---<br>
<br>
It took a long time for the US to give us any intelligence information at all, and when we get it it proves to be very imprecice says a weapons inspector which wants to remain anonymous to the british paper Daily Mail.<br>
<br>
He calls the received information for &quot;trash&quot;. The information is, according to the weapons inspector, either outdated, circumstancial evidence or simply wrong.<br>
<br>
- To be honest we got better things to spend our time on than running around randomly in Iraq, guided by false evidence, he says.<br>
<br>
According to the american TV channel CBS, which also is quoting frustrated inspectors, the UN inspectors in Iraq feel squeezed between an Iraq that's misleading them and a US with an unquenchable thirst for war.<br>

Trust it about as far as I trust the National Enquirer here.<br>
<br>
That being the case, the intelligence game is not about evidence such as could be used in a court.  It has to go off vague clues and intepretation.  Adding up a lot of little facts into one big picture.  Incidents, such as catching those missiles in cuba back in the 60's that were so clear cut are far and few inbetween.<br>
<br>
However the is enough eveidence to show Sadaam has and continues to manufacture chemical weapons.  His buological and nuclear programs continue, but at a much reduced level compared to years past.  And the US DID point out those missiles that the inspectors discovered, that violated the terms of the cease-fire.  <br>
<br>
As to the pressure on the inspectors.  Of course its there.  The problem is, until Sadaam cooperates, the inspectiors will never succeed.  They are not detectives.  They are monitors.<br>
<br>
And in the end do you honestly think that unless the US had this big hammer ready to pound him that Sadaam would have even allowed inspectors in the first place?  Without 'US warmongering&quot; there would be NO inspectors in Iraq.<br>
<br>
I have problems with this war mostly on domestic/priority reasons.  Not on the justifications, which are clear.  Sadaam lost legitamacy a long time ago.<br>
<br>
My question to you.  Do you really expect to have any success with Sadaam unless you are pointing a gun to his head?   It is the only thing he resonds to.<br>

<br>
My problem is that this is what the US has been saying for months, with absolutely nothing to show for it. Repeating the same arguments doesn't make them more true. This is the essence of why the people of europe don't want to go to war, because we have seen and heard nothing but the same regurguitated rhethorics - &quot;we know that &lt;insert accusation&gt;. Whatever you think of the proof-speech Powell held for the UN security council, there's nothing left of it except the phone-conversations which don't even identify the people. Unless you count the extra 30 mins with repeated rhethorics as evidence (hey, I even like Powell).<br>
<br>
Why is it that the worlds most powerful military power is incapable of obtaining evidence of this and showing it to the rest of the world to gain support ? Shouldn't that be a task of moderate difficulty, given the low techlevel of Iraq ? Why is it Elbaradei and his pals runs around with geiger counters and similar equipment and can't find traces of his nuke program ? It's hard to conceal radiation and traces of isotopes.<br>
<br>
Doesn't the complete lack of evidence strike you as contradictory when it's presented as a well known fact that he has WMD and the question is only how to deal with it ? It this is so well known you guys should be kneedeep in evidence already given all the surveillance equipment used.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My question to you. Do you really expect to have any success with Sadaam unless you are pointing a gun to his head? It is the only thing he resonds to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The demand of disarming is completely based on the assumption Iraq has WMDs. If Iraq doesn't have (which Iraq might have, I do not know, i just haven't seen any proof indicating it has) those your whole request/demand is null and void, and nothing but an strong indication of the US paranoia. How come Iraq's neighbouring countries aren't scared shitless of Iraq and praising the US for its will to do what you are going to do regardless of proof ? They're afraid for the stability of the region IF the US goes to war, not what Iraq might do if the US don't.<br>
<br>
But of course, in USs infinite wisdom, the US always knows best, and despite the fact that even US intelligence (along with other countries intelligence, include UK) dismissed the idea that al-Qaida was connected to Iraq autumn 2002 it's still being marketed, sold and bought right now. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
Revealing intelligence publically, has the danger of eliminateing that source for the future (leaks get pluged)  Do we have to parade the number of defectors who have described in detail the WMD programs?<br>
<br>
My problem with the people seeking &quot;peaceful&quot; solutions to this is that unless Sadaam feels powere is under threat, he will not cooperate.  It all fine and dandy to seek peaceful solutions, but unless you show Sadaam that you will squash him if he doesn't comply, he won't.<br>
<br>
You want peace?  Give Sadaam a hard deadline to FULLY comply or else face war.  That is the ONLY way he will ever cooperate.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

It is so much easier to trust Saddam's word over the U.S.<br>
<br>
Walkabout, I don't know what you want from our intelligence agency. Are you upset that we don't know everything that is going on in Iraq? Or are you upset that we are not revealing all that we know to the public?<br>
<br>
You do realize that all intel agencies rely on News reports don't you. Even our own. Reporters get sources &amp; info from them just like case operatives do. Then you have Iraq, whose intel is almost totally dependant upon CNN, etc. To feed them information just to make war protestors more confused is not a wise decision. Besides, what Powell did reveal, none of you believed what you saw &amp; heard anyway.<br>
<br>
We do know that Saddam has WMD. From confirmed human sources and tapes of people talking about it. We know it from what they have ordered from other countries. That is why we had the UN resolution. Not to go find it, but for them to turn over what we know they have. But you Europeans think this is a big Easter Egg hunt or something. And if the UN inspectors don't find anything then it just simply doesn't exist. Because you believe the word of a man who has killed millions over the world's oldest democracy.<br>
<br>
Smart decision! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/DLadida.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Sadaam is already clearly in &quot;material breach&quot;.  That is not in dispute.  He is way past the deadline set in Resolution 1441.<br>
<br>
The problem is that countries like France, Germany, and Russia are playing the power game, trying to hang onto their national economic interests in Iraq while also vying for greater influence on the world stage.  What better way to do that than to show up the U.S.?  After all, if they can prevent the U.S. from doing something that is clearly and importantly within its national interest, they certainly exert influence and some control over it, no?  And this is what France especially longs for more than anything... a return to the glory days when they actually mattered.<br>
<br>
But I digress.  Sadaam is in material breach.  Now, look at the arguments made by Villepin every single time Sadaam lets up a tiny bit more on the leash - inspections are working, let's give him more time!  Think of it as a scale of 1 - 10, with 1 being throwing the inspectors out, and 10 being full compliance.  Sadaam went from 1 to 2 when 1441 was passed.  As pressure mounts, he's going from 2 to 2.25... then to 2.5... when what the resolution <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>demanded</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was FULL compliance - a perfect 10. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

The trouble is, they're standing in the way of something that needs to be done for the good of the U.S., Iraq, and the rest of the world in the process.  <br>
<br>
But I digress.  Sadaam is in material breach.  Now, look at the arguments made by Villepin every single time Sadaam lets up a tiny bit more on the leash - inspections are working, let's give him more time!

<br>
Now... just imagine what Villepin and the rest would say if the inspectors actually FOUND some weapons of mass destruction.  Never mind why, it would not matter to them.  &quot;Inspections are now working more clearly than ever!  Sadaam is being disarmed as we speak, so let us stop this foolish talk of war when diplomatic options are obviously effective.&quot;  This would be utter hogwash, of course.  The fact that the inspectors found one stockpile, with the help of the U.S. and not Iraq, would only indicate still further the necessity for war, but they would immediately spin it as inspections working.  And my guess is that Europeans and the insipid street war-protester types would buy it.<br>
<br>

Well, outside the US the US government certainly isn't trusted. 70% of the european population against the war proves that pretty well.

What powell presented was investigated to check its validity. The satellite photos proved to be controlled by others than Hussein, there is no factory or trace of a factory there. It's void. The UK report containing clear evidence he talked about proved to be based on 12 year old material, all if the report is plagiarized and contain nothing new and certainly nothing resembling evidence.

Ah, now that's interesting. Where I live it's rather common to try validate information. I would expect that checking out the alleged tunnel systems under Bagdad would be rather simple, no ? Why aren't the UN inspectors there then, if we're to trust everything the ex Iraqi informants says. Another amusing part is it seems that the only exiled Iraqis talking live in the US or UK.

<br>
It's been said before, and I'll say it again... we do not need a &quot;smoking gun&quot;.  We do not need to find and display to the world a big missile with anthrax in the tip in one of Sadaam's palaces to justify this war.  We know that Sadaam posesses such weapons.  He has refused to acknowledge this and destroy them.  Like Ladida said, it's a matter of who you believe - Sadaam, or Bush.  The choice is not a difficult one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not that we trust Hussein any more, it's just we seem to find you trustworthy at the same level.&quot;<br>
<br>
This serves to indicate your own ignorance, not Bush's malevolence.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's rather amusing to see that a larger % of europes population see Bush as a threat to world piece than Hussen. How's that for your credibility?&quot;<br>
<br>
I find it rather tragic and sad.  Many Europeans have come a long way, and in the wrong direction.  It's also interesting to see which states DO support the U.S.  Or have you forgotten about the numerous European nations which are behind us?<br>
<br>
The fact that you consider Sadaam and Bush to be on a par in trustworthiness and motivation is all the more reason to brush you aside.<br>
<br>
Did it ever occur to you that maybe we have already verified that Iraq has WMD, we just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>haven't told you precisely and exactly how?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  What evidence we have given you dismiss as contrived, faked, or mistranslated without even having the slightest bit of knowledge regarding the matter anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;1) Attack Iraq<br>
2) Check if we found any WMD, if not plant some, and claim you disarmed Hussein for the good of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are the one suffering from hysteria here, not I.  If that was our plan, why have we waited so long anyway?<br>
<br>
If you wish to argue that Sadaam is not a threat, fine.  Make your case.  If you wish to argue that this invasion will be the precursor to a Pax Americana that will hegemonize the world despite our best intentions, go ahead.  These are reasonable arguments against war.<br>
<br>
Arguing that Bush is invading Iraq for some inscrutable, unjustifiable reason, be it oil, personal revenge, or any of the other conspiracy theories lefties dream up places you square among the protestors in the streets rabidly waving their pictures of Bush with a Hitler moustache, unable to intelligently argue any point except to draw a bogus moral equivilancy between America and Iraq. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

I challenge you to come up with an Iraqi outside of Iraq who supports Hussein, and is not being bought off or a government employee.

&quot;Playwright Harold Pinter, speaking at last weekend's rally, said 'The US is a nation out of control,' and 'unless we stop it, it will bring barbarism to the entire world.' He said America was 'a country run by a bunch of criminal lunatics with Tony Blair as a hired Christian thug.' When Blair shows up in the pulpit cleaving the air with a scimitar, let me know. When US television broadcasts a speech with Billy Graham hosting an Excalibur replica from the Franklin Mint Collection, demanding the decapitation of Muslims, let me know. When George Bush grips the podium and beseeches American rock formations to give up the location of non-Christians so we can slit their throats, and it's carried live on national TV by presidential order, drop me a line. It takes a particularly rarified variety of idiot to look at a Jew-hating fascist with a small mustache - and decide that his opponent is the Nazi.&quot;<br>

You got that rather backwards. What is printed in papers is based on the judgement of the journalists, not by populism - we do as other countries have journalists with (political) integrity. Newspapers usually do have a political bias, it's not attempted hidden but rather a part of their own definition. <br>
<br>
Norwegians read more papers than any other nation in the world (japan is second) - I don't know why, but we really have a lot of them, and we're rather fond of how they work and even small regional papers prosper.<br>
<br>
I laugh out loud every time the pro wars like to remind europe about WW2. Go remind yourself about Korea every time you feel like doing it instead.<br>
