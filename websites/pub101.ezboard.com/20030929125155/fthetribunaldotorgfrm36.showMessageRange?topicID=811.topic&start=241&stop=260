That is why I think this whole marriage argument is BS. Now as I have said, if you want to grant them the rights of marriage, but call it something else, fine by me, and this seems to be what is suggested here. But can we agree that marriage by any other name is still marriage? I mean, how does changing the name to &quot;civil union&quot; suddenly make the &quot;institution of marriage&quot; safe? All it is doing is placating (or attempting to anyway) those who feel marriage is solely for straight couples.<br>
<br>
To me, this sounds like saying that smoking cigarettes is bad for you, but if we call them smoke sticks we somehow negate the damage. Hey, if that's what it takes to make gay marriages legal, it is a minuscule price to pay imo, but wouldn't you agree that is pretty silly and shows how weak the whole argument against gay marriage is? I mean... it can't be all that bad for us if simply changing the name negates any ill effects.<br>

This is the sticking point.  Slippery slope arguments can be dangerous and are hardly always true, or I'd be sliding along with the rest of the gang down the slippery Patriot Act toward a police state.  Funny, though, that you *still* insist on labelling it a &quot;cruddy article&quot; while *still* refusing to even address any of its points.  You may disagree with it, but at least, PLEASE, tell me why.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Among the likeliest effects of gay marriage is to take us down a slippery slope to legalized polygamy and &quot;polyamory&quot; (group marriage). Marriage will be transformed into a variety of relationship contracts, linking two, three, or more individuals (however weakly and temporarily) in every conceivable combination of male and female. A scare scenario? Hardly. The bottom of this slope is visible from where we stand. Advocacy of legalized polygamy is growing. A network of grass-roots organizations seeking legal recognition for group marriage already exists. The cause of legalized group marriage is championed by a powerful faction of family law specialists. Influential legal bodies in both the United States and Canada have presented radical programs of marital reform. Some of these quasi-governmental proposals go so far as to suggest the abolition of marriage. The ideas behind this movement have already achieved surprising influence with a prominent American politician.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Gay marriage has nothing to do with polygamy. Marriage would still be between 2 people. Nothing in that respect would change.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet another faction of gay rights advocates actually favors gay marriage as a step toward the abolition of marriage itself.

I've yet to see anyone with this viewpoint. I would like examples and facts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quite apart from the likelihood that it will usher in legalized polygamy and polyamory, gay marriage will almost certainly weaken the belief that monogamy lies at the heart of marriage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Why would a union between two people confessing their love, and monogamy, to each other weaken the belief that monogamy lies at the heart of marriage. The reason (I will say most, I can't speak for everyone) gay people want to marry is to show that that is the only person they want to be with for the rest of their life.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If gays had a right to marry, why not polygamists? Andrew Sullivan, one of gay marriage's most intelligent defenders, labeled the question fear-mongering--akin to the discredited belief that interracial marriage would lead to birth defects. &quot;To the best of my knowledge,&quot; said Sullivan, &quot;there is no polygamists' rights organization poised to exploit same-sex marriage and return the republic to polygamous abandon.&quot; Actually, there are now many such organizations. And their strategy--even their existence--owes much to the movement for gay marriage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I want names of these orginizations. Then I will look at their agenda and speak about it. Otherwise this is a scare tactic by the writer, with no proof.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As proof, Coles said that America had legalized interracial marriage, while also forcing Utah to ban polygamy before admission to the union. That dichotomy, said Coles, shows that Americans are capable of distinguishing between better and worse proposals for reforming marriage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Not sure if this is true, but that does say that there is no similarities between polygamy and gay mariages where the courts are concerned.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are we? When Tom Green was put on trial in Utah for polygamy in 2001, it played like a dress rehearsal for the coming movement to legalize polygamy. True, Green was convicted for violating what he called Utah's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on polygamy. Pointedly refusing to &quot;hide in the closet,&quot; he touted polygamy on the Sally Jessy Raphael, Queen Latifah, Geraldo Rivera, and Jerry Springer shows, and on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and &quot;48 Hours.&quot; But the Green trial was not just a cable spectacle. It brought out a surprising number of mainstream defenses of polygamy. And most of the defenders went to bat for polygamy by drawing direct comparisons to gay marriage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I want direct quotes and sources. Otherwise this is more drivel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The ACLU's Matt Coles may have derided the idea of a slippery slope from gay marriage to polygamy, but the ACLU itself stepped in to help Tom Green during his trial and declared its support for the repeal of all &quot;laws prohibiting or penalizing the practice of plural marriage.&quot; There is of course a difference between repealing such laws and formal state recognition of polygamous marriages. Neither the ACLU nor, say, Ellen Goodman has directly advocated formal state recognition. Yet they give us no reason to suppose that, when the time is ripe, they will not do so.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
American Civil Liberties Union is not a gay group. It's a civil liberties group. So it doesn't matter if they supported this or not. No relation to gay marriage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why is state-sanctioned polygamy a problem? The deep reason is that it erodes the ethos of monogamous marriage. Despite the divorce revolution, Americans still take it for granted that marriage means monogamy. The ideal of fidelity may be breached in practice, yet adultery is clearly understood as a transgression against marriage. Legal polygamy would jeopardize that understanding, and that is why polygamy has historically been treated in the West as an offense against society itself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And I still have no idea how polygamy will be accepted when gay couples, of only 2 people, will be allowed to have the rights that they deserve. I agree, polygamy is a bad thing. Just show me one shred of evidence, one person that may even remotely know what he is talking about say something that makes sense here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>POLYGAMY, POLYAMORY, and the abolition of marriage are bad ideas. But what has that got to do with gay marriage? The reason these ideas are connected is that gay marriage is increasingly being treated as a civil rights issue. Once we say that gay couples have a right to have their commitments recognized by the state, it becomes next to impossible to deny that same right to polygamists, polyamorists, or even cohabiting relatives and friends. And once everyone's relationship is recognized, marriage is gone, and only a system of flexible relationship contracts is left. The only way to stop gay marriage from launching a slide down this slope is if there is a compelling state interest in blocking polygamy or polyamory that does not also apply to gay marriage. Many would agree that the state has a compelling interest in preventing polygamy and polyamory from undermining the ethos of monogamy at the core of marriage. The trouble is, gay marriage itself threatens the ethos of monogamy. The &quot;conservative&quot; case for gay marriage holds that state-sanctioned marriage will reduce gay male promiscuity. But what if the effect works in reverse? What if, instead of marriage reducing gay promiscuity, sexually open gay couples help redefine marriage as a non-monogamous institution? There is evidence that this is exactly what will happen. <br>
<br>
Consider sociologist Gretchen Stiers's 1998 study &quot;From this Day Forward&quot; (Stiers favors gay marriage, and calls herself a lesbian &quot;queer theorist&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . &quot;From this Day Forward&quot; reports that while exceedingly few of even the most committed gay and lesbian couples surveyed believe that marriage will strengthen and stabilize their personal relationships, nearly half of the surveyed couples who actually disdain traditional marriage (and even gay commitment ceremonies) will nonetheless get married. Why? For the financial and legal benefits of marriage. And Stiers's study suggests that many radical gays and lesbians who yearn to see marriage abolished (and multiple sexual unions legitimized) intend to marry, not only as a way of securing benefits but as part of a self-conscious attempt to subvert the institution of marriage. Stiers's study suggests that the &quot;subversive&quot; intentions of the radical legal theorists are shared by a significant portion of the gay community itself. <br>

I think a better question is: Please explain what these great benefits are that will help society. You are the ones asking us to change societal rules so I believe the burden is on you. This is the problem when liberal and conservative values colide. On one hand we have tradition and on the other is change. Society has its traditions and sometimes they grow outdated and should be changed if the majority agree. But &quot;Queer eye for the straight guy&quot; being a big hit on cable's Bravo channel or Ellen Degeneras &quot;coming out&quot; on network TV does not equal a majority shift in traditional thinking.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Please explain why &quot;traditional&quot; marriage is such an integral part of society.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, why is anything traditional worth doing? I've been thinking about this the last couple days. I'd like to think I'm not very traditional, but then again I don't want to use a unisex bathroom if I have a choice. I like driving on the right hand side of the road. And I don't want to be introduced to another guy as someone's &quot;wife&quot;. I've been programmed against it. Sorry.<br>
<br>
I wondered what I would think if a minority of the population wanted to do away with all men and women's restrooms and make them all unisex. Or if a movement started to make medical alternatives available to allow men to become pregnent and carry a baby to term, along with making insurance carriers provide coverage. What happens when sex change operations are considered normal medical procedure and are covered by insurance? Will society be ruined? Will it be different and will I want to live there?<br>
<br>
This is all speculation, of course, and it may enlighten and advance our society beyond measure, or it may bring our entire system crashing down. I don't know. But the important thing is you are asking us to speculate when you ask &quot;why not?&quot;, and then when we do you dismiss it as a slippery slope, conjecture, and speculation. But when we ask you to list the benefits all we get is: It hurts no one. I wish I could agree with you. You don't no who it will hurt because the change hasn't been implemented. All I know is I like things as they are, and you haven't convinced me that change is worth the effort.

Anytime society shows fairness, I call that a plus. And yes, I honestly believe this is about fairness, not some massive conspiracy to destroy marriage or make polygamy legal (though I have no problem with that either - it doesn't infringe on anybodies rights that I can see).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I'd like to think I'm not very traditional, but then again I don't want to use a unisex bathroom if I have a choice.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
But what if they made unisex bathrooms for those who choose to use them? As long as they keep the same sex bathrooms for people like you, is that a problem?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I wondered what I would think if a minority of the population wanted to do away with all men and women's restrooms and make them all unisex.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I would think it is wrong as it infringes on others rights. If they want to have a unisex bathroom <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>in addition</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to men and womens restrooms, than I have no problem with it myself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Or if a movement started to make medical alternatives available to allow men to become pregnent and carry a baby to term, along with making insurance carriers provide coverage.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Depends. They pay the premiums just like everyone else, but then you have the issue of most elective procedures not being covered, so I don't see why any insurance company would be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>required</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to cover this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What happens when sex change operations are considered normal medical procedure and are covered by insurance? Will society be ruined? Will it be different and will I want to live there?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Those who have this operation are required to go through some very intense screening and with very good reason - this is a life changing event if ever there were one.<br>
<br>
If we can show that there was a screwup in the genes or chromosomes or whatever, that caused a person to be the wrong sex at birth (and I believe this does occur and will one day be diagnosed with medical procedures rather than psychological testing), then I certainly am all for correcting that problem if the person chooses that course and have no qualms with insurance covering it.<br>
<br>
If a procedure can enable a person to live a happy life and they freely accept whatever risk the procedure entails, then neither I nor anyone else should be able to stand in their way. <br>

Seriously, if a guy has 5 wives or if a brother and sister get it on (as long as they are not allowed to conceive), how does that effect you? This is the part I don't get about alot of people. I understand their dislike of certain practices, because believe me, there are alot of things people do that I don't like. What I don't understand is the desire to prohibit people from doing those things if it doesn't infringe on your rights.<br>

What about giving women and minorities the right to vote? What's next, animals getting the right to vote? Maybe inanimate objects getting the right to vote! And space aliens!<br>

I think that we should never have given women the right to vote, just in case some day space aliens get the right to vote. Nevermind the women and their rights that they are deprived of. I mean hell, why the fuck should they care. I'm traditional, I don't want women to vote. <br>

Nothing like the government telling you that YOU as a person don't have the right to persue life, liberty, and happiness, just because you like dick.

This is the crux isn't it?  I often wonder how much people can handle.  Imagine how fierce the factions would become, and yes society would split severely into factions, Traditionalists taking an even harder right turn.  But that aside it seems so pretty doesn't it?  In a Kafka-esque kinda way, hell even Henry Miller, a total loss of tradition and morals.  Like the effects of the apple finally wore off with the memory of tradition actually deciding the way.  I love it because true charachter would really shine, I wonder what we really are?<br>
<br>
Guess we'll never know, just keep getting perceptions as we slide down and whine about the decline of society.  Well maybe we will if there's a big bang of some type.  Like aliens landing, crap like that, but not even artists can't be trusted to give us a realistic view, no one can.<br>

No they do not.  The base restrictions of marriage are the same for everyone.  Mustn't be a close relative, mustn't be same sex.  Homosexuals have chosen partners outside of the criteria for marriage, so do people that fuck their siblings, so do bi-sexuals that live with same sex partners.  If you want to marry someone, you must marry someone that fits the description of marriage, otherwise just fuck'em and be happy.  <br>

Anyway, just commenting on multiple observations about your new fascination with me. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A> at: 8/6/03 9:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=largthemiserable>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 639<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/03 10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=258>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyway, just commenting on multiple observations about your new fascination with me. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

(psssstttt... when it's two people arguing various points with noone else jumping in, it's not &quot;fascination&quot;, it's just the nature of arguing.

Pssst, pay attention, will ya!  You see that big word in the sentence that precedes the one you quoted?  &quot;Unrelated&quot;?  That means the things I was addressing have nothing to do with the argument at hand, such as Wolvar's asinine comments about his daughters.  In fact, that's what I pretty much said verbatim in my previous post.<br>
<br>
Oh and I threw my &quot;ball&quot; a page back.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=811.topic&amp;start=238&amp;stop=238">Here.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  Care to respond, or are you just going to keep tossing peanuts into the ring from outside the ropes? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2219<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/6/03 11:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=260>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> I don't understand your confusion with regard to seperation of marriage and society values on an individual.  Of course they are seperate, where did I claim otherwise?<br>
<br>
The link you listed shows that it was found to be discriminatory versus race which is constitutionally protected.  It did not change the basis of marriage, merely changed who was able to endulge in said institution.  It's the same as your other examples.  None of which changed what marriage is, they merely changed who could participate.<br>
<br>
I wasn't aware that making unrelated comments was indicative of fascination.  If so, there are a lot of people fascinated with each other.  If you really wanna fascinate me tho, I told you how to do it... send me some pictures, preferably naked ones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
