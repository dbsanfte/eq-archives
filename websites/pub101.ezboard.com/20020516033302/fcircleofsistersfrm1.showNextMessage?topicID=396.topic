Can you help?&quot;<br>
<br>
With a start, Uinin jerked his eyes off of the maps splayed across the tabletop.  He stared at Tereila blankly for second, dazed.  With a sudden shake of the head, he pushed himself away from the table and began pacing the length of the cramped room.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Umm... I think.  I think, uhh...&quot; Pulling his lip thoughtfully, Uinin studied the floor. &quot;I think we've got to do something.&quot;<br>
<br>
After a moment, he blushed, jerking his eyes up to meet her questioning gaze.  &quot;Err... obviously.  We can't let this kind of thing go on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uinin lost himself in Tereila's large, doe-like eyes.  They had spent much of their childhood together, playing jangly imitations of the adults' music on improvised instruments.  Uinin clearly remembered the shame he had felt when he had tried to explain to Tereila's mother how he had accidentally crushed her daughter's fingers trying to follow her lead on the rock-drums.  He felt color rush to his cheeks at the distant memory.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahem. Obviously.&quot;<br>
<br>
He realized he sounded like a fool.  Her coy grin only exacerbated the feeling.  She shifted a map of Antonica to the top of the pile, moving around the table to stand next to him as she studied it.  The tip of her tongue stuck out from between her lips slightly as she lightly traced the mail routes marked in red with her fingertip.<br>
<br>
Uinin bent down over the map, absently rubbing his forehead as he tried to ignore the floral smell of her hair, the tilt of her chin, the tiny smudge of ink on the bridge of her cheek.  They had grown up together amidst the towering trees in Kelethin, before her family was forced to relocate to Qeynos due to her father's work with the League of Antonican Bards.  Forcing her out of his mind for the hundredth time today, he tried to focus on the matter at hand.<br>
<br>
The map painted a disturbing picture.  Mail carriers' routes crisscrossed all of Norrath, delivering everything from Kings' treaties to the poetry of star-crossed lovers.  For years, the League has supplied Norrath with every scrap of important information, only now something that disrupted that flow.  Carriers had gone missing... never reporting to their destination. Something threatened that vital flow of communication for the first time in centuries.<br>
<br>
Uinin did not possess the keen tactical mind of some of his guildmates.  He was selected for this assignment for his experience as a runner for the League, the job which fostered his early development as an adventurer.  He didn't need the wits of a Queth or Qualvin on this matter, however, the map of the incidents painted a clear enough picture.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gnolls.&quot;<br>
<br>
His upper lip curled as he spat out the gname of the foul beasts.  Gnolls had infested half of this great continent, bathing the land in the blood of innocents.  He stabbed his finger down onto the map, near where the first courier had gone missing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here.  We start here.&quot;  He pointed out several other areas on the map. &quot;Here, here, here, and here.  We strike at dawn and continue until we drive the mongrel hordes in front of us and into the ocean.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uinin straightened, staring intently on the map in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;But, Uinin, there are so few of us,&quot; Tereila protested.  &quot;One, maybe two, of these camps the League could clear.  But so many?  It would be a massacre!&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned to face his childhood playmate, now grown into a beautiful young maiden.  Flashing his widest grin, he lovingly brushed the smudge off of her cheek with his thumb while staring into here deep, brown eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have friends,&quot; he said, eyes sparkling with mischief. &quot;I have friends that can help.&quot;<br>
<br>
+++<br>
<br>
Friends and colleagues -<br>
<br>
The League of Antonican bards is facing a moment of dire crisis.  Recent aggressive activities by gnolls camps across the continent have intercepted League mail runners, disrupting the flow of information and supplies across Norrath.<br>
<br>
On behalf of the League, I beseech you to take up arms against the gnoll menace, and to help drive the flea-bitten mongrels back into the deepest depths of the underworld.<br>
<br>
The four-pronged raid will take place on Sunday, April 14th across the continent of Antonica - the date of the next regular League mail run.  When the gnolls step out, expecting to trap a few helpless mail carriers, we shall meet them with bared steel and eldritch spell!<br>
<br>
Beginning at 11 a.m. EST and continuing throughout the day, the raid targets the four major gnoll enclaves on Antonica, allowing adventurers of widely varying abilities a chance to join in.<br>
<br>
Blackburrow<br>
Gnoll Camp - E. Karana<br>
Gnoll Camp - Lake Rathetear<br>
Split Paw<br>
<br>
These are Come n' Go events... swing by, hack a gnoll, leave when you want.  I'll be setting up chat channels so that raiding parties can coordinate their efforts more efficiently.<br>

The wind picked up suddenly, sending swirling dervishes of dust dancing through the camp, snapping the banners straight.  The air was charged with electricity, both from the coming storm and from the assembled warriors around the spires.<br>
<br>
Uinin squatted atop the hilltop, staring into the heart of the coming storm.  Karana apparently gave his blessing to the raid, he thought with a sardonic laugh.  Or perhaps the coming squall was a manifestation of his displeasure.  Sometimes, it was hard to tell the difference.<br>
<br>
The camp arrayed at the foot of the hill was an impressive sight.  A small army mingled below, each preparing for the afternoon’s fight in their own way.  The Vah Shir contingent was a collective exposed nerve, ready to pounce on the hated enemies of their ancestors.  Tails twitching, the most composed of the Chosen of Vah still flexed their claws unconsciously, glaring at the direction of the Splitpaw stronghold in the South.<br>
<br>
A collection of others clustered in groups throughout the camps.  An enclave of Gnomes tinkered together a clockwork automaton by the cook fires, a whirling man-shaped toy that emitted ominous showers of blue sparks.  Sharp, twirling coils of twisted springs stuck from the joints, threatening to take the eye of anyone who inspected the jerkily dancing doll.<br>
<br>
A group of Rangers from the Ledenyetz Troupe met with their friends from the Circle of Sisters, sharing tales of reckless bravery and showing each other their battle scars.  Nearby, a cadre of Druids shook their heads sagely at the Rangers, chuckling softly as they fed bread crumbs to the chipmunks crowding around them.<br>
<br>
Dwarven fighters monopolized the brew kegs, swinging their tankards in the air and singing ribald fighting songs that brought color to the cheeks of more than one High Elf standing within earshot.<br>
<br>
The first drops of rain began falling amidst the camp as the storm rumbled nearer and nearer.  Uinin straightened, letting the rising wind snap his cloak straight behind him.  He patted his hip pouch absently, checking to see if his spare lute strings were safely wrapped in waxed canvas to protect them from the wet weather.  This day would generate a new body of work – new tales of bravery and songs of sacrifice.<br>
<br>
A thunderous boom sounded from near the mess tent, a thing pillar of blue smoke mushrooming above the camp.  A handful of Gnomes filtered into crowd, whistling innocently with their hands in their pockets, despite their soot-black faces.  <br>
<br>
Tereila sidled up to Uinin, one eye on a sooty Gnome who had started to piece together an eyeball-shaped globe, ringed with swirling blades.<br>
<br>
“All is ready, my friend,” she said, a grim smile touching her lips.  “With any luck, we will be upon them before the gnolls are aware of what has hit them.  All we await now is your command.”<br>
<br>
Tereila held out a gilded horn to the bard, the ceremonial Call to Arms.  Uinin took the instrument from her hesitantly, holding it as if it were a viper that might turn and strike him at any moment.  Glancing down at the camp, Uinin realized that every face was turned to him, every warrior awaiting his word to march to death.<br>
<br>
They would ask no quarter from their foe, and they would expect none in return.  There was no telling how many of the assembled heroes would return, how many would suffer, how many would die.  These fighters would deal death and destruction on his signal, and were willing to risk their lives to do.  Uinin swelled with pride.  They would march, and they would win.<br>
<br>
He lifted the horn to his lips and blew. A clear, strong clarion call carried over the Plains of Karana, signaling the start to the raid.  A rumbling roar rolled over the camp, and the Storm above answered in kind.<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
<br>
The Raid is upon us!<br>
<br>
We meet Sunday, April 14th to take the Gnoll’s cowardly war on the League of Antonican Bards to their vile homes.  <br>
<br>
We will assemble at the Spires in the Northern Plains of Karana at 11 a.m. ET for the initial briefing.  There we will split into groups that will proceed to the gnoll camps appropriate for their level.  There are four primary targets that can accommodate adventurers of almost any level.<br>
<br>
Blackburrow – The easiest of the dungeons, it is located in the Qeynos hills.  Soulbinders are available in Qeynos and (I think) in Surefall Glade.<br>
<br>
East Karana – On the Northern edge of the Eastern Plains is a hill that is infested with gnoll reavers.  Groups in their high teens should find these to be risky, but worth a try.  Binds are available Rivervale and the Highpass Hold (if you can find someone to bind you).<br>
<br>
Lake Rathetear – Low to mid-20s groups can make good coin in this zone.  To get to the camp, head to the southernmost edge of the Southern Plains of Karana.  The gnoll camp is right across the zone line.  I mean it… RIGHT across the zone line.  Binds are up to you.  The Gypsy camp in Northern Karana may be your best bet, unless it is possible to bind at the centaur or aviak cities.  <br>
<br>
Splitpaw – For the older adventurers, Splitpaw is a hive of loot, experience, and sudden and violent death.  I can offer no advice to anybody who wishes to go her other than to watch your back.<br>

<br>
The gnolls camped by the edge of the Rathetear were driven from their encampment, forced to flee ignobly into the murky waters of the lake.  Only now were the shattered remnants of their party slinking back to their clustered hovels.  Gnoll embalmers hurriedly dragged the mounds of corpses to the side, preparing dark magicks of untold horror.<br>
<br>
In Blackburrow, gnoll matrons kept young pups in line with hushed tales of Cronandan the Destroyer, the Scourge of Blackburrow.  Straighten up and obey the elders, they whispered, or the blue-skinned Angel of Death would again drown the stronghold in blood.<br>
<br>
In Splitpaw, Tesch'Val gnolls wandered in a state of shock.  Eyes rolling in terror at the sound of a single footfall, the spiritless curs rolled over instantly.  Gibbering about giant cats and the mighty hammers of the knee-high clerics, the Split Ear Tribe was driven to its knees in fear and shame.<br>
<br>
Across Norrath, the results were immediate.  Freed from the incursions of the vile gnolls, the League of Antonican Bards were once again free to onnect the world's peoples.  They carry words that must go through, yet again, setting Norrath's wheels of politics, intrigue, and comerce in motion once again.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all you attended the raid, it was a great blast as far as I was concerned, and i can't wait to do something like it again.  <br>
<br>
Before we go... I have a couple of awards I wish to bestow.  If you have any others you feel need to be acknowledged, please feel free to post your own.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Against all Odds&quot; Award goes to  - Razael of the Ledenyetz Troupe.  Despite being unable to group with anybody in Blackburrow, this young wood elf bravely traded blows with swarms of gnolls in the stronghold.  Way to get stuck in!<br>
<br>
The &quot;Rand McNally&quot; Award goes to - Purrcy Si'Rona of the Chosen of Vah.  Purrcy sacrificed her own adventuring in order to help lead Cronandan out of the bowels of Blackburrow... and promptly got lost on the way out of Southern Karana.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Once more into the Breach&quot; Award goes to - Cronandan of the League of Shadows.  Evil though he may be &lt;grumble grumble&gt; the man did the Tier'Dal proud, taking the storytelling aspect of the raid and running with it.  His chat channel descriptions of the carnage and destruction were masterful... I wish I had the foresight to have logged it.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Schoolboy Howler&quot; Award goes to - Me, sadly.  Even before the Raid started I managed to concoct a remarkably stupid way of dying.  While binding at the gypsy camp in Noth Karana, we were attacked by a Griffon.  Naturally, we led it over to the tower, where Guard Blakely could take care of it for us.  WEEEELLL, I decided to try and &quot;help&quot; the Guard by getting into the act as well (and if I could garner the XP and loot by sneaking in the last shot, that was a bonus).  Erp.  I was targetting the Guard.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Ding!&quot; Award goes to - Faettena of the Ledenyetz Troupe.  Part of the Lake Rathetear group, the spunky Halfling ranger reached the all-important 20th season milestone.  All hail, Faettena Hystrung!<br>
<br>
Special thanks as well to Grash, Losha, Daaxr, Rakash, Darai, Aadmer, and all of the others who participated in the event!<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for the next event... <br>
