<br>
You have just shown that you do NOT have a dman clue about the issue at the Michigan Law School.<br>
<br>
They are NOT IN ANY WAY ADMIDTING UNQUALIFIED STUDENTS.  Race is used as ONE factor in many, and by rules placed from the ruleing of a previous court case, it cannot be the PRIMARY factor.   What IS happeneing is if applicants are basically equal in all other areas, the &quot;minority&quot; student is given a small advantage that tips the scales in thier favor.  This advantage is not enough to give them preference over other applicants whose qualifications are clearly better.<br>
<br>
Now I do think that the issue of useing race as a factor in ANY manner needs court attention, but don't go makeing assumptions or false accusations over it.  So the only &quot;whites&quot; who are being blocked form the School by this policy ARE NO MORE QUALIFIED THAN THE MINORITY STUDENTS WHO ARE ACCEPTED.  The question is, when all other things are more or less equal, can race then be used as a decideing factor?<br>
<br>
These students still have to pass thier classes and still have to pass the bar no matter how they got in any case. <br>
<br>
It is also questionable whether race had anything to do with the Blair incident, as more and more reports of white reporters are surfaceing that are pretty dman similar.  This points to a serious problem in the journalism field, but race doesn't seem to be at issue.<br>

<br>
Yes, some of the applicants who get the race exemption at Michigan are qualified for admission to lesser schools. But compared to the applicants who are not admitted, due solely to the admission of less-qualified applicants who get a race-based pass, they are unqualified for admission to the law school. If race was ignored, they would not get in. Students who do not get in are not qualified to get in, obviously. Michigan explicitly favors racial diversity, arguing that it provides an 'advantage.' <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Q3. Why does the Law School take an applicant's race into account?<br>
<br>
A. Because having a racially diverse class enables the Law School to do a better job of preparing students to be effective lawyers. Students are exposed to classmates who have had different life experiences, and their prior assumptions are challenged. Whenever an applicant's file reveals that he or she might add to the diversity of perspectives that are voiced in class, that helps the applicant's chances of admission.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Q5. If the Law School could obtain a diversity of intellectual perspectives within an all-white class, what additional educational benefit would be provided by consciously seeking to have racial diversity as well?<br>
<br>
A. Race continues to be a uniquely important factor in American life. When individuals meet on the street, when they decide where to live, when they decide whom to befriend, when they decide whom to work with, race matters. A well-trained lawyer should understand how the experience of race can influence people's perceptions of our nation's legal, political, and economic systems.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Your argument is that Michigan builds this diversity only when there are ties based on academic qualifications? Michigan is telling us that this isn't the case in their answer to Q5.<br>
<br>
I understand exactly how their system works.  You can attempt to sugar-coat it with language like admissions offices or employers use (&quot;Thank you for applying. We had many more qualified applicants than we had openings. Good luck at a lesser school.&quot;) but that's all that is -- sugar coating.<br>

Stephen Glass.  That is all.  His case is also markedly different - he knew how to beat the system, he worked it, he tried.  Blair was just lazy and reckless.  He got ahead anyway, he got promotions anyway.<br>

<br>
Howell Raines is the man in charge of the New York Times.  Race <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the factor.  Case closed.<br>
<br>
And Radgen - the admissions system gives minorities a large number of &quot;points&quot; in the system based solely on race.  These are the same points that are given for high test scores, a good essay, etc.  It is therefore very much possible that non-minority students who were actually better qualified were passed over in favor of minorities who may have been less qualified.  That is how the system works. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 5/16/03 5:16:09 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 751<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/16/03 8:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> It isn't a &quot;large&quot; number of points.  It is not enough to overcome any serious lack in qualifications.  It is enough to give them an edge over others of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>equivilent</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> qualifications because of thier race.  I sadi race was a factor, but it is a SMALL factor and not enough to overcome serious lack in other areas.  It is questionable if this is acceptable and why it is before the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
But that is NOT what Sop said, the accusation was the system was accepting unqualified applicants.  Thats is patently untrue.  Even in its most unfair and onerous versions, affirmative action was NEVER meant to bring in unqualified people.  The question has always been, is useing race/ethnicity as a basis fair, no matter the &quot;good&quot; reason.  <br>
<br>
A number of former military generals have filed a legal brief supporting the U of Michagan this week.   It is not such a cut and dried issue.  In a perfect world, we would be blind to race/ethnicity, but we don't live in a perfect world.  That being the case, what is the governments role?  Texas had a interesting solution.  I think the top 10% from EVERY Texas HS are automatically accepted into state collages.  This has no racial standard but because a lot of Texas schools are majority white or hispanic or black, it in effect does the same thing that considering race as a factor did in maintaining diversity.   <br>
<br>
Now to the NY Times,  Glass is not the only one.  Not by far.  Blair had a bad record, but he is NOT the only one at the NY Times with such a record.  I do think the NY times has a serious editorial/supervision problem.  They have a handful of reporter's who seem to be less than vigilant about getting all thier facts straight.  Till he got caught outright lying in a story, Blair's record was NOT the worse one at the NY Times.  It worries me more that his supervisor IS blamming race, its a copout.  The editors are not doing thier jobs very well over all at the NY Times and other media outlets (probably due to the time crunch on news these days)<br>

This advantage is not enough to give them preference over other applicants whose qualifications are clearly better.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, the case is quite significant, and the &quot;reverse&quot; racism is quite relevant as well.  The whole case being brought up, if you take a look, shows the GPAs of the two students and the difference was somewhere around .6 .  Now, I don't know about other universities, but at UofM .6 difference in GPA is the difference between getting into Lockheed and Microsoft compared to barely getting into ANY software company (example: 3.7 vs 3.1).  I know this because two of my friends are direct examples, one had a 3.6 and the other had a 3.2 and thats what happened to them.  So, if one person has a GPA that is .6 higher than the other person, but the lower GPA person gets in because of race then that is EXTREMELY unfair.  And actually, that is what happened in the law school, which is why so many bafoons are running around at the diag right now asking people to sign affirmative action forms, show up at court cases (thinking it will make a difference, which is a laugh) etc etc because they know the case is just shy of declaring the case a success for the person with the (significant) higher standards.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, UofM just recently in the past few years had to change its acceptance policies because there were &quot;slots&quot; reserved for minorities and even if not enough minorities applied for those slots, the school would go out and hunt for minorities that were way underqualified (barely able to do community college) to take those slots.  Why?  Because the federal and state governments offer money to a school for meeting a quota of a certain number of minorities of each type into their school.  Those quotas HAD to be met to get those funds, even if not enough people applied.  That policy got changed quick though.  Now they just give you 15 free points for being a minority on a 150 points-possible scale (the people with the highest points are accepted).  15 out of 150 is 10%, and 10% IS a large amount of points to be guaranteed.<br>
<br>
I have to point out that this 150 point scale also favors schools that are known to be rich, and well prepped schools.  Depending on the highschool you go to, you can be awarded up to 10 points on this 150 point scale.  My school happened to be 2 points for me (horrible) while there are 3 schools in the state that receive 10 points (2 of which are in the bloomfield hills area, 3rd richest area in the nation so I'm told). This is also wrong because they are public schools and personally I think state education funds for public schools should be pooled together and evenly distributed based on student enrollment in the high schools.  If you want a better education for your kids, go to a private school.  Publicly, it should be evenly distributed.  So, I also have problems with the opposite end of the system as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How many points does it take to pass the requirements at the school?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Its not a matter of minimum requirements.  Its a matter of wolf eat wolf, who has the highest.  Once enrollment is filled (which it always is, UofM is decently tough to get into) all the rest are cut off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My view is that any applicant who would have been denied admission but for their race is unqualified, by definition.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is absolutely not true.  Almost every person that applies to the law school at UofM is someone who thinks they have a chance at getting in, which means they are pretty much all qualified (i would say 100%, but who knows if some nut that is insane and dumb applies, outliers suck).  They all qualify.  Its wolf eats wolf, not a &quot;minimum requirement&quot; standard.  That is why this matters.  There are people from inner city schools (whites as well as blacks, which is why i hate affirmative action) that come from horrible backgrounds and nasty schools that don't achieve &quot;as well&quot; as the richies because they haven't had the educational prep for it, but they usually fair well here and are able to graduate and meet the &quot;minimum requirements&quot;.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

You can't determine how much of a factor race is playing, if you don't know how much weight it has on the process.  But like someone earlier said, no matter what, if someone is getting in over others solely based on their race... that's wrong.<br>

<br>
Advocates of affirmative action want to effect their conception of &quot;racial equality&quot; through a rebalancing of society along racial lines.  They see no problem with judging individuals based on their race, in order to accomplish this goal.  They justify this racial exclusivity on the grounds that existing inequalities demand counterbalancing inequalities of the opposite nature in order to right the balance.<br>
<br>
People, such as myself, who oppose affirmative action, believe that judging a person according to their race is absolutely wrong under any circumstances.  I believe that people should be judged based on their personal merits and knowledge, and that once we, as a nation, become accustomed to a lack of racial judgement, the &quot;balance&quot; will right itself as a system based on merit takes the place of old racially based systems.  The &quot;balance&quot; will not be righted overnight - but then, it is not being righted overnight either by the affirmative action response, either.  We have already passed laws against the egregious and institutionalized forms of racism in our society; now it is time to let social forces do their work to eradicate racism, rather than attempt to engineer it ourselves in attempts which can exacerbate existing problems and even create new ones (Jayson Blair, etc.)<br>
<br>
I can understand where those who believe the former are coming from, I simply believe that they are honestly misguided, and generally do more harm than good through their actions.  I speak in broad terms, here, of course, and from a viewpoint that is admittedly rather idealistic. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 5/16/03 1:17:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 285<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/16/03 2:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=685.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative action bites the Liberal hand that feeds it</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is the average admission score of those actually admitted?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
