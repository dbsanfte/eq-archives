Hmmm...<br>
I think I have stage fright now :-)<br>
I like to explore new places and cook things.  I would love to meet new people, but...  I am a gnome.  People ignore me.  I guess most folks have a hard time spotting me.  Especially the high elves.  They are so snotty!  I can't believe they are supposed to be the most intelligent race in the whole of Faydwer.  Tall like that, they must be banging their heads on ceilings all the time!  Oh, I am so bitter.  Please forgive me high elves.  I love you! :-)<br>
<br>
So no one really speaks gnomish in Faydwer, except gnomes.  But I think all that time we spend tinkering with gizmos interfere with our mating.  Gnomes make very few babies.  Much fewer than orcs, wood elves or other pests.  Whoops.  My bitterness shows up again.  Please forgive me wood elves.  I love you! :-)  Anyway...  Very few people speak gnomish in Faydwer.  That means I spend a lot of time talking to myself.  Not good, not good at all.  That made me a little wazoo, as the content and tone of this message should clearly demonstrate :-)<br>
<br>
It's like when I try grouping in Crushbone.  At first, not being able to speak elvish and often being the only gnome there seemed like a difficult obstacle.  But, full of resolve and bog juice, I kept trying anyway.  This is how I discovered something very important about the elves:  They always give up eventually!  Even now that I can understand what they tell me, I keep pretending I don't.  I spot a group I feel is worthy of me, hail them in gnomish and if they are unwise enough to acknowledge my presence, then I just keep acting like I believe they invited me to join their group :-)   I thank them, I bow, I do all sort of fake good manners and such.  If they tell me: &quot;You meard wlong&quot; or something similar, I reply, &quot;Oh, I clicked on the wrong button!  Please, invite me again!&quot; or something similar.  Of course, all my replies are always in gnomish.  It's been a blast to find groups in Crushbone :-)<br>
<br>
You may ask (please do, in the language of your choice, in group chat and over and over again), &quot;Did it take you long to get them to invite you?&quot;.  Yes.  Sometimes it did.  But I believe that's what pick pocket is for.  Killing time.  While the group I would eventually be a part of (even if they didn't know it yet) kept orcs busy, I would keep myself busy practicing roguish tricks on these same orcs.  Hey, legionnaires have gold!<br>
Anyway :-)<br>
<br>
You may wonder why I'm telling you about all this.  But I hope you won't, because I'm not so sure myself.  I think it has to do with the fact tonight, one of your guild member (I believe her name is spelled Rowinya) asked me if I was interested in joining the Circle of Sisters.  Wow.  That has been a shock for me.  I'm still shaking :-)  No, seriously!  It took me some time to believe this is what she actually asked me.  I kept reading over and over the garbled elvish on my screen.  I thought for a while maybe she just offered me wolf steaks and I misunderstood.  Everything's possible!<br>
<br>
I only met a few members of your group so far, but I remember some of your names, like Nullo, who taught me elvish, Titaisia, who looked very hairy, Raen who taught me to grunt like humans while we took the boat to Freeport.  I did not even have to ask Raen, she offered it to me!  I never remember names and guild symbols  usually, but yours I did.  Somehow, in my head, Circle of Sisters now means &quot;Bunch of nice people who will teach me languages&quot;.  That makes me love you so much :-)  Thank you thank you thank you :-)<br>
<br>
I don't know if I could and should join your guild though.  I think the Circle of Sisters has a very good reputation.  I probably could use this for my own benefit!  It is very tempting ;-)  But the fact I admit this temptation freely is probably a sign I'm trying to resist it.  You have so many rules.  It is a daunting task to look at them.  I think the worst part is I won't be able to say I did not get it because it was not in gnomish ;-)<br>
<br>
If you are very patient, I think I would love to join you :-)<br>
But I'm probably going to take a long time to do everything that has to be done to become a full member.  <br>
I should probably tell you I can talk a lot when allowed to also...<br>
But, until whatever happens, I was wondering...  Can I be your friend and learn more languages and stuff from you?  <br>
Pleeeaaasse :-)<br>

<br>
&quot;Enter freely and of your own will, and may you leave some of the happiness you bring behind&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi!  I'm Morgen Ayanamii, Lorekeeper of the Circle.  I saw the letter you had the bard post here in the Guest Hall.  Come in, come in, it's safe, no worries, we'd be glad to ea. .err. .serve you dinner. &quot;<br>
<br>
Morgen bounces around the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so glad to meet you.  The forms for application are in the other room, please fill them out in quadruplicate and send them per instructions to our Mistress of Initiates, Lessa.   After that you'll be ensl. . . err. .mentored for a bit, and then, if you like, we'll send you off on a sui...errr. .Test of Sisterhood.  Don't pay me no nevermind, now. . .where would you like sit?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll be our first gnome in the guild, I believe.  Ha.  That Darai of Ledenytez Troupe, what does *she* know?  She said she'd get all the good short folk, gnomes, dwarves, halflings, wood elves. .. and here now are you.  At least I hope you're good. . .or neutral. . .you don't mind if I dissect your brain to find out do you?&quot;  (casually looks at you over her shoulder). <br>
<br>
Morgen is putting something on a platter for you, and gathering some eating utensils..... &quot;What?  Oh. .but *I'm* a gnome?  No no. . I'm not a gnome. . .look here&quot;  She wriggles her nose and suddenly a colorful Iksar is standing there, offering you the platter, &quot;Here. .would you like a wolf steak?&quot;, grinning at you with that dolphin grin of theirs....<br>
<br>
**************<br>
OOC translation:  Welcome to our guildhall.  We'd love to have you apply.  We really need more gnomes, 'cause they're great!, and especially since we only got Melli and maybe a wood elf somewhere to represent short folk.  Make sure after you apply that you're registered on www.guildmagic.com and here (duh) at the ezboards (which you have obviously already done, so you're a step head).  In game, try to find an elder.  If you are uncertain whether we are the folk you want to be with, Ledenyetz Troupe is a wonderful place to check out.  But Darai gets too many of the cool gnomes, and I want us to have that happiness as well.  Oh, and I do in fact speak perfect Gnomish.<br>

That question in the application can have an answer as simple as you like it to be.<br>
<br>
And you are not STUCK with that answer either. Backgrounds can change over time. So apply now, start having fun and fill in the details of your background as you go.<br>
<br>
That is what most of the rest of us did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelenoreravensong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elenore Ravensong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#660000>(1/18/02 10:19:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=228.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://freehost.baypal.com/images/Elenore%20Ravensong/animraven.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_shocked.gif" align=absmiddle>  Yes, please apply</span><hr size=1> Yes, please apply!

I'm sorry Savah, I didn't want to make you cry. *comforts Savah*  I had no idea roasting bear steaks was making you sad...  But I want to change and be better, so I promise I will never do it again.  My time of roasting bear meat is done!  From now on, I will only smoke it!  Heck, I might even try boiling it :-)<br>
<br>
But no more bear steaks, I promise :-)<br>
<br>
Poor Titaisia...<br>
Norrath is full of rude people calling you hairy instead of furry and I'm one of them.  I will try to amend myself.  Oh yes.  I wall call you furry from now on.  Because it would be the polite thing to do.  But also because, well heck, you're SO tall and scary!  I'm afraid if I call you something else than furry, it could unleash your fury :-)<br>
<br>
It would be a honor to meet you Elenore.  I enjoy greatly the company of paladins.  Most of them are very brave.  One could almost say they have a death wish.  It's always a pleasure to compete with a paladin over who will die protecting the group's retreat :-)  I did the same thing to a huge barbarian warrior on a hunt lately.  He didn't seem keen on having a female gnome cover his retreat ;-)<br>
<br>
Nysa, I followed your suggestion and sent an application.  I even got a reply from Lessa.  I'll figure out what to do next, but I think eventually I'm going to need a mentor.  This might prove difficult.  I'm thinking I should learn human or elvish better as a preliminary step.  Anyway :-)<br>
<br>
I would like to end this post with a general statement about the under-rated sex appeal of gnomes:<br>
Yeah...<br>
But we have very cute pointy ears :-)<br>
I wish laughter and luck to all of you :-)<br>
