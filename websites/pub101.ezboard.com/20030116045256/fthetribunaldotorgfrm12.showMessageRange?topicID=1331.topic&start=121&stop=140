<br>
I agree, but it's all in the method you use. Right now with this welfare reform, we are actually punishing poor people and making it harder for them.<br>
<br>
People with children should not have to work over 40 hours a week. What happens to the kids who don't see their parent? They end up in a life of crime and then the welfare cycle repeats.<br>
<br>
We need to actually help people and set them on the right track, not punish them by bussing them out of town and forcing them to abandon their children. That is more expensive in the end and doesn't say much about our attitude as a scoiety.<br>
<br>
I don't think anybody wants to give people a lifetie long free ride. The question is how do we prevent while still giving people the respect and dignity they deserve. How do we do it without punishing innocent children for the crimes of the parents?<br>
<br>
Many, many people are one check away from welfare. Be careful what precedence you set because someday it may apply to you. <p><br>

<br>
If Rynnia's and Hayzen's accounts are accurate and I see no reason why they would lie - then I'm sure the poor are really feeling punished by being handed free money and driving around in Pathfinders.  Punishing them would be telling them to fuck off and go earn their money or die in a ditch somewhere.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>People with children should not have to work over 40 hours a week.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And on the flip side of the coin, people who need to work 40 hours in a week to support themselves, probably shouldnt be having kids to begin with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't think anybody wants to give people a lifetie long free ride.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

But that is exactly what happens.  You cannot give money away and then tell people in the mean time to go find jobs while continuing to hand them free money.  They may be uneducated, crude and boorish clods but even they understand that sitting on ass at home while getting money is better than working and getting same money.  You create a dependency on the state (which is what the Dems want anyways, har har) and you merely propagate the cycle.  One generation of America already went through welfare, I mean how long does it fucking take to climb out of the hole?  <br>
<br>
The correct thing to do (and I love my fellow man, dont get me wrong) is to kick his mooching ass to the curb and dismantle the entire welfare system.  I think its called &quot;tough love&quot; or something...<br>
<br>
Hell, by the way Hayzen and Rynnia make it sound, even I am tempted to go on welfare.  Or better yet, go on welfare and then work for one of the local companies in Chicago that pay under the table. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1731<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 12:13:35 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hell, by the way Hayzen and Rynnia make it sound, even I am tempted to go on welfare.

If it sounds too good to be true it probably is.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but there is more to those stories than meet the eye. I know people on welfare in my state and none of them are living the life of Raleigh. Maybe their state is alot more generous than mine, but Maine is pretty liberal with a higher min wage than most of the nation, so it seems strange. <p><br>

Ie.. retarted, and physically handicapped. Or those that are inbetween jobs unable to make ends meet.  Should not be used for a life time support system of some lazy ass fuck who pops out as many kids as possible to collect more money and let the children run the streets in rags bound to become our next wave of criminals and welfare mouchers.  I believe alot of those coming up with extra money are pushing drugs on the side or getting it from other under the table means.  I have seen them big fat 400pd people that eat and live better than most of America's hard workers.  <br>
<br>
  When I was in high school I worked at a supermarket.  There was a woman there that was trying to raise 3 kids.  I assume her husband walked out on her but never asked.  It was a small town mostly white; and she was a woman and black.  She worked 3 jobs and still couldn't make ends meet.  She still qualified for food stamps.  How degrading that must be.  She did not use drugs, smoke or have extravagent things.  She was and is (saw her still there when I went back to my home state last week) a hard worker.  I have no idea if she is still on food stamps but surely welfare isn't the only problem we are having.  How is she to get a better education when she doesn't even get 8 hours sleep a night?  And would it really matter in a small town like that?  How is it that a person can have 3 jobs and barely make ends meet?<br>
<br>
 Is Welfare fucked?... YES!  I think we need to fix other things before we can leave people to die in a ditch.  Imagine if some of our tax money actually went to pay off the debt instead of the politicians.  Imagine if we actually spent trillions of dollars on our debts and country, instead of giving it to other countries for &quot;humanitarian relief&quot;.  How much less tax could be taken out and used for those who earn it to make ends meet?  Once we get to the point where a person could live off minimum wage; then I say let them work or die in a ditch.<br>
<br>
 Maybe a ,mean time, solution would be to estimate the welfare recipients worth (tally cars, cloths, cable,grocery bills etc...) If they are living above the poverty level cut thier oxygen stealings asses off and hope to find them in a ditch the next week.            <p> <HTML><BODY>

I'm sorry, but I lean to the left in my politics and even I realize that welfare needs to be dismantled.  Why?  Because it causes more problems than it solves. <br>
<br>
There is no incentive or motivation for a welfare recipient to get a job because the pay would roughly be the same as their welfare check.  But hey, if you sit on welfare and get that very same money for doing nothing - why not remain on welfare perpetually?<br>
<br>
The only incentive or motivation you can provide to get a job is for those people to be starving on the streets somewhere.  That will get them moving.  Or they die.  Both outcomes work, really...<br>

As for you Loegan, Soprena is right on the money about you.  While everyone here is a Realist in one form or another and understands that welfare keeps people in the perpetual cycle of poverty and dependence... you on the other hand are an Idealist who has absolutely no regard for people's hard work and money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flasshgordon>FlasshGordon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F is for Friendship.</span><br>  Posts: 1052<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 3:59:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Yes, ladmo, but who would be the slaves to the mentally incompetant slaves of the poor people??! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1740<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 4:06:49 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> You are certainly entitled to your opinion Merton, but it's no biggie cause there are alot worse thing to be called than an idealist imo. <p><br>

I face a future of living under a government strongly allied to George Bush, who is now free of the Democrat safeguard in your Senate. As a belligerent, aggressive leader he is going to seriously piss the terrorists off. Maybe that's what you wanted, but I don't believe it will solve anything -- same as in Israel, both sides will attack more and be attacked more, but neither side will win or lose.<br>
<br>
With our huge borders and small population/military, Australia is a soft target for terrorists, recently hit hard in Bali. We are right next to the world's biggest Islamic nation and I wouldn't be surprised to see us lose a city to a nuke or something. I fear the consequences of Republican domination in your country.<br>

Having a parent who busts their ass to make a success of themselves will have every bit as much of a positive influence on children as any negative impact their being away from home those extra hours will have.  Personally, I work 11 to 12 hours a day on a normal schedule, and much more during tough times, my only regret is that I'm a wimp compared to my father who is truly a hard working man.  Hell, you don't even discuss a decent job in terms of $ per hour, and being salaried is just a nice way of saying you'll be working more than 40 hours a week.  By the way, I have 2 great teenagers who I have no doubt will be very successful in life<br>
<br>
All this focus on wages is a waste of time, buying power is what matters.  Others have already said it, and probably said it better than I could, but raising minimum wage would be a disaster.  It's all supply and demand, setting an artificial price throws it all out the window, nothing but inflation comes from imposing higher minimum wages.  Just look at the hell unions have played on the economy.  Yep, great for the people who are in them, at least in the short term.  <br>
<br>
There is a serious misconception that businesses have money, you would be hard pressed to find many that aren't running on borrowed funds.  If they are traded in the stock market, they are only there for 1 reason, they needed money so went public to raise it.  I've seen unions hold companies hostage, millions in raw materials on the floor all of it on borrowed money, if it isn't turned into product, and turned into product quickly the company goes under, they are forced to pay whatever it takes to get people back to work.  I've also seen a Union get destroyed, and laughed my ass off, maybe they should have noticed that there wasn't any material on the floor before they walked out, hell, if they hadn't walked there wasn't a damn thing for them to do.  All those people getting paid $25 an hour to do a $10 job, and all those $200K houses they had bought that should have been $75K if it wasn't for their inflated wages inflating housing and everything else right along with it.<br>
<br>
Raising the minimum wage would have the same effect.  Very short term happy people, short term inflation, a couple years until business fold under the excessive cost of operations, and long term unhappy people who lose their jobs and then their over priced homes.<br>
<br>
In general, welfare should be a function of the church, not of the government.  Things fall into 2 categories, they shoudl be taxed or subsidized.  Those things that are profitable and bad for society in general should be taxed, IE: tobacco, alcohol,  things that are generally seen as good for society, but are unprofitable should be subsidized, IE: museums, historic landmarks, military.  Where we get all fucked up, is we somehow have deemed financial success undesirable and tax the hell out of it, and at the same time have decided that having non contributers to society is desireable so we subsidize them.  It's absurd to the point that it's sickening, I have an uncle who has never worked a day in his life, and he just laughs at all us poor dumb fucks who go to work every day while he goes hunting or fishing.<br>
<br>
As long as we continue to subsidize the lazy non contributers they will continue to thrive, welfare is a career choice these days.  As long as bleeding heart liberals continue to whine about the plight of the poor and throw in a few &quot;think of the children&quot; pleas for good measure they will continue to have  poor people to vote for them so they can continue as an entity.<br>
<br>
Simple solution, get rid of welfare, people will get jobs or starve, either way the problem is solved.  As a bonus, we won't have to listen to the phone calls from democrats because they will be out of business. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/6/02 7:29:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I belive what hes trying to say grozzer is that they will hit you whenever they can, No matter what you do.

Australia has stood with the United States in every war we have fought since WWI - not just the big ones, but the little ones too.  You guys fought with us, and now suffer with us as well.  We owe you all a great debt of gratitude, and I grieve with you for Bali.<br>
<br>
I, however, do not see Bali as reason to break these ties with the United States and our efforts against terror and Islamic fundamentalism... if you succumb to the fear of &quot;what will they do next?&quot; ... then they have just won.
