<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The War's New Front<br>
<br>
By BRIAN BENNETT I TIKRIT <br>
<br>
When Fayek Kudayar Abbas quit his job translating for U.S. troops at the end of May, he thought the threats against him and his family would end. Abbas had worked for the Americans because the $40-a-week salary went a long way toward taking care of his wife and daughters. At first he tolerated harassment from some of his neighbors, who accused him of betraying his country by cooperating with the occupying forces. But as resistance to the U.S. intensified, Abbas found himself in even greater danger. A month after he stopped working with the Americans, his name showed up on a list of &quot;traitors&quot; being circulated among anti-U.S. insurgents. Then a grenade exploded in his garden, and someone scrawled abbas must be killed on the wall of his home. <br>
<br>
Abbas, 58, was standing last week in an alley a block from his house in Samarra, 20 miles south of Tikrit, when two men with red scarves wrapped around their heads turned the corner on a black Jawa motorcycle. One of them shot Abbas in the leg and sped off. Abbas lay bleeding in the alley for an hour until an ambulance arrived. None of his neighbors went to his aid. &quot;They were frightened,&quot; he said later from his hospital bed, his right leg bandaged up to his waist, &quot;that maybe they would be the next on the list.&quot; <br>
<br>
With U.S. forces trying to close in on Saddam Hussein and a new Iraqi governing council trying to assert its authority, armed insurgents are expanding the scope of their attacks to sow fear among ordinary Iraqis and discourage them from cooperating with the U.S. The targeting of civilians escalated to terrifying new heights last Thursday, when at least eight and as many as 19 people were killed and more than 50 injured in a car bombing of the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad—the deadliest incident of any kind since the fall of Saddam's regime. Though senior intelligence officials say they don't yet know who was behind the blast, Lieut. General Ricardo Sanchez, commander of allied forces in Iraq, declared it the work of terrorists. A senior intelligence official tells TIME that among the suspects is Ansar al-Islam, a group of Islamist fighters—Iraqi Kurds and Arabs—with suspected links to al-Qaeda. &quot;They could be among those possibly involved,&quot; the official says. <br>
<br>
While many Iraqis expressed outrage at the perpetrators for attacking a civilian building, the bombing seemed to have fueled just as much bitterness at U.S. forces for failing to prevent the attack and coming too late to rescue the victims. Minutes after the blast, looters ransacked the embassy, tore up the Jordanian flag and stomped on a portrait of Jordanian King Abdullah's father. By the time soldiers from the 1st Armored Division arrived, some 30 minutes later, the crowd had turned hostile. &quot;Screw you, Americans!&quot; screamed a young Iraqi in a white T shirt. &quot;Screw you!&quot; <br>
<br>
Though that kind of anti-American rage is by no means universal among Iraqis, officials fear that the rising militancy of those opposed to the U.S. may be dissuading them from assisting U.S. troops, sharing intelligence on the whereabouts of Saddam's loyalists and collaborating in the rebuilding effort. According to Titan, the company that manages the translators for the U.S. military, at least a dozen translators have been killed in the past month by anti-American militants. Other translators hired by U.S. troops say they lie about their jobs for fear of reprisal. When Aymen, 36, an interpreter for the 3rd Infantry Division's Task Force 27 in Baghdad, walks out of the Army compound, he hides his U.S. military ID under his shirt and tells his friends he works in construction. &quot;What if my wife goes to the market and is kidnapped?&quot; he asks. Firas, 24, another translator working with the U.S., says the Iraqis who cheered him on the streets after the fall of Baghdad now &quot;look at me as if I'm a spy or a traitor.&quot; No one but his mother knows he's working for the U.S. forces. &quot;It's just too dangerous out there,&quot; he says. <br>
<br>
The Iraqi fear of reprisals has complicated the U.S. hunt for Saddam. In the past month, two Iraqis working directly with U.S. forces in Tikrit have been murdered. One man, a source who led U.S. troops to a number of weapons caches and resistance organizers, was shot in his auto-repair shop in broad daylight. &quot;I would hate to see the stage,&quot; says a Pentagon official close to the search for Saddam, &quot;where they start shooting people who come and talk to us.&quot; <br>
<br>
For U.S. forces, the collaboration of Iraqi informants has become a critical weapon in the fight against the insurgency. Lieut. Colonel Steven Russell, commander of the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, says that by working from Iraqis' tips, his troops, together with the elite special-forces team Task Force 20, are knocking out resistance cells and collapsing the support structure around Saddam. Recent raids, a U.S. intelligence official tells TIME, have come tantalizingly close to capturing the ex-dictator. &quot;I can't say that the bed's been warm&quot; when the special forces have raided suspected hideouts, he says, &quot;but there's certainly evidence to say he's been where we've been.&quot; U.S. forces, says the official, have found in hideouts a &quot;certain brand of cigars, certain food items&quot; that are consistent with Saddam's tastes. &quot;He hasn't cast aside his cravings.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Iraqis who do come forward to talk to the Americans, especially in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, are risking their lives. Former regime officials thought to have pointed fingers at their old bosses are the chief targets of the insurgents' fire. Two weeks ago, members of the Fedayeen Saddam, the former regime's guerrilla corps, were seen about the town's main mosque dropping photocopies of a letter listing 21 &quot;traitors and spies who have direct contact with the occupiers.&quot; Ten of the names on the list, a copy of which was acquired by TIME, are those of Saddam's cousins. Last week members of the Fedayeen in Tikrit went after another local man who had sympathized with Saddam before the war but had lately turned on the regime. According to a Fedayeen officer who provides logistics and intelligence to an active guerrilla cell, the suspected turncoat was killed when two men in a pickup truck, their yeshmaghs wrapped around their faces, pulled up to the man's car and sprayed it with AK-47 fire before speeding off. <br>
<br>
To militants agitated by the U.S. presence in Iraq, cooperating with the coalition forces is an offense tantamount to treason. In Tikrit, a block from the parade grounds where Saddam often celebrated his birthday, graffiti on a wall in bold Arabic strokes read all those who cooperate with the americans will be killed. Not far down the road, a former lieutenant in the Fedayeen who met with a TIME reporter in his one-story home reiterates that threat. &quot;Traitors,&quot; spits the lieutenant at the mention of those helping the U.S. forces. &quot;They are not Iraqis. They don't love their country. They deserve to die.&quot; <br>
<br>
The American forces in Tikrit say they can't guarantee the safety of all who come to them with information. And while Russell is concerned about the distribution of lists of citizens cooperating with American troops, the U.S. focus on rounding up the leadership and guarding its own forces from attack means it can't extend much protection to the Iraqis, who may be the key to catching Saddam and ultimately subduing the resistance. And so U.S. soldiers are in a race with the insurgents. &quot;Our response,&quot; says Russell, &quot;is to finish off our list before they finish off theirs.&quot; <br>
<br>
U.S. commanders say they are winning the race, but it's a tense fight in which they have to rely on allies they don't know. One night last week, Russell was in an office building in downtown Tikrit, waiting for a call from a new intelligence source who said he knew where a prominent Fedayeen leader was staying for the night. Four M1 Abrams tanks, six Bradley fighting vehicles and two infantry platoons from the 4th Infantry Division stood poised to capture the man, who was believed to have been plotting for months to kill American soldiers in the area. Russell hadn't used this particular informant before, but he had a good feeling. &quot;The information is checking out,&quot; Russell said, a smile breaking over his wan face. &quot;This could be a good one.&quot; <br>
<br>
Just past 11 p.m., Russell's phone rang. The informant had spotted the target; the operation was a go. &quot;I wanna get this bastard who's been attacking my men,&quot; Russell said as the convoy pulled out and headed to a flophouse in town where the Fedayeen commander was lodging. Russell's Cobra Company stormed the three-story building, netting 38 workers from out of town and their man—a provincial Fedayeen organizer nicknamed Sami &quot;The Rock.&quot; Task Force 20, operating south of Tikrit, nabbed two more &quot;high level&quot; resistance leaders on the same night. Said Russell after the raid: &quot;The source came through.&quot; And he could come through again—if his name doesn't end up on the wrong list. <br>

At minimum they keep the truth hidden until they decide how they can word it to their gain.  How many times have you seen a politician dodge a simple direct question with the intent to release a staff-approved answer later?  You KNOW he knows the answer, he just needs to make sure it's worded correctly, leading to my distrust.<br>
<br>
A gopher chewing a power cable in one town and wiping out 1/4th the eastern seaboard seems a bit of a stretch to me, regardless of the antiquity of the system.  And why so antiquated in the first place?  We pay close to 200 a month alone at our little house in PA, just one stinking house out of millions.  Are you telling me they can't afford to upgrade?<br>
<br>
Much much much easier to believe it was a disgruntled power worker or terrorist attack.  If they have no clue, how are they so positive it wasn't a terrorist attack? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Yes, you can be banned for<br>

Power companies have strict rules about how much they can charge you. Government regulation is exactly why you have antiquated systems. If it was a free market the power transmission companies would be falling over themselves for your business. But since the government fucks with the free marketing of electricity there is zero incentive to make you, the customer, happy. I don't blame them either, they don't make enough to errect quarter million dollar per mile transmission lines. Plus the public wont sell the land for resonable prices, the eviromentalist make the companies perform multi-million dollar eviromental impact surveys and every town says, &quot;Don't build here, we dont want it&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just how much do you think it takes to run a power plant anyway? The overhead is in the hundreds of millions per year at my plant, and we only make 2 or 3 million per day IF everything goes perfect, which it rarely does. And one month or more out of the year one of our turbines is gauranteed to be down, which means we cant even break even. Doesn't leave much left over for profit, let alone upgrading substations. This is from the country's second newest nuclear plant, with multiple records set for efficency, costs, and refuel turn arounds. We set the world record for amount of electrical capacity generated last year, and we still have problems selling it at a good enough price to make a decent profit.<br>
<br>
And if you live in PA, then the plant I'm talking about services you and your $200 a month electric bill. So I hope some of this is getting through. Electricity isnt cheap to produce, maintain, or upgrade, especially on the PJM grid which has the worlds largest number of customers, and problems. It's over a hundred years old. If you want a better system be prepared to dig into your pockets a bit more. Or go buy more candles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 961<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/16/03 9:03 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Power outage</span><hr size=1> Arleanna - explain to me why, when power companies DID have a free market and no regulations, instead of either a) taking their newfound financial freedom and investing in infrastructure (new, more efficient transmission lines?) or b) improving profits, they created an artificial energy shortage, manipulated natural gas volumes, raised everyone's power bill by over 300% per year, and were later proven to have fabricated the whole thing just to make more money?<br>
<br>
Loaded question, I know, but if the utilities are not insanely tightly regulated, they're free to fuck over the consumer, and there's nobody who can stop them, because nobody can prove they're doing it (until a whistleblower steps up, I guess).  Just as the fine people of California.<br>
<br>
Not to come off all &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot; like here, but I don't even REMOTELY trust the utilities, especially the phone company and the power utilities.  When I lived in MA, they were just switching over to a competitive &quot;free&quot; market, and I don't know how well that went, but I moved to California just as the little &quot;let's not regulate them&quot; experiment was going to hell.  Given the alternative, I'd much rather have the government massively regulating the power companies and deal with the occasional power grid failure.<br>
<br>
And before you ask people to &quot;dig too deep&quot;, take a look at the cellular phone industry.  $2-5 million per tower, which has a 5-mile radius, and yet several networks (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint) all managed to wire the entire country with analog towers, and then REDO the whole thing in digital towers.  In the meanwhile, the cost for cellular phone service has gone from $1/minute average in the 1980s to today, where it's cheaper to have ONLY a cell phone and not even use a landline anymore.  These companies recognized the efficiencies gained in upgrading infrastructure would more than produce ROI in a short period of time (in their case, increasing # of customers so dramatically that the volume of customers more than made up for the lower margins).  <br>

I know this can't directly apply to power companies, but it's pretty clear that the cases so far where power companies were allowed to have free reign led only to massive consumer raping.  Enron didn't build California a bunch of new high-tech infrastructure for our $600/mo electric bills.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Yes, you can be banned for<br>

Power providers don't do anything but make the power and transport it across the grid. If a electricity commodity broker like Enron screws around it doesnt mean the power company got any more money, since they can only charge so much. The regulation between the electric company and the power brokers is tightly controlled. It's illegal for me to even talk business to an electrical power broker, so how would I know what drives them to do what they do that screws people over?<br>
<br>
As for telephones, they have less overhead. It's just a fact. The equipment that makes electricity runs into the billions for a reactor and a half billion for a turbine. We only have 40 years at most to make that money back with a multi hundred million dollar a year overhead. And the people who invest in the company need to see some kind of return or we might as well close up shop because we are breaking the first rule of business: Make a profit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=filanfyretracker>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/auction WTB a clue! </span><br>  Posts: 738<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/16/03 10:55 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.cthome.net/filanwizard/wtcsmall.jpg Width=110 height=141></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Power outage</span><hr size=1> thats the problem with generation is its hard to profit.  but its not impossible.  see the power companies need to learn that as our grid ages blackouts will become more common and profit will fall due to OT of the Linemen and replacing parts. also the fact when the power is out the meter isnt spinning.  investing now is the only way to provide a reliable profitable grid in the future.  speaking of which gotta check my progress energy stock..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=havneqalwaysoom>Havneq Alwaysoom</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://id.mind.net/~pseudo/Havsmall.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/16/03 11:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://id.mind.net/~pseudo/pethav.gif heigth=70 width=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Power outage</span><hr size=1> I think the biggest concern here is that Arleanna actually works at a nuke power plant and no one seems freaked about this <p><p><table border=0>

Were YOU affected?  Did you maybe have any elderly relatives who had to try to make it in the heat and in the dark?  Did YOU get effected for one second?  I had to take an elderly neighbor to the hospital because he was out of medicine and the local pharmacy was down for two days, not to mention take her to a cooling center for two hours because of the temperatures.<br>
<br>
What if that was your mom or dad I took?  Easy for you to sit and toss your fist in the air calling this &quot;just desserts&quot;.  Easy for you every time..  because in your computer chair, your comfortable house and your comfortable job, you aren't affecte by ANY of the things you rail against.<br>

It was built 10 years earlier in 1980, but was in a battle with the local government to allow them to startup. During the fight, the company went in bankruptcy due to cost over runs in the multi billions of dollars. There are also at least 3 other sites I can think of that were built in the late 70s that were never allowed to start. They are constantly being raided for parts when something breaks at an operating plant. It's sad. This is money that could have been spent upgrading the redundancy in our tansmission stations and lines instead of handing it to lawyers.<br>
<br>
The TMI accident near Harrisburg, PA in 1979 killed all new plans for reactors and chernobyl put the nail in the coffin for research into building next generation plants to replace the ones built in the 70s. Instead, the power demand in the US is in such dire shape that nuclear plants are requesting licence extensions past their agreed upon shutdown date and getting them. Even as more expensive gas turbines are being sold to foreign energy companies at a loss and then shut down due to extreme costs. <br>
<br>
Nuclear is not the cheapest. But it's also far from the most expensive. The cheapest is the one that pollutes the most, which is coal. The most expensive are trash burners and natural gas turbines, strangely enough. They not only pollute the air, they also bring the average cost per megawatt hour on the grid way up, which affects our electric bills.<br>
<br>
Heres an alright article on nuclear. It's heavily stanted in favor of nuclear since it was written for the NEI, and it's apparent they didn't take plant decomissioning costs into account when putting out these numbers. Something that really should be done to be fair when comparing kwh figures since a coal plant when it stops operating is destroyed with no further costs. Decomissioning costs are something like 5 dollars per megawatt-hour which brings the price to just above coal, but still well below oil and gas.<br>

There's a project that's being developed, called the Advanced Accelerator Applications program (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://apt.lanl.gov/">LANL's website regarding the program</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->), which takes nuclear waste (in particular, the transuranics) and uses neutron fluxes via spallation to cause the waste to transmute into shorter-lived isotopes (which take maybe years to decay to safe levels, instead of the tens or hundreds of thousands of years (or even millions for a few isotopes)).  In addition, the whole process is extremely exothermic, which projects the possibility of adding juice to the power grid (90% of the reaction goes to the lines, 10% goes to the accelerator to fuel the process).<br>
<br>
No real question for anyone, just tossing this out.  But, if Arleanna's more knowledgeable about the progress, feel free to chime in.  I was thinking this was going to be operational in a few years, but I hadn't heard anything, nor did I see anything on the web site. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1559<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/18/03 3:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> In other news<br>
