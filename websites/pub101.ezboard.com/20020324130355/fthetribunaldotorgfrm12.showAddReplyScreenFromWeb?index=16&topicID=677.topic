<br>
My post was attempting to defend a longtime friend.  Obviously I'm biased, but you seem to know that.  I'd like to thank you for being mature about everything as you have been.<br>
<br>
All I'm trying to say is, let's wait and see what Telymon has to say... because it's almost 100% certain that what he has to say will shed a whole lot of light on this and decide it one way or the other.  What I'm trying to avoid is exactly the sort of post Ladida has made... of course, this is the flameboard, and my efforts are probably in vain, but I feel obliged to stand up for my friend in the limited way that I feel I can.<br>
<br>
If Nexxon was given the gear as he claims, hopefully you two can come to some sort of agreement on what was guild material and deserves reimbursement.  If he wasn't, then the title of this thread and Ladida's flaming will be well deserved, and I'll look like an idiot.  &lt;shrug&gt;  In the end though, I'd rather have everyone wait on passing final judgement until we find out what happened.<br>
<br>
Not that the flamers care, but at least they have multiple targets now!  I hear that makes it so much more fun =)<br>

So you know what Sashanna.  You can go fuck yourself.  This will stick with me for the rest of my career, whether you say I did it or not.  One last thing, stop calling everyone so dim.  You're the idiot who just comes out blasting me without trying to talk to me like a civil person.  That just goes to show how dim you and your whole guild is.<br>

<br>
Telymon quits EQ for the 428795th time, and gives his stuff to Nexxon.  Now this is no surprise, because every time he quits he gives droppable stuff (thanks guilds of the tribunal) to nexxon and me.  At the time I was off playing DAOC, so this time it all went to Nexxon.  I come back for a bit, and Nexxon lets me use the horn until he can sell it.<br>
<br>
I use it til I get 60, then I play a few days longer, then after falling asleep on a raid I lose 60, and decide 'well that sucked, oh well, no time to be bothered with getting it back.'<br>
<br>
one day, telymon decides 'Hey, I haven't quit EQ yet this month, how about I start playing again.  oh I'll need that horn of hsagra back so the comps don't know that I gave it all away mmkay thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
<br>
sounded like a shitty deal to me, but I figured I'd at least let him get me back to 60 while he was on my character talking to all of his lovely EQ friends.   next morning, I wake up and guess what's missing !     if you didn't guess, you're an idiot, stop reading now.    big fucking deal, let him have it, I don't play EQ anymore anyway.<br>
<br>
he also decides to get on nexxon during this time, and take back the other stuff that he GAVE him.    well, telymon has his fun for a week, then decides that the end of the month is coming near, oh shit, it's time to quit EQ again.  he then GIVES all of his stuff back to nexxon, tells him to sell it, and enjoy himself.<br>
<br>
then a day or two later, nexxon starts getting tells from some random bitch in the comps explaining how he stole all this stuff from telymon and that if he ever wanted to be friends with all you cool people again, that he would have to return it at once.  ouch.  what's he to do?  unfortunately for him, he realises that enjoying himself sounds a hell of a lot more fun than appeasing a bunch of whiny bitches who accused him of stealing that which he was given.<br>
<br>
sorry comps, it's really a travesty that you let Telymon fuck you over as he's done to so many other guilds before you,  but nexxon is not the cause of your mistake, just a convenient scapegoat for Telymon so you all will still be his friends.  maybe on his 428796th return to EQ, you can bitch at him about it then.  until then, thanks for letting me use the horn for so long, it was really quite a nice upgrade! <br>
<br>
much love,<br>

<br>
You wouldn't. But that's not really the issue. Basically this is about ethics. Plain and simple: The gear just doesn't belong to you man. If Telymon gave you the stuff willingly, he was wrong, if you keep it, you are wrong. If people were coming at you and harassing you to give the stuff back, they were wrong. But the facts are the facts. The items never really belonged to Tely, and they don't belong to you. If you wanna do the right thing.. you'll give it back to the rightful owner. Perhaps even get a reward for returning the &quot;stolen property.&quot;<br>
After all, they should be fortunate that you still have everything and that they can even get the items back. A lot worse could have happened to that stuff, and I think they should keep that in mind when they make some of the comments they do.<br>

<br>
Nexxon, you need to give the crap back to the Companions &amp; go beat the crap out of Tely.<br>
<br>
The reason they are shitting on you is because your good pal made a post saying you stole it.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to give it back, fine, you will get to keep the items, but to many of us, you will be a greedy little bitch and your rep will be shit upon. So the decision you have to make is, rep or items. Either way, it is up to you.<br>
<br>
Seriously, I think you got screwed here. But by nobody but Tely.<br>

You can only make it better or worse. <p><BR>

<br>
Who knows the 'real' story here?  It honestly sounds like there is some serious confusion as to the exact truth...  Telymon could be lying... Nexxon could be lying.<br>
<br>
Telymon owes the truth to his guild.  Nexx owes the truth to... nobody.<br>
<br>
Are ya targeting the wrong person?<br>
<br>
Far as Nexx giving the shit back.  How was he approached?  Seriously take that into consideration.  I'll go out on a limb and make an assumption here, but I am guessing he was not approached calmly and deviod of accusation.   Anyone approaches me with a chip on their shoulder, all their facts not 'straight' and or holding a gun to my head unless I personally and deliberately gave them reason to do so and I'd tell them to fuck off.  I'd expect there are others out there like that.<br>
<br>
Pisses me off when someone leaves guild and does not give back their droppables, no matter their reasons for keeping them.  It's like yer uniform if yer part of a team.  Give it back when yer no longer part of that team.  Also pisses me off if a guildmember 'lends' guild items to friends.   I've read this all through a couple times.  Be sure yer getting the truth from Telymon, and don't expect a single thing back at this point from Nexxon, since his reputation is fucked now it is so much more to his advantage to just keep the shit.   Not saying that it is 'right'.... just saying what to expect.<br>

<br>
EV and The Companions are the two wealthiest guilds on the Tribunal.  As a result, both guilds are targeted by people trying to rip them off.  <br>
<br>
We have strong internal controls in place to track all guild loot - but people still try to pull a fast one occassionally.<br>
<br>
Its important for people that would try to rip us off to realise that we arent an easy target and we will follow the chain to find out what has happened and how it can be prevented in the future.<br>
<br>
As far as where the truth lies between Nexxon and Telymon - Im no longer clear.  Telymon posted on an internal board that an RL friend had ripped off all his gear because they had a disagreement at school.  Nexxon said he would have Telymon post to clear this up - but it hasnt happened yet.<br>
<br>
What I am clear on is that Nexxon is still holding stolen property.  While I may look like a nasty bitchy loot horse in the process - it has to be clear that there are consequences ingame - just like there are consequences in real-life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uestevaneldiabolo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Estevan Eldiabolo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mock turtleneck sweaters<br>hide my bewbs right?</span><br>  Posts: 431<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/02 8:13:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.toolband.com/store/img/dvd_sala.gif width=110 height=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Add Nexxon(Qrit) to the ***list for stealing from his fr</span><hr size=1> So why didn't anyone ever noticed that Telytubby was a mentally unstable kid?

<br>
Sash's explanation makes good sense, but my point is that guilds should be more considerate of who's holding their valuable items.<br>

Sure he has been shit upon, but if he doesn’t, then he will not look greedy, he will look like he took the higher road &amp; did the right thing, and he will look like he just got screwed. It isn’t hard to become sympathetic &amp; defend people like that.<br>
<br>
I know some of you think that Tely can give his gear to whomever he wants &amp; that person can do whatever he wants with it. That is not how things go with guilds like ours, and that is the reason we get upset &amp; will indeed throw shit at him.<br>
<br>
Here is how things went when I first started playing with EV. I was at the bottom of the seniority ladder. Aat was right above me &amp; had joined like 2 to 3 weeks ahead of me. We both went on most of the guild raids &amp; as people quit, took breaks &amp; whatnot, we rose higher in senority. As people quit or got better things, we were passed down items. <br>
<br>
My Donal’s breastplate was given to me by Thistleburr. I shit my pants I was so pumped. (Incidentally, it was Aats to have, but he let me have it because he is actually a pretty swell brotha). And it was mine till I decided I wanted a better breastplate or till I decided I wasn’t going to play anymore. Then I, had to do what was done for me &amp; make another cleric below me happy.<br>
<br>
Kreese gave me a Donal’s helm. Many people gave me bluediamonds. I remember a nice druid gave me that turtle shield. Most everything I had was given to me by the guild &amp; I gave it back to the guild when I left. Even items I looted on raids were not mine forever. They wouldn’t have gone to me if they thought I was just gunna hand them over to an out of guild friend.<br>
<br>
I can’t even imagine the shit storm that would have happened within EV if some RL buddy of mine was in EC selling all the crap people had given me or I had received on raids. <p><BR>

<br>
What kind of shit does Nexxon deserve?<br>
<br>
I truly see Nexxon as everyones scapegoat for Tely's shitty showing.<br>
<br>
Tel quits and hands his stuff over to a RL friend and tells him to do as he wished with it.  Sounds rather simple to me.  Comps have no one to bitch and moan at since thier guildie has exited stage left, so some feel it is their duty to vent their anger at the scapegoat here.<br>
<br>
Does it absolutely SUCK that Tely chose to pass his inventory off to a RL friend instead of his guild that earned it for him?  Of course.   Is Nexxon deserving of ANY of the shit that is being flung at him here?  <br>
<br>
Sorry..he's not..go dig Tely up from under the rock he crawled under and sling your shit at him...If the Comps want random item#0001 back then get Tely back online and have him and Nexxon work shit out.  Till then looks like you basically had a shitty excuse for a guildmate. <p><b><font color="green"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79222"/a>Kylemall Inthensom</b><br>

<br>
That said, he now knows that what Tely did is wrong. What he does is up to him... and what he does will be right or wrong.<br>

I imagine we won't see Tely again... and if we do, it'll be a swift kick in the ass later.<br>

<br>
Nexxon does deserve being trashed on though. He knows it was wrong. So much so he even lied about having the items.<br>
<br>
Just because he didn’t steal them doesn’t mean he is justified in going out &amp; selling them. And it doesn’t mean the Comps can’t trash him for taking advantage of a wrong doing. <p><BR>

If let's say, I dunno, a friend of mine from RNG or KoT or EV were to one day hand over to me 300kpp+ in droppable gear, I would sure as hell question whether or not it was theirs to give...  This isn't rocket science. <p><center>

<br>
ReCap of that one:<br>
<br>
Manlaar = RL friend of Balorf<br>
<br>
Balorf lets Manlaar use his account for raid.<br>
<br>
Balorf says Manlaar stole all his gear and is quiting EQ, yet a week later he is /WTB 100+K in items all over the place to replace all the pp/gear that was stolen.  Guild Feeling sorry for him loans him some &quot;decent&quot; Items not to mention those that came from private donations to him.<br>
<br>
Manlaar returns to game says &quot;WTF am I in Legendary?&quot;<br>
<br>
Balorf posts on E/V or Comps (don't remember wich) board asking to Join.<br>
<br>
We find out /guildremove Balorf<br>
<br>
Balorf says his brother did it and his brother sold all his equipment to get him the 100+K pp to re-equip him (even after all the donations from guild).<br>
<br>
Balorf says he Ebayed.<br>
<br>
Last week grouped with &quot;the Real Balorf&quot; before his brother EBayed in LGuk Exe (who btw was a monk and didn't know what FD was, No Joke Either).<br>
<br>
Sounds like they Related to me....but I guess seens how Babilove/Loveseeker (and her imaginary Friends) have returned to the Tribunal, I guess we can expect more of this infectious Bull Shit.  (Babilove and Balorf are lovers in case you all missed it) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxebantiz2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xebantiz2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/6/02 11:25:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You all don't know the full story</span><hr size=1> Reading this thread is incredibly funny as I'm good real life friends with all the people mentioned, but just to clear up any misunderstanding, the only person you all should be pissed at is Telymon.<br>
<br>
Nexxon of Revolution, Telymon of The Companions, Sinogue of Legendary, and myself are all good friends.  We all go to the same school in the same grade.  We've known each other a long time.  They're all really cool people to hang out with, but EverQuest is a much different world then the real world and they all act QUITE a bit different here.<br>
<br>
Telymon is irrational and insane when he plays EQ.  In the last two years I've played this game he has been in almost every high level guild I can think of (Requiem, RNG, Legendary, The Companions).  He's a major guild hopper and I always used to wonder how he could be so insane and get away with it.  He easily moved from high level guild to high level guild in ways I will never know.  He's never been able to decide if he really likes EQ and he's quit the game about a thousand times only to start playing again a couple weeks later, he was addicted he just couldn't accept it.  Everytime he quits he screws his current guild, his items go to Sinogue and Nexxon, they do not go to his current guild even though they are guild property.  I've even received some of his gear in the past but I've tried to steer clear of the whole mess (Tely, Nexx and Sin all share account info so there's constant stealing of items back and forth).  Whenever Telymon comes back to the game he automatically assumes he should get all his gear back too.  So he goes on a crusade of breaking into his friends accounts and *reclaiming* his old gear which he had given away (he always tried to get his older gear off my accounts too but I never let anyone know my info so I'm the only one who avoided this mess).  This generally makes for a whole mess and no one knows what gear belongs to who.  In this particular case Tely was 100% at fault as usual, Nexxon and Sinogue got the shaft, as usual.<br>
<br>
Sinogue received Telymon's Horn of Hsagra (the Tormax drop) and began using it as one of his primary weapons.  Sinogue replaced his Crescent Blades of Luclin and gave them to Domination.  Telymon gave the rest of his stuff to Nexxon and promptly quit.  To the guy that said Nexxon's gear sucks, take a look at it now.  He's wearing a Dragon's Blood Earring (off Yelinak I believe), a Gem Encrusted Ring, has a RBG and other assorted very nice items.  When Telymon decided he wanted to play again he literally stole the Horn back off of Sinogue's account, leaving him with no weapon because Domination had his Crescent Blades (I sincerely apologize for going off on you ingame Domination, it was not your fault I somehow thought you were mixed up in all this shit).  So now Sinogue is basically fucked and has no inscentive to play anymore cause he doesn't even have a weapon to defend himself.  I'm not sure what happened when Telymon tried to reclaim his gear from Nexxon, but as far as I know when Telymon asked for his stuff back Nexxon like a true friend GAVE IT BACK.  Telymon is insane and within a week of coming back he had quit again, Nexxon received the gear back.<br>
<br>
A lot of this probably makes no sense unless you knew these guys personally.  The point of this post is Telymon is the bastard that has screwed so many a guild on this server, how he ever got into The Companions I will NEVER know or understand.  It is purely The Companions fault for recruiting him without doing any sort of background check.  Your guild entrusted some of the most valueable items on The Tribunal to someone who I don't even trust with my items, and they aren't worth near as much and we're RL friends.  Nexxon is an innocent bystander who received some free gear from a friend, and now his rep is fucked because Tely made a completely made-up post in The Comps forum.  Sinogue got fucked and I doubt he will ever play again.  I always told these guys that they shouldn't share their accounts because it would bite them in the ass someday and it did.  I can only hope that Nexxon doesn't quit, as he's my only RL friend still playing and keeps the game fun.  Companions, you truely have no one to blame but yourselves.<br>
