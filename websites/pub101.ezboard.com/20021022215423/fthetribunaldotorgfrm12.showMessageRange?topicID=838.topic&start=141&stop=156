It seems more like a disgruntled factory worker who helps make octofag chocolate draculas is coming home from a shitty boring job and acting like his is the epitome of cool cuz he can concoct a flame on some dirty piece of company toilet paper and work on it all day long at his job. Then he can come home and post it up for all his virtual non &quot;semi reitred&quot; friends to see and act like he is sporting a footlong cock or something.<br>

<br>
Lets look at the ways in which you are a ass munching knob.<br>
<br>
1) You're a loot whore.  That's bad enough but to be loot whore over 12pp is idiocy.  <br>
<br>
2) You're a whiny little pussy who can't wait to come straight to the flame board to run someone through the mud.  If you had done what most intelligent people do this thread never would have happened.  As a clue for the future I will tell you what intelligent people do.  First they don't get their panties in a twist like a little girl over 12pp.  Second if that 12pp is really that important to them they confont the person in game first to see if they can solve it.  Third if if you can't get in contact with the person you try to get in touch with their guild leader or something, to ask them about the person.  You didn't even wait a day to find out what had happened you assumed that Lanfearr /q'ed out.  You made no attempt to contact them in game before running your little girl ass over here to whine and cry about the 12pp you were wronged out of.<br>
<br>
3) Your analogies are lame.  The whole apple, car theif analogy is laughable, and stupid.  Maybe you didn't know the difference between petty and grand larceny, but that only proves how much more of an idiot you are.  It is only topped by your comment about plumbers and the CEO of Microsoft.  Maybe if you were smart enough to string three or four sentences together to form a paragraph to explain how your tiny little brain is functioning your innane ramblings would make more sense.<br>
<br>
4) You have this unhealthy desire to have the last word.  You do think you're Cool Hand Luke, you plan on winning this only by tiring out the people who continually beat upon you.  Oh and if you're too fucking stupid to know who Cool Hand Luke is go rent the movie.  Bet you didn't know that was a movie reference did you?  Well you'll have to figure out the title on your own.  Do you think that if you just &quot;win&quot; this one argument the other testicle will finally drop, your voice will change, and you'll finally be a man?  <br>
<br>
Give it up and go home.  You have lost.  You have been told multiple times by multiple people to just give up and go home.  You were wrong to come here and make the accusations that you did.  So the only way you will get the last word on this board is if it's a written appology to Lanfearr.  Something along the lines about how sorry you are that you're a complete ass munch and never should have assumed anything would be nice.  <br>

You might be a loot whore if...<br>
<br>
...you constantly ask for mobs that drop loot for you to be pulled.<br>
<br>
...the first thing you say when an item drops is &quot;What class?&quot;, before the looter can announce the stats.<br>
<br>
...all you talk about in guildchat is how nice it would be to get x item.<br>
<br>
...you only attend raids where your class's loot drops.<br>
<br>
...you join a guild with phat lewt dancing in your head.<br>
<br>
...you slander someone on the flameboard in mere hours after the masterlooter goes linkdead without attempting to contact them first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Most guilds have the first 5 in them, to some degree. None that I know of have the 6th, a testament to your unguilded status.<br>

everything there is to say has already been said. Now it's just a matter of seeing how long the fucker will hold out on his &quot;last&quot; post guarantee.<br>
<br>
<br>
And, as for work, like I've already stated, I'm a software designer when not in school. <br>
I flame people cause it's fun. Sure, you wouldn't understand that, since it's *obviously* not fun for you, getting ragged upon by, like, 35 people. But believe me, for the rest of us, watching your antics is actually pretty damn funny. <br>
<br>
It's like watching a homeless dude beg for change but instead of giving him change you give him a car but he was so poor that he never got a license and when he tries to drive gets in an accident and dies.<br>
<br>
If you couldn't tell, that was an  analogy moran style- rambled, made no connections to anything that actually happened.<br>
