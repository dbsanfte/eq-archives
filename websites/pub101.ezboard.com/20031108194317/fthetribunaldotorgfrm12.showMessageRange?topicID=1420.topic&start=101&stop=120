The Sesame Street char with AIDS bothered me only slightly, not because it dealt with a gay topic, but a topic of a disease that is hard for a child of that age to understand.. BUT in a country (I forget the numbers but they're outrageous) that a VERY high percentage of the people have AIDS, you just might have to start that early. Being that the average child in america that watches Sesame Street is done by the time they're 6 years old, they're not ready for sex, so they don't need to learn about AIDS till it can be taught in a controlled environment, when they're ready.[/quote]<br>
<br>
The HIV-positive character in South Africa's Sesame Street acquired the disease through parental transmission, not sexual. Nowhere does the show refer to the sex act that originated the disease for the character. It's hereditary in this case.<br>
<br>
HIV/AIDS is not a gay topic. Particularly not in Africa. Without trying to label you as a homophobe, that line of thinking really should have died out in the 1980s, because it's straight complacency that even today leads to some people getting infected.<br>

You're a close-minded idiot, and here's why:<br>
<br>
You: &quot;But this is a Marvel comic book we're talking about. Super Hero comic books were for all types of people, children included. X-Men, while having many adult type themes, still kept it reasonable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Article: &quot;The new version uses double entendres and euphemisms to reveal his homosexuality without saying anything explicitly. Based on a blurb on Marvel's Web site, the tone may be campy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marvel are being so cagey with the homosexuality issue, you'd think it was mined, which it may as well be, actually. The most risque thing so far appears to be a few puns, and a few references to the butch, rugged good looks of some other characters. Like a male character in a Marvel book has never looked a chick that way? And indeed, much futher.<br>
<br>
&quot;But its just a corporation trying to make money. This isn't a matter of someone gay making a comic book with a gay main character.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh, doy? That is the object of publishing things for profit. I don't see the relevance.<br>
<br>
&quot;But for a company like Marvel, who no matter what you say, primarily goes to children, they should be more responsible then to market a product that has a SEXual preference as a focus. I don't force Christian morals down anyones throat. I don't give a flying piece of monkey crap who you like to have sex with, who you worship, or the way you live your life. Personally I don't care if you live your life &quot;right&quot; according to the church or not. I don't live my life that way, and I'm certainly not telling you how to live your life. I can't help it if you hold some ill-will towards your parents for screwing your life up. That's not my problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few points:<br>
<br>
a) If my anecdotal evidence is as good as yours, then I'll point out that in the two comic book shops I frequent, I've honestly never seen anyone younger than 12-14 in there unaccompanied. And if you think there's 12 year olds out there who are going to be influenced by a few racy comments about Batman's skintight outfit to such an extent that they're putting on a Truman Capote accent and selecting new curtains for their bedroom, then you must accept too that looking at Wolverine is gonna make them grow claws and wear yellow lycra/adamantium.<br>
<br>
b) What morals you do or do not force are of no relevance to this discussion. What is Marvel trying to &quot;push&quot; here, by having a gay character? Since you accept the argument that it's on a par with animal sex, I'll field my own example: by having a character called Spiderman, Marvel are forcing upon me the idea that I must shoot webs out of my fucking rectum.<br>
<br>
c) Sexual preference as a focus is nothing new to either Marvel nor the comic book industry as a whole. One of the key themes of the recent &quot;Spiderman&quot; movie was his ill-fated love life. A cursory glance through lots of Marvel series will display the same themes.<br>
<br>
I'm off to bed. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>

<br>
Jaeron, don't be such a fuckin twit. If my daughter, who happens to be 12, read this comic or even something more racey, I am not going to be concerned. Does that make me a sick fuck who molests children too?<br>
<br>
If you really think that todays 12 year olds don't know anything about sex, you are either clueless, fooling yourself or only seeing special ed kids.<br>
<br>
Any parent who has done a halfway decent job of raising their kids don't need to worry about them reading R rated comics. If the kid is normal they will certainly realize that it's a form of entertainment and not something to model your life after or use as a sex ed text book. <p><br>

Don't punish yourself and try to get it. Jaeron will go on and on about whatever enters his mind first, paying no attention to his past statements and main topic. When people talk about something he said 4 posts ago, and say that it was different from what he posted 8 posts ago, he'll call them morons and point out what he posted 14 posts ago. With the large amount of inconsistent statements he makes, there's  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> something that he can point out so he can call someone a moron or point out their &quot;poor&quot; reading comprehension. There is no consistency, he goes on about whatever he thinks will make people it look like he knows what he's talking about at the moment. You'd think that a silly little 17 year old high schooler like me would be the one to fall all over himself on a topic such as this, but nope, it's the 25 year old who had enough sense at least to stay out of the gangs that he was involved with.<br>
<br>
I and a dozen others have already pointed out the main flaws in Jaeron's arguments, but he just ignores them, goes around in a circle, and makes someone else point out the exact same flaws over and over again. He's stubborn like an injured salmon trying to make it upstream and won't quit no matter how mangled and bloody he is.  <br>
<br>
This is a guy that thinks that his life is different than it was 10 years ago in the 'bad neighborhoods', yet admits wanting to get into moronic scuffles at EverQuest fairs, and has &quot;challenged&quot; people on these message boards to &quot;fights&quot; because they said he had purple hair or some such crap. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And this is the guy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that thinks he knows what's what in the world of parenting and what is bad for children to read and be involved in.<br>
<br>
Don't try, just leave him be and let him die off on his own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeron>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 704<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/14/02 6:40 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Next time you fags ask why..</span><hr size=1> Okay just to clear a few things up.. this is about my feelings on companies making money irresponsibly using sex and controversy in a product that IS generally marketed to children to bring up sales.  I feel that children should learn about sex responsibly from their parents, but not all parents can do that.  This is not a perfect world.  Some parents don't want their kids to learn about sex till they're older, and they should have that right.  A show like Will and Grace is marketed toward adults, not children.  Comic books with super heroes are generally marketed towards children, AND adults.  And another thing, if this was done responsibly, it wouldn't be a problem either.  I mean to say, if a gay writer makes a comic that is obviously geared towards adults, and sold only to adults, thats one thing.  But that's not the case, and if it was, that comic book wouldn't sell.  I don't care how you raise your children, and I don't have children to raise.  But I think every parent should have the right and option to raise them as they see fit.  As far as AIDS and Sesame Street goes, I can see the reason they need that char over in South Africa.  Many children are suffering from AIDS.  If this country comes down with that same problem, where a very high percentage of 3-7 year olds have AIDS, or even 3-12, perhaps I'll see a use for that char here in the states.  This is NOT a gay issue at all.  The disease is in heterosexuals, homosexuals, and many IV drug users.  Sesame Street became a focus of this conversation because people can't read. :P  If they put a gay char in a cartoon that airs on Saturday mornings, I'd feel thats inappropriate too.  If they put a prostitute super hero in a comic book, I'd feel that was inappropriate too.  Get it? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

But you went off about this gay character without even knowing if he had sex in this comic, because you didn't care if he did or not - you had a problem with him being gay - period.<br>
<br>
Next you accuse a guy of wanting to rape 12 year olds just because he didn't think that reading this comic would turn them into some freak. Perhaps this showed me more about your true feelings than anything you've said thus far.<br>
<br>
Man, sit back and just breathe for awhile. Gays are not a threat to society, they are not going to brainwash your kids and they aren't going to contaminate the enviroment.<br>
<br>
It's all about tolerance. They just want to be open about themselves the same way straight people have since the 60's. Maybe a few of them go a little nuts, but this is the first generation (for the most part) that is finally getting a taste of tolerance. It only makes sense that some would go a little overboard after being forced in a closet for so long.<br>
<br>
Let them have their comics, TV shows, movies, sports stars, politicians and all the other things straights have had. Relax, this is America and they deserve their slice just like everyone else and there is enough to go around. I promise you, it won't ruin the country to let them live in the open. <p><br>

Just a small sample, decode it yourself. Please for the love of god do not ask me to go on. There's a fight on HBO(no no, don't get all hyped up, it's a pro fight not a street fight) I'd like to watch and it'd take 3 hours to go copy/paste everything. Go ahead and start your &quot;that's not what I meant&quot;s and your &quot;well that was different&quot;s and your &quot;well if you COULD READ...&quot;s and whatever else you think up in a quarter of a second.<br>
<br>
Also saying that you love to fight, you will fight and you will continue to fight is inconsistent  with your saying that you will one day have children. Well actually I guess it's not, but that's pretty screwed up nonetheless. &quot;I won't expose my child to sexual content, but I will come home to him with 2 black eyes, a broken arm, and a smile!&quot; Good luck to you and your future spawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaeron>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 707<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/14/02 7:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Next time you fags ask why..</span><hr size=1> Wow thanks..

<br>
As far as what you're quoting goes, you can't quote an attack as having anything to do with the point of the thread.  One has nothing to do with the other.  As usual, you don't point out what is meant in what I said, you just spout out quotes and say &quot;Figure it out.  Everyone else can!&quot;  Fact is, no.  Me cursing someone out for flaming me calling me a homosexual and my response flaming him for being an actual homosexual has nothing to do with the focus of the thread.<br>
<br>
Yes I will go off on someone in flames, but that doesn't change my views or beliefs.  Take stuff that talks about my beliefs on THIS topic, and I'll buy it.<br>
<br>
Loegan:  I was doing the attack about wanting to have sex with 12 year olds to stress a point.  To me, teaching a kid about sexuality, no matter what kind, is wrong.  Teaching a kid about homosexuality, or straight sex, is wrong.  Thats a parents job, and the right of the parent to decide when they learn should never be taken away.  I don't really think he'd have sex with a 12 year old.<br>
<br>
Anyway, fights starting now, opening bell any second.  I'll be back in a bit. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.
