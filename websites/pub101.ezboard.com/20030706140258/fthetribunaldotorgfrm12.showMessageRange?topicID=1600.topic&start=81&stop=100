<br>
You would do well to check this link and read for yourself who provided the biological and chemical weapons. ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/medsearch/FocusAreas/riegle_report/report/report_toc.htm">www.gulflink.osd.mil/meds...rt_toc.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> )<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>U.S. Exports of Biological Materials to Iraq<br>
<br>
The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has oversight responsibility for the Export Administration Act. Pursuant to the Act, Committee staff contacted the U.S. Department of Commerce and requested information on the export of biological materials during the years prior to the Gulf War. After receiving this information, we contacted a principal supplier of these materials to determine what, if any, materials were exported to Iraq which might have contributed to an offensive or defensive biological warfare program. Records available from the supplier for the period from 1985 until the present show that during this time, pathogenic (meaning &quot;disease producing&quot; , toxigenic (meaning &quot;poisonous&quot; , and other biological research materials were exported to Iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Records prior to 1985 were not available, according to the supplier. These exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
Included in the approved sales are the following biological materials (which have been considered by various nations for use in war), with their associated disease symptoms:[56] <br>
<br>
Bacillus Anthracis: anthrax is a disease producing bacteria identified by the Department of Defense in The Conduct of the Persian Gulf War: Final Report to Congress, as being a major component in the Iraqi biological warfare program.<br>
<br>
Anthrax is an often-fatal infectious disease due to ingestion of spores. It begins abruptly with high fever, difficulty in breathing, and chest pain. The disease eventually results in septicemia (blood poisoning), and the mortality is high. Once septicemia is advanced, antibiotic therapy may prove useless, probably because the exotoxins remain, despite the death of the bacteria.<br>
<br>
Clostridium Botulinum: a bacterial source of botulinum toxin, which causes vomiting, constipation, thirst, general weakness, headache, fever, dizziness, double vision, dilation of the pupils and paralysis of the muscles involving swallowing. It is often fatal.<br>
<br>
Histoplasma Capsulatum: causes a disease superficially resembling tuberculosis that may cause pneumonia, enlargement of the liver and spleen, anemia, an influenza-like illness and an acute inflammatory skin disease marked by tender red nodules, usually on the shins. Reactivated infection usually involves the lungs, the brain, spinal membranes, heart, peritoneum, and the adrenals.<br>
<br>
Brucella Melitensis: a bacteria which can cause chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, profuse sweating when at rest, pain in joints and muscles, insomnia, nausea, and damage to major organs.<br>
<br>
Clostridium Perfringens: highly toxic bacteria, which cause gas gangrene. The bacteria produce toxins that move along muscle bundles in the body killing cells and producing necrotic tissue that is then favorable for further growth of the bacteria itself. Eventually, these toxins and bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause a systemic illness.<br>
<br>
In addition, several shipments of Escherichia Coli (E.Coli) and genetic materials, as well as human and bacterial DNA, were shipped directly to the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission.<br>
<br>
The following is a detailed listing of biological materials, provided by the American Type Culture Collection, which were exported to agencies of the government of Iraq pursuant to the issuance of an export licensed by the U.S. Commerce Department<br>

And good for Woody for writing that.  Too bad there is a distinct difference between supporting the war and supporting the troops.  I think you have taken someone's statement for supporting those who are fighting, and warped it to fit neatly into the warmongering mentality of certain americans.<br>

Let's take back all of our weapons and see how long it takes for the Arabs to create another Halocaust.<br>
<br>
Great solution buddy.<br>
<br>
I don't see any mention of the Arab murderers in your little solution...wonder why?  Look they picked the wrong ally, now all they have is terrorism and Religious Zealotry to fall back on.  Isreal just happened to be the one that picked an Ally with a decent financial plan for the future, so they kick a little more ass than Rahhiim and his pipe bomb atm.  <br>
<br>
Ask not why the US supported Isreal then.  Once again it was a State created by the UN.  They were supporting the UN.  Ask why the USSR supported Syria, a country determined to go against the UN Mandate for the creation of Borders in Palestine.<br>
<br>
I bet a few ignorant assholes still blame the whole thing on the US after asking themselves that question.<br>
<br>
The stuff you put in that little article up there is all well and good Cyricus..however none of that stuff was provided by the US government, or the Military.  Private Pharmeceutical companies provided 99% of that. The stuff that was provided by the Military or Govt. was weakened purposely so that it's only use could be a vaccine, not an delivery agent.<br>
<br>
Noone said the US was perfect.  It's far from it.  But to accuse the US of purposely sending Iraq chemical weapons just to pretend to 'catch' them with it as far as 15 years down the road in an elaborate scheme devised by 'Dubya' to steal all of Iraq's oil...well that's just about the dumbest thing I've ever heard.<br>
<br>
In all the warring and fighting that has gone on...most of the times when Isreal broke a peace treaty or violated a UN Resoloution, it was only in response to a Terrorist attack on them.  Not condoning it, just understanding it.<br>
<br>
I think Dennis Miller had the answer, put Yassir Arafat on a bus to an Isreali Disco 5 times a week...that would help the shit stop. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am Arleanna's smartass<BR>

So they happily gave away someone else's homeland and expected the original inhabitants to accept it.<br>
<br>
Of course, when the arabs faught back and were winning good old Big Brother america stepped in and saved their miserable asses. <br>
<br>
And for any of you who think this so called war on terrorism is about the fight for 'freedom' you should go back to whatever cave you crawled out from. This war that is putting many lives at risk on both sides is about control of Oil, American's dominance over the Arabs by keeping Israel as the dominant power in the region and the surrounding of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And it sickens me to see how easily the majority of the American public is manipulated into thinking its a just cause. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arec49>Arec49</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/23/03 8:13 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www2.warnerbros.com/main/touts/secondary/originals_steppenwolf_chap3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  run for your lives sand niggers, its your turn to die.</span><hr size=1> The Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916 was a secret wartime agreement between Britain and France agreeing to divide the land of the Ottoman Empire after thier defeat in WW1, among it's terms was the establishment of an Arab state in &quot;Southern Palestine&quot;  Leading Arabs to be pissed about Britain basically using the League of Nations to rule Palestine as a British Colony until 1948.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Balfour Agreement which you speak of, was taken from a short note from Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a prominent British Jew and one Proliferator of the Zionist movement, stating that &quot;His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.&quot;  This Declaration sped the Jewish immigration to that Holy Land and yes, it is 'reguarded' as a formative National Document BY THE ISREALIS.<br>
<br>
The Neuremburg Laws (1935) provided legal framework for stripping Jews of thier rights as human beings.  The Laws and thier successors paved the way for deporting of the Jews, and ultimately to the death camps of the Holocaust.  The Nazi murder of 6 million Jews and the inability for most of them to return home even after Germany's defeat in 1945 rallied world support for a Jewish state in Palestine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Facing a Jewish refugee crisis amd mass emigration into Palestine it could no longer control, Britain acceded to Resolution 181 of the Newly Founded United Nations, which called for the partition of British-ruled Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as a seperate entity administered by the United Nations.<br>
<br>
Now before you start picking at every litte detail of what I said in some sort of propoganda attempt to obviously make The US seem 'responsible' for Saddam Hussien being in power.  Go back and look at your litte school books since you are too stupid to retain any knowledge that isn't sensationalist garbage, and see if it tells you what the US had to do with the Baath party in 1977...NOT in 1960.  <br>
<br>
The look up The Camp David Accords, Kissenger's 'Shuttle Diplomacy', and The Iraq-Iran war.  See for yourself how many times the US has intervened merely as a catalyst of peace in the Region, and how many times our pleas for them to come to some kind of reasonable resolution to the mess created by the &quot;Land without a people, and the People without a Land&quot;.<br>
<br>
Arabs didn't give 2 shits about Palestine until the Jews started buying up land from ABSENTEE Arab landlords. LEGALLY.<br>
<br>
Nowhere in this mess did the US draw the lines, or encourage the fighting.  And last time we took a stance of non intervention...we were called cowards by the people getting slowly assimilated by the Nazis.<br>
<br>
You Sashanna...are the 'tard'<br>

<br>
Now why don't you tell me why it is that when the Jews Declared Isreal as their state it was quickly and unanimously accepted by the US AND Russia, yet some years later Russia was supplying these Arabs with the weapons to boot them out? <br>
<br>
Oil<br>
<br>
Why is the US STILL supporting the Isrealis if all the Oil is in other countries?  It puts a serious strain on the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, the worlds largest Oil producer, as well as Iran, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Syria...and of course Iraq.<br>
<br>
Not Oil<br>
<br>
At best the only arguement you guys have is that it's all Britains fault for giving the Jews 'permission' to buy land there, and then our fault for protecting it when the UN Recognized it as an independant state?<br>
<br>
Look back at pictures of the Iraq-Iran war, and most of the Iraqi military incursions...those AK-47s, T-45s, and SCUD missles sure as shit didn't come from America comrades! <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lorendeldaywalker>Lorendel Daywalker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/23/03 9:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  run for your lives sand niggers, its your turn to die.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you fucking racist mother fuckers you southern rednecks cunts i hope more terriost attacks happen in america i hpe u die a painful death you fuking cunt your racism is so bad if i see you in the street ill shoot you in the spot and the rest of you rednecks i reckon all of you guys should join southern legion you guys all will match seriously.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->        <br>

2 reasons: 1, they are a foothold in the region. 2, they help to convince you idiots that your current political structure isn't fascist, when in fact it is. Bush was a member of the &quot;Skull &amp; bones brigade&quot; which was a KKK affiliate back in the day. He is a southern racist, but it doesn't matter, because all your future presidents will belong to the same coporate powers. Your democracy is dead, and it has been dead since Kennedy was shot. Your country is a poisoned, corrupt regime. You little people have failed. Your nation is a cesspool of coporate millionaires pulling the strings of your politicians. If you think that democracy is alive in your country you are deluding yourselves. Go ahead, shoot the messanger. I look forward to North Korea NUKING THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR CITIES. <br>
