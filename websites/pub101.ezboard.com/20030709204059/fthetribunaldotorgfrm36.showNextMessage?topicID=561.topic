<br>
 <br>
Unlimited reproduction and distribution is authorized. Just give me credit<br>
for my work, and, keep in context. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Since the media has decided to scare everyone with predictions of chemical, <br>
biological, or nuclear warfare on our turf I decided to write a paper and <br>
keep things in their proper perspective. I am a retired military weapons, <br>
munitions, and training expert.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Lesson number one: In the mid 1990s there were a series of nerve gas attacks <br>
on crowded Japanese subway stations. Given perfect conditions for an attack <br>
less than 10% of the people there were injured (the injured were better in<br>
a  few hours) and only one percent of the injured died. <br>
<br>
 <br>
60 Minutes once had a fellow telling us that one drop of nerve gas could <br>
kill a thousand people, well he didn't tell you the thousand dead people per <br>
drop was theoretical. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Drill Sergeants exaggerate how terrible this stuff was to keep the recruits <br>
awake in class (I know this because I was a Drill Sergeant too). Forget <br>
everything you've ever seen on TV, in the movies, or read in a novel about<br>
this stuff, it was all a lie (read this sentence again out loud!). These <br>
weapons are about terror, if you remain calm, you will probably not die. <br>
This is far less scary than the media and their &quot;Experts,&quot; make it sound. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Chemical Weapons <br>
<br>
 <br>
Chemical weapons are categorized as nerve, blood, blister, and <br>
Incapacitating agents. Contrary to the hype of reporters and politicians <br>
they are not weapons of mass destruction they are &quot;area denial,&quot; and terror <br>
weapons that don't destroy anything. When you leave the area you almost <br>
always leave the risk. That's the difference; you can leave the area and the <br>
risk but soldiers may have to stay put and sit through it and that's why <br>
they need all that spiffy gear. <br>
<br>
 <br>
These are not gasses, they are vapors and/or air borne particles. The agent <br>
must be delivered in sufficient quantity to kill/injure, and that defines <br>
when/how it's used. Every day we have a morning and evening inversion where <br>
&quot;stuff,&quot; suspended in the air gets pushed down. This inversion is why <br>
allergies (pollen) and air pollution are worst at these times of the day. <br>
<br>
 <br>
So, a chemical attack will have it's best effect an hour of so either side<br>
of sunrise/sunset. Also, being vapors and airborne particles they are <br>
heavier than air so they will seek low places like ditches, basements and <br>
underground garages. <br>
 <br>
This stuff won't work when it's freezing, it doesn't <br>
last when it's hot, and wind spreads it too thin too fast. They've got to <br>
get this stuff on you, or, get you to inhale it for it to work. They also <br>
have to get the concentration of chemicals high enough to kill or wound you. <br>
Too little and it's nothing, too much and it's wasted. <br>
<br>
 <br>
What I hope you've gathered by this point is that a chemical weapons attack that kills a lot of people is incredibly hard to do with military grade agents and equipment so you can imagine how hard it will be for terrorists. The more you know about this stuff the more you realize how hard it is to use. <br>
<br>
 <br>
We'll start by talking about nerve agents. <br>
 <br>
You have these in your house, plain old bug killer (like Raid) is nerve agent. All nerve agents work the same way; they are cholinesterase inhibitors that mess up the signals your<br>
nervous system uses to make your body function. It can harm you if you get it on your skin but it works best if they can get you to inhale it. <br>
 <br>
If you don't die in the first minute and you can leave the area you're probably gonna live. The military's antidote for all nerve agents is atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Neither one of these does anything to cure the nerve agent, they send your body into overdrive to keep you alive for five minutes, after that the agent is used up. Your best protection is fresh air and staying calm. <br>
<br>
Listed below are the symptoms for nerve agent poisoning: <br>
<br>
Sudden headache, Dimness of vision (someone you're looking at will have pinpointed pupils), runny nose, excessive saliva or drooling difficulty breathing, tightness in chest, nausea, stomach cramps, twitching of exposed skin where a liquid just got on you. <br>
<br>
If you are in public and you start experiencing these symptoms, first ask <br>
yourself, did anything out of the ordinary just happen, a loud pop, did <br>
someone spray something on the crowd? Are other people getting sick too?<br>
Is there an odor of new mown hay, green corn, something fruity, or camphor <br>
where it shouldn't be? If the answer is yes, then calmly (if you panic you<br>
breathe faster and inhale more air/poison) leave the area and head upwind, <br>
or, outside. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Fresh air is the best &quot;right now antidote&quot;  If you have a blob of liquid <br>
that looks like molasses or Kayro syrup on you; blot it or scrape it off<br>
and away from yourself with anything disposable. This stuff works based on<br>
your body weight, what a crop duster uses to kill bugs won't hurt you unless<br>
you stand there and breathe it in real deep, then lick the residue off the <br>
ground for a while. Remember they have to do all the work, they have to<br>
get the concentration up and keep it up for several minutes while all you have<br>
to do is quit getting it on you/quit breathing it by putting space between<br>
you and the attack. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Blood agents are cyanide or arsine which effect your blood's ability to <br>
provide oxygen to your tissue. The scenario for attack would be the same<br>
as nerve agent. Look for a pop or someone splashing/spraying something and <br>
folks around there getting woozy/falling down. The telltale smells are <br>
bitter almonds or garlic where it shouldn't be. The symptoms are blue<br>
lips, blue under the fingernails rapid breathing. <br>
<br>
 <br>
The military's antidote is amyl nitride and just like nerve agent antidote<br>
it just keeps your body working for five minutes till the toxins are used <br>
up. Fresh air is the your best individual chance. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Blister agents (distilled mustard) are so nasty that nobody wants to even <br>
handle it let alone use it. It's almost impossible to handle safely and<br>
may have delayed effect of up to 12 hours. The attack scenario is also limited<br>
to the things you'd see from other chemicals. If you do get large, painful<br>
blisters for no apparent reason, don't pop them, if you must, don't let<br>
the liquid from the blister get on any other area, the stuff just keeps on <br>
spreading. It's just as likely to harm the user as the target. Soap,<br>
water, sunshine, and fresh air are this stuff's enemy. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Bottom line on chemical weapons (it's the same if they use industrial <br>
chemical spills); they are intended to make you panic, to terrorize you,<br>
to herd you like sheep to the wolves. If there is an attack, leave the area <br>
and go upwind, or to the sides of the wind stream. They have to get the <br>
stuff to you, and on you. <br>
 <br>
You're more likely to be hurt by a drunk driver on any given day than be hurt by one of these attacks. Your odds get better if you leave the area. Soap, water, time, and fresh air really deal this stuff a knock-out-punch. Don't let fear of an isolated attack rule your life. The odds are really on your side. <br>
<br>
Nuclear Weapons <br>
<br>
Nuclear bombs. These are the only weapons of mass destruction on earth.<br>
The effects of a nuclear bomb are heat, blast, EMP, and radiation. If you see<br>
a bright flash of light like the sun, where the sun isn't, fall to the ground! <br>
The heat will be over a second. Then there will be two blast waves, one<br>
out going, and one on it's way back. Don't stand up to see what happened after<br>
the first wave; anything that's going to happen will have happened in two <br>
full minutes. <br>
 <br>
These will be low yield devices and will not level whole cities. If you<br>
live through the heat, blast, and initial burst of radiation, you'll probably <br>
live for a very, very long time. Radiation will not create fifty foot tall<br>
women, or giant ants and grass hoppers the size of tanks. These will be at<br>
the most 1 kiloton bombs; that's the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Here's the real deal, flying debris and radiation will kill a lot of<br>
exposed (not all!) people within a half mile of the blast. Under perfect<br>
conditions this is about a half mile circle of death and destruction, but, when it's <br>
done it's done. EMP stands for Electro Magnetic Pulse and it will fry every <br>
electronic device for a good distance, it's impossible to say what and how<br>
far but probably not over a couple of miles from ground zero is a good guess. <br>
Cars, cell phones, computers, ATMs, you name it, all will be out of<br>
order. <br>
<br>
 <br>
There are lots of kinds of radiation, you only need to worry about three, <br>
the others you have lived with for years. You need to worry about<br>
&quot;Ionizing radiation,&quot; these are little sub atomic particles that go whizzing along<br>
at the speed of light. They hit individual cells in your body, kill the<br>
nucleus and keep on going. That's how you get radiation poisoning, you have so<br>
many dead cells in your body that the decaying cells poison you. <br>
<br>
It's the same as people getting radiation treatments for cancer, only a <br>
bigger area gets radiated. <br>
 <br>
The good news is you don't have to just sit there and take it, and there's lots you can do rather than panic. First; your skin will stop alpha particles, a page of a news paper or your clothing will<br>
stop beta particles, you just gotta try and avoid inhaling dust that's  contaminated with atoms that are emitting these things and you'll be generally safe from them. <br>
<br>
Gamma rays are particles that travel like rays (quantum physics makes my <br>
brain hurt) and they create the same damage as alpha and beta particles<br>
only they keep going and kill lots of cells as they go all the way through your<br>
body. It takes a lot to stop these things, lots of dense material, on the <br>
other hand it takes a lot of this to kill you. <br>
<br>
Your defense is as always to not panic. Basic hygiene and normal preparation <br>
are your friends. All canned or frozen food is safe to eat. The radiation <br>
poisoning will not effect plants so fruits and vegetables are OK if there is <br>
no dust on em (rinse em off if there is). If you don't have running water <br>
and you need to collect rain water or use water from wherever, just let it<br>
sit for thirty minutes and skim off the water gently from the top. The<br>
dust with the bad stuff in it will settle and the remaining water can be used<br>
for the toilet which will still work if you have a bucket of water to pour in <br>
the tank. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Biological Weapons <br>
<br>
 <br>
Finally there's biological warfare. There's not much to cover here. Basic <br>
personal hygiene and sanitation will take you further than a million doctors. <br>
Wash your hands often, don't share dirnks, food, sloppy kisses,   etc., .... <br>
with strangers. Keep your garbage can with a tight lid on it, <br>
don't have standing water (like old buckets, ditches, or kiddie pools) <br>
laying around to allow mosquitoes breeding room. This stuff is carried by <br>
vectors, that is bugs, rodents, and contaminated material. If biological <br>
warfare is so easy as the TV makes it sound, why has Saddam Hussein spent <br>
twenty years, millions, and millions of dollars trying to get it right? If<br>
you're clean of person and home you eat well and are active you're gonna <br>
live. <br>
<br>
Overall preparation for any terrorist attack is the same as you'd take for<br>
a big storm. If you want a gas mask, fine, go get one. I know this stuff and<br>
I'm not getting one and I told my Mom not to bother with one either (how's<br>
that for confidence). We have a week's worth of cash, several days worth<br>
of canned goods and plenty of soap and water. We don't leave stuff out to <br>
attract bugs or rodents so we don't have them. <br>
<br>
 <br>
These people can't conceive a nation this big with this much resources. <br>
These weapons are made to cause panic, terror, and to demoralize. If we <br>
don't run around like sheep they won't use this stuff after they find out <br>
it's no fun. The government is going nuts over this stuff because they<br>
have to protect every inch of America. You've only gotta protect yourself, and<br>
by doing that, you help the country. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Finally, there are millions of caveats to everything I wrote here and you <br>
can think up specific scenarios where my advice isn't the best. This<br>
letter is supposed to help the greatest number of people under the greatest<br>
number of situations.<br>
 <br>
 If you don't like my work, don't nit pick, just sit down and explain chemical, nuclear, and biological warfare in a document around three pages long yourself. This is how we the people of the United States can rob these people of their most desired goal, your terror. <br>

<br>
I have never been worried about nerve agents or mustard gas and even a rogue nuke doesn't scare me too much, but biological weapons, depending on the type used, could wipe out 1/3 of our population in as little as a month.<br>
<br>
Even something like a severe flu epidemic can kill alot of people (mostly the old and very young), so the thought of a bug having help in being spread around by some guerilla warriors is pretty scary stuff imo. About the only real defense against that is avoiding contact with people altogether, because by the time you find out it's out there you could have already had contact with it. But who's gonna live like a hermit out in the woods out of fear?<br>
<br>
Just have to support our intelligence agencies and hope for the best. <p><br><br><br>

Even AIDS doesn't stand a chance against your immune system if its low concentration.  Thats right, your immune system can fight off things that you commonly hear as &quot;not curable&quot;.  The reason is that your immune system has to be overrun by the disease before one can see the disease grow (i.e. the concentration has to be large enough that its reproducing faster than the immune system can kill it off).  This makes biological weapons hard to use because they have to use enough in a confined area to create a certain concentration level...such as what eqnan was saying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lbarsoum>lbarsoum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/03 2:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=566.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting read.</span><hr size=1> That's a bit of an over-simplification of AIDS.  AIDS is an autoimmune disorder caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  The progression from HIV to AIDS is linked to increased viral load (read: not dependant), but this is a symptom, not a cause.  Furthermore, bacterial infection is not simply caused by the presence of a bacteria.  What often makes people sick enough to die is not the presence of the bacteria itself, but a toxin created by-product of metabolism, for example.<br>
<br>
These are all facts... I can even post my sources if someone would like.  I consider, however, the idea that &quot;your immune system has to be overrun by the disease&quot; before you become deathly ill a myth.  Just because you hear or read something in the news, doesn't mean that it is completely true.  I could go on and on on this topic, as it is, really, my field, but I'll stop boring everyone with details. =)  A good book to learn about AIDS is &quot;AIDS Update 2002&quot; ... if anyone actually wants to look into it further.<br>
