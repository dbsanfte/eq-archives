Actually if Canada was in the US's shoes I would like to think we would act relatively the same as we do now.  Canada separated from England through peaceful negotiation.  The US is a country formed through violent revolution.  I personally think that has effected the course the two nations have taken since.<br>

I never said we would've won without you.  I'm saying that Canada CHOSE to fight, even when the odds appeared to be heavily against our side.  In WW2, the US didn't get involved until you were attacked directly.  England asked us for help and we gave it.  They asked you for help and you said you didn't want to get involved.<br>
<br>
Have you ever heard that when Canadian's go traveling abroad they were Canadian flags so as not to be mistaken for Americans?  There's a very good reason for that.<br>

Looks like at the very least hitler/Stalin would have liked to have a piece of canada, History played a big part in how we developed muse, If it were not for the U.S. I am sure canada would have developed a much larger military to combat the powers in WW2. And would have had to kept troops abroad to stop stalin, you would have been FORCED into being what the U.S. is now.<br>
<br>
Remember Japan was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>well</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> With striking range of canada, If it was not for the U.S. you would have definetly fought a war,much like the U.S. did, that would have either turned you into an american type nation or you would be speaking japanese.<br>
<br>
Your right people dont forget shit like that, That also means you enemies would not have either, If it was not for the U.S. what would have told the japenese army when they invaded? We only hate hitler not you guys!<br>
<br>
You all seem to forget, The U.S. was not always a super power, Hell we were once like Canada. We kept our noses out of everyones buisness. We were Forced into the world spot light, How can you say it would not have been the same for canada if the U.S. had not been the ones fighting<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> In WW2, the US didn't get involved until you were attacked directly <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The U.S. was activly involved in suplying arms and muntions and money LONG before we became involved, We also sent over pilots much like the canddians did.<br>
<br>
Canada is the way it is now because the U.S. allowed it to keep its nose clean.<br>

Would the WW2 Military might of canda been able to stop japan? No<br>
<br>
Would you have grown to stop Japan? Probably, Much like the U.S. did.<br>
<br>
Would you when the war in europe was over have stoped stalin from claiming it all with your new found might? Damn right you would have, Because as you have said you had an obligation.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Was ASKED to come be a player in the world, We were forced to stop stalin from taking europe, We were drug into politics. And if We did not exist then canada would have been forced into the same situation, Well you or mexico lol.<br>

The war of 1812 had nothing to do with Canada, it was the British returning to get their colonies back (they never really considered the Americans free in 1779...) and it was played out as a war between the French and British on North American soil.  The US and Canada were both teeeeeensy little pawns in that war, symbolic really.<br>
<br>
Canada is fairly rich and full of natural resources, just like the US is.  But its not AS rich and doesn't have AS many natural resources - that was one major contributing factor in them growing up &quot;smaller&quot; even though as of ~1800 they were probably very similar countries. <br>
<br>
In times when Canada has felt threatened, be it through ties to their European roots or more directly, they've always stepped up to the challenge.  However, in the last 100 years or so, there's really been nothing to threaten them.  They know full well that every USA-hating freak knows what the maple leaf looks like, and they proudly wear them as they backpack safely across iraq or whatever it is.  Of course, I'm sure the Aussies felt the same way before the big bad Fundamentalism Monster(tm) saw fit to rear its ugly head in Bali.<br>
<br>
People keep making offhand references to the US isolationist policies of WW2 (and now you flame us now for getting involved :P ) but the US was quite actively supporting Britian long before Pearl Harbor or the German U-boat activities.  It just was &quot;under the table&quot;, if you will.  Of course, once the US was directly pulled in, things changed.  Note also that Hitler was WELL on his way to attacking the US via Mexico.  He was trying to get the Mexican military to invade the US, so as to distract them from helping the UK/France in Europe.  Had this not been detected (see: Zimmerman Telegram), WW2 could have gone a very different way.<br>
<br>
Where am I going with this?  If the US were magically to cease to exist, Canada wouldn't last long with their current philosophy as a member of North America.  Every one of those Latin American countries who are constantly fighting one another for money/power/territory would turn a very greedy eye north, and Canada would be forced to defend itself.  Just like the US did, oh about 170 years ago, when they were attacked by Mexico on just such a conquest raid.  They won, and shattered Mexico (basically leaving it the mess it is today), and took Texas.  But I assure you that if Colombia thought they could get a piece of the US's land/wealth today, they would do it in a heartbeat.  Without the US, Canada would just be carved up (or forced to build up). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadaetidalstorm>Jadae Tidalstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/22/02 5:41:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=52>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Canadian Minister of Defence calles Bush a Moron</span><hr size=1> Who wouldnt want Canada?

<br>
ROFL!!!  If the US is SOOOO  rich with natural resources, why do they want to buy mining rights, clear cutting rights, buy our water, our electricity, complain about the small amount of hunting licenses being issued, etc.  I don't know how much natural resources each country has, but it's safe to say not one is rich than the other 200 years ago, but now, Canada has more because a very large part of the country is either unpopulated or scarsly populated.  And the reason we don't have a large population isn't because of resources, it's because geography and weather.  Not everyone likes cold weather you know.<br>
