Is it common knowledge that insufficient oxygen is the actual cause of cancer?  I didn't see that on this board anywhere till I brought it up -- yet did you look up Dr. Otto Warburg and his papers and the work he did to be awarded the Nobel Prize?  I mean, I guess it's common knowledge since it's been known for over 70 years, but common to whom?  How many people who've never had a basic physics class know that the earth does not have a satellite and the moon actually belongs to the sun?<br>
<br>
Basically, since I've now had 2 grandparents and a young aunt die to cancer, and I see the percentages are 1 in 3 (think about that...think the next time you have 3 of you in a kitchen, in an office at work, in a booth at a restaurant, etc) that you will have cancer, I decided to study everything I could possibly get my hands on.  I used to be a chem major/pre-med minor with aspirations of med school -- till I saw what a sham it is.  Guess it kinda dawned me one day when I was practicing the Hippocratic Oath (which of course isn't said today...out of 157 schools of allopathic and osteopathic medicine last year, 1 had students recite the pledge).  I came across the part that says <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Do you realize everything doctors do violates this?  Have a cold?  Oh, here take this antibiotic.  Nevermind that it won't do jack and shit, we just like to sign prescriptions.  Here's a lollipop.  Oh, you have bad migraine headaches?  No, it wouldn't be the aspartame in your diet drink causing it -- here's a strong headache pain reliever...of course it will destroy your stomach lining causing a reflux of acid in the esophagus...so here's an antacid.  Oh, now you have bouts of dizziness?  It could be Parkinson's Disease!  Let's order a bunch of tests.  Ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Enzo's article about irradiating the body like this is a good treatment?  Please.  Anyone read that article?  Anyone pick up on the little snippet that went something like this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Scheinberg said he hopes to start human clinical trials with the technique next year. He said before the technique could become a routine therapy for cancer patients, researchers need to find out if the low-level radiation will cause unacceptable levels of damage to normal, noncancerous cells. <br>
&quot;We simply can't predict all of that,&quot; he said.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I mean, c'mon people.<br>
<br>
When I said doctors are the 3rd leading cause of death, was that part of the supposition?  Makes a good story, sells books?  Want some numbers?<br>
<br>
ALL THESE ARE DEATHS PER YEAR:<br>
<br>
12,000 -- unnecessary surgery  <br>
7,000 -- medication errors in hospitals  <br>
20,000 -- other errors in hospitals <br>
80,000 -- infections in hospitals  <br>
106,000 -- non-error, negative effects of drugs  <br>
<br>
These total to 250,000 deaths per year from iatrogenic causes!!  So much for no deadly medicines.  What does the word iatrogenic mean? This term is defined as induced in a patient by a physician's activity, manner, or therapy. Used especially of a complication of treatment.  And these are just the ones that have been reported.  Is that causing no harm?  Of course this could all be supposition at best, I found this in some rag-tag magazine called the Journal of the American Medical Association...is that a good publication?<br>
<br>
How about this, another analysis concluded that between 4% and 18% of consecutive patients experience negative effects in outpatient settings,with:<br>
<br>
116 million extra physician visits <br>
77 million extra prescriptions <br>
17 million emergency department visits <br>
8 million hospitalizations <br>
3 million long-term admissions <br>
199,000 additional deaths <br>
$77 billion in extra costs <br>
<br>
All in the name of better health, doing no harm.  Or is it. <br>
Remember how I said we ranked 12th of 13 countries? (second from the bottom) That was for 16 available health indicators. More specifically, the ranking of the US on several indicators was: <br>
<br>
13th (last) for low-birth-weight percentages <br>
13th for neonatal mortality and infant mortality overall 14 <br>
11th for postneonatal mortality <br>
13th for years of potential life lost (excluding external causes) <br>
11th for life expectancy at 1 year for females, 12th for males <br>
10th for life expectancy at 15 years for females, 12th for males <br>
10th for life expectancy at 40 years for females, 9th for males <br>
7th for life expectancy at 65 years for females, 7th for males <br>
3rd for life expectancy at 80 years for females, 3rd for males <br>
10th for age-adjusted mortality <br>
<br>
Of course, that can be explained by our excessive lifestyle, sitting behind the computer and smoking, drinking and being violent.  Except that this study also found:<br>
<br>
The proportion of females who smoke ranges from 14% in Japan to 41% in Denmark; in the United States, it is 24% (fifth best). For males, the range is from 26% in Sweden to 61% in Japan; it is 28% in the United States (third best). <br>
The US ranks fifth best for alcoholic beverage consumption. <br>
The US has relatively low consumption of animal fats (fifth lowest in men aged 55-64 years in 20 industrialized countries) and the third lowest mean cholesterol concentrations among men aged 50 to 70 years among 13 industrialized countries. <br>
<br>
You can read that supposition here:<br>

In 1996 more Americans died of cancer than died in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam combined, with 550,000 Americans dying of cancer. In 2002 it is expected that more than 1.25 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer.  Yet how many people have heard of Dr. Warburg?  How many people know ascorbic acid isn't Vitamin C, and that taking it actually lowers your pH dangerously (hello, it's an acid).  How many people know at a pH slightly above 7.4 cancer cells become dormant and at pH 8.5 cancer cells will die while healthy cells will live - and what you eat will determine what your pH is.  Instead, we look to radiation, surgery and poisons as our therapy?  Does that not seem pretty fucking stupid to anyone else?  Of course it doesn't...there's no money in telling people to eat better.  Wanna know how much a 1-month course of chemotherapy runs ya?  How much you think it will cost for an actinium-255 cage treatment?<br>
<br>
Here's the opening from one of Dr. Warburg's lectures -- he outlines it pretty nicely:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Prime Cause and Prevention of Cancer<br>
Dr. Otto Warburg<br>
Lecture delivered to Nobel Laureates on June 30, 1966<br>
at Lindau, Lake Constance, Germany <br>
<br>
There are prime and secondary causes of diseases. For example, the prime cause of the plague is the plague bacillus, but secondary causes of the plague are filth, rats, and the fleas that transfer the plague bacillus from rats to man. By the prime cause of a disease, I mean one that is found in every case of the disease.<br>
<br>
Cancer, above all other diseases, has countless secondary causes. Almost anything can cause cancer. But, even for cancer, there is only one prime cause. The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen (oxidation of sugar) in normal body cells by fermentation of sugar.<br>
<br>
All normal body cells meet their energy needs by respiration of oxygen, whereas cancer cells meet their energy needs in great part by fermentation. All normal body cells are thus obligate aerobes, whereas all cancer cells are partial anaerobes. From the standpoint of the physics and chemistry of life this difference between normal and cancer cells is so great that one can scarcely picture a greater difference. Oxygen gas, the donor of energy in plants and animals, is dethroned in the cancer cells and replaced by the energy yielding reaction of the lowest living forms, namely the fermentation of sugar.<br>
<br>
In every case, during the cancer development, the oxygen respiration always falls, fermentation appears, and the highly differentiated cells are transformed into fermenting anaerobes,  which have lost all their body functions and retain only the now useless property of growth and replication. Thus, when respiration disappears, life does not disappear, but the meaning of life disappears, and what remains are growing machines that destroy the body in which they grow.<br>
<br>
All carcinogens impair respiration directly or indirectly by deranging capillary circulation, a statement that is proven by the fact that no cancer cell exists without exhibiting impaired respiration. Of course, respiration cannot be repaired if it is impaired at the same time by a carcinogen.<br>
<br>
To prevent cancer it is therefore proposed first to keep the speed of the blood stream so high that the venous blood still contains sufficient oxygen; second, to keep high the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood; third, to add always to the food, even of healthy people, the active groups of the respiratory enzymes; and to increase the doses of these groups, if a precancerous state has already developed. If at the same time exogenous carcinogens are excluded rigorously, then much of the endogenous cancer may be prevented today.<br>
<br>
These proposals are in no way utopian. On the contrary, they may be realized by everybody, everywhere, at any hour. Unlike the prevention of many other diseases, the prevention of cancer requires no government help, and not much money.<br>
<br>
Many experts agree that one could prevent about 80% of all cancers in man, if one could keep away the known carcinogens from the normal body cells. But how can the remaining 20%, the so-called spontaneous cancers, be prevented? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> It is indisputable that all cancer could be prevented if the respiration of body cells were kept intact.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Nobody today can say that one does not know what the prime cause of cancer is. On the contrary, there is no disease whose prime cause is better known, so that today ignorance is no longer an excuse for avoiding measures for prevention. That the prevention of cancer will come there is no doubt. But how long prevention will be avoided depends on how long the prophets of agnosticism will succeed in inhibiting the application of scientific knowledge in the cancer field. In the meantime, millions of men and women must die of cancer unnecessarily.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Pretty succinct if you ask me.  Well, I about wrote a book in answering your question there...think it made a good story that'll sell?  Wanna know how I fit in?  It perturbs me to see total control over shit like this from pharmaceutical lobbyists and the government peons they own.  Gee, sure was nice of us to give $200 million dollars of our tax money to UNAIDS for all those poor people in africa who are dying.  Too bad they're dying of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> malnutrition</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and we can't give money to feed them.  Nah, we'd rather poison cocktail their asses up -- ever do any research on AZT and what that stuff really is?  Hahaha...look it up.  And they want $10 billion dollars now?  That's bullshit.  Grats Combivir (note to self, stock up on Glaxosmithkline stock).  <br>
<br>
Oh, I forgot to add this for Ladida...no I don't peruse these boards often anymore...in fact I haven't in weeks.  The drama just isn't interesting when you're no longer in the game...I just happened upon this thread because you started it and I figured it'd be a good one.  Was there something specific you wanted?  I can email you if you want.  Hope you're well.<br>

You use the text of one man to try to show that you know what makes the world tick and everyone else is wrong.  If I follow you, the professional world as a whole are in some giant conspiracy to supress knowledge that will cure cancer.  No one and no company has the nads to rise to the top and save us from the cancer blight, not to mention the untold billions in revenue.  That dog wont hunt.  When one or two &quot;professionals&quot; say green, and a few hundred thousand of their piers say blue, I tend to believe blue to be the best answer.<br>
<br>
No Dan, I&quot;m not convinced.  Not even close.  I agreed that most of the dietary information you list is good for the human body and will promote longer and healthier life, but I just cant believe that theres a little traffic cop in the body that rejects ascorbic acid and lets &quot;natural&quot; vitamin C pass.  Ascorbic acid IS vitamin C and All the &quot;vitamins&quot; the body needs and uses are utilized the same, be it &quot;natural&quot; or manufactured.  Of course the Natural ones cost a lot more, hense the need to make them more appealing, and hense to make more money.  The human body is a machine and not some supernatural, magical organism.<br>
<br>
However; all this being said, there is still evidence that green may be the answer in certain cases or in certain incidents.  The human mind is a marvelous thing, and some of its hidden and unknown powers may still prove the answer is green for the individual concerned.<br>
<br>
Just dont run out some hugh conspiracy theory.  Pauling also swore that Vitamin C was the cure for the common cold.  I remember when that news came out.  People were spending 10x the price for the bottles.  Then his claim was proven to be unfounded and now we're to believe vitamin C will prevent cancer; claimed by the same man.  Hardly.<br>
<br>
Sorry again man.  I'm just not a believer.  Mark me down as on the other side.<br>

Seriously, where do YOU come up with your ideas?  Loegan is exactly right...the synthetic version is completely different and dangerous.  Ever hear of tocpherols?  They make up the 'E' vitamin.  D-alpha-tocopherol is pure vitamin E.  Dl-alpha-tocopherol is synthetic vitamin E complex.  The first one is found in whole grains, seed oils.  Yours is made from combining turpentine and acetone.  That sound the same to you?  'No traffic cop?'  Are you a fucking kindergarten teacher or something?  Ever hear of ezyme-specific receptor sites?  Do you know what a receptor site is, how compounds bond, anything about how the body and cell respiration works?  Don't answer that.<br>
<br>
That's a nice little sheep-mentality sentence you made there though.  Can I play with it?  When one or two &quot;professionals&quot; say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> round</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and a few hundred thousand of their peers say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> flat</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I tend to believe <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the world is flat.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Didn't happen to be the king of portugal about 500 years ago, did ya?<br>
<br>
Secondly, comprehension is our friend.  I don't recall saying the body 'rejects' ascorbic acid, I said ascorbic acid isn't vitamin c and that it lowers your pH.  And I said vitamin c's role is as an antioxidant, which it is.  Oh, that's a 'bad guy killer' if you didn't want to struggle with that big 5 syllable word back there.  Oxygen...oxygen...oxygen...that is what you missed out of that little report I wrote earlier.  Maybe go back and read it again huh.<br>
<br>
And do you know anything about Liinus Pauling?  Obviously not.  Do you know anything about the shit you're spewing?  First off, Pauling's results couldn't be reproduced because the so-called follow up researchers use vitamin supplements, like ascorbic acid.  Pauling used pure, liquid vitamin C.  Vitamins are not molecular compounds, they're biological complexes.  Vitamin C is a complex containing P factors, vitamin K, vitamin J, and enzymes, like tyrosinase. Saying ascorbic acid is vitamin c is like having a tire and saying you have a car.  Ascorbic acid is a fractionated, crystalline isolate of vitamin C, one that in fact has an MSDS sheet that says to seek medical attention in case of swallowing.  That sound like the same thing you find in your fruits and legumes?  Not only that, his claim was never unfounded...it was just never reproduced on the scale that he claimed.(which was not that vitamin c cures the common cold you moron, your immune system cures it just like every other disease - Pauling said vitamin c PREVENTED the common cold.  Don't worry about not knowing that though, 'prevention' is an unknown subject to most men with the initials 'M.D.' behind their names also). There's thousands of studies of the benefits of vitamin C, thousands.<br>
<br>
Shit, not even when you said the 'natural' ones cost a lot more were you correct.  I've never seen a more from-out-of-my-ass post than that one.  Seriously, don't post again.  I can't stand anymore bullshit and cliches.  I'ma mark you down as 'pathetically lost ignorant ass' cause that's the best I can do.  If you want to call that the other side, I doubt any sane person would have any objections.<br>
<br>
Intrigued -- alkaline foods, cardiovascular exercise.  He needs oxygen and to bring his pH down.  By the way, 98% of men will get prostrate cancer...it's not a system with a high oxygen concentration.  They'll never die or feel any harmful effects from it though as it's contained within the prostate --unless it's operated on.  Yes, I know this is hard to believe, but once again doctors cause their patients to get ill.  Trying to use surgery to cut it out results in it metastasizing to other parts of the body (sharon osbourne) and making it a threat.  And so much more profitable.<br>
<br>
That dog won't hunt though, cause no company has the nads to rise to the top to cost themselves potential billions in untold revenue.  Heh.<br>

    <br>
Prostate cancer is diagnosed every 2 3/4 minutes, approximately 190,000 new cases each year. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in America among men.<br>
<br>
More than 30,000 American men lose their lives to prostate cancer each year, one death every twenty minutes.<br>
<br>
Prostate cancer incidence rates increased 192% between 1973 and 1992.<br>
<br>
One in six American men is at lifetime risk of prostate cancer. If a close relative has prostate cancer, a man's risk of the disease more than doubles. With two relatives, his risk increases fivefold. With three close relatives, his risk is about 97%.<br>
<br>
In the next 24 hours, prostate cancer will claim the lives of over 80 American men.<br>
<br>
Prostate cancer represents about 30% of all new cancer cases in American men.<br>
<br>
This year, more cases of prostate cancer in men under the age of 65 are expected than the combined number of men of ages who are victims of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease,  and brain tumors.<br>

My dad has never smoked, drinks only occasionally, swims 2 miles ever other day, works full time, has low cholesterol, great bp (blood pressure, for you eq addicts not a piece of armor) is very active at age 68.  But...prostate cancer will most likely kill him. He did not have surgery to remove the prostate and neither did a good friend of his.  His friends has spread to his bones and he has a short life expectancy left at this time.  Another friend with the cancer had his prostate removed and is doing fine at this time.  My dad was given one year by some asshole doctor recently which other doctors do not agree with.  If not at least controlled he has 2-3 years to live.  Sorry If I don't agree with ALOT of the bullshit I see here.  My mother also died of breast cancer when I was 21.  I find it hard to believe if there was a cure it would be hidden away.    <br>

Cancer all starts with something fucking up your DNA...Wich leads to bad replication...Ever tried making a copy of a copy? Ever tried it when the original copy is already fucked up? The error gets worse and worse and worse.<br>
<br>
I do understand the prevention of free radicals by anti oxidents has been proven to prevent cancer however divin I have never heard of it killing cancer....The actual cause is still in the DNA structure not in the cell itself....Most doctors agree the only way to deal with that is to eliminate the faulty DNA structure.<br>
<br>
I am very curious as to the reasoning behind why the cancerous DNA will begin to replicate itself normally from an abnormal state once your PH lvl goes to 8.5....Our knowledge of DNA is crude at best however at out current tech lvl besides, some crude changes, We can,t alter DNA very well at all.....And from most studies we've seen the body cant alter it either.(wich makes sense considering the DNA is like the base programing :P).<br>
 <br>
Infact besides radiation/poison messing DNA up its amazingly difficult to alter it at all (alter it in a controled way)....In the past few years great leaps have been made in the DNA therapy field however again its still  crude at best...Even the best technology can,t put DNA back together again, So I am really curious as to the reasoning behind why your PH lvl can.<br>
<br>
I am not being sarcastic I am very curious is there a link or a book I can get with more info on this?  After all some of the best cures are right under our knoses....(antibiotics:P) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usolovey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 12:37:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1113.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> btw intrigued I agree I really find it hard to belive the cure for cancer is sitting right infront of us, However....Sometimes the best cures are found in the most unlikley places.

<br>
1) again, I never said antioxidants kill cancer...I said oxygen oxygen oxygen kills cancer...oxygen which fosters a high alkaline blood pH in which cancer cells CANNOT respirate...they die<br>
<br>
2)<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Most doctors agree the only way to deal with that is to eliminate the faulty DNA structure.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Exactly.  Welcome to modern medical science, treat the symptoms not the ailment.  There is no 'faulty' DNA, there is DNA in such an environment that it cannot repair itself.  <br>
<br>
3)The high pH level doesn't alter DNA...it makes it unfavorable for cancer cells.  Go back to that Otto Warburg piece I posted about how cancer cells are products of fermentation, not aerobes like normal cells.  That's why they're cancerous...make fermentation impossible and the cells cannot live<br>
<br>
4)I said 98% of men will get prostate cancer, and that's a fact.  That's what all your statistics are saying in a roundabout way, it's not a high oxygen tissue.  And also like I said as long as it's contained within the prostate it causes no harm.  Unless, it's operated on.  Let me ask you...did his doctors biopsy it?  Sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Alkaline foods...no sugars, bring his pH up.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I am talking about 'prevention' of cancer...not curing.  As I said, the only thing I know that remotely works are antineoplastons. Best advice I can give anyone is, research it yourself.  I mean, if it was my life I wouldn't entrust it to a guy who studied for 8 years out of a text that a pharmaceutical grant provided.  And I don't.<br>

Some believe removing it before it spreads will stop it, but all it takes is one cell to have escaped.  My father's cancer had already spread outside the prostate before anything was done.  So that point is not valid.  The rest I don't know all that much about but my father does.  Thankfully there are still a few options out there and new things coming everyday.  I'm glad my father is such a fighter.  He won't give up until it makes him.<br>

You want us ... no screw that, you want ME to believe that there is a conspiracy of not only the top 5 pharmacutial companies, but in the whole world, to surpress your little gem of knowledge just to continue to let millions of folks die to protect some mythical product.  All this while the market for a proven preventative  (check the word proven), would far surpass all the current &quot;cures&quot; and procedures put together.  The secret and all powerful They who surpress this knowledge and comb the world paying off every one that &quot;sees the light&quot; to keep them quite.  Next you'll be telling us that 57.4% of all &quot;accidents&quot; are murders; They did it to bury the truth!<br>

I'm betting you spend all your awake hours adhereing strictly to everything you are preaching here.  And as in all crackpot cases like this, the more people you can get to think the same way you do, the more &quot;self evident&quot; that your believes are the true and only ones.<br>
<br>
Why cant you just say, &quot;..we dont really know, but there is some evidence that this or that might help...&quot; ...  I think most of us can work with that; maybe give it a try or not.

I hope it is. But even so I'm pretty sure that higher oxygen has its own side effects, some of them extremely dangerous.<br>
<br>
Oxygen is not such a nice element as most any chemist can tell you. Without it we couldn't make energy to keep our bodies alive, that is true. But higher then 20 something percent and &quot;bad shit&quot; starts to happen. Submarine sailors make their own atmosphere and there is a high limit to oxygen % allowed. I seem to remember it was for biological reasons, not just increased metal corrosion.<br>
<br>
Also, divers everywhere are aware of oxygen toxicity that is swift and fatal, caused when total saturated oxygen levels in your tissues are too high for the body to expell.<br>
<br>
You say that oxygen prevents the cancer, but cell mutations can easily happen from any high energy radiation that bombards a cell and destroys a peice of the DNA chain. We are constantly assulted by high energy radiation, esspecially at higher attitudes, so it's safe to assume that these cell mutations happen regularly but most all mutated cells die. Yet it only takes one cell mutation that is viable for a cancer to start. If I'm interpreting you correctly high oxygen and high blood PH will kill all cancerous cells before they can mutate? I find this a little hard to believe. Why wouldn't this high blood PH also destroy normal cells as happens in extreme radiation victims?<br>
<br>
Sorry if I am misunderstanding you, you might have already answered my questions but to be fair you are a bit hard to read. Conspriacy theories and ferverant single-minded diatribes cause my eyes to glaze over and I sometimes miss valid pionts in an otherwise rabid foaming at the mouth overly sensitive defend the Alamo at all costs style of writing. <br>
<br>
Many large pharmacutical companies also do not prescribe (haha, get it? <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> prescribe</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->! Ah, screw you to!) to the possibility that accupressure, faith healing, or magnet theropy are helpful other then the placebo like results they can create. Are they just doing their duty to ingore snake-oil quakery or is the oxygen cure for cancer conspiracy part of a larger sinister plot of pure evil? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Kittenslayer</a><BR>

<br>
First off bakamoron...wow.  Again you stun me into silence by your horribly inane statements.  I just want to address a few of your genius points before I try to answer Areleanna, who makes a good post.  First, I would just like to say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'You use all the big pretty words'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> causes me to chuckle.  You realize they're common parts of everyday speech right?  I mean, if you had to look up in the dictionary anything I said you're only reinforcing what I said in my last flame towards you.  Buy a vocab calendar man.  Then there's this gem: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'You quote obtuse text from obscure and contriversial &quot;professionsals&quot;'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Now seriously, I gotta know what constitutes a real professional to you.  I mean, if 2-time nobel laureates (that means awardees or winners, put the Webster's down) are not professional enough for you, then I don't know what to offer who would be.  Obscure papers? You know I was being sarcastic referring to JAMA as a rag-tag magazine?  Did you click on the link I provided to see where it took you?  Are they obscure? You can't look up Warburg's submitted work for the Nobel prize, or search out his name in any medical journal?  Hell, I gave you the exact speech that excerpt was from.  Are you really this inept?<br>
<br>
Or are you really this delusional?  '<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you are some how Right because your posts have so much information' </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so I should've talked from my ass like you without a shred of any coherent thought and then I'd be right?  Heh.  I like how you contradict yourself next by saying that there's a conspiracy to suppress this great knowledge...when first you said 80% of what I said was 'common knowledge' -- so which is it? Common or suppressed.  The fact is, it's not suppressed if it's out there for everyone to read is it?  <br>
<br>
Of course, you just can't be a total fricking idiot and avoid it out of turn - opposing all common sense - because it shuns the current medical dogma.  Cause we know they're always right.  From Nero's lead-lined Roman pipes to asbestos to DDT to LSD to cocaine in our soft drinks whatever the 'experts' tout as correct has to be right.  Conspiracy?  No.  The fact is, it's common business practise.  I'll outline it quickly cause I know you're a kindergarten teacher and you're used to talking to people smarter than you all day.  Pharmaceutical companies don't care to enforce the idea of prevention because guess what...they make their money by treating EXISTING CONDITIONS.  They're not gonna say 'oh hey, truth is we don't need your $40 billion a year because you could just prevent cancer from ever starting'.  Are you this much of a closet-idealist?  Most people are scum, motivated by selfish greed...how many false charities and scammers made money off of the hugest tragedy in our nation's history, september 11th?  Or don't you believe that that happened either?  For hundreds to thousands of dollars they juked honest sympathetic giving people...hundreds to thousands.  With pharmaceuticals, we're talking $40 billion.  I guess it's kinda hard for you to imagine the power one could command with $40 billion+.  So instead, just bask in your naivety.<br>
<br>
Finally, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Why cant you just say, &quot;..we dont really know, but there is some evidence that this or that might help...&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Perhaps you glossed over that warburg speech...let me bring this back to you yet one more time.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> It is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>indisputable</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> that all cancer could be prevented if the respiration of body cells were kept intact.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Nobody</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> today can say that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>one does not know what the prime cause of cancer is</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. On the contrary, there is no disease whose prime cause is better known, so that today <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>ignorance</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is no longer an excuse for avoiding measures for <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>prevention</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If you have a young daughter/son ask them to read that to you a few times and explain if necessary.<br>
<br>
Tidal - yeah, don't forget the constant toxins we introduce..through our food (pesticides, drugs given to animals), the way we prepare it(microwaving), the plastics and stuff we produce, which never decomposes into the soil to replenish nutrients, the addition of more rays from the sun through our ozone hole.  Hell, the biggest cause is probably the fact that in the 1920s (back when 2% of the populace had cancer and some had even heard of it) our oxygen content in the atmosphere was 40%.  Today, thanks to logging, extinguishing of the rain forests, pollution, I think it's down to something like 15%, may even be lower around 13% or so.  70% of it is now nitrogen.  Put all that together and I'm surprised the rate isn't higher than 50% today.<br>
<br>
Intrigued - if you don't mind talking about, I'm curious -- how did they come to diagnose your dad with cancer?  Routine check-up, he was complaining of symptoms?  <br>
<br>
Arleanna - I think I can answer most of what you wrote right here: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it does seem a bit far-fetched to my uneducated self that increased oxygen is a cureall for all forms of cancer</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Again, I never said it cured cancer...I said it prevents it.  Prevention is the name of the game...'dig the well before you're thirsty'.  <br>
<br>
As for submarines and oxygen limits, I'm not sure on this (any divers wanna chip in) but I think what you're referring to is that anything under a certain depth the oxygen is mixed or cut with helium...but that's a pressure issue and not to limit their oxygen intake.  Oxygen's too heavy or something so they need to mix in something lighter.  Oxygen toxicity as you call it is again I think pressure, not level.  When they surface too fast divers get the 'bends' and change pressures before the body can adjust.  The treatment is to oversaturate their cells WITH oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber, bringing them up to normal pressure at even rates.<br>
<br>
As for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ...correctly high oxygen and high blood PH will kill all cancerous cells before they can mutate?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it doesn't work quite that way.  You're right in that cells are constantly damaged or mutated, but as I said DNA normally edits these chains out and/or repairs them.  Everytime.  In fact there's 'checkpoints' in the cell cycle where the cell determines if the DNA sequences are all viable for mitosis, and if not it stops until they are.  It's when the cell fails to repair the damaged nucleotide sequences that the cells mutate beyond control and become cancerous.  Specifically, without getting into the whole cell cycle theory too much, there's several different DNA sequences that must fail before cancer arises.  Like the p53 protein (which plays a part in 2 parts of the cell cycle) forces damaged or bad cells to commit 'suicide'.  It must mutate (in both instances) until it can no longer keep damaged cells from mitosis.   There's a bunch of checks and balances the cell uses, but it all comes down to oncogenes, which control growth rate.  When the growth rate goes awry, there's too many copies being reproduced at once and complete DNA strands can't be assured for every cell.  So more cells are growing, but they're not cancerous. Then mutations happen in the cells themselves due to imcomplete or faulty nucleotide sequences, and then they replicate...now you have cancer.  As I understand it anyways.  This all happens when the conditions as was previously described are present, that of low oxygen high acidic pH.  High blood pH is inducive to aerobic reactions, which is what normal cells need.  Cancer as you recall is anearobic, an entity that relies on fermentation to survive.  That's why highly alkaline blood pH doesn't allow the growth of cancerous cells but in no way harms normal cells.  So, without an environment suitable for all those things to fail, they won't.  Of course, if you're talking about ultra-high levels of radiation sure you'll overpower the cells by damaging so many sequences at once.  Akin to promoting free radical damage by ingesting easily avoidable toxins, like cigarette smoke.<br>
<br>
As for pharmaceuticals not 'prescribing' to other homeopathic alternatives...again why they should they?  They're in the business to make money, not ensure the health or the public good.  There is no profit in curing, only treatment.<br>
<br>
Damn these things get to be too long.  No wonder I upset bakamon so much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 1180<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 2:36:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1113.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Why do people cling to this belief that doctors are some kind of diety who would never do anything contrary to what is best for you?<br>
<br>
In many states, doctors don't tell low income patients of procedures that may save them, because they are forbidden to by the insurance companies.<br>
<br>
Many doctors routinely prescribe medicines that are not the most effective for a patients symptoms, due to kick backs from pharmacutical companies.<br>
<br>
Healthcare is a multi billion dollar business and when you are talking in numbers that big, I don't see why it's hard to believe they will manupilate conditions to better serve profits.<br>
<br>
Look at the oil business. Is there anyone who doesn't know that there have been systems developed that get well over a hundred miles to the gallon? Did the oil companies have any problems buying up rights to those devices?<br>
<br>
I am not saying it's a giant conspiracy, but it is in most healthcare providers interest to make people who have inexpensive cures look crazy. I don't know enough about chemistry or biology to know whether Dvinn's case is strong, but I know of other areas where legitimate practices with proven results are shunned and ridiculed by western medicine... and I believe they do it for self preservation. <p><br>

I do exercise, take a whole food health supplement that contains every vitamin, mineral, amino acid and enzyme known to man (naturally), and I avoid stuff like cigarettes, microwaved food, tap water, try to avoid sugar as much as possible, etc.  Like I said, it's called prevention.  You can choose to live like an ignorant ass for all I care, in fact you can trust in modern science to poison you until you're dead with chemo. I for one take simple steps to avoid such an unpleasant exodus from the world.<br>
<br>
I don't even care if you believe me or not (or rather believe the documented scientific facts of a 2-time nobel laureate).  I was just shedding some light on something I was more or less 'asked' to post about.  You can continue thinking that I spend every waking minute dwelling on death and mortality timetables if it makes you feel better however.  Just one thing I have to know...what part of anything I reported do you view as the 'crackpot' portion?

Today however it is know that leaches have the best anti blood clotting agents in the world (Far far better then anything we can synthesize). Now pharmecutical companies are rushing to try to copy this agent because its uses for limb reatachment are so extensive....<br>
<br>
Some forms of snake poison atack the nervous systen....Some like the black mamba can actually disconect the brain from the body....Its an amazing and horrific reaction this form or nerve blocking is far superior to anything we have today...If it could be controled it could make an amazing surgical tool . And its being studied by alot of the worlds leading pharmecutical companies.<br>

For thousands of years nature has adapted animals to thier specific goals in life...Those animals were pretty much giant test tubes for all kinds of neat little chemicals flying around, many of wich are so complex we are just now begining to decipher them.<br>
<br>
Altho many docotors wont admit it, self healing is used alot....Its been proven people who are told a drug is revolutionary and will help you, do get better, even if the drug is nothing more then a sugar pill....I am sure one day in the future perhaps we will all be able to heal ourselves but until that day medicine has time and time again saved many peoples lives....Its hard to veiw it as pure evil.<br>

One last little tidbit....I am almost positive sharks do not get cancer....I do not think there has ever been a case of it....Wierd huh?
