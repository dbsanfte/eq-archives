Black Hawk Down was a fucking good movie. The reviews over on your side of the pond weren't so good? Big fucking deal.

<br>
But just a few facts:<br>
<br>
Did you know that western, including americans, businessman used to fund the Taliban.<br>
<br>
Also Iraq used to be an allied of the United States, when the Americans were at war with Iran.  Now Iran is our friend???<br>
<br>
Iraq house the Taliban, but so does Pakistan yet they are our friends.  Hrmm... wonder the fact that Pakistan has nuclear missiles has anything to do with it?<br>
<br>
Israel terrorises the Palistani people, but the Palistani do suicide bombing, which is btw the origin of suicide bombings.  Some arabs say that 911 happened because of the american stand on the West Bank situation.  BTW Israel does have nuclear weapons also wonder if that has anything to do with it.<br>
<br>
Hate to say it but if Irak had nuclear weapons it would stabilize the region, it would surely quiet down Israel.  And it would drastically change US policies towards Irak.  In fact it would change to entire US Middle East policy by the US.<br>
<br>
Why do we want to stop Irak from having nuclear weapons again???  Why do we really want to stop them???  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah because they are bad people, that can't be trusted.<br>
<br>
Hrmm... didn't we say the same about the Russians once upon a time???  But we never attacked them, oh yeah they had nuclear weapons.<br>

Some of it is dead wrong, however most of the things applicable to exposure from DU ammo is good if not a little misleading because it's not put into perspective. The thing to take away from it is that yes DU is bad, but its not bad because it's radioactive, and it's not any worse than anything you encounter on a daily basis even in somewhere like Iraq. You get way more exposure just standing in the sun, breathing, standing next to a fire, smoking, in some places drinking the water, and a ton of other sources than you'd get from any kind of exposure from DU ammo. The only way DU is going to kill you is if a slug of it moseys your way going 4000 feet per sec.<br>
<br>
Most of the few problems associated with it in any form ammo or otherwise are because it's a heavy metal, and heavy metals are in general bad for people. The things not pointed out are what make people shit their britches in instances like this, and in the case of DU, the military could spray DU ammo around any major city for days and not come close to the heavy metal or radiation exposure levels inherent in the city's natural pollution. In that regard, you'd be better off worrying about the lead exposure from the hundreds of millions of normal rounds fired than the tens of thousands of DU rounds, and you'd be even better off than that worrying about the lead levels in your environment from pollution. You're exposed to this stuff all day every day, but people with an agenda like to play on people's ignorance and find something to pin on someone else to scapegoat all their problems onto. That's all this is.<br>

<br>
Yes, Iraq used to be an ally, and Iran an enemy.  Hmm...Germany, Italy, England, France, Japan....... all used to be the US's enemy.  What happened?  Oh ...but some of them didn't have nuclear weapons at the times of troubles.  Your nuclear theory is gone, next theory to be shot down please.<br>
<br>
And no, it isn't because the people of Iraq are bad people (as you so knowledgably TELL us how we feel about them) it's because Sadam is a fucking looney waiting for his chance to destroy life.<br>
<br>
Before you even think to try to throw your pathetic thoughts of how you are telling us that all American's think, get your facts straight first.<br>
<br>
You try to tell us that we are bad horrid people for trying to doctrine what others do.  Yet you come here and tell us how we feel about others, and how we should be.  Again, pot, kettle, FUCK YOU peon.<br>
<br>
The US and Russia didn't exchange friendly salvo's of nukes...why you might ask?  Well, not you Ariar, as you are by far a vastly superior intellect than any of us Americans... it's because they realized that they would end human existance.  Nuclear winter... I looked it up on w w w.dumbamericandictionary.org, and it dun told me what dat is.  It no good.<br>
<br>
So you are telling me that Palistine is the origin of suicide bombings?  Are we supposed to give you a gold star because of your fucked up twinge of a thought?  No boss...do you recall: Kamakazis?  Or maybe Vietnam (suicide bombings there)...sorry chief, Palastine did not &quot;originate&quot; suicide bombings.<br>
<br>
Do you just go thru each class in school, and learn: 2+2, and then US BAD, US BAD, US BAD.  Grow the fuck up, and try to actually realize that the American people are NOT one voice.  We don't all support every decision.  Nor do we condone them.<br>
<br>
As well...I'll be first in line to admit that not all the folks in Afgan wanted the WTC to be hit.  It was that coward osama and his goons.<br>
<br>
And to whoever tried using the: action/reaction theory...give me a break.  Tell me what the US did to deserve having her citizens targeted and murdered like they were. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoctraculapinkerton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Octracula Pinkerton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I put the O in Oh Shit Its That Guy.</span><br>  Posts: 1648<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 6:45:01 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bullshitjob.com/officespace/peter.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> Anyone else find it kind of ironic about how a bunch of foreigners are coming here telling a group of Americans how Americans in general think and see things? <br>

<br>
Any french fucker who posts on this thread, or any british fucker who posts on this thread is an asshole, period, your asses wouldnt be alive, like 70% of the forgeiners posting on this board if it wasnt for the US always coming to the rescue.<br>
<br>
Do you know the US is the only country that rebuilds a country they are in war with? We rebuilt Germany, Japan, Italy along with every other target. We have provided food/money/and medicine to those we get into fights with.<br>
<br>
So you piece of shits who want to live in ignorance, go for it, but your ass is only alive because of the power of America.<br>
<br>
In Japan when we dropped Atomic...not Nuclear bombs, we targeted large Military targets, it wasnt for terror purposes. <br>
<br>
We were in Vietnam on the whim of fucking moronic politicians we stayed their to make a profit for certain congressmen and presidents who had a nice opium trade going on. Vietnam was politicans sacraficing Americans, we constanly fought against superior numbers with an enemy on its home grounds, yet we still killed more of them then they killed of us. As for killing children in Vietnam, yeah so? They were used as sheilds, just like in Somillia, and children were given live grenades and told to run into american camps because the soilders wouldnt shoot them, yeah gotta love an enemy that uses it own children as weapons, Oh wait that is what some of the countries in the Middle East do....<br>
<br>
For the moron who is posting that our shells have radiated and killed one million children....are you sure you arent mistaken by the fucking fact that Saddamn used chemical weapons on his own fucking people? Plus this just seems to be some fucking stupid fucker throwing out some supposed information.<br>
<br>
Most of you are complete and total morons, seriously. Canada profits from living next to us, Mexico profits from us, fuck EVER FUCKING COUNTRY PROFITS FROM US, and you know what, most of the wars and shit you see are just scams to get more american money....like Africa refusing to eat our artifical corn....yes you are starving, so refuse help, what did they ask for though? MONEY, the leaders want millions of dollars to rebuild farms, who do they want it from? America...<br>
<br>
Our strength supports the world, you all cling desperatly to us for protection and direction.<br>
<br>
All you french fucks though posting in this, need to shut up, its been pretty much established france could be taken over by a strong breeze, and if it wasnt for the US saving your ass constantly, you would all be speaking german and eating frankfurters instead of crossaints.<br>
<br>
To the men and women serving the US, thank you, you risk your lives everyday protecting morons like Merton the sexually confused communist.<br>

I don't know about Irak, but if Iraq had nukes, they wouldn't have them for long cause Sadam would have them launched in a heart beat.<br>

Yes, Canada, Mexico, and other countries do profit from the USA, but the US profits from the same contries.  It's called free trade you fucktard.  And I don't see Milochovic saying &quot;Yes, I had millions of people killed just so I could get a few bucks from the US.   I'm sure going to need it when the UN is going to execute me for the war crimes I commited&quot;.  STFU guy.  You're making other Americans look bad.  And the whole GM food problem is a whole other story.  It has nothing to do with people not wanting American aid.<br>

When in fact I support what the US is trying to do.  Iraq should not have nuclear weapons, it's bad enough that Pakistan, India, Israel, and China has them.  BTW, Pakistan is more a ticking time bomb then Iraq.<br>
<br>
---<br>
&quot;Yes, Iraq used to be an ally, and Iran an enemy. Hmm...Germany, Italy, England, France, Japan....... all used to be the US's enemy. What happened? Oh ...but some of them didn't have nuclear weapons at the times of troubles. Your nuclear theory is gone, next theory to be shot down please.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hahaha! At the time those conflicts &gt;started&lt; there were no nuclear weapons on the planet.  You must have been asleep the day the teacher in debating class said points must be relevant, Huh?<br>
<br>
And of course you missed the point, what I am saying is that the US, as they should, behave differently against nations with nuclear weapons.<br>
