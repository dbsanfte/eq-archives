<br>
So let me get this straight. We say Iraq has WMD, including an active nuclear program, but the UN said there is no evidence. We tell them their inspectors suck and couldn't find their ass with both hands and that we need to go to war to defend ourselves. The UN doesn't back us, so we say &quot;fuck you - you are irrelevant&quot; and go to war on our own. We say the Iraqis will welcome us with open arms while the rest of the world wonders if Bush did inhale. <br>
<br>
So 6 months later we are in Iraq, knee deep in a guerilla war and the UN HQ gets blown to fuck. So what do we do? Use this event as an opportunity to get UN support (You remember those guys - the ones who were irrelevant and going down like the League of Nations) without giving up any authority to milk Iraq for all it's worth.<br>
<br>
C'mon in guys - we aren't going to give you a fair say, but we will let you share in the consequences of our royal fuck up!<br>
<br>
Does this administration's arrogance know no limits?<br>
<br>
WTF<br>
<br>
Personally I hope they tell us to go fuck ourselves. We have found no WMD, no nuclear program and we didn't use enough troops to do the job. We created this clusterfuck by being arrogant fucktards and now we want help without surrendering anything?<br>

So because of your hatred of the Bush administration and your hopefulness that they fail, during this first real opportunity of US seeking UN help you are abandoning your past hope that more countries join us so that the rebuilding process can go smoothly. <br>
<br>
Just last week you were screaming about how the Iraqis have no electricity or water and they're worse off than ever. Yet now, because of your hatred of the Bush administration, you hope that the UN tells us to go fuck ourselves so the Iraqis can suffer... and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>much more importantly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so we can suffer the punishment for ignoring the UN in the first place! &quot;The Iraqis! They have no electricty! They have no water! They're worse off than ever! We can't make the Iraqis' lives better on our own! But I sure as hell hope the UN tells us to go fuck ourselves!&quot;<br>
<br>
I've talked to people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>living</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in Iraq, Loegan. Have you? No matter their opinions on our actions pre-war, they sure as hell don't &quot;hope&quot; that the UN tells us to &quot;go fuck ourselves&quot;. They sure as hell do not give a damn about whether the US or the UN is &quot;in charge&quot; in Iraq. All they want is all the help they can get. They sure as hell do not want the US to suffer, with the penalty being that they themselves are forever doomed to lives of misery and an unnecessarily long reconstruction process. You, however, seem to be fine with that. <br>
<br>
This ain't about the war anymore, Loegan. It's about reconstruction. If you want the UN to tell us to go fuck ourselves and not help the Iraqis get their security back, fine. I hope they can work something out. So do millions in Iraq. But I think that's only because both me and the people of Iraq believe they should come first, while you on the otherhand think the fucking of ourselves should be first thing on everyone's mind.<br>
<br>
Continue on with your &quot;fair say&quot; nonsense.<br>

Until we are ready to make real concessions - absolutely. It's about time we swallowed our pride and quit making a bad situation worse. Iraq's democratization requires the legitimacy the UN can provide and maybe, just maybe, if the US wasn't up front in the faces of everyone acting like a bitchy wife who'll never admit to being wrong, this situation will start to settle down instead of escalating.<br>
<br>
Doesn't this administration's arrogance and general &quot;know-it-all&quot; attitude ever embarrass you? Even a little bit?<br>
<br>
EDIT<br>
<br>
BTW - Doesn't the fact that we were responsible for the UN HQ security register at all? This experiment of Rumsfeld's to see how much we can do on a shoe string force is not just killing Americans now, it's killing UN people. Somebody needs to step up to this fumble butt handling of Iraq and start bringing some sanity to the situation. Until they can expect some semblance of security, why should the UN wade even further into this mess with the US continuing to call all the shots? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A> at: 8/21/03 2:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dumai01>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Messiah of the Flameboard</span><br>  Posts: 574<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 4:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Iraq's democratization requires the legitimacy the UN can provide&quot;<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Until we are ready to make real concessions - absolutely.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So you're saying that we should concentrate on improving our relationship with the member nations of the UN over helping rebuild Iraq.  I'm sure the people there would not agree with that.<br>
<br>
And as far as that goes.. how many of those greedy motherfuckers in the UN wanted a piece of the rebuilding pie?  I seem to remember France wanting their post war hunk, as well as virtually every other member nation, scrambling to get their bids in to &quot;help&quot;.  Now we want formal help through the UN.  WHO is asking to get something for nothing here?  It isn't the US. Your hate of Bush is making you as much a Waffler as ol Billy Clinton was!<br>

Wow.. so we should beef up OUR security of the UN there and protect THOSE people over the Iraqi people?  They shouldn't be handling that for themselves?  Don't know about anyone else here.. but I'm frankly SICK of this kind of thing.  They should bring their sorry asses there to defend their own HQ.<br>
<br>
And once more.. you're talking as if the very organization you called useless and ineffectual a month or two ago is &quot;the answer&quot; for cleaning up Iraq.  Bullshit.  They aren't an &quot;organization&quot; so much as a clusterfuck of cowards unwilling to back up their own resolutions.

Not really.

What resolution would that be Dante? The one prohibiting WMD? Show me where they violated it. And while you are at it, show me where the UN was wrong in not backing this fiasco. Show me where France was wrong. <br>

You are such a Bush ass lick.

We can't even secure the UN HQ from a truck bomb FFS. This wasn't some guy with a dynamite belt that sneaked in somehow - this was a fuckin truck that got right under the building.

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Security around our location was not as secure as you might find at the U.S. compound, and that was a decision we made so the offices were available to the people,&quot; said chief UN spokesman Fred Eckhard, in comments that appeared to confirm the UN had refused U.S. help. &quot;We did not think at the time we were taking an unnecessary risk.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3797<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 6:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> Here's a hint - it was a flatbed truck loaded with a 500lb Soviet made bomb surrounded by numerous other bombs and munitions.

<br>
And Colin Powell just said he knew nothing about the rumors of the UN refusing US security. Either way, the power lines aren't secure, the oil piplines aren't secure, the water pipelines aren't secure and even the embassies aren't secure. Seems to me that after 5 months there isn't very much that is secure.<br>
<br>
I just hope Wesley Clark decides to run for President, because he is the one person who called this situation accurately from the git go.

So sorry I don't think that every other country should take it up the ass so the  US can maximize profits off Iraq. Let Bush get off his high horse and make concessions like a diplomat instead of shit talking like a high school QB and I am sure we'll get all the help we need. Otherwise they should tell us to take a flying  fuck. <br>
<br>
I think your problem is that you know as well as I do where the fault lies if we fail to get help and you don't like it.  By the sounds of what Powell said, there is no way this administration will make reasonable concessions. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A> at: 8/21/03 6:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2256<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 6:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this for real?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

If by substance you mean surfing the net for extremist links to support my arguments, I guess yer right, I never do that.  If you mean searching the news for links to bash opposing views, yer right, I never do that.  <br>
<br>
However, I disagree with your opinion that I do not provide substance to this forum, Look, I actually made you make a credible statement instead of a vague non-supported Bush bashing comment.  Do you see a difference??  Guess we disagree on what constitutes &quot;substance&quot;.  Perhaps you should quantify THAT.<br>

I don't give a fuck if Bush is right or  wrong.  That's what you really hate.  No one cares that you think he's Satan, and while people CAN see and are willing to admit he's not a GOOD president..   he's NOT Satan.<br>

You're constantly de-railing (when you aren't starting) threads just because Bush is mentioned SOMEWHERE, or can even be loosely connected.  Flameage aside..  you should consider seeking some kind of help.  You're increasingly irrational over that ONE subject.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  You KNOW which resolutions the UN didn't police, and if you want me to, I'll go to the threads and retreive your quotes agreeing the the UN is an inept and ineffectual organization.<br>

<br>
So you made me clarify what I meant by other countries taking it up the ass. Did it ever occur to you that anyone who reads the news knows exactly what I mean? Do you think deploying troops costs no money? Do you think supplying them costs no money? Do you think the risk vs reward is anywhere near worth it to other countries considering the US's attitude?<br>
<br>
Bush did nothing but berate and belittle the UN, but now that he needs to cover his ass so that he won't have to pull up a large number of reservists, he sends Powell to the UN to invite these countries to come help, which is fine if done with the right attitude, but he has the nerve to deny them any say in Iraq's affairs.<br>
