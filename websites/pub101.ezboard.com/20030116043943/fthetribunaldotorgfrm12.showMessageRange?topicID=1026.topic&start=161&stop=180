Countless bombing runs began to wear on Germanies ability to produce munitions and Vehicles and other weapons of war. <br>
<br>
The reason the Germans quickly stoped being able to fend off the massive but inferior Russian forces was because the industry to supply the demand of thier army was being destroyed. Piece by piece it was being taken apart by the U.S.<br>
<br>
What would have happened if the U.S.'s bombing runs had not knocked out alot of Germany's abiltiy to produce tanks? The Germans did have superior technology and equipment as compared to the Russians and even to the Americans. Alot of the reason the Germans became inept to defend themselves was because of the U.S.'s abosulte dominance over the skies. Wich lead to the destruction of Germany's formidable Industry.  <br>
<br>
And vis verse if the Russians were not detering the german army and not eating up money and time...Perhaps the Germans would have perfected thier new jet egines and defeated the older and inferior American bombers. Or worse they would have finsihed thier atomic testing. And then wed all be speaking German now.<br>
<br>
There is alot of what ifs......But there were many times in the war where sheer luck helped the Russians and the Americans. But at no time in the start of the war could it have been said Germany was &quot;sure&quot; to fall.<br>

If the best you can do is scream backpeddling for my not being clear on the issue and you're so called smugness in a technicality, I see I am dealing with mental midgets.  Oh wait, I'm arguing with Americans, that is a given.<br>
<br>
So let's see, how small was Israel before 1967?  How much land did Israel gain during the six day war and conceded back in 1973 and 74?  How many arab nations recognized the mere existene of Israel officially before the six day war and the subsequent skimishes in the years following?  Why did Egypt cut displomatic ties with the US after the 6 day war?  Who gave Israel all those weapons to start this cluster fuck in the first place?  <br>
<br>
What?  You don't know the answers?  Pull your head out of your asses and learn something other than what you are currently reading in your high school textbook.  <br>
<br>
So are you denying that the US hasn't been fucking around with the Middle East?  Gee, I guess these arabs hate the US because they make pretty movies then.  Obviously there is no reason to hate the US, they are a kind and lovey dovey force for the world.  Ha.  I suppose Americans are even more stupid than I thought, which would explain the quality of educational scores evidenced in your national testing.<br>
<br>
So, you people are just like the Americans I described, you have a thumb up your asses and are wondering Why oh why did these Terrorists crash these huge airplanes into our buildings???  Wake up to reality.<br>

The T-34 gave the Germans a nasty shock ! Although it can be considered a development of the BT series, the T-34/76 is actually a major redesign : more armour protection, wide tracks, a powerful engine, and a great gun. With these features, it outclassed all the German tanks in service in 1941.<br>
In response to the German invasion (Operation Barbarossa), a mass of T-34 streamed from the newly built Tankograd production plant : from 1940 to 1945 more than 40,000 T-34s (of all models) were delivered. Hurriedly built and poorly finished by western standards, the T-34/76 was nevertheless a superb fighting machine.<br>
Throughout its life, the T34 design was subject to various changes. From the early two-man, hexagonal-shaped all welded turret with a short barrelled gun, it passed to a larger cast steel turret (with a cupola for the commander) and a longer-barrelled gun.<br>
In 1943, as the existing panzers couldn't adequately oppose against the T-34/76, the Germans were forced to develop a new tank : the Panther.  <br>
<br>
 T-34/85<br>
Weight : 32.0 ton<br>
Dimensions:8.15 x 3.0 x 2.6 mt<br>
Armor (max) : 90 mm<br>
Range : 360 km<br>
Speed (max - route) : 55 km/hr<br>
Main gun : 85 mm<br>
Crew : 4 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The T-34/85 tank was first produced during the winter of 1943-44. It was actually developed by mounting a cast steel turret, originally developed for the KV-85 heavy tank, on a virtually unchanged T-34/76 hull. <br>
The wide tracks enabled the T-34/85 to cross every type of terrain, including soft mud and snow, giving to the tank the capacity to operate where Germans couldn't even travel.<br>
The T-34/85 combat career lasted, in various countries, more than 40 years, as it was still in line during the 1980s in Africa, former Yugoslavia and Albania.  <br>

The T-34 wasn't anything to laugh at.  It definately surpassed the Sherman.  Back in WWII, Russians built things with quality, rather than quanitity.  (well as best they could)  Since resources were rare, they had to do the best with what they had.  It wasn't until much later, don't know when, when the Russians developed the &quot;Quanity over Quality&quot; military method.  While during WWII, the US had plenty of resources to burn, so we went with Quantity over Quality.  It wasn't until much later, that we switched to Quality over Quantity.  I'd guess this was because our country hadn't really had a large standing army, since we don't have borders that need patrolling and what not.  So we'd rather have the small army we had, be better equiped, than have tons of toys. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulomanforeversong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loman Foreversong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/26/02 8:47:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All you French dick-wicks</span><hr size=1> How do the French work like 6 hours a day, 4 days a week.<br>

<br>
I'm pretty sure Pren wouldn't just randomly make that up, while I believe you could be warned for training/KSing, Karenne.  Although, if anyone would get warned for that type of stuff, it would be me you'd think.  But it only happened once when I was KSing a newb's DF belts.  Hah.<br>

<br>
What has the United States done to take your freedoms?<br>
<br>
You are an australian correct?  Japan was poised to take australia with almost no resistance.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the United States protected the world from communism throughout the cold war.<br>
<br>
I can back up my stance with historic facts.  You will back up yours with what?  An unsigned kyoto protocol  and ICC?  Please.<br>
<br>
What has australia done for the US recently?  Other than provide token military support in the war on terror.<br>

I don't believe someone is making arguments about how stupid Americans are, while spouting unresearched, incorrect information.  First off, Israel.  The Islamic religion states that the Jews will never have a homeland.  That is why they never had a country before modern day.  We helped them become a country by giving them the ability to defend themselves, but not because we're the big bad US, but because a bible entry stating that a people shouldn't be allowed to have a land isn't a good enough reason to slaughter them whenever they try to.  They should, and they WILL have a country.  If you don't like that, too bad, deal with it.  Secondly, the Middle Eastern countries we have problems with don't hate us because we allow Israel to exist.  They hate us because of our religion, and because of our culture.  Our policies are just an excuse.  The US was created on Christian beliefs.  The Crusades were Muslims vs Christians, and they've been at war for.. not years, not decades, centuries.  We &quot;infected&quot; their lands by instilling idealisms that went against their culture and religion.  Their women began to try to live a life better then that of a slave to their man.  Their children began to try to live amongst the Christians and Jews because in a world such as the one we live in, it's alot harder to hate just because you're taught to.  I suggest you go do some research instead of reading these boards all day.  Do a search on Crusades on the web or something and start there.  Maybe then you'll have a better idea of why we're in the world situation we're in.  Otherwise, you might as well just fess up that you didn't learn as much in school as someone raised (but not born) in the US of A.<br>
