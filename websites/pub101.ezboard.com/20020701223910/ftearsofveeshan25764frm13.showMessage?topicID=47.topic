Candra never doubted there was more than a little truth to the proverb. However, with that acknowledgment came the thought that she was lacking, overall, in virtue. She couldn't help but giggle as she considered the thought and its implications on the present moment.<br>
        &quot;Milady, ye must be still!” came a surprisingly meaty voice considering the source. The source was a rather smallish gnome matron (short even by gnomish standards) with stark white hair worn in a tight bun and a face lined by her life's many years. Her dark-colored eyes were shaped by her attention to detail and experience as a critic; narrow and slightly angled. The tiny features set to her face weren't wholly devoid of warmth. She had rosy cheeks, a whimsical upturned nose and thin lips that held a slight smile even as she was chastising Candra. &quot;How can I do a proper fitting when ye refuse to be still?&quot;<br>
        Candra rolled her eyes playfully 'round and did her best to not giggle. &quot;Please forgive me, Syntiki. My wondering thoughts led me to a moment's amusement.&quot;<br>
        Syntiki didn't seem to care so much about Candra's daydreams. Her attentions were focused on the gown she labored to complete. She replied to Candra with a firm &quot;Humph!” Such a reply threatened to restart Candra's laughter all over again, but another voice broke through to warn the woman away from further distraction.<br>
        &quot;Candace,&quot; the calling of her given name took Candra by surprise. So softly spoken, it was barely more than a whisper. The sound slipped into her ear and slinked around her mind and captured her complete attention. &quot;Mistress Syntiki's skill as a tailor is without par. Her creations are works of art and genius. Please be more considerate of her time and talent.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes, grandmother.&quot;<br>
        Like her grand-daughter, Perendra Raslemtar was an enchantress by vocation. She was, in fact, a &quot;Beguiler&quot;, Mistress of her Art. She was also matron of Candra's maternal family. &quot;Very good then, dear. No doubt your wedding gown will be a wondrous creation.&quot;<br>
        Poised atop a short base, Candra looked about the fitting room as much as she could without moving too much. She used a large mirror opposite her to make up for her lack of mobility. As a young girl, Candra loved visiting Perendra's private sitting room. Most guests of the estate were received in a salon off the main hall or the library, but the most honored and important guests were led to this space. Candra could only wonder about the deals, intrigues and pacts the room had hosted over the many years.<br>
        With its tall windows and sumptuous furnishings, the room held a fanciful quality that still impressed the younger enchantress as being a little larger than life. It had been the venue of many tea parties when Candra was a young girl. Good memories shared only by Perendra, herself and few tight-lipped chimerical guests conjured into attendance. Today it was the venue for her the fitting of her own wedding gown. The guest list was brief; her grandmother and herself; plus the seamstress, Syntiki and her young gnome assistant. A human servant moved quietly about seeing to the foursome's needs.<br>
        Syntiki stood upon a stool making alterations to the gown's bodice as her assistant addressed the trained hem. Syntiki did all the talking for the duo. &quot;Ye'll have a fine dress indeed, Candra. I think this is m'best work yet.&quot; <br>
        Candra could sense the welling of pride in the gnome's voice. She beamed a smile at Syntiki and inclined her head in a very slight nod, &quot;It's so beautiful. You're a miracle worker for sure.&quot;<br>
        The blush in Syntiki's cheeks warmed a few shades and her perpetual smile crested deeply. The assistant could be heard from behind giggling.<br>
        The swishing of layers of skirts heralded Perendra's steps as she came to stand before Candra, cutting off the bride-to-be's line of sight to her own reflection. The elder enchantress took a long, studious look at the gown and the woman it dressed. &quot;Such an amazing gown, Syntiki.&quot; She looked up into Candra's eyes as she made the compliment. To Candra, Perendra represented the quintessential ‘grand dame’ of the civilized world. She displayed an ageless beauty that could never be mistaken for youth. Though her face bared faint lines of age, her deep blue eyes gleamed with wisdom and humor. Her long, dark hair lent her an air of mystery. She was dressed simply, as befits a woman of her age and character and moved with certain grace and dignity. Candra could not help but wonder how much of what she looked upon was real and how much of it was just a trick of magic. <br>
        Perendra looked away from Candra's curious expression to Syntiki with a question of her own, &quot;Are you sure that 'white' is appropriate? This is, after all, my grand-daughter's second wedding. I doubt anyone will be fooled much into believing...&quot;<br>
        Candra cut the woman off before the thought could be fully expressed - though, in truth, the point was made. &quot;It's my thought that counts, grandmother. I shall have my white dress.&quot;<br>
        &quot;But, dear…&quot;<br>
        &quot;No 'buts', please.&quot; Candra warned, &quot;My love for Galain is innocent and pure even if my morals aren't considered as such. This marriage, grandmother, is for love and not politics, as the first was.&quot;<br>
         Perendra took a step back from Candra's stern speech and inclined her head in a slight bow. &quot;Of course, dear. I didn't mean to imply anything salacious. I simply wanted to remind you that as it is your second wedding you are no longer bound to such a traditional choice of color. You are at liberty to select any color you desire.&quot; That said, she turned, angling herself to return the bride-to-be's view of her reflection. &quot;You will make a radiant bride no matter what color you select.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Then I shall make a beautiful bride in 'white', thank you.&quot; She thought her reflection made a great portrait of a future moment. A beautiful, raven haired bride dressed in a beautiful snow white gown. Who cared what everyone else thought?<br>
        An odd tension filled the air and silence prevailed for a long few minutes. The gnomes seemed in better spirits for it. Perendra returned to her seat where she supped on a fragrant cup of tea. Candra sought to put the whole matter behind her by finding suitable distraction. She found herself staring into the mirror again. <br>
        Candra didn't like what she saw in hr reflection. She was so angry and so defiant. It showed in her eyes and the slight pout shaping her lips. It was in here shoulders and her breaths. She drew in a breath to collect it all and released them slowly into the room's still air. Most of her young life had been wasted on other people's dreams for her and so few on her own ideas about what she wanted to be. The old days of childhood insecurities were behind her now. She was self-assured, alive and would not be restrained.<br>
        A song hummed into her ears and interrupted the thoughts swimming in her mind. Its rhythm and lilt were oddly familiar, though Candra could not place where or when she'd heard it before. Without thinking, she turned on the source with a suddenness. &quot;What is that song?&quot;<br>
        Syntiki's assistant fell back, frightened by such a dramatic turn. Her employer's mirth disappeared as she berated Candra in the unusual cant of her native tongue. Perendra casually set her tea to the table and stood to affect the role of diplomat or peace-bringer. <br>
        Candra focused on the assistant who was already retreating. She waved at the other two women without looking at them, demanding their silence and getting her way. She knew her actions and tone were severe, and that they frightened the girl. Still, she couldn't help herself. Her heartbeat raced, drumming against her chest and her pulse quickened. She didn't understand what was happening to her, but every one of her instincts directed Candra to the song. Had she been bespelled? What magic had the gnome used? She wondered about these things and more despite the fact that her senses had not detected such.<br>
        Fearing the enchantress' the assistant ceased her efforts to escape and prostrated herself at Candra's feet. Her words were lost to the fitful sobbing that had overtaken her. To this Candra sighed. She knelt down before the tearful assistant and attempted to relax her mind with a soft touch and warm-sounding apologies. &quot;There there...&quot; Candra said as she put a hand on the other's tear-moistened chin and lifted the girl's face to see her own smile. In the moment that their eyes met, the assistant became Candra's thrall. The enchantress did her best to speak kindly. “Be still now, you silly girl and tell me of the song uttered from your lips.”<br>
        The sobbing stopped immediately and the girl's eyes were suddenly clear, almost blank. Caught in the mesmerizing power of Candra's violet eyes she could do naught else but as she was bid, &quot;It's just a song taught to me by me own mum...'Flora's Secret' they call it.&quot;<br>
        “A spell?!” Syntiki’s features slackened and her face suddenly ashen. “I’ll have no part of this!” She turned to leave the room, but Candra’s spell caught her before she could put a hand on the latch. Her will was no longer her own.<br>
        Perendra watched the whole event without reaction or expression. She seemed resigned to the roles of observer and critic. “Rather messy, don’t you think?” She asked her granddaughter earnestly.<br>
        Candra ignored the older woman’s wit. She walked past her without as much as a word to stand nearer to Syntiki. She ordered the gnome to face her, and then looked deeply into her eyes. “You arrived at my grandmother’s home early this morning to complete the alterations for my wedding gown. You made successful gains towards that end, but was overcome by a painful headache that forced you to end the fitting abruptly. I thanked you heartily for the time you and your assistant put in on my behalf and we rescheduled for early tomorrow afternoon.”<br>
        Perendra said nothing as Candra turned on the assistant and then her own servant to re-construct their memories as well. She merely observed the whole event without comment or interaction. The wry, slight grin at her lips spoke volumes.<br>
        Candra tied up all the loose ends and then released the women’s wills. She played the role of blushing bride-to-be as the tailors made their earnest apologies and said their goodbyes. She praised the servant for her duties as well, and promised to reward the woman for her hard work. In the end, it was just the two enchantresses in the sitting room with tea on the table. Perendra took a seat and bid her granddaughter to join her.<br>
        Candra bore the weight of her grandmother’s gaze as she crossed the room to join her at the table. Her mind was still reeling from all that had just transpired. She wasn’t sure how she would hold up to the elder woman’s scrutiny. To be honest, she didn’t know how to explain what had happened at all.<br>
        Perendra made small talk as she poured the tea. She commented on the weather and upcoming Beltaine festival. She even offered up a suggestion that the wedding take place just prior to the nighttime fertility festival as a means to supplicate the gods and receive the blessings of a child at the start of their union. <br>
        Candra wasn’t sure what to make of it all. For one, she had no plans on children for the near or far future. Then two, why was she making small talk after all that had occurred. Candra sat there in stillness with the pungent scent of the tea under her nose and her gaze beaming over the elegant tea set upon the table. Her violet gaze was deadlocked with Perendra’s. It was an amazing act of defiance to hold such a contest with a Beguiler of Perendra’s power and experience. Candra was comfortable with that risk.<br>
        “Is there a problem, dear?” Perendra asked in nonchalant tones and took a sip from her cup.<br>
        “No,” she lied, and then thought better of herself. “Actually, that’s not true. I just...don’t understand how you can sit there and pretend that nothing’s happened.”<br>
        Perendra shared a thoughtful look with her grandchild and smiled at her with practiced warmth, “You mean your little episode, of course. Well, that was certainly something now, wasn’t it?” She returned her cup to the table before asking the question, “What was that about, exactly?”<br>
        “I don’t know,” was all Candra had to say in reply. She pushed for the question to be asked and now shied away from explaining herself. Worse still, she felt defensive.<br>
        The Beguiler wasn’t at all impressed with that answer as she commented, “Oh where’s that fire now, Candace? That passion you always uphold as the core of your very being?”<br>
        Candra caught the hint of an insult being thrown her way. “When I was a child you told me that my passion is the truest part of my fae spirit. That it is the legacy of my ancestors.”<br>
        “You’re no child, Candace. Passion without discipline is nothing but chaos.”<br>
        “I follow my instincts!”<br>
        “You act on your impulses.” Perendra remained cool despite the heat of Candra’s flaring temper.<br>
        “I live life to the fullest...”<br>
        “But without regard to the consequences, and believe me little charmer – they will come about regardless of what you do. Your youth will pass you by quicker than you think and in time you will learn that your little philosophy of having fun while you can will only lead to regret.”<br>
        Candra shot out of her chair, sending it tumbling backwards. Her eyes began to sparkle with a low luminescence, like fiery amethysts. “Would it be better for me to hide behind the illusion of youth as you do, playing politician as my life passes me by?” The words darted out of her mouth with a venomous tone.<br>
        The question posed shattered Perendra’s confident demeanor. It hurt her and the pain showed in her face. She stood from her seat in a smooth, boneless motion and turned towards the door to leave. <br>
        Candra wished she hadn’t said what did. Ah, here’s the regret she spoke of. “Grandmother, please...” she wanted to apologize, but that effort was halted by a dismissive wave of Perendra’s hand.<br>
        “We will speak again in the morning, after we have both taken time to relax our minds.” Without further word, Perendra opened the door and crossed over its threshold into the hall beyond.<br>
        Candra lingered in the room’s stillness for a few minutes before shedding the unfinished gown for her own robes. Afterwards she found herself waiting, to be sure that her grandmother was gone from the hall. When she was certain of that, Candra quickly made her way through and out of the grand home of her childhood.<br>
<br>
                                 * * * * *<br>
        It wasn’t until a few hours past the time when the coachman delivered Candra to her own home that she began to relax. As the sun above Felwithe had begun its descent towards the horizon, Candra undressed and lay down over the sheets that dressed her bed. They smelled of Galain. She realized that she’d forgotten to instruct the maid to change the bedding and was grateful for her own forgetfulness. Her lover was gone from her to tour some far away land for adventure and greater understanding of his own craft. <br>
        Candra gathered up the top layer of bedding by handfuls and pulled it towards her. She took it into her arms and held it close. She longed for the company of Galain’s stable mind and strong arms. His scent alone was a poor stand-in, but one the enchantress cherished.<br>
        As sleep overtook her, Candra imagined her lover beside her, and then above her. Their bodies moved in perfect rhythm towards an inevitable climax of passion. He held onto her still, playing his fingers through her hair.<br>
        “Sing for me, my pet.” He pleaded with her and she could not resist him.<br>
        <br>
        Lover’s in the long grass<br>
        Look above them<br>
        Only they can see <br>
             Where the clouds are going<br>
        Only to discover<br>
        Dust and sunlight<br>
        Ever make the sky so blue<br>
<br>
Her voice was as beautiful as the song she sang, but somehow alien. She was too enrapt with the music to give it much thought. She continued to sing.<br>
        <br>
        Afternoon is hazy<br>
        River flowing<br>
        All around the sounds <br>
             Moving closer to them<br>
             Telling the story<br>
             Told by Flora<br>
             Dreams they never knew<br>
<br>
Something about the song struck her as odd, but she was too intoxicated, drunk on Galain’s affection like it was whiskey. She smiled into his face and told him that she loved him, to which he replied:<br>
        “As I love you, Zaria.”<br>
        Candra looked up at him in shock, unsure of what to say. Galain simply smiled at her and continued to play his hands through her luxurious snow-white mane.<br>
        She leapt out of the bed which she only now realized wasn’t her own. A veil of silky white hair fell over her eyes, obscuring her vision. When she lifted it away from her view she was no longer in the strange bedroom, but a heroes’ hall. All ‘round were men and women of different races and vocations. Each held a fist to their breast and was turned to a dais that was the focal point of the room. Upon the pedestal stood a woman dressed in a radiant, white robe so bright that it was hard for Candra to look upon her without narrowing her gaze.<br>
        The tailor’s song hummed in Candra’s ears as she made her way to dais. It was nothing more than a distraction, she thought; nothing more than another obstacle, like all those people barring her from a closer view of the woman in the white robes. As she pressed forward, Candra caught something strange out of the corner of her eye. Instinct took over and she turned her head to spy the oddity full on.<br>
        Her eyes flashed wide as she spied an army of monstrous shadows running along the walls of the room. Hints of the grotesque could be made for their form and the wicked shapes of the weapons they bore. Fear gripped Candra’s mind and heart. She screamed! No one heard her.<br>
        How can they not see? How can they not notice?!<br>
        The attentions of the gathered were completely focused on the woman in the white robe. They were completely enrapt and saw nothing save her visage, heard nothing but her words. The only way to make them aware of the danger was to get to the woman.<br>
        Candra moved swiftly, navigating through the crowd ‘til finally she reached the fore of the assembled. The shadows were looming closer still. There was no time to waste. She jumped onto the dais, screaming as she ran at the woman. <br>
             The shadows were already descending when she turned to face Candra. It was a surreal moment as she laid eyes on her. She was a High Elf and bore the same ageless beauty that her grandmother used magic to create; a pale, flawless complexion and fine features framed by utterly straight white hair fell over her shoulders to waist length. Candra tried to find the words to warn her of the dangers at hand, but could not find words or even thoughts for that matter. She was caught, enthralled by the woman’s gaze. Eyes as violet as...her own!<br>
             They held her still as the blade bit through her flesh.<br>
<br>
                                   * * * * *<br>
Candra awoke to darkness. No flames lit the night. For a moment she thought the stillness and the dark was death, but she came to her senses and realized the strangeness was nothing but a dream. “It felt like so much more...” she muttered to no one at all. <br>
              In her heart Candra knew that there was more to the nightmare. Exactly how much more was the mystery she was determined to solve.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucandraverbena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Candra Verbena</A> at: 6/18/02 9:06:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uicariaq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IcariaQ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 6:54:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Visions of the FuturePast, Part I</span><hr size=1> *swoon* <p><table width="80%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Icaria Quellarion<br>53rd Season Enchantress<br>
