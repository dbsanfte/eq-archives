Doesn't matter, cause when you did I would post articles that showed evidence to the opposing view, which was really my point. At this point we are not sure. What we can be sure of however, is that if a gene is found to be repsonsible for homosexuality and they find a way to screen for it, alot of parents are going to be aborting. That's why many homosexual groups oppose this type of research.<br>

There is alot of destructive behaviour that teens do and get alot of flack for it. Sometimes it's the need to be a martyr that drives them, sometimes it's the rebel pahse and sometimes it's just the allure of doing something taboo. Just because it causes conflict for the person, doesn't mean they didn't choose it.<br>

But can a complete lack of that instinct be considered an instict as well? Can something that is not based on survival or a species survival be considered instinct?<br>
<br>
I do completely agree with you that environment will increase or decrease the number of practicing homos. Like say ancient Greece or  say a prison. Or especially an ancient Greece prison, wowser.<br>
<br>
And that brings up many fun questions. Does an environment that better fosters homosexual activity bring out people who are indeed gay or makes more heteros try it out? I suppose they are not mutually exclusive, but I find it hard to believe that people would pass the point of acceptable experimenting to completely gay, no opposite sex over environment alone, because of the instinct you talked about.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you, do you see any current environment that you think you could be thrust into or have been brought up in that would have made you, with your entire genetic makeup prefer to exclusively have sex with men and lose the instinct to have females? <p><BR>

<br>
As to enviroment, I think it may seem like there are more gays, but only because more come out of the closet in an open atmosphere. Most of what I have read puts the percentage of homosexuals at 10% of the population pretty conisistantly through the ages, which suggests defect to me.<br>
<br>
Then again, I have no idea how they can know what percentage of the population was gay 50 years ago, let alone 300 years ago, so who knows. <p><br>

<br>
Most homosexual groups support this type of research. Why? Because it will stop stupid ignorant fucks like yourself from making fun of people because you think sexuality is a choice. Heredity or environment? I don't know. What I do know is there is no fucking way I would chose to be a gay male in this society. I have no martyr complex, I have absolutely no problem getting chicks to have sex with me, I wasn't molested as a child, hell I never had sex with a man til this year. I wasn't a mommas boy, daddy wasn't too loving or not loving enough, I don't like Babs or Eliza, Bette or Judy, I have no fashion sense, I am not feminine in any way. To tell the truth, I don't get along with gay people at all. <br>
<br>
Why am I saying this all? /shrug <br>
<br>
What I can tell you is there is no fucking way I would choose to be gay. Do you realize what it's like? Do you know how much it actually hurts to hear people fling around the words gay and fag as derogatory terms? For the people who say gay as a derogatory term and gay referring to sexuality are different you need to pull your head out of your asses and think about it. You know how using that term to descibe something lame came about? Because the word straight was being used to describe something good. Obviously straight is the opposite of gay, so gay was used to be bad. Captain obvious here I know, but a lot of people don't piece that together. Our grand fucking society today tells you that if you are gay it's a defect, and you deserve to be ridiculed and made fun of. Is it a defect? Possibly, but do you go up to people with down's syndrome and call them a retard? Do you go up to autistics and confuse them to laugh at them? Maybe you do, Loegan, I don't know. But until you find out if it IS a defect or environment I think you need to shut your gaping maw and stay out of conversations before you turn into that hypocrite you have been accused of and really don't want to be. <br>
<br>
I didn't choose to be gay, but I choose to be proud. Not because I am gay, but because I have made it through life with ignorant fucks as a lot of you seem to be, and haven't killed myself or went crazy. Take a long hard look at yourselves. Do you like to hurt people you don't even know by slinging around terms like faggot and gay. I'm talking everyday life here and not the flameboard. <br>
<br>
<br>
Do you like making people's who, for the most part, have no choice in the matter, lives a living hell? If you do, then you are a hypocrite for criticising me or anyone else for sleeping with the same sex. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 764<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 1:06:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=829.topic&index=136>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the fuck is up with the Vagrants?</span><hr size=1> Camthan, I am sorry if my comments have hurt you, because I know I have made my share of gay comments. But I would be lying if I said I don't find gay parades hilarious or said that flamers don't irk the shit out of me.<br>
<br>
I laugh at sado-masochist (sp?), drag queens, hookers and people jerking off and any other number of sexually related things. As offensive as it might be to some, it is not malicious... insensitive, but not malicious.<br>
<br>
So, while I may make comments that offend you, I hope you also realize I would not deny you a job, deny you housing or support harassing you or running you out of town. I have a sister who's lesbian and an ex-wife who's bi, both of whom I love and would defend if their rights or well being was threatened. <br>
<br>
But all that being said, I will still be a guy who makes gay comments and laughs at flamers. Dunno what that makes me, but it's who I am. <p><br>
