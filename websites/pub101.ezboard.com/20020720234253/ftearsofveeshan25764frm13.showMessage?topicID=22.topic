I was born the son of a rogue, who happened to<br>
be quite infamous throughout the realms.I was the result of a liasion with a foul <br>
necromancer. Not too long after my birth both were apprehended by the authorities and <br>
sentenced to death for their crimes against society. I too would have met that fate, <br>
were it not for the intervention of a kindly old man. He suggested that perhaps I <br>
could still be redeemed, were I raised in a more wholesome environment. From that <br>
day on, my life would be forever changed.<br>
     I was sent to be raised by the warrior priests of Mithaniel Marr. At first, due to<br>
my young age I had no concept of what this meant.<br>
     As the years progressed, I was constanty ridiculed due to my heritage, and found <br>
myself in constant conflict with several of the pupils. This of course frequently errupted<br>
in physical violence, which was punished severely. As the priests were harsh taskmasters <br>
where their wards were concerned. <br>
     Upon reaching my majority, I railed against the priests and left the temple. I <br>
was unsure where I belonged in life and felt I could do better than the life they had <br>
arranged for me. I spent much time hireing myself out as a sell-sword to various merchants<br>
in order to guard their cargo. During this time, while traveling with a caravan bound for <br>
Freeport, I became grieviously injured. Were it not for the swift action of my employer, <br>
I would surely have perished. He brought me to the cleric guild in Freeport where my life <br>
was saved. One of the clerics who attended me, recognized who I was, from my time spent at<br>
the Paladin hall. <br>
     During my period of recovery, I had much time for reflection on my life thus far. <br>
I looked back on the constant evils that I had been forced to defend myself against as a <br>
sell-sword. I realized that as a sell-sword I had been quite lucky, but my life lacked <br>
purpose, it lacked direction. Upon full recovery, I returned to the Paladin Guild-Hall,<br>
and petitioned to be re-accepted into the fold. After much deliberation on the matter I <br>
was accepted. I then devoted myself completely to my studies and came to gradually <br>
realize that this was where I belonged. This was the purposed that I had searched for.<br>
I was meant to combat the evils that plagued Norrath, in the name of truth. I had no <br>
doubt that this would be a protracted battle, but I could not, and will not let evil <br>
over-run the good citizens of this realm.<br>
     As of this writing, I have risen to the 38th level of service to Mithaniel Marr, but <br>
the battle has only just begun. I have met several commrades along the way, and though they <br>
may serve a different God, our purpose is the same. So we deemed it beneficial to join <br>
together to combat these evils that pervade the realms.<br>
