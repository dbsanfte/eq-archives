If you think for a second the Russians had the Wehrmacht beat and were &quot;pushing them back into Germany&quot; at the time of the Normandy invasion, then it's gonna be a pretty damn loud pop when you finally pull your head out of your ass.<br>
<br>
Theres only 2 things that stopped the Wehrmacht from crunching it's way right the fuck to mongolia. The T-34 tank, and the Russian winter. The T-34 made them run out of ammo trying to kill a solid chunk of pig iron on tracks (unlike the paper mache Grants and such we had over there), and the winter froze their asses to death. The ONLY thing that allowed what had become a static front to move west AT ALL was the fact that forces had to be taken from the East to once again fight in the West. Before the invasion, the fight in the west was absolutely fucking over. They didn't have to put shit for resources there since they had most of the govenments under their thumbs anyway to 'govern themselves'. Enter 200,000 British, Canadians, and 'stupid Americans' and now they have a problem on their hands. They're suddenly fighting a two front war with the two fronts 2500 miles apart, Oopsie! Can you say Logistical Nightmare? THAT is what took the heat off the Russians, allowing them to regroup and advance.<br>
<br>
The smartest thing Hitler ever did for the Allied cause was attack Russia. One thing I definitely will say about the Russians is they put the fear of God in him. When it came to which side he wanted to hold more after France was invaded, he wanted to hold the Eastern front. He was not afraid of the fresh faced GI's and ass-tired British who may occupy his country and waggle fingers at his people. He was afraid of the Russians who still remembered Stalingrad, Leningrad, and the Urals and wanted to come over there and turn Germany into a fucking parking lot and rightly so.<br>
<br>
To say the Western Allies didn't do much is complete horseshit. You can act the historian, but you're talking out your ass buddy.

One of the scariest WW2 facts for me was the non-agression pact Hitler and Stalin had signed (secretly).  If Hitler hadn't broken it the war (and the world) would likely have a very different face.<br>

<br>
This is the most ignorant steaming pile of bullshit that relegates this entire conflict to a tank model and winter?<br>
<br>
First of all, practically the entire tank park of the Soviet army (~20,000 tanks) had been destroyed in the opening months of the war. which allowed for moderately easy progress during the summber of 41.  The t-34 didnt make a significant difference until the battle of moscow when the siberian divisions were brought up as last ditch reserves from the Far East front and the greater impact was made after Stalingrad since during late 1942-early 1943 is when the USSR rebuilt majority of its tank park.  The t-34 was not even produced in significant numbers to make an impact until 43 and at that time the original cannons had to be reworked from the 75 mm cannon installed on the original model that became obsolete by early 1943 and had to be up graded 2 ways, once to a 76.2 mm cannon and then again to an 85 mm cannon with reinforced chassis.  <br>
<br>
Basically, the T-34 was not produced in significant numbers to make an impact until the USSR turned the tide of war already.  And the problem was not of germans &quot;running out of ammunition to kill a solid chunk of pig iron&quot;  That is the dumbest statement I have ever heard regarding war on the Eastern Front.  USSR was using sloped armor on the front panells of the T-34 chassis.  Its not that the armor was so thick that it was impossible to penetrate, it was because it was so cleverly designed.  And finally.  The Kirov Works mode l 1 tank (KV-1) had better armor and armament up until the 1943 models of the T-34.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The ONLY thing that allowed what had become a static front to move west AT ALL was the fact that forces had to be taken from the East to once again fight in the West. Before the invasion, the fight in the west was absolutely fucking over. They didn't have to put shit for resources there since they had most of the govenments under their thumbs anyway to 'govern themselves'. &quot; --Maxx<br>
<br>
Lets review some basic facts.  June 22, 1941 germany invades USSR and proceeds in the span of 6 months to demolish and encircle a good portion of their armed forces and make it to miles within Moscow by December.  Zhukov launches a counterattack with the FAr East front divisions that were brought up for Siberia and germans pull back.<br>
Then basically Soviets and germans sit with their thumbs up their asses for 2-3 months until germans launch their spring/summer offensive to get to the oil fields at Caucasus.  Army GroupSotuh demolishes the russian forces making incredible gains until it reaches the Volga.  At this point Army group South splits into Army Group A(AGA) and Army Group B (AGB).  AGA proceeds to the Caucasus mountains to take the oil fields while AGB is ordered to take Stalingrad and then wheel north along the Volga behind Russian lines.<br>
<br>
By August of 1942, AGB aka the 6th army invades Stalingrad.  After a 4 month struggle in the city, Soviets finally launch a counterattack on Nov. 23, 1942 along the north flank and south flank of the 6th army effectively encircling it in 4 days.  The russian winter freezes the germans to death as paulus refuses to break out of the cauldron and Manstein/Hoth are unsuccessful in penetrating the ring at Southwestern point, yada yada yada.  ~ 90,000 german prisoners is whats left alive of the 6th army, a major military and political victory for the allies as Hitler is denied the capture of Stalin's city and his best army is annihillated.  Now that AGB has been destroyed, this leaves AGA in a very bad situation.  The encirclement of the AGB leaves them cut off from the main front line while the russians try to wittle down the encircled 6th army.  By February of 43, 6th army surrenders, so the germans and soviets engage in a bunch of minor front skirmishes up until the summer of 1943 when hitler decided to gamble on kursk salient.  Kursk is directly related to Stalingrad.  At stalingrad, germany is delivered a major political defeat(albeit their military losses were fairly high) but at Kursk, the entire backbone of the Wehrmacht would be borken.  In summer of 1943, ensues the largest tank battle in history of warfare totalling about ~3,000 tanks engaged for both sides.  Germany is delivered a smashing defeat.  Now, After the summer of 43 (Battle of Kursk) the German Army would NEVER mount a major offensive operation in the east ever again.  At which point to take advantage of wehrmacht's vulnerable position, the USSR begins rapidly proceeding forward.  Roughly by the same time as US invaded normandy, USSR had captured parts of finland and karelian peninsula and had entered Poland.  Germans were basically pushed out of USSR by the time of D-Day invasion.  There was NO static front.<br>
<br>
If you have any more questions, please consult me or your local library.  Furthermore, it is this kind of arrogance, righteousness and total lack of actual information that makes people doubt American schools.  <br>

I'm sorry but no, I do not have any 'questions' for you. It's already obvious that youre answers are nothing but smoke, mirrors, and fiction. Let's review 'your facts':<br>
<br>
-There was no static front at the Urals in 1944.<br>
<br>
You started out talking about the Eastern front, I reply, you reply by telling us dipshitted statements about Finland. How the fuck did Finland get on the eastern front? Also, I guess your definition of a mobile front is one that moves 5-10 miles in time periods of months except for isolated areas. Guess what? Thats a static front. For you to say there was no static eastern front is a gross fucking conceptual error of the worst kind. <br>
 <br>
-The T-34 had no significant effect on the Eastern Front.<br>
<br>
The T-34's 10&quot; thick armor wasn't what made it resistant to penetration, it was it's &quot;clever design&quot;? Of course this is a stupid statement to you since you choose to deflect the statement rather than reply to it. You can quote all the bullshit you want from your book but if you actually read it and think about that all that ass you spew but dont understand means, the facts remain that a) There was no 'clever' design of the T-34 that hadn't been done by the germans previously. The armor was sloped where it may encounter high energy shots and it was thick as hell where it counted and very thin where it didn't to save weight. They barely had enough Bessemer furnaces to remove defects before casting when they first started production, it was not high quality metal. Pig iron is exactly what it was and they knew it. This is EXACTLY why the T-34 was good, because basically it was the first thing the Germans encountered that was as diffucult to take out as their own, and they fell into the exact same problem we did with theirs years before.<br>
<br>
The russians moved entire factories east brick by brick when the Germans were advancing and this in conjunction with their own scorched earth policy fucked them when it came time to go on the offensive. It wasn't a tactical problem, it was a logistical one. Before you go ranting and quoting specific units blah blah blah from some book, think about what they're saying. The fact that they could force the germans to retreat even one inch is highly attributed to the fact that they lost much of their oil supply to Montgomery in the african desert. Had WESTERN allied forces not taken that from them, the russians would have been advancing from Moscow in the race for Berlin instead of their western border. <br>
<br>
Your whole point that the western allies had little to do with victory in WWII shoots holes in your credibility before you even open your mouth to say more. Unload all the crap you want about this unit here and that one there but guess what? It doesn't change the fact that the whole basis of your argument is dick, and anyone who doesn't have a 'dumb American' agenda will agree.<br>
<br>
The facts remain that:<br>
<br>
The T-34 had a major effect on the Russian ability to deal with Panzers and Tigers<br>
<br>
The war the western allies brought to the Germans was THE KEY to the Russians not being overrun by heaping logistical problems on them.<br>
<br>
The Russian are very fucking lucky their weather sucks.<br>

I'd like you to point out where I supposedly claimed that the front even reached the Urals. Basically, the farthest point of German penetration eastward during 1941-1945 was Stalingrad.  You can hardly call Stalingrad a &quot;Ural Front line&quot;.  Now you're just making up things that I supposedly said.  Once again, point out where I said that.<br>

Ok, here is how Finland tied in to the Eastern Front.  First of all, After the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact USSR felt emboldened and invaded Finalnd in 1940, one year before Germany invaded USSR.  USSR suffered very heavy losses due to very stiff Finnish opposition and the excelent tactical skill of the Finns.  This would play a role later when Germans would siege Leningrad for 900 days and would bombard the civilian population from the northern direction (Finnish territory).  Finns also provided some assistance to the Germans in small skirmishes around Leningrad and were eventually invaded again in 1944 as USSR was reclaiming its territory.  That is how Finland ties in with Eastern Front.<br>
<br>
Now, to the question of static/mobile front.  This is a huge subject which is very difficult to cover in one post, but basically in my previous post i explained major military operations and battles and indicated when there were lulls in fighting as both sides massed forces for ofeensives/defensives and used time to regroup.<br>
<br>
Here's a brief outline and recap just for you.  I can't spell this out anymore easier for you: <br>
<br>
Majority of military action in the East Front happened on Southern and Center fronts of the Eastern Front.  The front did remain moderately static on the Northern portion of East Front around Leningrad/Latvia/Estonia etc. from Winter of 41-42 up until 1944. <br>
<br>
Summer of 41 --- Winter of 41-42   Germans advance from USSR/Poland border to Moscow, sieging Leningrad(sieging it until 1943), capturing Kiev, capturing Minsk, sieging and capturing Odessa.  By the end of 1941, Germany has captured the 3 Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia).  Captured majority of Ukraine, captured practically the entire Belorussia and captured Moldova. <br>
<br>
Winter of 1941-1942   Soviets counterattack at Moscow effectively pushing the Germans away from the capital.  Majority of the front remains static as both sides are focusing their struggle on Moscow.<br>
<br>
Spring of 42  Small skirmish actions in center and southern front portions of East fron resulting in loss/gain of 20-40 miles as Germany masses for a major thrust to the Caucasus.<br>
<br>
Summer of 42  ---  Fall of 42  Germans unleash their spring offensive in Southern Russia which takes them from Kiev and Odessa to Stalingrad.  Roughly a 900 mile advance in 3 months.<br>
<br>
Fall of 42 --- March of 43  Germans are defeated at Stalingrad, Russians counterattack and push them back to the lines at which the Germans began their offensive 9 months ago.  <br>
<br>
April 43 --- July 43.    A lull falls over the Eastern Front as both sides have battled to exhaustion and began to pull together their forces and reinforce positions.<br>
<br>
July 43    Germans strike out at Kursk Salient and engage in the largest tank battle in history that breaks the strength of the Wehrmacht for good.  Very little advance in terms of miles.   The front lines remain fairly unchanged since before Battle of Kursk began.<br>
<br>
July 43 --- November 43   Massive Russian offensive that begins right after the germans start retreating from Kursk.  Germans get pushed to the Dnieper river and Kiev is liberated.  The Front moves westward couple hundred miles along the entire East Front frontline.<br>
<br>
December 43- Summer 44   Russian offensive peters out although advance continues although not on a scale as huge as the offensive second half of 1943.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess your definition of a mobile front is one that moves 5-10 miles in time periods of months except for isolated areas. Guess what? Thats a static front. For you to say there was no static eastern front is a gross fucking conceptual error of the worst kind. &quot;  -Maxx<br>
<br>
Your statement is very misleading, if you are referring to the Southern front as a &quot;few isolated areas&quot;, you have no concept of the amount of space that was being fought over from spring of 42 to summer of 43.  If you are referring to Northern portion of the front, I might agree.  Northern front remained mostly static until the major Russian offensive in 43 since both sides focused their major efforts on Southern front, and in 1943 at center front (Kursk). I would say that in the offensives that took place every year with Germans typically starting summer offensives and Soviets retaliating with winter offensives, that each offensive would reclaim hundreds of miles of land.  Static front as a whole?  You couldn't be farther from the truth.   Those are just the major points I outlined, not mentioning quick reversals which are too numerous to mention such as the Soviet recapture of Kharkov in March of 43 and the German counter attack that pushed them back 70 miles. Those types of &quot;local&quot; operations are myriad and I dont have the desire to go through them individually.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The T-34's 10&quot; thick armor wasn't what made it resistant to penetration, it was it's &quot;clever design&quot;? Of course this is a stupid statement to you since you choose to deflect the statement rather than reply to it. You can quote all the bullshit you want from your book but if you actually read it and think about that all that ass you spew but dont understand means, the facts remain that a) There was no 'clever' design of the T-34 that hadn't been done by the germans previously. The armor was sloped where it may encounter high energy shots and it was thick as hell where it counted and very thin where it didn't to save weight. They barely had enough Bessemer furnaces to remove defects before casting when they first started production, it was not high quality metal. Pig iron is exactly what it was and they knew it. This is EXACTLY why the T-34 was good, because basically it was the first thing the Germans encountered that was as diffucult to take out as their own, and they fell into the exact same problem we did with theirs years before.&quot;  -Maxx<br>

According to this   <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.skalman.nu/soviet/ww2-equipment-tank-t34.htm">www.skalman.nu/soviet/ww2...nk-t34.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->      and Jane's guide on armored vehicles which is widely considered to be the best civilian resource for military information and statistics, the thickest armor range on even the latest and upgraded T-34 model which was the T-34/85 (85 stands for the upgraded 85 mm cannon which replaced the 76.2 mm cannon) the thickest armor range was 20-90 mm.  Which would equate to 9 cm at highest end.  Which would place the armor thickness at roughly 3.6 - 3.7 inches in the thickest spot.  A very far cry from the 10 inches of thickness that you claim.  Please stop quoting made up facts and statistics that you know absolutely nothing about.<br>
<br>
You claim that my statement of the T-34 having a clever design is stupid?   You might want to consult these websites.<br>

&quot;The T-34 was a technologically innovative design which addressed the short-comings of the earlier BT series of wheel/track tank. &quot;  --Website mentioned above.<br>
<br>
&quot;The design overcame the technological superiority of German forces during the Great Patriotic War.&quot;  --Website mentioned above<br>
<br>
&quot;The T-34 had a more powerful cannon than German tanks, a higher top speed (32 MPH versus 25 MPH), and superior sloped armor and superior welded construction&quot; (Note the mention of superior sloped armor)  --Website mentioned above<br>
<br>
&quot;The T-34/85 was a modification of the T-34 equipped with a more powerful armor and cannon. T-34/85 had a flatter turret which gave this already inovative tank design the look that all tanks adopted after the wars end. Although not equal to the German Panther and Tiger tanks, the huge numbers of T-34s more than compensated for their technological shortcomings&quot;  (Note where it says that the Russian T-34 was not equal to Tigers and Panthers thus debunking this statement:  &quot;The T-34 had a major effect on the Russian ability to deal with Panzers and Tigers&quot;  --Maxx)  --Website Mentioned above<br>

&quot;It featured a high velocity gun placing more emphasis on tank killing ability and its armour was very well sloped making it difficult to knock out&quot;  --Website mentioned above   (note the mention of the sloped armour which was the clever design I was referring to)<br>

Obviously you dont even have a clue about these tanks.<br>

And finally...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Your whole point that the western allies had little to do with victory in WWII shoots holes in your credibility before you even open your mouth to say more. Unload all the crap you want about this unit here and that one there but guess what? It doesn't change the fact that the whole basis of your argument is dick, and anyone who doesn't have a 'dumb American' agenda will agree.&quot;  --Maxx<br>
<br>
Here's something to think about.  90% of German casualties in the entire Second World War were on Eastern Front.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, speaking of holes in arguments, I think I exposed enough of them in yours.  Please, next time you try to speak include some actual data to back up your statements and try not to get emotional.  Its not your fault that everyone talks about how wonderfully impressive D-Day was but no one even remebers places like Stalingrad, Kursk, Leningrad, Minsk.  Places which had as many people die every day for months as the first day of D-Day.  The key thing to remember is that by 1944 when D-Day was landed, Russia effectively and single-handedly broke the back of the German army and whatever was left of the Wehrmacht, was just a demoralized, ill-supplied mass of survivors of previous battles and green recruits for the most part.<br>
<br>
Like I said, please consult your local library, I'm tired of going through this every time some idiot opens their mouth and yaps something they know absolutely jack about.  <br>

I don't care anymore what kind of miniscule bullshit you can pull out of your ass or how much you think you know about ww2 or the T-34. Half of what you say in fact proves my points, reread the T-34 part. The fact remains that if you think the Russians could have retaken Europe on their own without the aid of the western allies in western Europe or Africa, then you obviously have some kind of anti-British or anti-American (infinitely more likely) hangup, and cannot even reason correctly because of it. There are no facts to back up what you say and there never will be, only more paragraphs of this unit and that yadda yadda, so forget it. Arguing with you is a waste of my time because you fall into the same category as the Jesusfreaks basically, you'll argue your point till you pass out because you can't stand America for some reason and this argument will never end. <p>"I am Jack's total lack of surprise"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umertondraco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/15/01 1:46:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The world according to Americans .....</span><hr size=1> Oh it wasn't hard.  20 minutes of typing and then 5 minutes to type in &quot;T-34 tank&quot; into Google, pick first 2 websites and provide quotes. <br>

I have problems with a lot in this country, I readily admit that, but that doesn't mean I go around bashing the US in broad generalizations.

Stereotyping every american into one lump sum is one thing that pisses me off, because stereotyping of any nature is ignorant and small-minded.  <p><br><center>
