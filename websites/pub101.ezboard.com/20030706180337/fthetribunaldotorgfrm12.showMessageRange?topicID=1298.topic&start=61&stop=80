Fuck that - you are a ninja-looting asswipe who deservers every piece of trouble such a reputation can bring you. It's really quite simple - if you loot an item from a mob that isn't &quot;yours&quot; (and I don't care if you got it to 1% before wiping - you weren't able to beat him and therefore forfeited your go at it, and NGoH was ready to finish him off) without permission from the guild/force that &quot;owns&quot; the kill, you are a ninja-looter. There is no rationalisation, no excuse, no &quot;hey we did most of the work wtf&quot; - you loot from a mob that isn't yours, be prepared to accept the consequences - which in this case equals a well-deserved spot on the Piece of Monkey Shit list.<br>

<br>
First off,  It is factual that a small number of DV members were still in combat with DS when NGoH engauged.   That was a stupid move on their part.  Had they waited til DV wiped , then engauged,  perhaps this would have all been avoided.   <br>
<br>
Secondly,   this one goes out to all you dumbshits who like to walk over another guild and take their intended raid target.     Why the fuck are you so greedy?  If people are there..  let them be...  can't a guild attempt a raid in peace anymore?     People have become so goddamn greedy and overall fuck-tarded..  that they must try and leap frog over another guild who is attempting to take out a mob that has potential &quot;phat loot&quot;.     It just goes to show the true nature of most people..   assholes.      What is so wrong with seeing another guild make an honest attempt on a raid-level mob,  without you interferring and fucking things up for them?  <br>
<br>
Been on this server for approx 3 years now..  and It just disgusts me to see how this server went to shit because of greedy people.    Does getting another uber BP, for one of your guild tanks to add to his already impressive collection of velious, kunark, luclin BPs,  really justify your unbelievably stupid behavior?   Why not allow a tank, in a lesser guild,  try for that BP so he can get rid of his pimp-ass treeweave he's been wearin since level 30?   But oh no..  the little man has to be stepped on here,  so that the already powerful can fill their packs with redundant and mostly unneccesary loot.    <br>
<br>
I'd love to see all you cocksmokers (those who my above paragraphs are directed at) move over to a PVP server..  where trampling another guild in attempts to steal their raid mob..  is damn near encouraged.   <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Because you all are sure-as-fuck not wanted here</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Re- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Ninja Looter</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kaspian..   I've known Kaspian for a very long time now, both in eq..and in RL.    But addressing his EQ career (that which matters in this topic)..   you couldn't find a better person on this server.   You can ask any of the hundreds of people who know him,   he's the kinda person who would never put a knife in your back.. and would stop whatever he was doing (no matter how important it was).. to lend a helping hand.    Over the time this man has played EQ..  he has never caused problems.. always obeyed the rules..  befriended 99.9% of the people he has met.   <br>
<br>
Do I think that what he did was right?  Not at all..   but do I think it was wrong?....<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Fuck No</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.   Even the nicest of people can tolerate only so much.   People want to play dirty?- then they better not be shocked by things like this.  <br>
<br>
Kaspian and his guild were cheated..  Kaspian looted something that was unjustly taken from him and his teamates..     given the current way this server is behaving..   i say...  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Congradulations on your item Kaspian..    and a big &quot;Fuck Ya&quot; to those who tried to cheat you and your guild</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.    Because god knows a shitload of us have had the same thing happen to us..  but we just didn't have the guts to take that which may very well have been ours.<br>
<br>
So to all the greedy fuck-tards (yes.. i love using those words to descibe you) out there..  let this event be an eye-opener as to what direction you are taking this server.  <br>

Tell me that you would not be pissed off if you were in his shoes..      Tell me you would not be pissed off if your guild attempt on a mob was cut short by another guild waltzin in and finishin the mob..prematurely and unjustly claiming the kill and loot.   Tell me you would not be even remotely upset..  and then you can take a crack at flaming Kaspian and his actions.<br>
<br>
Until then.. keep your trap shut and stop choppin sentences out of peoples posts to make yourself look good.   You're nothing more than a simpleton who thrives on mob mentality.   Or maybe you've just never experienced the joys of being walked on, during your less-than-uber times in eq.<br>

Karma's a bitch..   now don't get me wrong .. Kaspian will likely get his &quot;bad juju&quot; for doing what he did.    <br>
<br>
IMO.. the whole thing was a big fuckup.   The mob shoulda been left to the first guild there.. whether it was Phalanx, DV, or NGoH.   If they died..  fuck it.. they shoulda been able to get a second attempt without hassle.   <br>
<br>
The matter was handled in-game between NGoH , DV, and Kaspian..    it should never have been brought here in the first place..     as all it is ..is starting shit.   <br>
<br>
As far as actually naming Kaspian, Kowie,   You really shoulda kept your mouth shut..   the matter was handled.    Its not like he's an escaped felon with a history of repeat crimes.      He's no longer a part of your guild..   he's no longer your concern..    Defend your guild..  don't destroy others.   <br>

These lists have not been updated for 9 months... just how many guilds have you guys had problems with? A lot of guilds let Kaspian in, I think it just might be time for people to be warned of his take-matters-into-his-own hands-behavior, I mean just maybe. There's this dandy semi-new feature called &quot;Server Transfer&quot;.

<br>
first off..(1)Organized (2)Chaos.. this is actually one guild.    &quot;Organized Chaos&quot; ..  was a guild i was in when i was like level 25..  was in it for 2 or three days for a PVP event because my younger brother was in it.  Left after it was over.    Damn man, that's nostalgic.<br>
<br>
3)Vicious..  yet another noob guild.. my character barely had pubic hair when i was in this.  The guild had maybe a dozen members, none of which were ever on.   So I left..  not for any other reason that there was really no one ever around in guild.. felt it was pointless to be guilded.   <br>
<br>
(4)Wrath of Power...  Ahh  now there was a damn fine guild experience.  Was lvl 44 when i joined these guys.  Led by Darkax and Olav ..   we kicked much ass (as much ass as a non-uber guild could kick).    All of wrath of power stayed in wrath of power until we merged with...<br>
<br>
5)Eternum..    This turned out to be Wrath of Power without the fun or coordination.   Damn near every member of Wrath of Power left Eternum..  including myself..  to recreate...<br>
<br>
6)Wrath of Power..     We recreated it,  but with less numbers.. less devoted members..  although we tried.. the guild eventually crumbled to nothing.   RIP Wrath of Power. <br>
<br>
So Zoro went guildless.. for a while.. until a friend of mine (Daeja Veux) and myself.. decided to make a guild for our twinks..  TWINKS..  just to piss around with.   Hence minions of mischief was created.. to be able to talk to our all friends while we played twinks..  bear in mind this was &quot;Pre-chat channel&quot; days.. and was the only way we could think of doing so.  I guilded Zoronious just to be able to bullshit with friends while i soloed etc..  &quot;WE WERE NOT AN ACTUAL RAID GUILD&quot;..   so technically you can't even hold that against me..  infact my twinks are still guilded in MoM.<br>
<br>
which leads me to my next guild.<br>
<br>
8.)Forge of Evil...  supposedly &quot;E/V tryouts&quot;,  or so we were told.   Had a few E/V members deguild from E/V and guild themselves here inorder to &quot;scout&quot; out new talent i suppose.   Few of us went to EV.. most of us just stayed in FoE and did our thing til it went to shit due to lack of leadership and members leaving. Eventually FoE fell to pieces.  <br>
<br>
 9)Aurora Noctum...   Damn fine guild,    looked into it because of its convenient raiding hours when i began working evening shifts at my current job.   Stayed with AN for a quite a while,  enjoyed being part of them.  Left due to changes in work schedule, many months later,  because i was no longer able to attend 90% of their raids due to time differences.  <br>
<br>
and lastly,  <br>
<br>
 10)Legendary..    good guild,  but unfortunately never stayed with them long,  as a month after i joined them.. I had retired from tribunal.   <br>
<br>
<br>
For the record,  I have never had any problems with any &quot;actual&quot;  guild I've been in.   Nor has those guilds had a single problem with me.  <br>
<br>
So yea,  you throw up a post with all my guilds from an eq character who is damn near ancient.. and it will look impressive..  like<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> doesn't look like there are any on this server that can handle him<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->.   <br>
<br>
But next time you toss my name in something, ..   know your facts.. and understand why i was in, and left those guilds.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Kaspian does his own thing,  I am not responsible for his actions, guilds, etc..but if you pay attention to the order inwhich his guilds show..  after reading my post you'll understand why he's no longer in them.. as most of them no longer exist.  So no need to continue putting my name, nor his (if that's all you wish to share with us), in your semi-slanderous posts.<br>
<br>
Chances are.. 90% of ppl who play eq have a list just as long if not longer .. and probably much more impressive..with better , juicier, stories to tell about each.  <br>
<br>
Return to your angry mob,  simpleton. <br>

You're golden, Mr.  Zoronious, but I do still very much believe Kaspian will have a hard time fitting in any guild on this server, whether his actions are made public or not. You're not responsible for his actions, but can't you, like, talk some sense into him or something? Ask his parents to get involved or have the local minister give him some advice on how to act in an online enviroment. Council him! You both will feel a lot better when Kaspian is known and adored by thousands rather than hundreds in this game and on this server.<br>

<br>
Kaspian you hold that because you never died amd the mob was mem blurred, you were still in engaged.<br>
<br>
Actually that's wrong. If your raid force wiped, just because you are still alive, you (personally) are not still engaged, the fact that you said weren't on his aggro list, you admitted you were disengaged from him. <br>
<br>
Doing 80% of the damage but still wiping is just that, wiping, as in losing any and all claims to the mob and its loots.<br>
<br>
Also, you cannot claim you are solely engaged to a mob you cannot kill. GMs have reinforced this countless times in similar situations such as in Iceclad Ocean (kiting Lodizal til you get friends to muster a force isn't engaging, et al).<br>
<br>
Zoronious, omg you are such a tard.<br>
<br>
You remind me of someone who would kill the dog who stole the porkchop your mom tied around your neck to get teh dog to play with you in teh first place.<br>
<br>
Atm, you belong in Iraq, so we can more easily bomb you<br>
<br>
Stop playing a victim/martyr or attempting to, it doesn't work, no one cares, furthermore, you can't martyr yourself on something illegal.<br>
<br>
The only ppl that were cheated are teh people who were deprived of that Wand of Cursed Souls, if you feel you were cheated out of that item, bring more ppl next time to DS and dont wipe, kk thx la~ <p><img src=http://www.casiesplace.com/neweq/enchantress_with_slave2.jpg><br>

And telk wtf was zoro have to do with this situation and his or kaspian previous guilds, lets check your old history.  I'm sure you were in atleast 5 + guild from back in the day, so that has no frame of reference unless you're saying legendary and aurora noctrum or bad guild, and also saying a guild that one of the finest eq player Darkax ran, wrath of power, was bad then you're just not where it's at.  Next thing you know i'll have a post up here saying lets look at your guilds, well go ahead i was in plenty and i gave to each guild all i could as most of the people that play eq do, but sometimes you just haveto leave the guilds for personal reasons about conflixs with our ppl in the guild.  if you need to talk to me drop me a tell, and sorran you bro, send me a tell, and tell me what's happening down under, you get that advanced copy of pop yet?<br>

<br>
Don't you just hate those guys? I turned into one above, and looking back, realized it, and started hating myself. I'm a horrible horrible person for doing a quick and simple online video game investigation into the history of an avatar, making assumptions about that person being problematic in guilds, and including his innocent friend who is here to simply stick up for him.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I love you all. Let's get together in Plane of Knowledge and do something together, explore the planes and get some items and experience. To show my trust, I'll even have Kaspian loot everything for the group. Maybe we can start our own guild together? We can meet in real life at some point to... somewhere in Texas? I've always wanted to go there. Did you know that there's an ocean in that state? I mean, you look at all the old westerns, and you see its set in Texas, and you never see the Ocean, even though Texas has a large coastline, and the ocean is a fun place to go to. You'd think the old cowboys would want to relax at a beach every once in a while, but you never saw that in the movies. You might see it in today's modern westerns, but I don't enjoy modern westerns at all. Its a shame that the best westerns of today are comedies, like that Jackie Chan movie. You know, the one with that other guy, where they're in the bathroom playing that drinking game. What was his name? He's in that new movie with Eddie Murphy... man I can't think of his name, he was on Jay Leno just the other day. He was amusing. He told this story about him losing the key to The Club on his car's steering wheel. He just had to travel a ways up the street, a couple miles maybe. So he opened his car door so he could tilt the steering wheel a bit further while driving it, but he didn't make it to where he wanted to go because he couldn't make the turns, so he had to park his car on the curb and come back the next day with a saw or something, I don't know how he got it off, he didn't say. I sorta think the story of getting it off would have been equally amusing, and it was too bad he didn't get a chance to tell it. He didn't have time, you know, with the commericals coming up so the next guest could get prepared to come on out. Johnny Carson would have let him tell the rest of the story. He would just schedule the next guest for a later date. The guests didn't mind it much back then, it happened pretty often and they knew it may happen to them. It was all in good fun. Johnny Carson is a much better host than Jay Leno. He's into too much toilet humor. Johnny told risky jokes, but he stayed within the limits, and aside from the fact that the Tonight Show was on late, it had the qualities of a family show. Its not a family show these days with Leno, what with his toilet humor. I cringe when I watch him sometimes. He's a nice enough guy, and I think I have some things in common with him, like cars. I own 4 cars, not nearly as many as him, but I think they're pretty good cars and he might enjoy them. I wouldn't want to be his best friend, cause he tells a lot of jokes that I don't agree with, but I think we could hang out, maybe once every couple weeks. Johnny Carson, now I could be his best friend, and he could be mine. I don't think he and ed Mcmahon get along all that well, so he might have a slot open for a best friend. I don't know how to get in touch with him though. Maybe I'll meet him at a benefit or an entertaining concert or comedy show one day. He's getting pretty old, and his health is fading, so I don't have much time, but it might happen, it just might. Its not like I'm praying for it to happen or anything, I'm not obsessed with Johnny Carson, its just that I wouldn't mind meeting him and becoming friends with him. We could cruise town one day, if he likes cruising. Maybe he likes bikes better than cars. I know a great bike trail just about 20 miles from me. Its safe and close to a mom and pop store, which is owned by the nicest people you could ever meet. Well, not really, I'm just saying that to get the point acrossed of how nice they are. I'm sure there are nicer people out there, who would die for you at a moments notice, or give you their home or let you adopt their children. I'm sure there are people like that out there, who are nice, but really, that's just a bit disturbingly nice. I wouldn't want to get involved with people like that. I would feel guilty 99% of the time I'm around them. It'd really be a weird experience. <br>
<br>
But anyways, we'll do that sometime. Soonish maybe, I won't be getting PoP til Wednesday or later. =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxavioustribunal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XaviousTribunal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/22/02 1:44 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mfalk01/pics/shurikengif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Virtue Doomshade Fiasco</span><hr size=1> TelkandoreTelenesisyouareafuckingasshole <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mfalk01/pics/xavious.gif"><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28243" target="_blank"><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mfalk01/pics/Image1.jpg"><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28243" target=_blank>Property of Tamarai</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utelkandoretelenesis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 647<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/22/02 1:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Virtue Doomshade Fiasco</span><hr size=1> What did I do to offend you?
