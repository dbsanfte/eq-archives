<br>
When you have 90 members show up for a raid, then you will understand the importance of throwing 90 people at a given mob. You are missing something extremely obvious, the number of people attending a raid is often equal to the number of people &quot;thrown&quot; at a mob. I think if you put more thought into it, you will figure out why this is so.<br>
<br>
Oh, to answer your underlaying question, we bothered with Vyemm twice. First time was at somewhere around 3AM, the second time was at 12AM with 27 people. The reason we don't kill Vyemm is because he's at the &quot;end&quot; of the NToV cycle if you will (this is something you'd know after you go through a cycle of NToV, but I'll explain it to you for now) and that's usually around 1-2AM ish as our raids start late. At that time most of the key classes have left, or are leaving, and Vyemm itself doesn't warrent a trip back into NToV when there are other mobs up.<br>
<br>
Actually, there were quite a few RNG members interested in how well Trans did against Vyemm. Some were impressed, others didn't particularly care. If it's that important to you, continue to try to kill him. When we care about Vyemm as much as you apparently do, then we'll go kill him.<br>
<br>
Until then, you play the game your way, and we'll play it our way.<br>

WTF did we ever do to you?  When RNG got in the rotation, it was by hard work, *proper* negotiations with the guilds (EV and Comps at that time) currently on the rotation, and the killing of Aary.  That's how we got in.  We had permission from the guild up (The Companions), to attempt Aaryonar. Now all of a sudden someone wants to come along and raise the bar?  Fine.  RNG can easily, and I said easily, kill Vyemm if we wanted to.  Why haven't we?  Well several reasons.  It's always late when we get to him after 2 days (yes it takes us 2 days to do the rest...we can't raid like some guilds can and do it in 7 hours), and everyone is generally tired, needing to make up lost exp, or what not.  So the raid peters out by the time we get to him.  On day 3, people just aren't up to going thru the hell of Flurry Drakes, and no telling how many deaths, for one *very* hard dragon.  It just isn't worth it.  Especially if something else easier is up.  We're just like everyone else.  We take the path of least resistance.<br>
<br>
Vyemm is currently very hard.  Even the Companions have left him up the last several rotations.  Are you stating the Comps don't belong in NToV because they don't kill him?  I don't know what guild you are in, but I'm going to make a stab and say Transcended.  Yes Transcended deserves to be in the rotation, they did kill Aary.  But, *and this is the important part*, there is a proper way, and an improper way to go about getting in the rotation, and Trans chose the improper way.  So now you're finding resistance, and extra conditions.  These, by the way, are not coming from RNG.  I'll admit that I'd rather not see another guild there, but if one does belong there, then I'll accept it.<br>
<br>
If all the NToV capable guilds (and I include Transcended in this) want to raise the bar and say you have to kill Vyemm, fine.  But don't do it after we've left him up, and say we're not worthy...that condition wasn't there when we had our turn.   <p> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59422  target="web"><b>Skeeja Skywolf</b></a> <BR>

<br>
Its not too hard to gimp past Aary with 65 people because Aary is just a glorified Dozekar and a total pussy.  Then you can plant your flag into North Wing and go apeshit.  The real test of skill is Vyemm and I suspect that RNG will never bother with him because the knockback simply makes the zerg on Vyemm ineffective.<br>
<br>
And lets face it - if RNG cant zerg it, then RNG cant beat it.  You're about at the same level of play style as Legendary, the only thing that is elevating you slightly above them is that you have more numbers for The Zerg.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me lay it out for you clearly Boinshar, the mob to defeat for N-ToV rotation entry should be Vyemm - so we can get hobbling 3 legged dog of a guild like RNG out of the rotation and trim it down to 3 entities who are in fact capable of killing every mob in N-ToV.<br>
<br>
Then the rotation can be lovingly preserved intact and all problems are solved.  You can go back to farming West Wing, Umbral Plains, or whatever the fuck you were farming before N-ToV.<br>

We kill far more things with 45-50 than with 90.  However, if a member logs on, and says &quot;can I come to the raid&quot;, well, we never refuse them.  As anyone can attest, 90 people in NToV is lag city.  LD's galore, general chaos.  In fact, I was glad it started to get late and a 3rd or more of us left, made it much easier to kill.   <p> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59422  target="web"><b>Skeeja Skywolf</b></a> <BR>

RNG and SI on the other hand - have not demonstrated that ability.  I dont think you have any place in N-ToV if you cant kill every single thing that is in there.<br>
<br>
Since Vyemm is the hardest dragon in there - if you can kill Vyemm then you can kill everything else in there.<br>
<br>
RNG cant kill Vyemm.<br>
<br>
Therefore, you dont belong in the rotation.<br>

<br>
We've killed King Tormax<br>
We've killed Cazic Thule<br>
We've killed Itraer Vius <br>
<br>
CT and IV knockback just like Vyemm.  You think we can't kill Vyemm?  What a joke.  Have you guys killed him yet?  Oh you haven't?  Why not?  Don't make excuses, you had 2 days after all.  You can't kill one measly dragon in two days?  RNG has only attempted Vyemm twice.  The first time was our very first trip into NToV, it was late, and we lost, CR'ed, and left.  The second time was with 27 people, and although I had logged by then, I understand Vyemm was gotten to about 80% with insufficient forces.  <br>
<br>
We use the very same tactics that everyone else uses.  Ch cycle, melee control, backup healing, etc.  I don't know what your problem with us is, but get over your ego trip.  <br>

Neither has Trans, ergo by your logic you do not belong in ToVN. We kill anything and everything we want, when something is left up, you can bet that theres a reason behind it. Guilds all have a certain reputation and ways of doing things, Some guilds fight there way in, proving themselves, others like to whine... Some even duel for a shot (Hi Rynnia) Merton, you are a genetic wonder.<br>
<br>
One thing I would like to point out is Legendary and SI were at one time top level guilds, and Thinkness keeping trans together is doing an amazing job even with you as a spokesperson along with Estevan and Xavre. Mabey you should take your advice and have a seat at the doors along with the other guilds you mentioned and have a /gems tournament. <p><center><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=3333FF)"><a style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101935>Lumaden Dragonrider</a></div>

Why don't you stop talking like your big shit because you killed Roy? Roy was last years news and is small time now. Hell NToV is small time now. It's leftovers for a bunch of starved wolves (the big boys have left the building), so take your place in line and shut the fuck up. <br>

<br>
You see, he's got something to prove. What exactly, we don't know, but he's the sort of person who just HAS to prove to everybody else that he's &quot;good enough&quot;. Of course, the way he goes about it is as expected. Since Merton feels that Trans has how entered NToV, being the extremely lowly recognized 5th in his opinion, he just has to try to do SOMETHING to make himself feel better.<br>
<br>
His logic don't even work, since Trans haven't killed Vyemm, so Trans should not be in NToV according to him. However, he knows if he brings this up to Thinkness, he'd get smacked down, as usual. Therefore, he has to come to the flame board and stirr up crap to feed his ego. He probably won't even admit this to himself... he wants to feel important, but alas Trans was &quot;too slow&quot; by his way of thought, so he had to do SOMETHING to elevate himself.<br>
<br>
Since you obviously care so much about killing Vyemm, probably to prove to yourself that you are worthy, then do it. Don't come here and whine about only getting him to 30% and why nobody else bothers with him. Get him to 0, feel good about yourself (if you were even at the attempt). If you REALLY feel so strongly about Vyemm, talk to Thinkness and tell him not to lead Trans into NToV until Trans can kill Vyemm. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to accommodate your inferiority complex.<br>
<br>
I suppose the saddest thing is the fact that Merton thinks he's got something to prove, while nobody else cares.<br>

<br>
We didn't kill him on our last rotation because after a ninja patch, he suddenly warped all over the place like Yelinak-of-old(tm) and was a pain in the ass.  We wiped like 3x to him due to bugs and came to the very simple conclusion that he wasn't worth it.<br>
<br>
We'll continue to farm him once he's fixed; since we only go to NToV like once a month now, I don't know if he's still warping all over the place, but if he is, honestly, he's not worth the effort.<br>
<br>
Vyemm strat is different from CT and IV, btw... they don't all have an *AE* KB... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulaearyalifeblood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laearya Lifeblood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/2/02 6:35:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NToV Rotation</span><hr size=1> I always thought Merton's title said it all, guess people don't pay much attention to it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Logic is futilte when dealing with a frustrated man, Merton needs to get laid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><blockquote><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=111561>Laearya Lifeblood </a></center>

Last I heard, Trans did kill Aary with 39 members . . . with the help of an unspecified number of Vargrants.  Of course, this is heresay (ie who knows how many people that particular rumor went through), but I'd like to hear some kind of confirmation (besides Merton who has proved beyond all doubt that he is a moron and couldn't count anyway) that trans actually did Aary by themselves, or that they are having some kind of ongoing alliance with the vagrants.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I don't have a problem with Trans, but if all this mess is going to be stirred up, I'd at least like to know if it is for a valid reason.<br>
<br>
At any rate, it's gonna be the guild leaders and officers of trans the the guilds currently in the rotation that work this out.  Thank god for chat rooms.  That ought to help a lot.<br>
