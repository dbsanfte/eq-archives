Also did he return ALL of the following items: Fungi Tunic, Tinkered Mask, Horn of Hsgara, plus assorted resist gear?<br>

I for one did not know about the &quot;guild loot&quot; rules. I am quite sure there are many that dont know about it and many that feel it is wrong.<br>
However, I bet that if I joined one of these large guilds one of the first things I would learn and understand is the &quot;guild loot&quot;. So it matters not what outsiders think about that rule. The members know it and accept it when they join.<br>
If someone gave me 300kpp worth of loot because they were quitting would I take it? Hell yes I would. (do to the fact that I didnt know about &quot;guild loot&quot;). When approached about would I return it.........Yes I would. I would expect some sort of reward or compensation for doing the &quot;right&quot; thing.<br>
Cogito said something that is more true than anything that has ever been said. When the dust all settles the only thing that a person really has in this game is their reputation.<br>
Flame board reputations matters for shit but inside the game...... I would rather be a &quot;gimp naked n00b&quot; with a solid reputation as be a trashed player with the best of equipment.<br>
<br>
Nexx, If you returned the loot to the rightful owners then are a giant among men. If not then you are just the receiver of stolen goods. A fence for the crooks. Basically a nobody in the on-line world where nobodys fade away to nothing. <p><p><html><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FF0000" width="200"><font size="3"><strong><p align=center>Krickett Buffslinger</strong></font></p></td><td bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><font size="4"><strong><marquee width="120%">Council Member of the Regulators of Norrath..

You are looking too deep within my post.  Stop trying to spin this into a Rynnia vs. The Companions thing.  I could give a fuck less if another guild was in this situation.  My opinions would be the same.<br>
<br>
I said I could understand why he would not give them back at this point, based upon how it *looks* like he was approached before this post.<br>
<br>
Personally I would have given the shit back or not taken it in the first place.  I despise theives.<br>
<br>
You mention Tribunal Community... yet I see no community at work here.   Someone says someone stole something from them and everyone goes wild attacks the supposed theif.  Where's the trial period?  Where's the innocent until PROVEN guilty.   If yer gonna link up the Tribunal 'community' with RL ideals then you need to not pick and choose here.  &quot;Telymon said&quot; is not final judgment.   The 'community' here is thin.  There are no rules other than those set forth by Verant.  The 'community' is a mob of people loosely tied by guildnames and personal friendships.  This flameboard is about the closest thing the 'community' has to a judicial system serverwide, and the dude was fucking guilty as soon as this post was made.  So, I say to you, pull your head out of your ass and take a look at what is going on here.  It's a fucking mob of cavemen running after the dude with the meat, calming down a bit and THEN trying to be a bit more rational once they realize that they are not gonna catch him, and it might be the only way to get the fuckin' meat back.<br>
<br>
I'd not fuck anyone over like this.  I don't think it is 'right' to do it no matter how he was treated.  But I certainly 100% can understand him being pissed off at this point and not returning any / some of the items if what was written here is true.  That's all.  Stop trying to spin it into a &quot;Rynnia is a piece of shit and would have done the same thing  blah blah blah.&quot;  No I would not have.  One can understand how someone else is feeling / reacting at the moment even knowing that you would never have gotten to that point.  Fact is I would never have been in his shoes.  I wouldn't have taken the shit in the first place.  Putting myself in his shoes NOW I'd tell ya all to fuck off, calm down, apologize and then I might give the shit back.  No I do not like to be bullied, and were I being bullied, I'd throw it right back at ya.   If ya wanna call me a piece of shit because I can see where this guy is at this point in all of it, then fine.<br>
<br>
Sometimes people can be fucking vicious in this game.  I remember awhile ago when Molitoth allowed someone to use his deepwater breastplate, and the person using it got harassed in game to the point Molitoth made a post about it.  Mob of cavemen chasing after the dude with the meat.  I'll say it again, the 'community' is thin here.<br>
<br>
And don't compare this shit with Alexandr.  It wasn't a blatant ninja of some items.  It's quite a bit more complex than that. <p><IMG SRC="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/monkey.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 1562<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/7/02 1:01:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ladida5000.homestead.com/files/ladidadwarf3.jpg height=147 width=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is pretty sad</span><hr size=1> Glad you are learning the ways of evil Krickett <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I figured most guilds do run systems like this though. I know when I was in my first guild, we would commonly sell things between each other or sell things to people outside of the guild, even though one of our own could use it. It wasn’t wrong or anything. We were a small guild &amp; we didn’t raid much. I would not expect someone to give me things that they could make plat off of to progress themselves along.<br>
<br>
But EV was much different, as I imagine most other guilds are.. People have been kicked out for selling items/rare spells that people inside the guild need. The only things we sold were things that nobody’s main needed. That was the way it went. I really did like that system, and it did help people get equipped fast &amp; have the spells they needed fast. And it felt good, everyone helping out each other always, never giving up something that you wanted. <p><BR>

<br>
Generally, unless the person who loaned you the item says so, you won't sell their item when you need cash or upgrade to something better.  Instead, you will return said item for them to do with as they wish.<br>
<br>
God knows I've got jama gear that Vortigern loaned me from one of his twinks sitting in the bank still on the off-chance that he returns to the game and actually wants any of it back.<br>

These guys are RL friends. It's not like some stranger in EC gives you a backpack of Kunark BPs and some plat. Sashanna made Nexxon pay the price for his behaviour by making the post here. <br>
<br>
I had no interest in this incident until I among other tells from Nexxon (out of the blue, I have never talked to him before as far as I know) got these. Maybe I should feel bad for posting his tells, but on the other hand I probably died a couple of times pulling the very Tormax that dropped the horn he stole from us. And a few times in sleepers for the mask he got.<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 07 00:31:10 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'Alright, all I can say is that I'm VERY dissapointed in the behavior of a guild such as yours.  I was just told to go to DAOC becuase I'm no longer welcome on this server.'<br>
[Thu Feb 07 00:31:28 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'I've worked so hard on this char and your people have no right to destroy that.'<br>
<br>
Gee - he is disappoited in MY guild for not letting him getting away with this. Heh. Oh dear, where did I lose my sympathy.<br>
<br>
What you seems to be arguing is this is too hard a judgement. I disagree. He was made aware of the situation, he lied, he showed no will to make up for himself. Sashanna posts, and suddenly we should pity the guy - or &quot;understand&quot; he doesn't want to give up the items. <br>
<br>
I'm sure he never would have given up the items willingly. I'm equally sure Comps can live without the items even if we would have preferred to have them. After all, we worked hard to get them. This thread however showed to the rest (at least the boardcampers, of which like 50% don't even play the game hehe) what kind if person he (and Telymon) is - and tells people to avoid both. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

<br>
I've a hunch here that he was approached far differently.  Guilty until proven innocent fashion.<br>
<br>
Not saying he's guilty, not saying he's innocent.  Saying that my assumption is that he was approached by an angry mob or individual and the behavior he's exhibiting is understandable from my perspective, and that putting myself in his shoes *this very instant* I probably wouldn't give the shit back.  Not saying his behavior is 'right.'<br>
<br>
And by your arguments about stolen property, the person(s) who purchased this shit from Nexx if he did indeed sell the stuff, are obligated to give the items back as well, if we follow along the apparent seamless transition from RL law and ideals to in game activity.<br>
<br>
I'm arguing.  That's what this board is here for.

Uh, no. I'd be fucking PISSED. And I'd DEMAND my stuff back. Hell, no. I'd take it back. If you gave me any lip, I'd kick your ass. <br>

<br>
&quot;If you even THOUGHT twice about giving me my shit back, I'd kick your ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tough talk, easy to type out.  Would you be willing to go through with this in RL though?  Or would you involve the police instead?  While we are swapping in and out of RL here.  In RL, someone having 'your stuff' is not sufficient cause for physically inflicting harm upon them.<br>
<br>
&quot;And this punk lied and contradicted himself, to boot, and you're defending him? &quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, merely saying I can see his side of it at the moment.  At not time have I said that him taking those items was fair or just.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fuck you. You're a tard. I've got nothing more to say.&quot;<br>

Who knows where the items are now, who knows how many times they've been traded.  For all we know the Horn and Tinkered mask thingy have been cycled through ten different accounts, I don't even know if a GM can track that kinda shit.  If I bought an item in EC from some dude I didn't know, and a couple weeks later I got a tell from some person I'd never spoken to, saying they think my gear belongs to them, should I give this person their items and pray that the stuff really belongs to them like they claim?  Fuck no.  There's enough assholes and scammers on the server I'm not just gonna hand over my equipment because some dude says it belongs to his guild.  Point is there is no way to know what item originally dropped for who.  There's so many items traded throughout the server who knows which ones are &quot;legal&quot; and which ones are stolen property.  Whenever I buy an item I don't send every fucking person a tell to make sure that the item wasn't ninjad or stolen off someone's account.  Notice that little message that pops up right when you log into the game, it says something like &quot;Please remember all trades are final, trusting another player to return with items at a later date may leave you with nothing to show for your trade.&quot; Nexxon doesn't have your gear, whatever he has left he gave you, what more can he do?  There's no reason to continue this thread.  Comps can do their best to trace where the items went but what's the fucking point of wasting so much time over a couple items?  Just realize that sometimes you recruit a real piece of shit into your guild and they will fuck you over.  It's happened in my guild before and we don't take to the flameboard so everyone can say their peace, when 99% of the people here don't know shit.  We /guildremove the fuckers and make sure that other guilds know this person has no place in any decent guild.  <br>
