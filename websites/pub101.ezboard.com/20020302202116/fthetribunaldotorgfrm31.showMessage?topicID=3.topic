If you are not at a raid,you cannot move your position on the list, thus not rewarding you for not showing up, but neither penalizing you if you can't make a raid for good reasons. Best way to illustrate this is an example.<br><br>There are 6 warriors in the guild, and this is the list prior to a hate raid.<br><br>1.) Lilwee<br>2.) Marlfox<br>3.) Gwarr<br>4.) Bonway<br>5.) Cong<br>6.) Gnarring<br><br>At this Hate raid, Lilwee, Gwarr and Cong make the raid. 2 Indo pieces drop, and the top 2 there each chose to loot a piece (Lilwee and Gwarr)<br><br>This is what the list would be after the raid.<br><br>1.) Cong<br>2.) Marlfox<br>3.) Lilwee<br>4.) Bonway<br>5.) Gwarr<br>6.) Gnarring<br><br>Notice the people not at the raid do not move thier position, people who loot drop to the lowest spot of someone at the raid, and people rotate around no show's. This help's allieviate the &quot;Why does so and so get an Indo BP, and they only make one raid a month, if that?&quot; If they never raid, they will never get to the top of the list. It also helps everyone to get gear, not just a select few. Although in some circumstance's I can see the reasoning for wanting to pimp out say one main tank so that he can survive against uber_mob_02, it'll all come with time. If people raid, they will get gear, and if they don't, they won't get gear, it's kinda a pain to keep the list up to date, but I think it works very well for us.<br><br>Lilwee Beasty<br>59th Myrmidon<br>Elder Warrior<br>Royal Norrathian Guard <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uguddyearplaysureblimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guddyear Playsureblimp</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/saltire.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Good Times</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/12/01 12:41:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> lists become useless when you deal mainly with cross class loot.<br><br>The problem with rolling on an item is only really a problem if you are a hardcore raiding guild, you have to assign loot to active players as they will benefit raids the most.<br><br>While people think that /random is more 'fair' in the end game it's stops being about what is fair and becomes wholly about what benefits the guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usentria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sentria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/01 3:18:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> /aggree Gouddyear<br><br>we do a tier system per class(decided by officers)<br><br>tier 1 being highest.....<br>the amount of time you put in raiding = tier status<br>Bps/Robes from ToV(also quest items form HoT) or from statue of rallos zek/uber mob loot = tier 1 (sometimes they pick one or 2 items for tier 1 and the rest is randomed by tier)<br><br>kind of a basic idea....the best way to get the most loot no matter what system is to raid the most...if its all randomed you have the most chances to win...if its tier or DKP etc the more you raid the higher you get....<br> <p><P><h5><b><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=29841">Sentria - 59 Myrmidon of Legendary</A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usentria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sentria</A> at: 8/13/01 3:20:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrunth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grunth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/14/01 2:02:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/nvanover/inmybelly.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> We Roshambo for it, last person standing gets the loot.<br>I wonder if that's linked to the fact that we haven't looted anything in the past six months due to corpse rot.<br><br>Ah well *Kicks Aeglos in the nuts* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubractos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bractos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/15/01 6:15:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> we in EH also do a tier type system,  based on percentage of raids attended. <br>Basically this is used for determining of who gets what we deem as uber loot (ie epic drops if there is a contest to who gets, breastplates, robes, caster headpieces ). <br>With most dragon drops we let everyone who would use roll, with the exception of epic drops (scales, books).<br>those who are in the top tier (we have 3)  are those that get to roll on the uber drops.  Of course you have to be on the raid to roll.  If none of the tier ones need the item then the tier twos roll.<br>With normal drops on raids we allow those that can use the item and will use it to roll.

I personally would like to see a point based system that moves people up and down the ladder when they get to loot something.  seems similar to what the RNG are running.   It would function like the tier system but would allow someone who doesnt make a lot of raids to be able to eventually climb his way up to looting a  great drop.  currently our system doesnt allow someone to move up that doesnt attend a lot, but i think either way you would be applying trickle down looting so in the long run i think either are about as fair.

It is a &quot;guild&quot; raid afterall.   <br><br>one last thing I think is worth noting. Since we introduced this system we have had a dramatic increase in raid attendance, and have been able to see a dramatic increase in the gear of our active members and had a reduction in someone getting a Big drop and leaving the guild shortly thereafter.<br>No system is perfect they all have their flaws and it is IMPOSSIBLE to make everyone happy.

You have the four different types of quest armor form ToV - we have a loot officer taking tells on who are interested, discuss this with other officers on the raid and award on this basis.<br><br>2. You have the items that can be used by only a single class, our senior class member present at the raid has the say along with the loot officer.<br><br>3. You have the limited cross-class items that can be used by, e.g. all plate, or all melee - those are handled by the officers taking tells as per 1.<br><br>4. You have the totally uberific all/all pieces that will be an upgrade to anyone. These are usually handled by a group of officers present at the raid, taking tells if necessary - who wouldn't want a belt of snorfslaying or gaunts of dragonslaying?<br><br>We used to have a rotating list of items, back when we did fear/hate regularly - after you loot one item, you go to bottom of list and can't loot another item before everyone above you either has or passes. Velious and all/all items made this system obsolete though, hehe.<br><br>Hope I make sense - as Gudd was trying to say, it's really all about equipping the guild to do the &quot;next&quot; thing and hedging your bets in the process. It's always annoying to have dragon haste or other droppable uber-items leave the guild, so of course equipping the old-timers become a no brainer. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=65693>Sscaley Bbastage</a><br><i><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net>The Companions</a></i> <br>Warlizard on Tribunal</big><br><a href=mailto:remmer@mail1.stofanet.dk>Send an email</a><br><small><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=5798>Aauminki Troldmand (oom)</a></b></small> <br><i>preference to persons who sign up in advance and show up on time</i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarmandehammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armande Hammer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/31046577930/pics/bottle_cap.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/01 12:10:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> We tried lists and it was more of a pain in the ass then anything, now we do loot the same as Sscaley described. <p> <font size="1" color="#800000" face="VTCBelialsBladeShadow"><center>                    <a href=www.eqforge.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=3600>Armande Hammer</a></font><font size="4" color="#800000" face="AvQest"><br> <b>Bad Ass Warlord  <br>1st</b> <a href=http://pub79.ezboard.com/betheios>Etheios</a> <b>Panzer Division <br> 1st Etheios Canary Squad</b></center><br><br><center><b><i>"He who dies with the most toys.....<br>WINS!!"</b></i></center></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubalorfhasawintersoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balorf Has A Winter Soul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/01 1:01:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=C:\My Documents\My Pictures\Scrap></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> Heres my feelings -<br><br>1.

A warrior only no drop item drops and both warriors can use and want.  60 warrior has been in the guild a year, 57 10 months. 60 warrior gets the item no questions asked right?  Next week they raid ToV again, nother warrior thing drops and 60 warrior gets again, because of what your saying he gets the first item that drops that he needs.  Lvl 57 starts to get mad and figures, hell what am i doing here, im not going to get anything on any of these raids unles he doesn't come, leaves guild or retires.  Lvl 57 quits guild. Meanwhile this is going on with everyother class in the guild.  What happens? you end up with about 2 of every class in your guild.  Granted your items are staying in guild and your people are pretty much decked out. But, can 20 60s take out 60 55+s'? Probably not.<br><br>2. NBG is a really good way in my opion to distribut loot.  Every person that needs it, no alts, gets the chance to roll.  When you win you cant roll until everyone else gets something.  Also, this is assuming some items are not no drop, allow people to trade at the end of the raid.  In past experences this has done very well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uguddyearplaysureblimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guddyear Playsureblimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Good Times</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/01 6:23:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>1.

It doesnt make sense anyway you need to spread damage so as a consequence spread AC and stats.<br><br>b) Your 57 warrior levels to 60 and is on an equal footing, in many if not most classes there is a huge difference between being level 59 and level 60, warriors especially.<br><br>In a situation where you have 2 relatively equal seniority people it might be worthwhile involving one or both of them in the decision, at least that way the other person doesnt feel cheated.<br><br>There have been occasions where someone has asked me if they feel I should get another item over another member and I have said no, I have also said yes. <br><br>Fact is I dont really mind all that much on the understanding that it will benefit my guild and not just the person wearing the armour. It's all about priorities. If a guild wants to do big stuff then they need a big stuff attitude, if on the other hand a guild finds fun in equipping their members for the sake of having cool stuff then random is surely the way to go because  there is no longer any justification on assigning loot by seniority.<br><br>It's all a question of what you want to do with your armour, it's a personal thing and no way is right nor is it perfect. Do not expect everyone to be happy and dont try to make it that way, just do your best and the rest will follow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaauminki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauminki</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/17/01 3:57:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Senority or NBG</span><hr size=1> I respectfully disagree, while I agree with all that Gudd posted - I'd like to point out a few reasons that actually makes me like the system we use now.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lvl 57 starts to get mad and figures, hell what am i doing here, im not going to get anything on any of these raids unles he doesn't come, leaves guild or retires.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>That'd fine by me, people joining my guild for loot will be sorely disappointed.

People dont always quit the guild though, big guilds needs need those second tier people to survive.  Once you have 84932 high level warriors in your guild like Companions do, they cant all be &quot;the man.&quot;  The 4th and 5th warriors just have to suck it up and know that the accomplishments of the guild are more important than their personal egos.

This system is for those that have the goal to be among the elite of EQ. <br><br>If a guild just wants to have fun, however, and everyone get items, then it's /random and spread out the loot.
