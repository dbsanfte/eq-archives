How did Iraq get its weapons? We sold them<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
By Neil Mackay and Felicity Arbuthnot<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
THE US and Britain sold Saddam Hussein the technology and materials Iraq needed to develop nuclear, chemical and biological wea pons of mass destruction.<br>
Reports by the US Senate's committee on banking, housing and urban affairs -- which oversees American exports policy -- reveal that the US, under the successive administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush Snr, sold materials including anthrax, VX nerve gas, West Nile fever germs and botulism to Iraq right up until March 1992, as well as germs similar to tuberculosis and pneumonia. Other bacteria sold included brucella melitensis, which damages major organs, and clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene.<br>
<br>
Classified US Defence Dep-artment documents also seen by the Sunday Herald show that Britain sold Iraq the drug pralidoxine, an antidote to nerve gas, in March 1992, after the end of the Gulf war. Pralidoxine can be reverse engineered to create nerve gas.<br>
<br>
The Senate committee's rep orts on 'US Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual-Use Exports to Iraq', undertaken in 1992 in the wake of the Gulf war, give the date and destination of all US exports. The reports show, for example, that on May 2, 1986, two batches of bacillus anthracis -- the micro-organism that causes anthrax -- were shipped to the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education, along with two batches of the bacterium clostridium botulinum, the agent that causes deadly botulism poisoning.<br>
<br>
One batch each of salmonella and E coli were shipped to the Iraqi State Company for Drug Industries on August 31, 1987. Other shipments went from the US to the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission on July 11, 1988; the Department of Biology at the University of Basrah in November 1989; the Department of Microbiology at Baghdad University in June 1985; the Ministry of Health in April 1985 and Officers' City, a military complex in Baghdad, in March and April 1986.<br>
<br>
The shipments to Iraq went on even after Saddam Hussein ordered the gassing of the Kurdish town of Halabja, in which at least 5000 men, women and children died. The atrocity, which shocked the world, took place in March 1988, but a month later the components and materials of weapons of mass destruction were continuing to arrive in Baghdad from the US.<br>
<br>
The Senate report also makes clear that: 'The United States provided the government of Iraq with 'dual use' licensed materials which assisted in the development of Iraqi chemical, biological and missile-system programmes.'<br>
<br>
This assistance, according to the report, included 'chemical warfare-agent precursors, chem ical warfare-agent production facility plans and technical drawings, chemical warfare filling equipment, biological warfare-related materials, missile fabrication equipment and missile system guidance equipment'.<br>
<br>
Donald Riegle, then chairman of the committee, said: 'UN inspectors had identified many United States manufactured items that had been exported from the United States to Iraq under licences issued by the Department of Commerce, and [established] that these items were used to further Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons development and its missile delivery system development programmes.'<br>
<br>
Riegle added that, between January 1985 and August 1990, the 'executive branch of our government approved 771 different export licences for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. I think that is a devastating record'.<br>
<br>
It is thought the information contained in the Senate committee reports is likely to make up much of the 'evidence of proof' that Bush and Blair will reveal in the coming days to justify the US and Britain going to war with Iraq. It is unlikely, however, that the two leaders will admit it was the Western powers that armed Saddam with these weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
However, Bush and Blair will also have to prove that Saddam still has chemical, biological and nuclear capabilities. This looks like a difficult case to clinch in view of the fact that Scott Ritter, the UN's former chief weapons inspector in Iraq, says the United Nations des troyed most of Iraq's wea pons of mass destruction and doubts that Saddam could have rebuilt his stocks by now.<br>
<br>
According to Ritter, between 90% and 95% of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were des troyed by the UN. He believes the remainder were probably used or destroyed during 'the ravages of the Gulf War'.<br>
<br>
Ritter has described himself as a 'card-carrying Republican' who voted for George W Bush. Nevertheless, he has called the president a 'liar' over his claims that Saddam Hussein is a threat to America.<br>
<br>
Ritter has also alleged that the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons emits certain gases, which would have been detected by satellite. 'We have seen none of this,' he insists. 'If Iraq was producing weapons today, we would have definitive proof.'<br>
<br>
He also dismisses claims that Iraq may have a nuclear weapons capacity or be on the verge of attaining one, saying that gamma-particle atomic radiation from the radioactive materials in the warheads would also have been detected by western surveillance.<br>
<br>
The UN's former co-ordinator in Iraq and former UN under-secretary general, Count Hans von Sponeck, has also told the Sunday Herald that he believes the West is lying about Iraq's weapons programme.<br>
<br>
Von Sponeck visited the Al-Dora and Faluja factories near Baghdad in 1999 after they were 'comprehensively trashed' on the orders of UN inspectors, on the grounds that they were suspected of being chemical weapons plants. He returned to the site late in July this year, with a German TV crew, and said both plants were still wrecked.<br>
<br>
'We filmed the evidence of the dishonesty of the claims that they were producing chemical and biological weapons,' von Sponeck has told the Sunday Herald. 'They are indeed in the same destroyed state which we witnessed in 1999. There was no trace of any resumed activity at all.'<br>

You need to read through that again.  All that was shipped to Iraq were &quot;precursors&quot;.  They were not weapon quality material.  Nothing the US sent to Iraq was able to be immediately turned around and fired from an artillery shell at Iraqi Kurds.  So again, we did not give them weapons of massive destruction.  We gave them materials that could be used to produce those weapons.<br>
<br>
If I sold you a pipe, some pipe ends, some gun powder, and some dynomite fuses.  Did I just sell you a pipe bomb, or did I just sell you a bunch of shit that could be used for all kinds of things, to include the making of a bomb?  If I did, we best bust down the doors of Lowe's, Home Depot, and about 100 Firework Stores in Indiana and Wisconsin!  Because they are selling bombs to citizens.<br>
<br>
And this is an extremely simplified analogy.  You'd have to spread the purchases over several years, from various agencies, and from different countries.  There is a reason why they are calling those substances &quot;Dual Use&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that the officials that Ok'd these sales were complete dumbasses and didn't know their possible use.  What I'm saying is that we did not sell him WEAPONS.  Saddam and Saddam alone is responsible for the production and the use of WMD within his and his neighboring countries.<br>
<br>
Finally, Ritter doesn't know shit.<br>
<br>
If you don't know the final amount of weapons you are dealing with, how can you possibly say that X percentage of the material has been destroyed?  Also, how old is Ritter's estimations?  Iraq made TONS of VX and Anthrax, but we didn't send them TONS of anything.  We sent them small samples.  They made the rest.  So what has prevented Iraq from replenishing their stocks since Ritter's estimations?<br>
<br>
Then, how in the world would Ritter know what was and wasn't destroyed during the war?  He wasn't privy to Intelligence reports, as if such reports are even accurate.<br>
<br>
So his &quot;opinion&quot; how much material Iraq currently possesses is about as accurate as any of the other morons that have taken their little 3 day vacation in Iraq in the last 3 months.<br>

<br>
I've been wondering, how do people get this idea in their head? Is it thought that Saddam is just going to forever live peacefully, biological and chemical weapons in hand, without going after Israel, without using his weapons on people in his own country? The weapons are just going to sit and collect dust for the next 30 years? Or in your case, it is because you think biological and chemical weapons are too hard to use...? That was not the case a few years ago. To say that Saddam was able to murder the kurds with chemical weapons because we gave our &quot;support and consent&quot; of the action is complete BS, and is just as bad as the lies the far right is spewing out. &quot;We're the ones that gave them the bad stuff back in the day!!&quot; It's time for people to get over it and stop stamping their feet and screaming &quot;It's your fault! It's your fault!&quot; like children. People act as if this throws the whole argument out the window. Move on. I'll agree that the links to Al Qaeda are weak when compared to other countries, but that's as far as I'll go.<br>

<br>
The need to disarm may be legit, but the reasons Bush gives for doing so are lies and BS and we did alot to put him in the position he's in today. If we had told him not to go into Kuwait, he would have never gone. He knew the US would kick his ass.<br>

He never used WMD in Kuwait. Funny how a crazy madman who will attack the US with them, didn't use them in his invasion.<br>
<br>
The US gave him mixed messages and then turned on him in mid stream. We give him weapons and then say we have to invade and take him out because he has them. We allowed him to gas the Kurds with a wink and a nod and supplied the materials necessary to do it, but then we say he is a monster for it years later.<br>
<br>
We are hypocrites when it comes to Iraq and that's what pisses me off. Bush may be right to invade Iraq, but he is right for the wrong reasons. <p><br>

<br>
No, we sold them to him, precursors or no, while he was still ostensibly our ally.  Cold War and all that?  Ok, a month after his atrocities were committed we still sold him a batch of goodies.  That was a Bad Thing!  We screwed up.  Whatever bureaucrat approved that deal, or failed to cancel it, deserves to be sacked.  Now... what the hell does any of this have to do with policy in 2003?<br>
<br>
&quot;AND we gave him the nod before he went into Kuwait&quot;<br>
<br>
No.  Absolutely not.  A clueless ambassador made a vague statement that SOUNDED like we were giving the nod.  This ambassador was talking out her ass due to lack of experience, PMS, generic stupidity, or some combination thereof... who knows?<br>
<br>
&quot;but for whatever reasons, whether it be crossed wires in DC or a change in policy or a CYA move, we decided to beat his ass for Kuwait afterwards.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe because he was threatening the stability of the region, our Saudi friends, and perpetrating an act of extreme aggression in a region in which the entire world has a large vested interest?  The nitwit ambassador screwed up.  She made a statement which implied something that was completely opposite to American policy and which she was therefore, obviously, unable to back up.<br>
<br>
&quot;he need to disarm may be legit, but the reasons Bush gives for doing so are lies and BS&quot;<br>
<br>
They are?  Which reasons of his are lies and BS?  Which reasons would you then give as the proper ones?<br>
<br>
&quot;and we did alot to put him in the position he's in today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Allow me to repeat myself - who gives a damn?  If we screwed up 20 years ago, so what?  Let's pound our chests and flagellate for a while, and then get around to taking away his weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we had told him not to go into Kuwait, he would have never gone. He knew the US would kick his ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll say it again - blame the clueless ambassador for the war if you want (which is still fallacious, Saddam is to blame in the end), but not the U.S. as a whole or U.S. policy.<br>
<br>
&quot;He never used WMD in Kuwait. Funny how a crazy madman who will attack the US with them, didn't use them in his invasion.&quot;<br>
<br>
He didn't need to use them in his invasion - its not like Kuwait put up a huge fight.  And we told him pretty clearly that if he used them on the battlefield, Iraq would become a very large chunk of irradiated glass.  This is not an intellectually honest argument.<br>
<br>
&quot;We give him weapons and then say we have to invade and take him out because he has them.&quot;<br>
<br>
You know, a lot can change in 15 years.  Stuff like, the end of the Cold War... the Gulf War... 12 years of refusal to disarm peacefully... etc. etc.  Its not like we sold him this crap 3 years ago while we were trying to disarm him.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We allowed him to gas the Kurds with a wink and a nod and supplied the materials necessary to do it, but then we say he is a monster for it years later.&quot;<br>
<br>
Allow?  We also allowed the Rwandan genocide then I guess, as well as the Yugoslavian horrors.  We &quot;allow&quot; every single horrible thing that goes on in the world by not somehow &quot;disallowing&quot; it, I suppose.  He did it with U.S. precursors and/or weapons - fine!  I accept that.  There was a Cold War going on, we were still using him to balance Iran, blah blah blah.  I'm not even saying it was a good idea or a smart one - it did allow him to gas the Kurds, after all!  But the situation was DIFFERENT.  Besides - even if we did provide some of the materials, the fact that he then developed, deployed, and used the weapons places the blame squarely on HIS shoulders... not ours. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

<br>
It has to do with the fact that the same SOB who was facilitated the deal is now the SoD making the case against Iraq. It has to do with the fact that the US acts all fuckin righteous when talking about Iraq and our Holy War against WMD and the monster who gasses his own people without ever acknowledging the fact we fucked up and made it possible for him to do so in order to further our own interests. It has to do with the fact that maybe the reason he looks like such a monster is because we dealt him into the game and rewarded him for his atrocities by selling him more powerful weapons and making deals with him.<br>
<br>
Saddam hasn't changed since 1980... we have. Our at least our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>public</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> policies have.<br>
<br>

<br>
And doesn't the Ambassador speak for the US? What did we do to rectify the situation? Did we open up diplomatic channels and give him a way to pull out while saving face in front of the rest of the world? No, we jumped in and took advantage of the situation by kicking his ass and helping out another dictator who, while maybe not as bad as Suddam, is a major violator of human rights.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>They are? Which reasons of his are lies and BS? Which reasons would you then give as the proper ones?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Calling him a monster for gassing the Kurds is BS when we ENABLED him to do it. You can nitpick about precurors vs actual weapons, but the bottom line is we enabled him to do this with full knowledge of what he was doing. That makes us just as much of a monster as he is in my book.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Allow me to repeat myself - who gives a damn? If we screwed up 20 years ago, so what? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
And the Kurd villages he gassed did put up a huge fight? And we never threatened him if he used WMD when he invaded Kuwait, because we never told him not to invade Kuwait FFS. We threatened to retaliate if he used them in OperationDesert Sheild/Storm. Big difference.<br>
<br>

<br>
The point is the same whether we sold it to him 10 years ago or 100 years ago - we helped him gas his own people when he was doing something for us. Now that we have no use for him, we use his WMD as an excuse to invade.<br>
<br>

<br>
I will not forget the U.S backing of Sadam Hussein take over of power in Iraq because he was anti-communist, and was against Iran. glossing over his atrocities then, because it served our purpose.<br>

I will not forget that we back dictators and despots this very day because it serves our purpose.

look back through history at the country's that hate the U.S. and maybe you'll start to see a trend.<br>

look back to the U.S sending of troops to moscow to help the corrupt and pathetic Czar of russia during the Soviet Revolution and wonder why the Soviets hated us.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
to the countries in africa, where the people are suffering worse atrocities then Saddam has done<br>
<br>
we say we're fighting a war on terrorism, but why are we ignoring the countries were terrorism is taking place this day?<br>
<br>
Indonesia, they even say they have Al Qaeda ties, yet we're not there in a blaze of glory?<br>
<br>
We're worried about Iraq's &quot;supposed nuclear weapons possiblity&quot; yet ignoring N. Korea's admitting their's and flaunting it in our face.<br>
<br>
We'll send troops to help the former Slavic republics and heir genocide, yet ignore Rwanda's genocide. <br>
<br>
We deplore the Palastinians bombing of innocents, yet ignore Israels killing of innocents.<br>
<br>
We back a president who slaughtered innocents and who while being investigated had the witness killed, mysteriously<br>
(Ariel Sharon)<br>

True, but we only armed them with conventional weapons. We were helping OBL drive out an invader in his country, not gas his own people.<br>

The pre-cursors are very common chemicals.   The reason why the pre-cursers are not controlled, except in cases where a country has SHOWN to be trying to make weapons, is because of thier usefulness in perfectly legitamate manufactuiring.  We did screw up in the early 80's (close to 20 years ago.  Most of Iraq's chemical weapon capabilty is completely homegrown.  It is even arguable that the material we DID sell was not critical to thier efforts anyway.<br>
