<br>
Now back to education.  I will disagree that people in poor education areas should realize that education is important and therefore education will improve.  This is looking at the issue from your perspective where your education, you feel, was acceptable.  Now, for an extreme example, you grew up and went to school in an area where the education couldn't even be considered rudimentary, where your peers are not interested in learning and the teachers are not interested in imparting knowledge, would you think that telling your kid to try and learn in that environment is necessary?  No, of course not.  If anything, you will feel that sending your kids to such a school system is futile and is only done to accomplish fulfilling the law.  Again, this is an extreme example.  So, where are these parents supposed to culturally change?  Obviously the state isn't getting it done.<br>
<br>
Now with that said, what exactly IS the problem with a federalized education system?  Obviously we have people who will use the Constitutional Shield, but that isn't addressing the problem but rather hiding from it.  <br>
<br>
Also, let me get a fact straight so we are all on the same page:  We all agree that there are many areas of the US where the students produced have received a substandard education from K-12 (in comparrison to other world leading countries).  Yes? <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

The state isn't getting the job done of convincing kids and parents that they need to learn?  How exactly is it supposed to accomplish that?  We're doing all we can - have you seen the nutty new ads that are all over TV?  &quot;I dun had tree kids, and I'm 15 years old, and I gunna get a gud edukation becuz i dun want dem tew grew up tew be lahk me.&quot;  Learning the English language would be a good place to start!  But anyway, they're trying; but government simply cannot change people's attitudes that quickly or easily, if it can at all.  What more can we do than put out ads all over the place telling people &quot;Educate yourselves already!&quot;, pass and enforce laws requiring kids to be in school, and provide free public education?  Of course - federalize it!  The question is not what harm will that do - even a passing familiarity with the federal bureacracy would reveal a great deal of the answer to that question, not to mention the many other arguments... the higher up the scale you go, the less control individual parents (you know, the ones who care?) have over the system, for one thing.

At the end of the day, IMHO, it comes down to the fact that local schooling has failed in this day and age.  It was very appropriate at the time of the Founding Fathers, and yes, they wrote the laws in that spirit.  Today, however, the inequity in funding and the complete lack of standard education quality (let alone curriculum or testing standards) means that a kid coming out of a MA school is going to be vastly better educated than your average Mississippi student.  If you don't see a problem with that, then we've identified the problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1174<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/12/03 4:45:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> But parents are not completely in control of schools, Tuwene.  They have a certain degree of control, but much of it is delegated to the school board, and there is, of course, a standard curriculum in general, just not in specific.  Don't be insulting - schools in Mississippi or Georgia do not teach that &quot;interracial proms are bad&quot; and &quot;southern baptist field trips are good&quot;.  Our laws and groups like the ACLU see to that very well.  The only place you'll have anything like what you're talking about is in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> small towns or rural areas.  The problem in places like that has more to do with a focus on football than anything else, generally - again, that has to do with the attitudes and values of parents and students, not the school system!<br>
<br>
My point is, no matter what you do with the school system, the attitudes and values of the students and parents will be the baseline determinate factor of the quality of education obtained.  Federalizing the system will only introduce a slew of new problems while completely ignoring the only factor that really matters, and doing away with the good things about the current system.  Maybe you would like every school in the nation to use Howard Zinn's textbooks - I pale at the thought.  A school in San Francisco can, if they want.  If the school my (hypothetical) children were attending wanted to use them, I'd be out there raising Hell, because I can do that and actually have a chance at affecting what happens.<br>
<br>
There are bad schools in Mass., and there are good schools in Mississippi.  You can't force anyone to learn anything - what you can do is provide the opportunity.  In the case of minors, you can even force them to sit in a chair in a classroom, but even that often accomplishes nothing.  Standardizing the material nationwide and setting up an enormous bureaucracy around it would do nothing more than exactly that - standardize it - which you might have more problems with than you think.  After all, as long as the schools are teaching nice quasi-liberal material, you'd probably be happy... but what about those pesky Republicans?  What if Ashcroft was the head of the new, improved Department of Education?  And what if the entire nation had no choice but to learn what he wanted it to?  Our government is federal for a reason, and our school system is as diverse and decentralized as it is for a good reason too.  Personally, I think we should scrap the DEA altogether... but that's just me. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 520<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/12/03 4:52:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=108>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> State education departments mandate certain aspects of curriculum, and schools follow it....to the extent that they want to.

Actually, quite to the contrary.  The question IS what harm would it do?  Because it is obvious that the current approach is failing, but you would rather stay on that failing course and keep using that failure of a method - hoping that it would somehow rectify itself magically.<br>
<br>
Somebody mentioned federal administrators in each school district, I think that would be a good start in combination with funds being alotted from the federal budget to improve the condition of the schools.  Standardized testing would provide a measure of uniformity.<br>

So far your only argument against a federal school system is that it would be mired in too much bureaucracy.  I find that excuse...  weak.<br>

The Constitution is considered &quot;a living, breathing document&quot; that is able to be changed and altered according to the wishes of the American people.  This is why American democracy works so well; it is able to be adjusted according to the times.  I would like it to be adjusted to suit the needs of the people when it comes to education and if you find that &quot;ignorant&quot; or &quot;fairly frightening&quot;, then perhaps you should be advocating that we return to the system that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only white male land owners can vote</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as well.  The only person displaying ignorance here is you.<br>
<br>
Also, my main point before was if education in the areas that are substandard isn't changed, then where will these people possibly find the motivation to aspire for better learning?  I theorize that if education was made worthwhile for everyone, motivation would increase.  How is this wrong?  People here say that cultural change must be made but from where does cultutral change spring?  An improved education system would definitately faciliitate such a change.  If not, then please inform us, your doubters, where these people will miraculously come to such a profound realization.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Federalizing the system will only introduce a slew of new problems while completely ignoring the only factor that really matters, and doing away with the good things about the current system.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So, going off of this, what is &quot;the only factor that really matters&quot;.  As far as I could tell, the US school system(s) are fraught with a myriad of problems.  Also, I would like to hear what these good things about the current system are?  I thought we had all come to an agreement that the US system has so many problems it was anything but good.<br>
<br>
Here is another thing I will just put out there for everyone to consider:  Just because a person is living in a rich school district does not entitle them to a better education than say someone who lives in Compton, CA. <br>
<br>
Yet this is precisely what I am getting from the naysayers.  You live in a poor education district?  Sucks to be you.  You should learn to culturally change yourselves instead.  This is simply rediculous.  This also smacks of &quot;classism&quot;.  I would rather have the Federal Government ensure that all people in the US are given the equal opportunity to a good education as opposed to the sea of crap with patches of good that is our status quo.<br>
<br>
Also, I am still waiting for someone to come up with figures showing the number of the top educated countries out there have a system based on the local level as opposed to nationalized.  I suspect there are none but I am more than willing to have my mind changed.<br>

This is a chicken-egg argument. Educate people better, and they will want better education.  I make the egg-chicken argument. When people want better education, they will ensure that they get it. To me, my version has the appeal that, when people want change and are motivated to change, they cause it to happen.  Your version does not appeal to me as it is the socialist version that a 'benevolent' central government can actually (force) people to change.<br>
<br>
How would a central government role bring about a &quot;miraculous change&quot; as you say?  Governments don't change people -- people do.<br>

First, I disagree that public education is a sea of crap as you call it. Second, your views smack of &quot;socialism.&quot; What you call classism we call the ability to actually act on the desire to better ourselves and our families.  The ability for low income people to change the educational options for their kids is almost non-existent however, and &quot;vouchers&quot; if well-implemented could improve that. Even Bill Clinton declared that &quot;the era of big government is over&quot; during his second term. Socialists are in the great minority in the US.<br>

Such a list of &quot;top educated countries&quot; always includes countries with smaller and much more homogeneous populations than the US. Establishing the nexus between educational excellence and the level of government that runs the schools is your challenge.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1177<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/13/03 10:38:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> The Constitution is only a &quot;living breathing document&quot; if you are the sort of wacky liberal who likes to think that way.  I like Clarence Thomas' response when asked about this very matter - he pulled out a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution that he keeps in his jacket, looked at it, and said, &quot;My copy is inanimate.&quot;  I'm tired of the living breathing document crap - that's nothing more than an excuse to read into it what you want to be there.  The Constitution can be changed by the American people - by Amending it, not by reading new rights, new restrictions, or new federal powers into it by the courts or by Congress.  If you would like it to be adjusted to suit the needs of the American people, then by all means, lobby for an Amendment allowing what you would like to happen - don't just try to pretend that it's already there, hidden from the watchful eyes of politicians, lawyers, and judges for these last two centuries.  The fact that suffrage was restricted to white male landowners in the 18th and early 19th century means very little to our current argument - that issue was taken care of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>by amending the Constitution</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  You have read the Constitution, haven't you?  Unlike so many of the &quot;penumbra&quot; rights and allowances recently dreamed up by judges, that issue was taken care of as it should be.  It's so amusing that you label me ignorant on the topic - we may disagree about it, but ignorant I am not... try to keep a rein on the unwarranted insults.  You've already had one of them thrown back in your face.  Forse non vuoi un'altro?<br>
<br>
As far as education, you still don't get it.  You think we can somehow make education &quot;worthwhile for everyone&quot;, and that a federal system will accomplish that.  Government cannot make people care!  All they can do is provide a service.  Cultural change can come through education only if those being educated are interested in education!  Since the problem is an apathy regarding education, changing the system won't do anything to help at all.  Whether the education is good or bad, they still won't care.  That's where vouchers come in - you allow parents who do care, but are stuck in an area with a majority of parents who don't, to send their kids somewhere with good education, i.e. parents who care.  That's been my entire point all along - parent and student motivation determines the quality of education, given a certain baseline amount of funding <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>which is already present in 99.8% of schools</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Standardizing the curriculum is something you worry about once you get people to actually stay in the school and care.  Of course, under our current system, even if they do want to learn, they might be stuck in a bad school - and that's why I think if they were allowed to move around, it would improve the quality of education in general.<br>
<br>
The Federal government should assure that anyone who wants a good education can obtain it.  It already does that.  What the federal government cannot do, and should not try to do (for should it try, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fail, and accomplish nothing but spending heaps of money to no end), is force people to change.  That's the whole point of the sort of socialistic programs that you and so many other people advocate - government shaping society.  Frankly, the whole idea scares me.  Government should provide services, not shove ideas, views, or values down anyone's throat.  I thought that was what, oh, separation of Church and State was all about?  You have ignored my point above so far - you love the idea of standardized education, but you seem to assume that such an education would follow nicely along the lines of what you want.  What if those redneck trailer park Bible-thumpers were voted into power?  You seem to think that they already have been - would you want Bush and Ashcroft dictating what your kids learn?  They might even throw in a smidgen of Creationism in there!

<br>
If the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT tried to do that, it could be challenged in court and struck down.  See:  Current abortion laws.<br>
<br>
on the local level, it's far harder to enforce.  Only a VERY motivated teacher or parent can get bad education out of schools.  See:  Scopes v. Tennessee(?) I believe.<br>
<br>
When education standards are at a central, national level, they will BY DEFAULT be held to the most &quot;middle&quot; standards - there will be no veering to either the right OR the left, because there will be too many opponents on either side.  The only thing redneck america and Boston/San Francisco are going to agree on are going to be nice, middle-of-the-fence curriculums - and frankly, that's the way it SHOULD be, until college.<br>
<br>
In College, you've got the equal and unbiased foundation - study whatever you like.  Let one kid be a theology major, the other a computer scientist - that's GREAT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mertondraco>Merton Draco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fuck all of you</span><br>  Posts: 2520<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/13/03 1:23:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=660.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The fact that suffrage was restricted to white male landowners in the 18th and early 19th century means very little to our current argument - that issue was taken care of by amending the Constitution.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If there is no religious curriculum being taught at schools, then there is no problem.  That is fine by me.  Religious studies canb be left up to the parents or the student themselves, not the duty of the government to spread religion and never will be, thankfully.<br>

I'll tell you what, if the Ashcroft ultr right wingers wanted to push religion/creationism in a federal school system (and they couldn't because of the Separation of Church and State) it still wouldn't bothe me much, because the benefits of standardized education far outweight a religion class here and there.  The math, literature, science, writing skills, reading skills,  being taught in a Federal public school wouldn't be much (if at all) different from the stuff that is currently being taught.  Those subjects are pretty much bias free.  Finally, if it did reach a point where Creationism would be taught in schools (and it couldn't because of Separation of Church and State) then I would still expect the creationism classes to be optional.<br>
