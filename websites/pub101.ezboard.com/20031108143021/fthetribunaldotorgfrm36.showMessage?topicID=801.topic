Ok... the reviewers HATED this movie with a passion I've not seen in a long time.  Village Voice gave it an &quot;F&quot;.  Ebert gave it 0 stars.<br>
<br>
I absolutely loved it.  I'm pro death penalty, but only maybe 5% more to that side then the 50% undecided point.<br>
<br>
Why did the liberal critics hate this movie so much?  Was it just plain bad?  If you've seen it I'd like some opinions.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://kot.jellopit.com/rowe/rigerprance2.jpg" style="height:211;width:117;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Worst performance from Kevin Spacey I'd ever seen.  I honestly thought this guy couldn't make a bad movie.  Scenes where he was begging the report girl to help him <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>seemed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like he was just being controlling, but in the end we find out he was probably serious.  If he was serious, why didn't he just tell her everything instead of giving her veiled clues?  Hannibal Lechter did becuase it was fun to him and he had nothing to lose, this guy had no excuse.<br>
<br>
End of the movie, clock was ticking away, she was trying to figure out who had the full tape.  She didn't call the police, or the govenor, she wanted to figure it out on her own. Tick.. tick.. tick..  he's strapped in the chair and she's calmy sitting in the psycho's house watching the tape.<br>
<br>
She busrts out of the house, the car fails, tick... tick... she decides to run on foot to the prison!  Keeps her cell phone in her purse.. actually runs past a few payphones...  DAMN, didn't make it!  Oh well.<br>
<br>
Now he's died unjustly.  The system failed?  Should we put a moritorium on death penalty?  Nope, this was just a trick.  The guy, a 'very smart' and 'very passionate almost in a psycho way' guy cheated his way to death row.  Intentionally mislead the state and costs the taxpayers some dough in the process.  He, at the concept level of his scheme, proved nothing.  Only that he's passionate and has psycho friends and isn't nearly as smart as he's supposed to be.<br>
<br>
They hinted that he didn't actually intend to die, that the psycho holding the full tape was supposed to release it dramatically just before he died.  Then they hinted that he didn't release it because he felt a full on death would make a bigger impact.  If this was true why didn't the guy about to die say so?  I guess he felt a death would make a bigger impact too, but if he's so smart he would have known that the state would have seen this as cheating as I said above.<br>
<br>
Makes no sense, but does provide for some cheesy drama.<br>
<br>
The best parts of the movie were the sex scenes, they actually rocked.  Also the helper guy reporter the sent with the girl was pretty good.  She was bad, Chronkite on pms I think he said, so when she got teary eyed it was kinda comical.<br>
<br>
I wish they had a true story to back this up, would have helped alot. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enzoblueksies>Enzo Blueksies</A> at: 7/26/03 10:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigadoondemortis>Rigadoon deMortis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 418<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/03 1:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=801.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Life of David Gale</span><hr size=1> I'm not picking apart your post to nitpick - but because I saw each of these things as way different.<br>

<br>
His whole schtick was he wanted to be redeemed in the eyes of his son.  That's why he requested the reporter.  He was begging for help - but not to be spared execution as we find out at the end - he was in on the whole thing from the day of the murder - this gives her &quot;Freedom&quot; so to speak.<br>
<br>

<br>
I do agree with this being a point of contention.  It bugged the hell out of me that she sat in the house and watched the tape.  However, the lawyer said that &quot;The machine will need to be fed by 6:00&quot;.  Realistically calling the police wouldn't do jack - and if you needed to contact the governor - how would you go about it?  But she does put her intern partner on to making the phone calls while she begins her &quot;run&quot; to the execution site with the evidence.  Also - the lawyer pointed out that the powers that be wouldn't believe her - because she had been &quot;Fratenizing&quot; with the client.<br>
<br>

<br>
The cell phone thing they cover in the very beginning - and lots of people seemed to miss this.  When they first walk into death row the guy asks for pointy objects, pointy shoes, and cell phones.  She indicates  - yeah I got one - but there's no signal here so what's the point.<br>
<br>
At the time this was set (mid 90s) and in the town it was set in (Huntsville), it's completely believable that there was no cell phone coverage.  Texas is a very very large state,  and Huntsville, with the exception of the prisons, is a typical middle of nowhere Texas location.<br>

Only Bitsy knew this.  I don't think it's about the system failing - and maybe this is what liberals are so upset about - they thought it was going to be a movie about the &quot;system&quot;.  I don't think the movie is actually about the political issue of the death penalty at all.  I think it's really a movie about the consequences of life, and the desire to seek redemption.<br>
<br>

<br>
Noone hinted this - Bitsy came to this conclusion and thus her attempt to &quot;save&quot; him.  But in the end we discover he was in on it - he had no will to live anymore, and he indicates this - he says that death is something we fear so greatly and we do all these sorts of things to avoid it.  But he's accepted that he's going to die - and he knows why he's doing it.  For the salvation of his son's memory of him.<br>

I would have to disagree. I thought Kate Winslet was phenomenal.  Listen to her accent in the film, then listen to her real accent.  She's totally English, and completely lost the dialect while playing the part.<br>
<br>
On the crying - she cries four times but at three different &quot;awakenings of innocence&quot; she truly looses it - all when watching different tapes.  The first is the horror of the tragedy itself when she sees the first tape.  The second is when its obvious it was a suicide - the horror that things were not as they appear, much, much worse.  And the third is the horror that she was somehow an unwitting accomplice in all of this (But actually this frees her from guilt).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One question I had - there are constant references to Judas.  When he's stumbling drunk in the street he mentions Judas and the 20 pieces of silver.  When he walks into her house before he passes out he's talking about praying to the wrong Judas, and the &quot;saint of lost causes&quot;.  Why all the Judas references?  If he's supposed to be Christ in this film (the toy lamb which he's always carrying with him emphasizes this).  Then is there a judas in the film? Is it her? <br>
<br>
When I think about Judas - I think about a poor duped accomplice in God's great plan - similiar to her role in the whole thing.  She didn't betray him (I don't think) - the most prominent Judas characteristic is betrayal.  But she was the unwitting accomplice in his plan. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://kot.jellopit.com/rowe/rigerprance2.jpg" style="height:211;width:117;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
I think she could have convinced the police or govenor if she would have found a phone.  She was a big time reporter and they would have lost jobs if she squawked to every paper in the country that she had proof and they didn't listen, espicially when the proof is so undeniable.<br>
<br>
Didn't know what to make of the judas thing either..  kinda forgot that point honestly, or put it off.<br>
<br>
She preferred to be called Bitsy.  That in itself is hilarious.  If I walked up to my boss and said, deadpan faced, that I preferred to be called Snuggles, I would have gotten roughly the same effect.<br>
<br>
I also was a bit put off by how crazy he went.  He was supposed to be an 'academic stud' but more than once proved out to be either a drunken pschizo(sp) or a looney liberal (tv debate).  It was really hard to believe him as seriously intellectual.  He was great as the teacher in the beginning, then seriously lost it to the point where I didn't really feel sorry for the guy.<br>
<br>
I do agree that the Village Voice et al debased this movie because it didn't do much for a liberal cause of any kind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=801.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=801.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=801.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=801.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
