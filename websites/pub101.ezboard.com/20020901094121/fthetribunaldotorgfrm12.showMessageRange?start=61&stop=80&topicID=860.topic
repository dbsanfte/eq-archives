I really enjoy debating because you can learn from the exchange.<br>
<br>
As to being opposed to abortion, I understand because I was opposed to it as well. But then I started thinking along these lines...<br>
<br>
Say you have a father that is dying because of kidney failure. The only way he can survive is if his son agrees to donate a kidney. For this scenario let's assume that the son will suffer no ill effects from the donation, yet refuses to for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
Now, I think we all can agree that the right thing for the son to do would be to donate the kidney. I also think that we can all agree that if we forced the son to donate the kidney, that the father would benefit.<br>
<br>
So, would you force the son to donate the kidney? After all, it saves a life and no harm is done? The father has a right to live, it's right there in the Constitution.<br>
<br>
The fact is, if you take away the son's right to do with his body as he sees fit to fulfill the father's right to live, you are doing a great amount of harm. You are taking away the son's right to control his body. Nobody will argue the fact that the father has a right to live, but that right can't infringe on the son's right to control what is done to his own body.<br>
<br>
Now apply that to abortion. I think alot would agree that fetus has a right to live. The thing is that fetus is dependent on the mother's body and the mother has rights as well. We could prohibit her from having an abortion to fulfill the fetus rights and it would save the it, but at the cost of taking away the mothers right.<br>
<br>
If we are not willing to take the sons right to control his own body away to save a conscious, self aware father, why would we take away a mother's right to do the same, for a fetus who is neither conscious or self aware?<br>
<br>
I don't like abortion. I despise it when women have multiple abortions because they are so irresponsible when it comes to using birth control. However, stepping in and taking a woman's right to control her body away, may save the fetus, but will destroy on of the most important rights we ALL we have... the right to control our own bodies. <p><br>

          My question is, if the stem cell is farmed and the embryo has been manipulated by science, is this considered a human?  It is not produced in the same way, they dont take a sperm and egg and introduce them they take dna from the body and produce these embryos.  And it even isnt grown in a human it is grown in a petri dish, and then the stem cell is taken and manipulated more.   this isnt affecting the mother cause there isnt one.  its just another form of medicine.  Bush is against this cause of what science can do with it, from a radio speech i heard him do, he is afraid that through stem cell reseach scientist can develop a better human.  So take away the whole abortion thing, different circumstances altogether.  <br>

For one, if the father is against abortion, he should have discussed this with her before hand, as once she is pregenant, he has no rights until the baby is born. And of course, the mother is responsible for her choice, whcih only she alone can make as it is her body.<br>
<br>
Maybe someday embryos will be able to survive outside the womb from day one (with support of course) and then we will be able to fulfill the right to live without infringing on the mothers right to control her body.<br>
<br>
Of course the question of when life begins will still need to be answered, but at least we could fulfill the potential for life regardless of that issue. <p><br>

<br>
Since I pay a large amount in taxes I think I will stay right here. Just because you want it doesn't mean it will be so. It should be a voters choice to decide if this type of research is &quot;ok&quot;.<br>
<br>
The whole problem is there will always be someone who goes to far. Someone who can't follow the rules or follow a moral stand point on what is &quot;right&quot;. Now you may come back at me and say, 'who is to judge what is right?' and that would be a good point. I consider things like cutting open a cats skull while it's alive and seeing the effects of different chemicals coming into contact with it, while the animal is alive, wrong. Why? Because my moral sense doesn't wish to cause harm to others nor pain, even small creatures. Some people don't follow this train of thought though. They are so clouded with what they think is best for humanity that forget the simple things like caring what or who they hurt to reach their goal. <br>
<br>
What would make sure it stops at stem cloning? Do you really think if people started this type of cloning that they would not try to make a human? Life is something to prize and look on in awe, because you feel lucky enough to have been blessed with it. What happens when life is suddenly a pricetag to be purchased on the Internet? Buy your own clone today! <br>
<br>
The one thing that keeps humans in cheek is that they believe there is a divine creature above who has powers beyond us (Yes, yes please don't start threads on the &quot;I don't believe there is a god&quot; topic. A good portion of the population believes there is some divine creature though above us). If we no longer believe in that, because we can create life out of almost nothing, where will we be? What will happen when people no longer fear doing wrong because the religion holds them back no longer? <br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just rambling though....<br>

Well, until it joins with an egg or is at least in the process of doing so, it would be a hard argument to make. You can definatly say that if someone injurs you so you can't produce sperm that they have robbed your potential to create life, but I doubt that's where you were going with this.<br>
