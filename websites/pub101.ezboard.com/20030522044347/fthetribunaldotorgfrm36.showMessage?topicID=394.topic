We know what these terrorist groups are capable of and we know that they would be more than happy to die in the process.<br>
<br>
The US may be capable of launching a 'blitzkrieg' that will wipe out Iraqi command and control within 48 hours but it is completely unprepared and vulnerable for terrorist warfare to be waged on its own soil.  <br>
<br>
As so many public documents on the Internet attest - it would take probably take 20 well supplied people acting in coordination to knock out key power grids, transportation hubs and spread chemical and biological warfare agents in high density urban areas across the US.  We are incredibly fortunate that the terrorists who perpetuated 9/11 were comparative amateurs.  <br>
<br>
If you are a supporter of the war on Iraq - then you should be prepared for the war to arrive, in biological, chemical or even nuclear form, at your local shopping mall, place of work or school.<br>
<br>
There is, however, an alternative to US unilateral action which will be seen by the Muslim world as a declaration of war on Muslims by the US.  That alternative is to act through the Security Council of the United Nations which would put a stamp of legitimacy on the actions of the US and may be what is needed to prevent a jihad on American soil.  There is a reason why every country in the world apart from the US, UK and Australia wish to seek a diplomatic solution.<br>
<br>
I am not going to say that if you go in and murder the civilian population of Baghdad while they sleep in their beds at night on February 17th that you can sleep safely in yours.  What I am saying is that the American people need to stand up and question where their President is leading them and what the consequences of his actions will be.  <br>
<br>
If, at the end of the day, you accept the judgement of your President that it necessary to carpet bomb Baghdad and thus kill thousands or millions of Iraqi civilians, you should be aware that as an American civilian you too will be a target.  <br>
<br>
You may feel differently when the lives of you or your loved ones are endangered.  But by then it will be too late.  <br>
<br>
All I ask is that you think long and hard about it now before such a time comes and speak up.  After all its your hard won democratic right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/4/03 2:18:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't want to say I told you so</span><hr size=1> For one thing you are not in a position to say 'I told you so&quot; till we actually DO attack Iraq and IF there is a major terrorist incident afterwards.

The 9/11 terrorist were some of their best(And they did pull off the operation).  Where are these super terrorist operatives suppose to come from?  If they existed 9/11 would have involved what you just described.  Not just the planes into the WTC.  And besides we all know how grounded in reality most internet sources are.  That is not to discount the threat of future terrorist attacks, they will happen, I just find your scenerio, while technically feasible, unrealistic.  Al Queda is not going to ratchet up operations against us because of anything we do in Iraq, they already are trying as much as they can and will attempt it with or with out a war in Iraq.  For one thing they don't particualarly care about Iraq (They hate Sadaam almost as much as they hate the US but they will use it for PR no doubt) and for another they are probably about as pissed at us as they are going to get after we booted them more or less out of Afganistan.  <br>
<br>
The other major middle east terrorists(various Palestinian groups) don't really care about Iraq either, again they will use it for PR but they are not going to go out of thier way to target the US.  The various Palestinian groups don't have the global reach they use to have back in the 70's and they are far more concearned about Isreal.  Most of their attacks are aimed at provoking an Isreali response in the hopes that the Isreali's go overboard and strain the relationship with the US.  The last thing they are going to do is do something that will tighten US/Isreali ties.<br>

Not exactly true.  For one Several other countries have backed the US policy.  Spain, Italy, Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland off the top of my head.  Also a lot of countries concearns in opposeing US policy has more to do with money, as in what they can make doing buisness with Sadaam and Iraq than it does with any fear of terrorism.<br>
<br>
If your only reason to oppose a war in Iraq is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fear</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of terrorism then my response is for you to grow a pair.<br>

Reason: they listen to stupid pussies like you.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Chief UN inspector told in his report to the UN that Iraq has ALOT of Chemical weapon producing agents unaccounted for.  Which is pretty much the reason why they went in there.  <br>
<br>
Did you not see the Iraqi Ambassador to the UN shit his pants on camera when they asked him about the documents that were found in the private residence of thier scientists showing tons of these agents that the Iraqi's denied ever posessing?<br>
<br>
To be anti-war is one thing....but to try to spread propaganda is another.<br>
<br>
Bush (while being a complete moron) is not calling the shots on this alone...he has all his top military advisors screaming at him that this needs to be done or else something like the nightmaristic terrorist scenario you described may be possible for Iraq to finance and equip.<br>
<br>
And for God sakes...NOBODY is going to blow up innocent civilians, the only Civilians that would be harmed would be civilians driving a tank, carrying a machine gun, or operating a god damned AA site.  Last time we invaded Iraq Hussien used innocent civilians as human shields...as well as lining the city of Bagdad with the kind of bombs that would cause a pure hallocaust should ground troops enter the City...all in a last ditch effort to remain in control.  So who is the real monster here?<br>
<br>
Anyone else here remember when chemical weapons were used on a city in the Balkans by Slobodan Milosovic because it was the fastest method of ethnic cleansing?  That shit is in the DNA and it will continue to disfigure thier kids for years to come. And you guys want to let Hussein have them?  No fucking way.

First, it's a huge assumption to try and predict how the &quot;Muslim World&quot; will react to this.  You have no fucking idea what the millions of Muslims outside of the middle east will react.  Secondly, for all intents and purposes, 9/11 pretty much proves that there is ALREADY a jihad on American soil in the eyes of SOME muslims.<br>

Let me share something with all of you putzes  that think you're being heard when you post your paranoid, ill-informed garbage here:  Nobody gives a fuck what you think.  If anyone thought you had something important to say, maybe they'd elect you to an office where your opinion mattered.  And it's not like you can do anything about your complaints.  You can cry about war, terrorism, taxes, health care, the economy, etc. all you want, but what you say or type is all a big fucking waste of energy.  You can't and won't do a God Damned thing about it but bitch.  Your vote doesn't count.  Do the math:  Pretend you voted exactly the opposite way that you did for our last presidential election .... did Gore win this time ?!?!?!?!<br>
<br>
Fuck, get a megaphone and shout your babbling rants in a populated metropolitan area .... people will think you're insane ( rightfully so. )  But maybe at least they'll pay attention for a few minutes.  Here, you're just being a fucking tool.<br>
