Believe what you wanna believe.  I sure as hell don't want to hear about it, though.<br>
<br>
And in case you wanted to know... I believe in ignorance, and just trying to do the right thing most of the time.<br>
<br>
Don't be an asshole.  Treat others like you want people to treat you.  If you're like Ladida and enjoy putting your cock in other people's asses, then expect Mr. T to come along and widen you a bit when you're least expecting it.<br>
<br>
Give as much or more than you take.  Earn what you have.  If you're Ladida, this means YOU buy the 24 pack of Vasoline this week, cuz Minng's been buying it for the last 2 months you cheap prick.<br>
<br>
If someone asks for help, help them if you can.  Like when Ladida's dad asks him for a reach-around.<br>
<br>
Flush.  If you take donkey craps like Ladida's mother, then unclog your shit before the next person comes along.<br>
<br>
The devil made me write all that.  I said 20 hail Mary's and all was forgiven.  I can no longer be held accountable for anything said above.  If you hold me accountable you are attacking my faith and my religion, and will burn in hell.  Awesome.<br>

<br>
This is &quot;class&quot;? I dunno about that. I guess, in real life, that I do have class, then.. Lemme tell you about something. <br>
<br>
I once visited a cult, with a friend of mine. We had no idea it was a cult, though. We just thought we were visiting this guy. He'd given us directions, but no phone number, or address. That turned out, was due to him not having an address. He lived in a trailer, on a dirt road. Kurt Vonnegut Jr sez &quot;It's not a crime to be poor, but it might as well be&quot; hardy har, but wealth and poverty doesn't make a person good or bad, of course. I didn't have an opinion of this guy as being good or bad then, and I don't now either. I thought he was a weirdo then, and now, I think he was a weirdo and a loser. <br>
<br>
Well, we sat down, and he offered us some wine. Kinda odd, I thought, they live in utter poverty, and offer us wine. It was from a tiny, 1/3 size bottle (I don't know wine), and he said it was made locally, and would we like to see where it came from? Uh yeah sure. So off we went. The vinyard was just around the corner, but this wasn't no ordinary Napa Valley outfit. This thing had big walls around it, and a gate with a security guard, who smilled and nodded at our friend the weirdo, and let us in. <br>
<br>
We were full of questions. What is this place, what's with the walls and the guard, he knew you, nodded at you, what's going on here? He told us it was a club, a wine club. Wow, a wine club, damn that's impressive! Does it cost a lot? Yeah, it cost $400 a month (or something like that). <br>
<br>
Now, he lives in a little trailer, on a dirt road, with his wife and one kid, in complete powerty, and pays hundreds of dollars to belong to a wine club? <br>
<br>
Bit by bit, it dawned on us, what this was. It was a bona fide fucking CULT! The chap in charge was known as &quot;The Teacher&quot; and would educate these people, with the &quot;good bits&quot; from the bible, various philosophical works, just basically fill people's heads with good information, and in return they would live in various degrees of poverty, and pay every nickel they could spare, to The Teacher. As far as money goes, this dude earned money by washing the other cult-members' homes, so I guess he was at the bottom of the ladder somehow. But he'd been up to this for several years. The Teacher had several cars, including a Rolls Royce, and they only rarely saw The Teacher, cos other people would teach peons like him, not The Teacher. And getting an invite up to The Teacher's mansion was like a huge deal... It struck me that teaching someone the &quot;good bits&quot; from all these works, makes a lot of sense, you know? The bible has some very good information, stories, points about ethics and what have you. But it also has some totally immoral and downright evil shit in it. But most of if is junk and garbage. Similar things could be said about other works of this nature, as well as more modern books on philosophy. So the principle made sense, just as far as learning stuff. <br>
<br>
But this dude was not very enlightened. He was somewhere in his mid 20s, but his mind was like an early teenager. His desires and hopes were oddly and childishly materialistic. <br>
<br>
Well, we kept asking the guy over and over, what this was all about. And I was very respectful, because I wanted to learn as much as possible about it, and I did not have any disrespectful thoughts about it. I was just too stunned, I guess. Not so my buddy, who was a philosphy professor at the state university. He started saying stuff like &quot;Oh so you are kinda like Jesuits, except you don't have the sheep rugs?&quot; and things of that nature. As we drove off, he joked about how The Teacher would honor him with an invite, and probly have his wife over a wine barrel in the cellar... I remember distinctly, how he referred to the cult as &quot;Over the Barrel Club&quot;. <br>
<br>
I dunno dude... I didn't make fun of it, I guess I was just too shocked. I hardly think these guys are gonna do a Waco or Heaven's Gate stunt. But a cult is fucked up -- I mean, even most Christians agree with that, and Christianity is just a very well established uber cult with lots of power and history etc. <br>
<br>
I believe in just basically being good to people. Pretty simple stuff. And no, I really don't get up in arms about religious folks. I really appreciate talking things through with them, to learn things. And I wouldn't normally get in anyone's face about their beliefs, but as I said, I've seen this shit before, jesusfreaks killing kids, basically because they are a bunch of loons high on religion, and hey, that aint right. Neither are mickey mouse wicca witchcraft fucked up goth mental cases drawing pentagrams on the floor and jerking off 5 year olds, jesus dude, that is messed up. People killing and abusing children in the name of religion, and you're all going &quot;Oh I'd never question your religious beliefs!&quot; <br>
