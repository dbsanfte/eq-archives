You might have seen, in the distance, a small shape, reminiscent of a halfling, tearing through the denizens of the thicket with all the fervor of a young kodiak in a bixie hive! If you were there long enough, you would see that small halfling shape draw closer to the gate in the wall , and would eventually appear to grow a bit larger and take the form of a halfling warrior named Smallhands, as she ran closer to the gate on her way to town to refresh her hunting supplies.<br>
<br>
One might wonder why a young halfling would spend so much time killing insects and animals when the vale is threatened by goblins and orcs! If you asked her, she might tell you she is looking for a giant fruit bat rib cage, that ever so elusive anatomical rarity among the asthmatic giant fruit bats with no ribcages. She might tell you that a friend told her to gather all the silks from the spiders and spiderlings and sell them in the bazaar. She might tell you she likes to gather anatomical components for all the other halflings, even if she cant find hers. Or she might just laugh and say, &quot;Sorry, I can understand that language!&quot;<br>
<br>
You see, the thicket is a quiet place. Halflings dont have neighbors. They only generally speak halfling. They exist in their own happy halfling world. Sometimes foreigners come through the thicket and shout, &quot;Guffrty sedfre jvbert an f dll nhewb gho&quot;, or auction, &quot;FTB bucye jonuyginbs 3 kjp rixh!&quot;,<br>
but most halflings obliviously continue on, in their happy halfling world. It's a world where crickets chirp in the forest, all day and night, where magical green fuzzy acorns fall from the great trees, and berries grow bigger than anyplace else on Antonica.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, halflings stop and take the time to bring others into their world. Sometimes, they can make a good friend teaching the other races what it means to be a halfling. If you asked Smallhands if that ever happened to her, she might tell you a story about a barbarian named Glisan. A shamaness who came to the thicket for one reason or another, and found herself alone in a half height world of masked half height deputies. Smallhands would tell you about the time she ran past Glisan on her way through the gate in the wall of serilis, and tried to talk to her. She didnt understand her, of course! So Smallhands ran on, and bought her bandages and field point arrow heads and large groove nocks and round cut fletchings and wooden arrow shafts and jum jum juice and made a couple rat sandwiches. But, when she ran past Glisan again, on her way back to the other side of the great wall of serilis, she stopped and talked to her again. She took the time to teach her the ways o' the shire folk.<br>
<br>
Last night, Smallhands made a journey. A long journey, and a scary one, for her, being a small halfling in a big world, and nearly all of it new to her eyes. She didnt make that journey alone ... Glisan was with her! Together, they traveled first through the Runnyeye Citadel, laughing as they sprinted past the goblin guards, who of course gave chase! Smallhands and Glisan ran all the way to the gorge of King Xorbb, a dangerous place, but again they ran through, having left the goblins of Runnyeye behind in their fetid and dank citadel underground. Now they broke out of the canyons into the plains of Karana, the muddites unable to pursue them further, because once they leave the shadows of the canyons their clay bodies dry up in the sun! Oh, didnt I tell you! As they ran through the gorge of King Xorbb, a veritable army of elemental creatures made of earth pursued them, hoping to drag them down and smash their bodies into the earth! Our heroes were not to be stopped by such as Muddites! <br>
<br>
Now in the open sun in the eastern plains of Karana, Smallhands gasped in astonishment at the wide open sky, the clouds lazily making their way across, a slow dance of of colors and shapes on a background of the most beautiful blue she had ever seen. But she didn't gape too long! Her and Glisan ran on, possessed by the spirit of the wolf! They ran to a great rope bridge, built of timbers and ropes of a girth that made the guardian stronghold in rivervale look like a dirt shack! Smallhands' mouth hung open as she ran under the mighty timbers and heard the ropes creaking from the bridge shifting in the winds. Never had she seen such a sight. And on the two ran. They ran until they reached the northern plains, and as they ran, a figure loomed on the horizon. A terrible figure, a giant the size of 200 halflings all stacked around and atop each other, a giant with the most horrible pink complexion and hideous taste in clothing! Smallhands shuddered in revulsion as she looked at the cap of the hill giant. She wondered briefly if perhaps it was giants that built the bridge she just crossed, but such contemplations quickly left her mind as she focused on the new world unfolding before her. The two ran on, and on, and they reached the spires of the Combine Empire, standing in mute tribute to the lost civilization, curved, rune etched spires arcing together in silent grace. Smallhands was, by this time, nearly numb from mental stimulation, so she just sat under the spires and took it all in, eyes shining bright with wonder.<br>
<br>
Soon the nexus shimmered to life, bright motes of magical energy spun all about in a whirlpool of energy, and Glisan and our hero reappeared somewhere else! People where everywhere, all shapes, all sizes, all races! Smallhands was seen to shiver when she saw all the ogres and dark elves. They ran quickly from that place to the bazaar, the great market, where Smallhands took her tightly bundled furs, bolts of silk and spools of silk thread, found a spot not too close to any dark elves or ogres, spread her wares about her, slapped an abitrary (and what seemed to her to be an exorbitant!) price on them, and waited for her first customer. Only a few minutes had passed before people started stopping to view her wares, and buying them all up! Smallhands gaped in amazement at her growing pile of platinum coins, and shared a wide eyed glance with Glisan, trying to pretend to her customers she was a jaded trader, not swayed by the sight of all that coin!<br>
<br>
If you asked Smallhands how long she thought it would take to raise the money she needed for equipment, she would have told you hours, at least. But what happened was she raised 243 platinum coins in the space of less than an hour! She closed up her shop early, and went shopping! First she bought a bronze bracer, and slapped it on her wrist on place of the cloth one she wore. Then she saw a blade, a dull red blade that looked like all business, called an ebon razor, she had to have that too! She finally saw a Netherbian chitin breastplate, and, giving up all ambition of ever finding a giant fruit bat rib cage, she bought it, with no small amount of anxiety, but, when she tried it on, it matched her proudfoot platemail armor perfectly! Through it all, Glisan was with her, keeping her company, offering advice, and just being a great friend.<br>
<br>
Smallhands had quite an advenure on her way back to the vale, too, ... but that is another story! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujaxy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaxy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Founding Chieftess</span><br>  Posts: 347<br> <font color=#660000>(9/10/02 10:48:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bixie Berry Buns and Breasplates!</span><hr size=1> ( ooc )<br>

In fact, they fought quite a few battles! If you had watched them that evening, you would have seen them fighting a carrion spider, a gorge hound, a lion patriarch, a lioness matriarch, a dark stalker, and an evil eye! This trio was an oddball bunch, two of them were over six feet tall, and the other one was not even half the height of the other two! <br>
<br>
You might wonder why they were fighting all those things. If you had asked the small one, she might have said she was fighting Carrion spiders because they, in turn, ate halflings as a dietary staple! And her being a halfling, and a deputy, and a member of the great wall squad, (she might seem quite proud of this, and stand tall while she said it…well, tall being a relative term) she felt it her duty to fight the spiders guilty of such fiendish habits as eating halflings! And as far as all the lions, and chasm crawlers,(which are giant snakes, with a poisonous bite and skin the mottled color of the rocks in the gorge), and gorge hounds,(which are just mean canines, bred strong by the tough environment of the narrow canyons), and dark stalkers,(which seemed a lot like gorge hounds to the halfling, Smallhands, except, they had black fur and were quite stealthy), well, the reasons she fought all those is mostly just because she wanted to make them into sandwiches and steaks! <br>
<br>
Yes, Smallhands likes food. If you watched the halfling, in her journeys through and around Rivervale, the quiet halfling city, she would be seen to be giving food to nearly everyone she talked to. You might think, what a nice halfling! The fact is, well, she is a nice halfling, but, she found that most people give her food in return! Every exotic dish Smallhands gets makes her quiver with excitement! Many times she just sits and looks through her bag of food, smelling the Halas ten pound pies, trying a bite of a patty melt, drooling as she thinks of her plans for that mammoth steak in cream sauce.<br>
<br>
Oh, what about that evil eye? Well, it had to be stopped! After all, it was evil! And halflings are good, through and through. You might know this, or you might not, but evil eyes use mind control. They beguile their enemies, they snatch their free will, they cause one to turn on their friends, or run of a cliff, or something equally nefarious. You see, evil eyes really are evil…through and through. It isn’t easy to defeat them …but the trio in the plains that evening did! Smallhands, the halfling, Glisan, the beautiful and wise barbarian shaman, and, another barbarian, Jorlik, a mighty shaman also, strong, with a easy smile and always a laugh. The three didn’t blindly take on the evil eye…they made a plan first! They assessed their own ability to resist the evil mind magic, Smallhands checked her blades and her quiver, Jorlik readied his hammer and his magical spirit strike, Glisan stood with her spear in hand and a dangerous gleam in her eye.<br>
<br>
Smallhands ran past the evil eye and let an arrow fly from her bow! Jorlik and Glisan waited in ambush (the trio’s standard fighting plan), and as Smallhands lured the evil eye close, they let fly with mighty magics! The eye was caked with frost as the icy blasts of the northerners spells froze its skin and membranes! Smallhands slashed and kicked as fast as she could! The eye, evil and deadly as it was, fell beneath the onslaught of the three courageous fighters…its’ summoned animated warrior soon followed it into oblivion! And there was great rejoicing! The three cheered and clapped and hugged each other, congratulations were given on a battle well fought.<br>
<br>
Oh, they were cocky now, those three! They smugly slew beast after beast with the same plan, Glisan and Jorlik waiting in ambush, Smallhands drawing the prey into the trap. For hours, mighty spells flew, Smallhands little arms pumped like windmills in a distant gnomish land as her sword arm rose and fell, and the plains of eastern Karana were the playground of the three!<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until they saw another evil eye that they were put in their place. Oh, it would be an easy fight! After all, they had defeated such as this before, right? And without much ado, they pulled the evil eye into an ambush! Oh, ‘twas a glorious battle! At least, until, the eye slipped its cold tendrils of thought into the minds of our heroes! Smallhands stood mesmerized as she watched her friends fall under the control of the beast, their faces twisted in horror at the evil of the thoughts they could not control, thoughts alien and mad! Smallhands shook with exertion as she tried to move, and finally broke free! She ran after the beast, tears streaming down her face as she saw her friends marching zombie like under the sway of the eye! She slashed, and kicked, with all her heart, the evil eye hit back, its animated warrior hit back, and her friends, minds lost to the cold evil, hit back too! Smallhands finally crumpled as Glisan, face contorted in horror and revulsion, stabbed her spear into her tiny body.<br>
<br>
Well, it was a lesson learned. But it had its price. Jorlik and Smallhands, slain in the eastern plains, Glisan, mind scarred and heart wounded. Glisan stood alone after she defeated the eye, her friends’ souls being drawn back to their anchors.<br>
<br>
The three came back together, there, in the eastern plains, Jorlik and Smallhands running together from Rivervale, through the Runnyeye Citadel, through the gorge of the evil eye king, Xorbb, and out from those canyons into the open plains. They were humbled, and a bit more somber, as they regrouped and drew their armor on. But, evil eyes can’t keep our trio of heroes down! They continued their quest for meat and snake eggs and halfling vengeance!<br>
<br>
At length, they grew weary, and, decided to go to the human village nearby to sell what items they had acquired and equitably distribute the monies earned. So they sauntered across the plains to a small village in the shadow of the great mountains, browsing through the wares of the rural merchants, selling spider legs and venom sacks. They split up the earnings, said their goodbyes to each other. Jorlik gathered wood for a campfire…wandering a bit out into the plain to find dry wood. It was then that he met with disaster! A wandering griffawn( a beast most deadly, with the body of a lion, the head and wings and fore talons of a mighty eagle, strong and with a thick hide)smelling that delectable scent of a soft skinned barbarian, caught Jorlik by surprise out in the open! It buffeted Jorlik with its broad strong wings, stunning him, while it eviscerated him with its beak and claws! Glisan and Smallhands ran towards him, but it was far too late! His body lay bloody and abused, his soul already departed.<br>
Well, that evening of adventure, about to end, suddenly went into overtime. <br>
Jorlik, his soul drawn back from oblivion by its magical anchor, reconstituted in a new flesh in Rivervale, prepared to make the journey through Runnyeye, to get back to east Karana. As he stepped into Runnyeye, his ears assaulted by the howling and gibberish of goblins in the tunnels, his mind teased by the thoughts of the mighty evil eyes telepathically broadcasting their messages of despair throughout the stinking citadel, he steeled his resolve, and started his journey through, toward the gorge of king Xorbb. As he stepped around the last corner, his eyes fell upon some strange little creatures, little moldy creatures the size of his forearm! They eyed him hungrily for the long space of a heartbeat, Jorlik stood frozen, recognizing the predatory nature of the creatures! He suddenly jumped into motion, sprinting his long barbarian legs toward the tunnel that led to the gorge, to life, but the sporelings were many! Spore flew everywhere as they drug the mighty barbarian down, kicking and shouting his wrath. Alas, the mighty Jorlik fell once again! Glisan, and Smallhands, by this time, had made it back through the gorge to the other side of the Runnyeye Citadel. <br>
<br>
Smallhands, ever the doer and not so much the thinker, charged into Runnyeye, running through toward Rivervale, drawing the goblins a gibbering horde behind her. She reached the other side of the citadel, near the tunnel that leads out to Rivervale, and turned to fight. A goblin neophyte, a spellcaster, singed and blasted her as she chopped him into fine goblin chunks! Smallhands wounds grew severe, Glisan was on the other side of the citadel, near the gorge…she tried to make it through, but the sporelings were in between the group, cutting them off! Glisan, assaulted by the sporelings, was forced to run back to the gorge to save herself from the fate Jorlik had fallen to. Smallhands fought on, a goblin runt getting chopped up by her weapons, which had grown hot from the blood of the goblins running over the blades. Finally she stood alone, the corpses of the neophyte and the runt strewn about her! Jorlik made his way back, and stood by her side.<br>
<br>
Smallhands, convinced they could make it back through to the gorge, led another mad dash through Runnyeye, Jorlik running behind her, half stumbling through the dark stink. Again, the sporelings jumped to find a new host for their parasitical feeding frenzy, and again, Jorlik fell beneath their onslaught. Smallhands made it through to the gorge, where Glisan had waited, unable to get past the sporelings.<br>
<br>
It was about this time Smallhands decided to ask for help. She sent out the call, to the Clan of Brothers, and the Circle of Sisters, that one of theirs was in dire straits! Omiumbutu and Nullo, both champions of their respective orders, came to the rescue of our trodden trio, blasting through the sporelings like a deputy through a diseased rat! Nullo used powerful magic to restore the life force of the fallen, our three made it through Runnyeye to fair Rivervale!<br>
<br>
In Rivervale, a warrior named Kilibin showed Smallhands a great kindness by granting her a fine piece of armor, a crafted bracer! Jorlik and Glisan relaxed, talking with each other, and Kilibin, Smallhands giggling the whole while at how funny they all three were and wishing she could be that funny. The Rivervale jester showed up, just as they were getting bored, a little halfling named Lynnon, who made a show of being a beggar and a selfish ass! It was quite entertaining for our trio, and Kilibin, who all thanked Lynnon heartily for his entertainment! Finally, Jorlik stretched out on the grass in front of the Fools Gold Tavern, and fell asleep, and Glisan and Smallhands made their way to the Weary Foot Rest, where they fell into a deep sleep, with dreams of evil eyes, and jum jum cake, and bear steak, and sporelings, and halfling jesters, in the quiet shire of Rivervale.<br>
