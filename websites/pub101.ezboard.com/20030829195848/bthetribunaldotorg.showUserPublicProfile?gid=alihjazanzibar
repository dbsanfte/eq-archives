I was the bastard child of Markus Jaevins the ring leader of a cult called the Gatecallers.  For most of my youth, I was fed summoned black bread and water.  <br><br>  Dad (who always told me not to call him that in public) was a geek who scribbled on paper all day, and Mom was a heretic prophet heathen who ran around in full plate armor; killing children in the murky forest called Toxxulia.  <br><br>I decided that I would take on the priesthood when I got older, which embarrassed my mom and dad.  They called me a fool, and they called me names like "Fishhead" and other stuff which I can't remember since the last electric shock therepy....  One thing I do remember,   I told them, "It's okay, Mom and Dad.  You'll see the truth, on the day that Prexus floods this stinking hole - AND DROWNS YOU ALL LIKE THE SPONGES YOU ARE! BUWAHAHAHA! " --- *ahem* After that, it went black.  So, I don't remember much else.<br><br> Anyway...  <br><br>I told them not to go on that rendevous to Qeynos, because those damn boats are unreliable!  <br><br> Their ship sank somewhere off the coast of Erud's crossing.   Whoever said Prexus didn't have a sense of humor?  <br><br> For the rest of my youth, I was raised by the Kerrans who live on the island out there.  <br><br>  Like I said, I had a normal life, except for the fact that every so often, if I saw a giant rat running around, I'd feel this insatiable urge to chase it down and kick it around like a soccerball with my feet.<br><br> The doctor says I'm getting better, I just need to get outside more.  <br><br>
