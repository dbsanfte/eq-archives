<br>
For sure... you would know a lot about my loyalties. Insults are cheap. What i do see is that if i don't spell everything out loud and clear, it passes right over your head.<br>
<br>
&gt;So you are not denying my point that most if not all europeans buy into the Hollywood Bullshit?<br>
<br>
According to you, who do you think is more cynical when watching an &quot;Independance Day&quot; where the Stars &amp; Stripes flags fly across the view every 5mn ? Do you always need stereotypes or you sometimes think on your own ?<br>
<br>
&gt;Is that supposed to Impress me?<br>
<br>
If you actually cared to read for a change, you may have noticed that the statement this responded to was a blanket &quot;Euros got no clue, they just watch Holywood crap&quot;. To which i am replying : not only some euros do know some yanks, some of the posters here actually work in this specific industry and have a pretty good idea of what's going on behind the scenes.<br>
<br>
&gt;Do you make my culture?<br>
<br>
To the small extent of my professional involvement, i certainly do contribute to it, unless you never set foot in an AMC. I do take partial responsibility for collaborating on a number of really poor productions either sides of the Atlantic. My humble apologies : I had to &quot;boil the kettle&quot; somehow. I promise  you that I have improved my young ignorant ways though.<br>
<br>
&gt;How so sheb? Please explain the curroption of our jounalism in your eyes, Please tell us how it would be better in your eyes.<br>
<br>
Simple : the ENTIRE media (TV - press - radio) on this continent is run by SIX corporations. ALL SIX of them contribute to various degrees to the SAME political color. They not only spoonfeed the population with the lowest common denominator of government stamped junk, their role as a &quot;check &amp; balance&quot; is long forgotten. I would really enjoin you to read some non-english press so you can see the difference for yourself.<br>
<br>
&gt;Or is it better if its from my perspective? Or is Loegans Perspective better,<br>
<br>
It's not a problem of perspective, it's a problem of diversity. Many of my views do happen to coincide with Loegan's or Tuwene's. I tend to have divergent ones on economic matters though.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Who is left with its soldiers out there away from thier fucking families so you could enjoy the weatern culture you so hate.<br>
<br>
I think you ought to be reminded who &quot;inspired&quot; your democratic culture and where your &quot;freedom&quot; constitutional draft was written. If you are going to cry historical foul... so can I. Point is : that one flew right by you. You want respect ? Show what you are capable of. Personally, I don't consider the levelling of the second poorest nation on the planet an act of fantastic courage. Standing up against the most powerful one on the other hand takes a little more balls, doesn't it ? Or would conceding that one scratch some of that bald eagle god honest american pride ?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;I do not need your &quot;Invisable&quot; army Bullshit sheb, I live in America I know how great it is, Europes jelousy and animosity towards what we have become makes me sick, But Thats just my Opnion isnt it?<br>
<br>
Just get your head out of your flag for a minute : jealous ? Of an equal if not better quality of life ? Or could it be that we are all concerned with an ultra nationalistic country taking on the clothes of an imperialist war hungry fascism ? <br>
<br>
&gt;Your not American Sheb, So there for its Immpossible for you to be Un-American, Dont you get that yet?<br>
<br>
I do get that sarcasm is lost on you...<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;You hate Bush not because of who he is, You hate him for what he is, A proud honest man<br>
<br>
Riiiiight... <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Because in the back of your mind you know deep down inside yourself you wish your country was like America, That way you would not have to be working here would you?<br>
<br>
Or maybe i was just curious of meeting some of those supposedly friendly americans and made a mistake in coming here ? Why would I wish any country to be like the USA ? Each part of this planet is rich in its own diversity. Different doesn't have to mean better or worse. Realise this though : if i were motivated by greed or whatever little fame my kind of job affords (mostly none - hence my &quot;invisible&quot; reference), i would be working in New Zealand right now. You probably think i am boasting : I just consider myself very lucky to be enjoying a fairly unique job for which there is tremendous demand and very few skilled hands. I wish everyone had this chance, but i also work my ass off for it, just like anyone who wants to be really good at what they are doing. Anyway - time to go home for today : i have the whole week end to do my taxes and cover for my happy colleague who's just become daddy today. <br>
<br>
Have a good one !<br>

Not rebutting you but restating my response, Diverse Veiws come from Differing perpectives of the people in Charge sheb. From what I see on TV there are plenty of veiws out there, About every Opinion and then some is represented out there.<br>
<br>
<br>

Greece? And who did most European nations take after when they &quot;redid&quot; thier Goverments? You forget quickly that the &quot;new&quot; Europe on the whole is a younger governing body then the U.S. (This does not mean they have a younger culture)<br>

What do we have to do to Prove ourselves in &quot;your&quot; eyes? for years we faced down many threats to Protect you and ourselves, For years we tried to be the best we could even tho we have been the Only super power left.<br>
<br>
Think about it if the U.S. had collapsed and Russia stood strong, Would they have been like the U.S.? <br>
<br>
The fact is Sheb we have nothing to Prove to you anymore, And most Americans are tired of doing so, Why dont you prove something to us? Why dont you prove you can do something for a friend and expect nothing in return.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't consider the levelling of the second poorest nation on the planet an act of fantastic courage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Your right, Of course the U.S. has never stood toe to toe or eye to eye with the Biggest powers on the Planet, And of course every European nation has?<br>
<br>
Was it you who showed down Russia? Was it you who stopped Hitler? Was it you who lost thousands stopping China? <br>
<br>
How many bad asses do we have to face down to prove to you we are just? How many hoops must we jump through sheb? <br>
<br>
You cry foul that we are beating up the little guy, Was afganistan rich sheb? were they powerful? How many Americans did they manage to kill sheb? Do you even understand in todays world Power is not measured by money or guns or weapons. But by Conviction. <br>
<br>
A few men killed thousands, Imagine what a leader of a nation can do, Can you even grasp why we might be scared sheb, Can you even relize for a second why Bush is pushing for this?<br>
<br>
Jesus they were just talking about how a group of Cubans landed in miami and walked around in full gear before surrendering, What if they had a full tank of nerve gas sheb?<br>
<br>
And yes sheb it takes alot of Balls to veto something in the U.N. let me tell ya, Shwew thats courage. Much more so then sending soldiers against somone who definetly has chemical Agents and guns, I mean After all France and Germany might strain thier arms when they raise them to veto.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Of an equal if not better quality of life ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
That in 200+ Years a group of crap became something that was previously Unkown to the world, A super power. Your not jelous of how we live sheb, Do not take me for being so naive. You are jelous of what we are and what we represent.<br>
<br>
For once the center of the earth is not Europe, And many Europeans have a hard bitter time accepting that they are not the &quot;shit&quot; anymore, God you can see this focalized in France.<br>
<br>
I am not saying anyone is &quot;worse&quot; Or better then us, However sheb I am saying no longer is Europe the rebirth of Culture, No longer are they the end all be all. I have a feeling they are pissed that we are now playing a game that used to be exclusive to Europeans, The game of Global power. After all Colonilism showed us how much Europeans Prized that game right?<br>
<br>
Most of all tho I think they are jelous because they did not think of the Big Mac :P.<br>

The fight over Iraq's oil <br>
<br>
Analysis <br>
By Daniel Yergin <br>
Cambridge Energy Research Associates <br>
<br>
The threat of war in Iraq has just one reason, say many critics: Western hunger for oil. Daniel Yergin examines whether the claim stands up. <br>
Oil figures large in the debate over the current crisis with Iraq. How could it not? Yet, when it comes to oil, there are two decidedly different points of view. <br>
<br>
<br>
According to some, the Iraq crisis has been created as a pretext and cover for an &quot;oil grab&quot; by the United States, Britain and the international oil industry. <br>
According to others, Iraq, once liberated from the current regime, will flood the world market with cheap oil, boosting economies and providing a quick fix for concerns about our energy security. <br>
<br>
Although there is a wide gulf between them, both these points of view have one thing in common - basic misapprehension about the scale of Iraq's oil industry and the timing for new production. <br>
<br>
A second tier oil producer <br>
<br>
No question, Iraq is a very big oil country. Its reserves are the second largest in the world - behind only those of Saudi Arabia. <br>
<br>
<br>
But the real picture is different. Iraq represents just 3% of the world's total production capacity. Its oil exports are at about the same level as Nigeria's. <br>
In contrast to the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, which was more about energy security, this current crisis is focused on overall security, and it requires several leaps of logic to conclude that the current Iraq crisis is &quot;all about oil&quot;. <br>
<br>
Physically, Iraq could double its current capacity, but that could well take a decade or more, and would still leave it in the second tier of oil nations. <br>
<br>
No US administration or any British government would launch so momentous a campaign - and take such risks - just to facilitate a handful of oil development contracts and a moderate increase in supply half a decade from now. <br>
<br>
The 'day after' Saddam Hussein <br>
<br>
What would be the future of Iraqi oil without a Saddam Hussein? <br>
<br>
War could damage Iraq's output at the very moment when a new regime would desperately need oil revenues to secure its own stability. <br>
<br>
Saddam could also torch Iraq's oil facilities in a pyrrhic defeat, although the prospect of post-war tribunals in Iraq might deter some Iraqi commanders from obeying any such orders. <br>
<br>
<br>
There should be no assumption that Iraq will welcome foreign investors on a reasonable timetable <br>
<br>
And there is the critical question of authority. Who would be making decisions? <br>
<br>
If there were a temporary military government, it would be preoccupied with establishing firm control over Iraq's weaponry and laying the basis as quickly as possible for a new Iraqi government with broad representation. <br>
<br>
The country earns the bulk of its living - $15bn (£9.5bn) in 2001 - by exporting oil. <br>
<br>
For that reason, any temporary military authority would be keen to see the &quot;new&quot; Iraq maximise its oil earnings and would be loath to get much involved in the decision making about the future of the industry. <br>
<br>
For its part, any new Iraqi government will be intent on getting its arms around its number one economic resource so that it can generate as much revenue for reconstruction and development as quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
Following Kuwait's example? <br>
<br>
Iraq is not Afghanistan. It has the means, through oil, to pay for rebuilding the country. <br>
<br>
<br>
But a new government will also have another priority. It will be determined to bolster its sovereignty, legitimacy and nationalist credentials - all of which will be essential requirements for holding the country together. This ensures that when the time comes to sit down with the oil companies, Iraq will be a tough negotiator. <br>
There should be no assumption that Iraq will welcome foreign investors on a reasonable timetable. History warns that such is not a foregone conclusion. <br>
<br>
After the 1991 Gulf War, Kuwait said it would open its oil industry to foreign investment; 11 years later that has yet to happen - because of nationalistic opposition in Kuwait's parliament. <br>
<br>
The limits of Iraqi oil <br>
<br>
One of the reasons that the &quot;It's all about oil&quot; discussion gets off on the wrong track is that it makes the assumption, often without realising it, that Iraq would turn over its current 2.8 million barrels per day of production capacity to international companies. <br>
<br>
<br>
Companies will be cautious when it comes to spending billions of dollars until they are pretty confident about security and stability <br>
<br>
But that's a misleading assumption. Why would a new Iraqi government want to split revenues? <br>
<br>
It does not need the international companies' investment for fields that are already developed, and can simply purchase technology and equipment for existing fields. <br>
<br>
However, for its undeveloped fields, a post-Saddam government will need capital - lots of it - for exploration and new production. And that is when a new regime is likely to turn to international oil companies. <br>
<br>
Weighing investment risks <br>
<br>
Which ones? It will have no shortage of suitors. <br>
<br>
Companies will be eager to get in line to sign contracts with a country that has 11% of the world's proven reserves. (Saudi Arabia, the highest, has 25%; the North Sea has just 1.7%). <br>
<br>
<br>
But they will be cautious when it comes to spending billions of dollars until they are pretty confident about security and stability. <br>
And, for the companies, &quot;stability&quot; applies both to the new regime itself and also to the contracts they sign with it. <br>
<br>
Companies from several countries - Russia, France, Italy and China, among others - already hold contracts, but because of UN sanctions they are not operational. <br>
<br>
Companies without contracts, including the British and American ones, will have to assess how much time and trouble they are willing to bear. <br>
<br>
For the oil companies, the big issue is how to manage the range of risks - from the geological to the fiscal to the political. In response, they often work together in consortia and partnerships, and that's likely to be the way things work out in Iraq. <br>
<br>
The companies with existing contracts will likely team up with other companies - American, British, European, Canadian, Australian, Japanese - to form new partnerships. <br>
<br>
Three years to restore output <br>
<br>
Any new Iraqi regime has to face the stark reality - the deteriorating condition of the Iraqi oil industry. <br>
<br>
Production capacity has dropped from its peak of 3.5m barrels a day in 1980, before the Iran-Iraq War, to about 2.8m barrels per day and continues to fall. <br>
<br>
Reservoirs have been damaged by years of mismanagement. The infrastructure - whether wells, pipelines, pumping stations or ports - is in poor shape and environmental considerations are widely ignored. <br>
<br>
<br>
Iraq would not have the ability to 'flood' the market [with oil] - nor would it have the desire <br>
<br>
To get back to 3.5m barrels a day could take three years or more, at an estimated cost of at least $7bn. <br>
<br>
The next hurdle is to increase production above that. Another two million barrels per day would require a major push and would still leave Iraq several rungs below the capacity of the big three producers - Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia. <br>
<br>
Making that leap to 5.5m barrels a day would come some time after 2010 - at a cost of upwards of $20bn. <br>
<br>
Some assume that Iraq could turn into an Opec-buster as its output increases. But its likely growth in output would not give Iraq that kind of clout. <br>
<br>
It would not have the ability to &quot;flood&quot; the market. Nor would it have the desire. Its intense need for revenues would make it much more interested in selling oil at $20 or $25 a barrel, rather than at a bargain basement rate such as $10. <br>
<br>
Competing with the Caspian countries <br>
<br>
<br>
World oil demand is growing, driven by countries such as China and India. <br>
<br>
The competition is shaping up: On one side are Russia and the Caspian countries, primarily Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Standing on the other side is the Middle East, including Iraq. <br>
<br>
The race to supply growing world demand has a clear and tangible prize: by 2010 the growth in world oil consumption could mean an additional $100bn or more a year in oil revenues flowing into the treasuries of nation states. <br>
<br>
After &quot;the day after&quot;, Iraq will be better positioned - and highly motivated - to compete for its share. It will be a strong competitor. But it will also be only one of several strong contestants. <br>

You'd find that most countries papers defend their own governments decision and find flaws in others, be it the US, UK, the country I live in or anyone else. Call it biased, apologetic, nationalstic or loyal - as far as I'm conserned they're all facets of what we all like to call the truth. It is always easier for someone part of the very culture to understand the logic behind governments decisions.<br>
<br>
As for getting my US information from Hollywood heh - while it is true I haven't been in the US, I have met very many americans and also worked with quite a few of them, and given my nature discussed with a lot of them be it purely norwegian issues, comparison issues or US issues. So while it's obvious I certainly don't understand the US culture as you guys do, it also goes the other way around. As I've posted before, I don't (or didn't) have a problem with the US culture, at least until recently. It's what I feel lies *behind* the Bush administration and its doings that I can't stand. The support for Bush has been pretty thick in this forum, and you won't see me cheering over something I find fundamentally wrong.<br>

<br>
Thats where we differ Wenin, have you seen them change thier style of dress? They are very much trying to push into the pop scene. Trying to be more &quot;glamourous&quot;, Infact many people have even said she is pulling a &quot;Faith hill&quot;.<br>
<br>
The message is not the same essman, one said &quot;We do not like bush and were ashamed of him&quot;, The other said &quot;we respect the president and just wish to see peace have a chance&quot;<br>
<br>
There is a huge diffrence in those statements.<br>

<br>
I never would have done so (or at least I hope I wouldn't unless it furthered my cause). A singer is not like a Senator or a Represenative. I cringed when Senators made French jokes because they represent our government directly. They need to be professional in their words and their deeds as they have to deal with these governments on a diplomatic level.<br>
<br>
A citizen however can and should say what they mean and mean what they say. Sure there is the risk of their being boycotted, but that is lame anyway. I know this sounds like a flip flop from my previous post but I got to thinking on it and this is what I came up with:<br>
<br>
When you protest the government, you are trying to force change. The people you are protesting have the power to change what it is you are protesting about.<br>
<br>
When you boycott a person you are in effect trying to silence them. Punishing someone for voicing their views is actually attempted censorship, because you know that a boycott will not change their opinion, it will only force them to be silent.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I can also see the point of not wanting to buy a product from somebody whose views you find offensive. It is your right to not buy from people you disagree with.<br>
<br>
So as you can see, I am torn on the issue. It seemed simple at first, but once I thought about it, boycotting people for their views seems more like censorship through economic pressure than simply showing disagreement.<br>
<br>
I guess it doesn't matter anyways, because either way it is a persons right to boycott anyone or anything they choose.<br>
<br>
I still think that her apology (on the part about Bush) is out of pressure and not heartfelt. <p><br>

If every joe American could get on TV and say his piece to Millions then I could definetly see your point.<br>

<br>
Very true, though I wonder why people give any weight to alot of them. It's like being an actor or a singer means you are automatically intelligent and informed. Grant it a few of them are, but there are plenty out there who know less than your average 5th grader too. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think alot of Americans have a difficult time seperating the actor from the person and fiction from reality. I guess that is the side effect of living in a media saturated society.<br>
