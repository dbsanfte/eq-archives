Because I Am </span><hr size=1> Deep Roots<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he drifted in and out of sleep Banor reminisced about his past.  His early childhood had started so serenely.  His father was a well respected blacksmith, and his mother dutiful in her support of him.  But the quaintness of Kelethin never grabbed a hold of him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When traveling to the high elf strong hold he never longed to be back climbing in the limbs of home.  In fact the word home had never sat well on his lips when describing Kelethin.  His father often looked at him, summing him up.  Banor knew that he did not measure up to his fathers expectations of a son.  But there was nothing he could do about that other than try harder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Banor’s reverie continued he realized there was never a single point, an event which summed up his inadequacies.  Simply put, he knew he did not belong and so did his parents.  Yet as the years past no one ventured forward.  Banor stared into the velvet carpet of night.  The moonlight illuminated the semicircle of sameness of homes built into the great limbs of Kelethin.  Its deep roots had held this city up ages and would continue to do so long after Banor was gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In that respect he honored his city, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that this great city would never crumble.  It would grow and grown, ever reaching skyward, and maybe that allusion is what bother Banor the most.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He felt the people had forgotten their roots.  Those deep roots when they had first come here.  It was not the trees that provided them comfort and support, but the land.  The fruits, and berries, the honeysuckle and the dewberries, those are the lifeblood of Kelethin not this great stand of trees.  The indomitable spirit of the rangers that had carved out this life style should be the revered amongst their kind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But in the end it wasn’t for him to decide and as a youth his views were inconsequential.  He knew this too to be a fact, and understood that his father’s oft sorry eyed looks at him were his disappointment coming through.  When the day came it was neither; expected, heralded, nor harbingered as a day of liberation.  It started like any other day and ended like no other.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor arrived late to the furnace.  The fire he was supposed to build before his father arrives already burning hot.  He had promised yesterday never to be late again, and here he stood alone in the workshop.  He waited patiently, roaming the shop looking at various pieces his father was working on.  Each laden with intricate patterns, built into sturdy craftsmanship.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An hour passed and his father had not returned.  Banor turned the damper on high to allow the fire to burn itself out before heading outside.  Down the latticed walk ways, onto the lift and into the wild wonders of the surrounding area Banor bound happily.  He spent hours running around stalking prey, getting close enough to touch a deer.  Avoiding orcs was a matter of pride, and taunting the bixies and running away to loose them in the deep forest was a past time of endless joy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The night was fast approaching and with dread Banor began his long trek back to Kelethin.  It wasn’t long before he heard many people calling his name out into the twilight.  He called back to them not knowing what would prompt such a search.  A man came through the thick brush, his countenance a look of extreme concern.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you Banor, Treha’s son?” he asked quickly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor replied affirmatively and looked quizzically back at the man.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You don’t know me, but I am a friend of the family; J’har Telk.” He said and extended his hand offering an introduction. Banor shook his hand, introducing himself in turn, and ask what his was all about.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp J’har looked at Banor, and Banor could feel that once again he was being summed up.  J’har shook his head negatively, “I don’t know young man, and your mother asked me to retrieve you from the forest.  We must go back now.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor could tell from the tone in his voice there was no brooking with him and began to walk back.  As he traveled Banor began to realize something terrible had happened.  Something had happened and it was bad enough that his mother could not wait for his return.  His mother had sent for him, not his father.  His father had not shown up for work and he had gone out to play.  His father was injured, or dead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The walk back became a run, and Banor ripped into Kelethin like a whirlwind.  When he finally arrived at his parent’s home he saw the collection of people inside before he opened the door.  Tears welled up on his cheeks.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where is dad?” he blurted out when he entered.  His mother’s face red and won, tired from endless hours of crying.  Her eyes were puffy and Banor barely recognized her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His mother took only a moment before responding, “I sent for you because I wanted you to hear this from my lips, your father, and my husband has passed away.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest was a blur; he could hear words, and see people come up to him and felt them pat him on the shoulder.  But he was dead on the inside, and the world continued to move without his notice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was hours before he again regained cognoscente thought.  He found himself deep in the forest.  The sounds of the wild life had soothed his pain enough for him to fall asleep in the nook of a tree.  And so his exodus from Kelethin had come to pass, without much ado, and without a farewell.  It still hurts Banor thought as he looked at Sasha, no matter how much he tried to avoid it.  It sill hurts.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When they woke, both looked at each other with pained faces.  Stretching and preening trying to remove the kinks from their sore muscles.  Sasha stretched while still remaining seated.  Her arms extended above her like a steeple of a temple.  Banor smiled as she moaned out loud, her body shivering as her muscles convulsed.  He offered her water from their flask and she shook her head declining.  Raising it above his head he doused his head and rubbed the water in rinsing his hair as well as possible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha reached over and relieved him of the flagon doing the same.  Banor smiled mischievously watching the water trickle down the back of her nape.  His hand wrapped around her, pulling her close and nibbled on her ear.  She leaned back into him, letting him hold her in his arms.  She smiled knowing that she had been chosen, and gasped in remembrance.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I remember what happened now”, she said as she turned around and faced her lover.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank Tunare!” Banor exclaimed.  “I thought something was wrong” he said and smiled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha pulled him back to her sliding one leg between his, “Nothing will ever be wrong with you at my side lover” she whispered into his ear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha began to pack, telling Banor the details of her dream.  How she had come to be a shadow knight no longer, but one of Tunare’s chosen.  The love in her voice told Banor all he would ever need to know about her.  Tunare had blessed her and him in one swoop.  He finally had a connection, someone who inspired him. The best part of his new life was that she felt the same about him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He listened intently as she related the details of her dream.  How Tunare had first come to her as the tiger.  His jaw dropped as was amazed at how close he had been to his god.  She had stood, played and ultimately guarded over them.  He felt exhilarated to have had that interaction.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They packed up there sleeping supplies and returned the wall.  Sasha had looked at the repeating symbols again briefly and frowned.  She took out the supplies for making a meal and watched as Banor approached the wall staring at each symbol and mumbling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What he believed had happened was when they had entered they had been transported to the far end of the catacombs.  He returned to the two vortex icons he had identified the night before.  He traced his fingers along the stone edges of the tile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha began looking for something to start a fire with, but was suddenly struck by the lack of materials.  There was nothing what so ever to burn, no cob webs, no dried husks, nothing at all.  The realization hit Sasha like a raging werewolf, the catacomb was clean.  Worse than clean even it was spotless, there was no death.  There was nothing lying about, spiders, bugs, and no detritus of any kind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor turned around and exclaimed, “I’ve got it!’  He turned back around and traced along the edges.  “Ok we entered there” he said motioning at the end of the tablets.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha followed along with him, nervously looking about reading in more and more disturbing details.  What little dust there was in the pores of the rocks was gray, fresh like the dust settling on your house hold furniture.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And then we were teleported to here” he said and laid his finger at the farthest point from the entrance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha looked at the edges, “Where are we in this maze?”  She asked, momentarily forgetting her suspicions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Excellent question” Banor moved approximately half way through the maze and touched the tablet he believed their location represented.  A sound from behind the wall clunked, and they both jumped back.  The tabled recessed into the wall and water began to pore out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha looked at Banor, “Oh yeah I was waiting to tell you I think the catacombs might be an elaborate trap.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor frowned and looked at the water as it poured out of the square hole.  He smirked at Sasha.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well it’s not like we’ll die anytime soon” he said think with sarcasm.  As if on cue though several tumblers clunked and other tablets receded letting in more water.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “There is no dust or anything on the floor” Sasha exclaimed as she began to gather up their supplies.  A thin layer of water had already coated the floor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We have got to get to the end of this maze before it’s too late” Banor said tersely grabbing his packs and hefting them on his shoulder.  He smiled at Sasha as she straightened up under the weight of her pack.  He leaned in and kissed her on the lips.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You ready?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh I am good to go” he quipped back and Sasha blushed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As they began to run down the hall their feet splattered in the water.  More than an inch of water lay on the ground already.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clunk, cha-clunk could be heard as they ran faster and faster.  Soon they were sloshing along with the water up to their shins.  The smack smacking of their feet landing once on the horizon of the water and again on the floor reminded Banor of watching Sasha and Tunare so long ago it seemed.  He smiled as he ran along, looking from time to time as the symbols on the wall whisked by.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clunk, cha-clunk, by the time they were getting close to the exit the water had risen to their waists.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor waded in front of Sasha, taking the lead as they returned to the entrance.  The floor began to ascend as they got closer to the entrance.  He could feel the heat of the afternoon sun but could not yet see its light.  The water steadily got shallower until finally it was back down to their ankles.  They raced along, slogging it out breathlessly anticipating the sunlight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor pointed as he drew closer, “Jump over this one coming up.”  They leapt over it with ease.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clunk, cha-clunk, water began to poor out of the walls as symbols receded.  Then suddenly the entrance began to close.  Two great stones began pushing inextricably together from opposite sides of the walls.  Sasha and Banor called out simultaneously, rushing faster.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha could see beyond Banor.  She could see there was not enough time.  As they reached the entrance she slammed into Banor pushing him through the entrance sending him flying forward.  He barely passed the threshold as the massive stones slid together sealing her in the catacomb.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Banor screamed in abject terror.  Sasha could hear him through the wall, she called out to him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clunk, cha-clunk, water began falling from the ceiling and the walls.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sasha watched as the water spewed from the ceiling from small holes.  The roar of it all had quickly drowned out her and Banor’s fevered speech.  She slouched and leaned against the wall, the water already up to her knees.   Looking in vain at the walls for some clue on how to make the water retract Sasha began to cry.<br>
