<br>
Nexxon decides to strip the account and sell the items in EC  (which included Sleepers Tomb and Tormax drops).  The rogue finds out about this and demands the items back.  When I confronted Nexxon he denied that he ever had the items:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> [Tue Jan 29 20:06:43 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'I don't have the items.'<br>

[Tue Jan 29 20:07:00 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'I will never have the items.'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
about 50 seconds later he contradicts himself <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> [Tue Jan 29 20:07:48 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'He let me BORROW some items while he took a break, he got on my account and took them back.'</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Then he says he only took things that he could use:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> [Tue Jan 29 20:11:46 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'I'm not going to borrow things I can't use.'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And contradicts himself again<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> [Tue Jan 29 20:18:47 2002] Nexxon tells you, 'I had the horn and resist gear'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
(The weapon was a Horn of Hsgara that drops off Tormax - Nexxon is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MONK</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Horn of Hsgara is a 1 hand piercing 13/20 which is warrior / ranger / shadowknight / rogue only)<br>
<br>
I asked one of Nexxon's guildmates what Nexxon was doing with the Horn of Hsgara:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> [Tue Jan 29 21:49:57 2002] Wrog tells you, 'he said he wanted to trade it for 200k worth of monk gear'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So the moral of the story is - dont trust Nexxon further than you can kick him....  he still has a bunch of gear that he has stolen from the guild and from his friend and is refusing to give it back or has sold it off.<br>

&quot;Guess what friend, telymon came back for a week and during that time he logged on my char, took the horn, gave it to nexxon, told comps that nexxon stole his stuff and sold it and quit again.&quot;<br>

Telymon has always been a little bastard. He's come back to Legendary (And the game) more than a vietnamese hooker, which is where our inside joke &quot;Don't telymon.&quot; comes from. :&gt; <br>

I'm gonna call him and have him post on here to get this all straight.  I'm dissapointed that you have nothing better to do than to blame me for your ex-guildie screwing you.  Don't put this on me just becuase he left the game and wanted his real life friend to be well off.  Get over it, I'm so sick of the tells telling me to delete or start over becuase my rep will be destroyed.  Goes to show how well you people treat others.  Thank you for those who actually believe me in that I stole NOTHING from ANYONE!<br>

How about you ask him tommorrow to post here under his own sig that he simply gave all the gear to you and that you are the innocent and aggrieved party.<br>
<br>
If that is in fact the case then I owe you an apology.  I would point out that you are suspected of stealing the gear because your story is so inconsistent.  If you had simply said that he gave it to you to sell in the first place much of this would be avoided.<br>

<br>
Nexxon, I just want to add, that even if he does check out your story, you are still a miserable piece of dog shit. Sure you won’t go on the list, that is reserved just for people who steal, scam, train, and do other things of the worst kind.<br>
<br>
But, you are a fucking classless liar, out for your own self rather than concerned over doing what is right. Yeah it was Telymon’s gear, but quit crying about everyone bitching at you. That is what happens when you sell off gear that should have gone back to the guild that he got it from.<br>
<br>
If you wanted a good rep, you would have returned the gear. But now, you will just be another joke of the server, another shitstain that everyone laughs about &amp; makes fun of the guild that you become a part of. Enjoy your plat though. <p><BR>

<br>
I remember him selling all the high end stuff... I wondered where he got it... he told me a good friend quit and gave it to him.  That answered that.<br>
<br>
Obviously I have no way of knowing whether this is true or not, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, because he is a friend... I wish Telymon would show up to verify one side or the other, but until then, I will say this:<br>
<br>
If the gear was given freely as Nexxon seems to indicate, there would be NO obligation to give it back to anyone.  If Telymon had wanted any of his items to go back to his guild, no doubt he would have taken care of that himself before he quit, or at least told Nexxon, &quot;Don't sell this&quot;.  If Nexxon is telling the truth that his RL friend wanted him have his gear when said friend left the game... there is absolutely nothing to flame Nexxon over.  In my personal experience, Nexxon has never been the greedy sort who would screw someone over like this.<br>
<br>
I don't expect everyone to grant Nexxon the same level of trust that I do, of course, but this whole issue is a &quot;he said, she said&quot; until one person - Telymon - speaks up.<br>
<br>
PS - seems odd to me that this is surfacing now, since the whole sordid affair took place quite a while ago... you'd think the Comps would have noticed something like this being sold off or something?<br>

And your last post was a sure fire way to destroy it. At least if you are gonna give him a chance to explain his case, wait till Tely posts before you crap all over the guy. I mean if he's guilty he's guilty but you aren't even giving him a fighting chance. <br>
<br>
Your last post was as good as putting him in the &quot;peices of monkey shit&quot; thread. And while I'm sure that your intention is just that, don't be a hypocrit and ask him to calm down, tell him he can restore his rep, and then proceed to publicly rip him a new one. <br>

If Tely does come &amp; explains that he gave the stuff to his friend rather than it being stolen, then he will not go on the list because he will not be a thief. But in my book, he will still be a shit stain. I have a feeling Tely doesn’t want to come because he knows it was a shitty thing to do to his former guild.<br>

I am sorry that some of you jackasses think this assmunch was somehow in the clear or justified in selling off that gear since Tely left him his character after he left. I still do not think that makes it right.<br>
<br>
If I had left my account with a friend when I quit &amp; he had gone to EC &amp; sold all my Donals &amp; BD gear &amp; the other trinkets that I received for being a part of EV, then you bet your ass my guild would have shit on me AND my friend.<br>
<br>
The guy knew it was wrong. Why else did he lie about even having it. I hate little shits like this who do things that they know is wrong just to help themselves out. And you bet your ass I am going to call him on it.  <p><BR>

With all respect Caledhon,  I do not agree with you.<br>
<br>
Look at it this way.  If your family owns a nice car and lets you drive it thats nice of your family.  But if you decide to leave the country and give the car to your best friend who the family has never heard of, then you can damn well expect the family to come knocking on your door.<br>
<br>
Telymon never owned the items he had on him - they were guild loot.  *If* he gave them away he was ripping off his own guild.  <br>
<br>
We are talking about over extremely high end gear here - some of which will never drop in game again now that the Sleeper has been released.<br>
<br>
By holding onto the gear when he knows it has been stolen from the guild, Nexxon is dealing in stolen property.  The only question is whether Nexxon stole it on his own or was simply so dim as not to realise that it didnt belong to Telymon either.<br>
<br>
In either event, Nexxon now knows that the property was stolen and is still refusing to give it back.  Thats where the real offence lies.<br>
<br>
Nexxon feel free to contact any Companions officer in game to return the items. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucaledhontelrana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/5/02 4:42:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Add Nexxon(Qrit) to the ***list for stealing from his fr</span><hr size=1> I understand your point, Sashanna, and it is a good one.<br>
<br>
My post was attempting to defend a longtime friend.  Obviously I'm biased, but you seem to know that.  I'd like to thank you for being mature about everything as you have been.<br>
<br>
All I'm trying to say is, let's wait and see what Telymon has to say... because it's almost 100% certain that what he has to say will shed a whole lot of light on this and decide it one way or the other.  What I'm trying to avoid is exactly the sort of post Ladida has made... of course, this is the flameboard, and my efforts are probably in vain, but I feel obliged to stand up for my friend in the limited way that I feel I can.<br>
<br>
If Nexxon was given the gear as he claims, hopefully you two can come to some sort of agreement on what was guild material and deserves reimbursement.  If he wasn't, then the title of this thread and Ladida's flaming will be well deserved, and I'll look like an idiot.  &lt;shrug&gt;  In the end though, I'd rather have everyone wait on passing final judgement until we find out what happened.<br>
<br>
Not that the flamers care, but at least they have multiple targets now!  I hear that makes it so much more fun =)<br>

You don't deserve the items back becuase you couldn't come to me in a civil way.  You think you are so high and mighty that you can't come talk to me you have to interrogate me.  Thats a bunch of bullshit.

So you know what Sashanna.  You can go fuck yourself.  This will stick with me for the rest of my career, whether you say I did it or not.  One last thing, stop calling everyone so dim.  You're the idiot who just comes out blasting me without trying to talk to me like a civil person.  That just goes to show how dim you and your whole guild is.<br>

p.s. Not all the comps are bad people, just Sashanna and a few other assholes.  By the way if you haven't forgotten this is just a game.  I could care less if I quit, do your worst ruin me if it makes you feel better.  My life will go on becuase my whole life doesn't revolve around this game.  Not like you are causing me pain.

<br>
Telymon quits EQ for the 428795th time, and gives his stuff to Nexxon.  Now this is no surprise, because every time he quits he gives droppable stuff (thanks guilds of the tribunal) to nexxon and me.  At the time I was off playing DAOC, so this time it all went to Nexxon.  I come back for a bit, and Nexxon lets me use the horn until he can sell it.<br>
<br>
I use it til I get 60, then I play a few days longer, then after falling asleep on a raid I lose 60, and decide 'well that sucked, oh well, no time to be bothered with getting it back.'<br>
<br>
one day, telymon decides 'Hey, I haven't quit EQ yet this month, how about I start playing again.  oh I'll need that horn of hsagra back so the comps don't know that I gave it all away mmkay thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
<br>
sounded like a shitty deal to me, but I figured I'd at least let him get me back to 60 while he was on my character talking to all of his lovely EQ friends.   next morning, I wake up and guess what's missing !     if you didn't guess, you're an idiot, stop reading now.    big fucking deal, let him have it, I don't play EQ anymore anyway.<br>
<br>
he also decides to get on nexxon during this time, and take back the other stuff that he GAVE him.    well, telymon has his fun for a week, then decides that the end of the month is coming near, oh shit, it's time to quit EQ again.  he then GIVES all of his stuff back to nexxon, tells him to sell it, and enjoy himself.<br>
<br>
then a day or two later, nexxon starts getting tells from some random bitch in the comps explaining how he stole all this stuff from telymon and that if he ever wanted to be friends with all you cool people again, that he would have to return it at once.  ouch.  what's he to do?  unfortunately for him, he realises that enjoying himself sounds a hell of a lot more fun than appeasing a bunch of whiny bitches who accused him of stealing that which he was given.<br>
<br>
sorry comps, it's really a travesty that you let Telymon fuck you over as he's done to so many other guilds before you,  but nexxon is not the cause of your mistake, just a convenient scapegoat for Telymon so you all will still be his friends.  maybe on his 428796th return to EQ, you can bitch at him about it then.  until then, thanks for letting me use the horn for so long, it was really quite a nice upgrade! <br>
<br>
much love,<br>

<br>
You wouldn't. But that's not really the issue. Basically this is about ethics. Plain and simple: The gear just doesn't belong to you man. If Telymon gave you the stuff willingly, he was wrong, if you keep it, you are wrong. If people were coming at you and harassing you to give the stuff back, they were wrong. But the facts are the facts. The items never really belonged to Tely, and they don't belong to you. If you wanna do the right thing.. you'll give it back to the rightful owner. Perhaps even get a reward for returning the &quot;stolen property.&quot;<br>
After all, they should be fortunate that you still have everything and that they can even get the items back. A lot worse could have happened to that stuff, and I think they should keep that in mind when they make some of the comments they do.<br>
