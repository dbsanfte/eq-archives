Firstly, since Sueini's not posted something I asked her to post yet, I'll post it here myself.  I think she simply hasn't seen it yet, so nothing directed at her here.<br>

-------------------<br>
Hail RNG,<br>
<br>
It's come to my attention that someone attempted to hack your RoP site and it's being attributed to me. Pentagarn has gone so far as to publicly say it's me. Well, I'm tired of defending my intentions THREE MONTHS after I'm no longer in the guild. I know that some of you would prefer to think otherwise but I still have many friends in the guild, even though most won't own up to it for fear of being labeled brainwashed sheep. But whatever the naysayers might think, I still have many friends in the guild and have no desire to see them hurt in any way.<br>
<br>
So, bottom line, wasn't me. Find a different boogy man to fear in the dark of night.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and Pent? Get over me ok? Time to stop blaming me for global warming, poverty, your hangnails, and anything else that goes wrong for you or RNG. Time to move on. Mmmmkay?<br>

Now, as to more recent comments.  <br>
<br>
Lilwee.  Fuck you you fucking piece of shit.  I never did a fucking thing to you and you hate me for no reason i can determine.  Die.<br>
<br>
Agin, fuck you too.  I don't know why you have an 18-wheeler parked up your ass sideways about me and always have, but... hey! Fuck you!  And btw, stop sending women pictures of yourself naked with your cock in your hand.  There's easier ways to promote birth control.<br>
<br>
Oh and Pentagarn.  Fuck you for more reasons than I have time to post.<br>
<br>
<br>
RNG, I haven't been around for about 3 months, find another fucking scapegoat.  BTW, if I was the only one causing all the trouble then how come all your problems didn't disappear when I left? Hmmm.... maybe cuz I wasn't the problem? I was just the only one not afraid of getting stomped on by the guild leadership and said shit about it?  <br>
<br>
Go figure!  People bring stuff up on your boards in an effort to discuss problems and get stomped on for voicing anything negative!<br>

<br>
No one is accusing you of hacking our website, Toury.  Yes, when Broshan posted about it, your name was mentioned as a *possibility* as a former member.  Any former member, especially one forcibly removed, would be brought up, as a natural reaction.  It's simply human nature.  It never was ever seriously suggested however, that it was you. There were other possibilities brought up too.<br>
<br>
I don't wish to flame you Toury.  I happened to like you.  Yes, you were outspoken, and weren't afraid to say what was on your mind.  However, coming here and flaming us like this hurts me.  I'm damned proud of RNG and our accomplishments, and I respect all the officers, from Broshan on down, and I abide by their decisions.  You couldn't.  It's the core of why you're no longer with us.  And I'm sorry, I am truly sorry it ended the way it did for you.  It was the last thing I wanted to see.<br>

Despite Broshan's and Boinshar's orders to the contrary I am banned.<br>
<br>
As far as flaming all of RNG, I don't believe I did that.  I responded to three individuals who consistantly blame me for everything bad that happens in RNG long after I'm so very gone.  <br>
<br>
And if you think that the hacking thread is the only one where I'm mentioned then you should read your boards a little more closely.<br>
<br>
I put almost 2 and a half years of effort into RNG and it's success.  I held the guild very dear to me and placed it above myself far too many times.  That's my mistake and my problem.  I've been removed for reasons I strongly disagree with by officers whom I not only do not respect but strongly dislike.  I figured I'd be left alone now, yet my name gets dragged up again.<br>
<br>

I think RNG seems to have a major problem at picking straw out of a hat and beating on good people. But don't worry about people hating you for no reason what so ever and having them try to destroy your life. I met a lot of people like that in this game. Which just means there are jealous of you and really want to be like you. They are most likely some fat retard who gets off to this type of stuff. Seriously RNG what the fuck are you doing over there? Try using some common sense and don't piss off the good people. I cant figure out why the hell you booted Tourmalaine in the first place. She is a amazing person. All I can figure was someone again made a mistake on your side and decided to take it out on someone else just for kicks. That's my 2 cents. Who ever came up with her name in the first place should be banned from everywhere just for causing problems. <p><p align="center"><br><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><a href ="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=86924" style="text-decoration: none">-Magelo Profile-</a><br><img src=http://www.magesticfate.com/images/Zynar58.gif>

Before you rip me a new one as well Toury let me state for the record that I like you, have always liked you but due to the nature of your reactions ALWAYS I agreed with the decision. As far as posts about you, they have been gone a very long time so if anyone is feeding you post from our PRIVATE board they are changing the dates and very well may be changing or creating the text as well. If I where you I would wonder why this person claiming to be your friend would try to keep you upset about something long passed. Being your friend I would want to protect your feelings not hurt them over and over agian by A.) giving you flase information and B.) by bringing up a post that did mention you for reasons you know of. Just my 2 coppers worth and incase you fame me too Toury know it is wasted effort because I will not revisit this site. <br>

Ps. RNG is a good guild and am a very proud member. *big hugs to all<br>

As for the reasons for my removal and flaming you, well.... this isn't a flame on you, but I would be honestly shocked and stunned if you knew the true reasons and convoluted bullshit that lead to me getting removed.  RNG politics run very deep and pretty ugly, most people are blissfully ignorant of them, as I wish I now was.  I want nothing to do with them.  I've been gone for a while now and yet some people just can't get over me and move on.   <p><BR><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25946"><BR>Tourmalaine d`Winter`Rex</a><BR>60th Phantasmist of Mithaniel Marr<center><br><b>Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war!</b><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umandoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/22/02 8:26:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was gonna leave this to die, but...</span><hr size=1> Is that why rhoas went to legends ? =/ <p><br><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22676" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://4.60.57.44/mandosig4.jpg" border="0"></a></center>

I think RNG seems to have a major problem at picking straw out of a hat and beating on good people.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Thats fucking halarious.  But I cant see RNG doing that.<br>
They are just kind of stuffy sometimes.<br>
<br>
A few guilds are like that.<br>
<br>
They take things a little too serious and end up with<br>
the collective mentality of a group of six year olds yelling <br>
&quot;you cant pway wif us, your not in our secret club!&quot;<br>
<br>
Pretty much isolating good people like Toury and such and missing out on some good times.  Its a fucking shame actually.<br>
<br>
I have yet to find a guild where everyone just has a fucking sense of humor and doesnt have  a fucking dynamic conglomerate of its most un-intelligant, ass smell fingered , retards in its upper ranks ruining it for those of us that are simply playing Eq for a good laugh, and a good time.<br>
<br>
This fucking game doesnt require any fucking skill once you do anything once.  Its a glorified fucking chat room, lighten' up.  I know quite a few of you are those socioligically shunned old D&amp;D playing idiots who take shit way to seriously because of the nature of the game.<br>
<br>
Those type just never learn.<br>

<br>
On another note, you &quot;this game takes no skill&quot; people crack me up.  Just because you can grind out xp in high level newbie zones doesn't mean it doesn't take skill to do challenging content.  If it's so easy, where is your epic?  Why aren't you level 60?<br>

I had a wonderfull time in POW and during my trial memberships with KoT and RNG.  All of which go back quite a few months.<br>

Not one dispute with anyone in game, over anything, at all cept an incident or two long ago.<br>
<br>
I dont care to figure it out.  But posts like my previous one do tend to draw out those exact people I talk about.<br>

Its like tipping over an old bucket laying in the lawn.<br>
Buncha blind worms all clumped together wriggling around for cover in a bunch of smelly sludge.<br>

Just one of the masses.  You never had a trial membership in kot btw, I know you like to imagine things that never happened and post em as facts but we don't do trial memberships.  You were allowed to come on a few raids with us, and you grouped with a few members.  The way we induct people to the guild is we have a public poll that means nothing, just to give the officers a sense of the general opinion.  Then the officers hold the real vote amongst themselves.  I promised not to post the results of the public poll, but they were fucking hilarious, trust me.  I don't KNOW the results of the officer poll, but I am virtually certain it was a unanimous no.<br>
<br>
You didn't get into KoT because you are an ass in game.  It had nothing to do with your inane posts here.  Your prior guild leaders had nothing at all good to say about you.  Despite that, we gave you the benefit of the doubt and afforded you the opportunity to play with our members in raid and single group settings in order to let them get to know you.  Unfortunately for you, they got to know you.<br>
<br>
Posts like your previous one are a flame against the officers and leader of my guild, did you expect me to let it slide?  Keep telling yourself that the world is out to get you if it makes you feel good about yourself, but you're asking for a reaming if you post that kind of bullshit.<br>
