My first and last post on the flameboard.<br>
<br>
Enjoy it.<br>
<br>
The hatred between SI and EV extends far beyond what the 2 guilds are today. It used to be AoK and The Elitists. Saben was the one who started things rolling between us but it's not really important why anymore. Those events happened a little over 3 1/2 years ago.<br>
<br>
And here we are today and how things have changed. EV is longer the the german Nazi of the Tribunal and I am no longer Hitler. SI has gone from the 6 man ebay farm to... Well not everything changes.<br>
<br>
SI is now the pissed off teen getting revenge on his dad who beat him too much as a child. Thats right EV is the dad. Fact is EV was your daddy for about 3 years as we owned your asses everywhere you turned. But now you've grown up and gotten strong and all that pent up frustration has been building up for so long that you take every chance you get to lash back at your aggressor. Maybe the beaten child has become stronger than good ole pops. But I doubt it.<br>
<br>
You see pops just had some bad times and now that those times are over he's all ready to whoop some ass again. but he's tired of whooping the same ass he did for 3 years. So he has chosen to focus on other things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that I had my fun what this boils down to is this game has gotten to be more work than play and we don't need the added frustration of arguing with other guilds over crap. We haven't challenged SI on anything in quite some time it just seems to be you guys who wanna start shit.<br>
<br>
What comes around goes around seems to be the common phrase you are choosing to use as your rallying cry. I think you should more closely remember past incidents though.<br>
<br>
NToV. As I remember it we CoH'd PAST you and beat you to the target. If you had been at the target we would not have interfered and at the most we'd have hung around at zone waiting for you to fail and give up.<br>
<br>
Zlandicar. We raced to the spawn. You guys got there and ready first you fought and lost, we fought and lost, you fought and lost, we fought and won.<br>
<br>
AoW. Don't ask me how but he just showed up at our camp. Whether he was trained there but someone or what I was the first person he saw from our raid and we killed him. We were waiting for you guys to have your chance at him thought and we did not pull him to us no matter what you might think.<br>
<br>
I myself was not present when Mojak kicked Nosey's ass in a duel to force you guys out of the NToV so I dunno what happened that day.<br>
<br>
I'm sure theres more cases but there was never an instance where you guys where we saw you were at a spawn and decided lets go down there and take it from them even though they are already there. Not worth our time in most cases by the time we would get there the mob would be dead.<br>
<br>
Whats funny about the Coirnav incident is some of your old guild members never thought you guys would try to contest that spawn but I knew differently and I told them that and I was right. I don't put anything past you guys only for the simple reason that you have such an intense hatred for EV. Does that mean EV is the reason SI is successful now? I'd like to think that and a few years ago I'd probably gloat that it was the case but it's not. SI is successful because EV went through very rough times. No need for me to go into detail but had we not had the problems we did we'd be well into Time by now. Is that an excuse? Call it what you want to it's the truth. EV has never been this far behind in the overall server kills. Even if SI does make it to Time before us it's not that big of an accomplishment. Hell PVP servers are in Time.<br>
<br>
But SI people will no doubt continue to gloat about how they are ahead of us. The &quot;When EV was the best&quot; quotes will fly around and SI will march through the streets like a gay pride parade while people look on bewildered.<br>
<br>
You guys can keep tossing insults at me all you like. That doesn't bother me. I've done far more in the way of insulting SI and their members than you will ever be able to do to me so bring it on. Fat, Ugly, Stupid, whatever. oooo insults.<br>
<br>
Most of the hatred you guys have for us is because of me. Do you know how much that feeds my ego? The fact that I can sit here and laugh my fat ass off while you guys sit here and carry torches for things that you probably don't even know what really happened some 3 years ago. You people are a joke. Whatever happened in the past happened. Get over it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You know whats funny about SI and the people that carry these flags for the old time members? They don't know what those same members did to their own guild for a long time. Everyone laughs because I still harp on Rynnia's ebaying. I do it because I think it's funny that someone who was a leader in their guild was farming items to sell rather than equip their own guild. And don't get on my case about serone because he wasn't a leader in my guild. When Kunark Came out rynnia and her 6 man farm machine got tons of items for themselves and what did they do with the extra loot? They didn't distribute it to their guild thats for sure. Whats sad is alot of their members didn't know this was happening and today it still happens. Rynnia in PoP would play her 6 box self group or whatever she had and farm the tactics basement for ornate armor to sell in the bazaar. Or farm Cazic Thule sewers for loot to sell in bazaar. I'll bet she never went in guildchat and just offered those items to whoever needed them. You guys carry a torch for someone who really doesn't give a shit about you.<br>
<br>
Now you come to me. Crush is an asshole. Bet thats what most of your guild thinks. Thats what most people in competing guilds have thought of me since I started. Yeah I am an asshole but my guild comes before anything else. The people in my guild and making them better has always been my priority and I am respected for that and I show respect back to those people.<br>
<br>
Loyalty before all else. Some of you would do well to listen to that. Just make sure your Loyalty is not misplaced.<br>
<br>
I will not be replying to this again.<br>
<br>
<br>
    Love me or Hate me<br>
