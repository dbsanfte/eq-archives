<br>
Big fucking deal 1 piece of loot went to a Transcended rogue, get over it  Legendary, because you were the only ones bitching about it except for some newbies who didn't even know the item was no drop and that they couldn't use it anyways.Btw, did your petition ever get answered or was that just a bunch of bullshit talk too?  Go practice some flurry drakes or something.<br>

And I only saw 2 Comps Wizards there Chatja...unless they were anon. AS IF IT MATTERS!  I don't care if it was 10 Comps MB wizzies there...her looting the dagger was just plain wrong.

In the end it's just one piece of loot...but so was the Cobalt BP that got scammed by Hogge...or the 10th ring loot that got ganked by Brianne(Uliuuliuliuuliuuu).

The emotes etc that were given across the server was to let people know the encounter was there, and the encounter will be there for awhile to come. So there was no GM involved other than sending the emote, this encounter has been on stormhammer for a bit now apparently, and this was just it going to live servers now.<br>
<br>
<br>
In regars to last night, I didnt just organize my group, I am sorry if you think that. The channel /fallen with the 70ish people there and all guilds and n00bs alike spamming it as well as ooc/shout was impossible to work in. So I made a different channel, had all the companions(some recrtuis/friends), sol invictus, trans, and some RNG in it. With a total of 33 or 34 people in the channel. In that channel, we organized and set things up without the clusterfuck of disorganization that the /fallen channel had. I told people in the channel, who were part of the &quot;Force&quot; I was leading, that if anything dropped droppable I would loot it and we could decide later, if anything no-drop dropped I would call off stats in the channel and anyone who needed would send me a tell. Nico and Nollo got clerics organized, chatja tanking and telling melee what to do, and I was giving out general strat as well as what to expect from what we knew of the encounter. <br>
<br>
I then joined /fallen and gave out the info I knew on mob 1, that a second mob would spawn, and the general jist of what was going to happen. The channel still a clusterfuck I dropped it. Chatja used shout to give brief strat for melee, nico got clerics set up in ooc.. then we went on our go.<br>
<br>
We knew with so many people from so many guilds organization and loot was going to be a mess, it always is, and we were not suprised tonight. We knew the second dragon would be pretty tough as well, so we told people to bust ass on the first, and we would zone/cr and reset up if time for the second. (second is about tormax difficulty with a slight ae easily resistable, which although is a super hard encounter, it is for a mixed group of people)<br>
<br>
So we moved accross and got ready for the pull/rush (got kinda fubard by some others running out ahead from other guilds). Engaged and at 90% I called discs/burns. We watched him go from 90 to about 10 in a matter of seconds. He fell over,  my group got the &quot;you have gained experience&quot; message (relavent later on) and so I dropped a knee. I was somewhat under the dragon at this time. The loot being a rogue only belt. Several people chain inspected me as they tried to loot the mob.<br>
<br>
Now (I play in 3rd person) I see this kerafym looking mother fucker flurrying like he was having an epileptic seizure on everyone around him, and chatja trying to snag aggro and clerics running some heals. It was sloppy and getting out of control fast. (Tormax popping on you mid zlandi fight is kinda interesting if you can picture that =0 )) I called the stats in the channel, and asked if anyone in the channel could use. Slyie was who responded, so I asked him to loot. Told him to wait 30 seconds.. then I told him to come right where I was and to start chain clicking to ensure when I let up he had a good chance of getting ont he corpse with others who were all spamming the corpse. I said GO and backed off the corpse, slyie did in fact get it and get the belt. <br>
<br>
We then tried for a bit to fight the second dragon but wiped out, serpento cyrielle and ringa then CR'd EVERYONE even though they only had to get the people in the channel they made sure everyone was recovered after BOTH attempts(will get to that too). Nicolee/Nollo sticking people up and then froc/kabuall start going off in shout and ooc.<br>
<br>
Froc's claim to fame comes from his brilliant commentary. Slyie is getting yelled at and petitioned for ninja looting the belt and people asking for the belt to be destroyed. So I pipped up and said my group got the kill, and I decided the loot. This was what happened, and said in order to let them bitch at me instead as I had no problem with people being upset at me, its a god damned game for fucks sake. Things did not stop there as Froc proceeded to exclaim with his guildie's that it was *IMPOSSIBLE* for us to have gotten xp. As they figured they would stack the deck with their 2 rogues, 2 wizards, and get the xp it wouldnt be possible for anyone else to get it. They planned to get xp and deal with the loot themselves, kinda like what I did =0 ) The shouts about how it was impossible for us to get XP was quite quite amusing. It also just reaffirms the idea that you guys did THE SAME THING and were just upset that you got one upped. hahah ok, sorry, still laughing at the possibility 4 wizards &gt; 2 != true (dont get technical no one got a crit 8P)<br>
<br>
So my group, which to dispell the rumours of non guildies etc helping me get the kill since you wanted to go that route, contained Monk, Cleric, and 4 wizards. The 4 wizards were Shehbahn, Entriude, Psihala, and Myself. Did I set up a group to control the loot? Sure did, just as you did =) Did I plan to distribute the loot fairly? Sure did, but among those 30ish people who were either with us, or asked to join us (for the SI/Trans/Rng came to me because of the clusterfuck going on and asked if I was/would organize, so since they asked I let them join in). I mean fuck me, a companion awarded a belt to trancended, hold the phones !<br>
<br>
I did what you planned to do, I just did it better. You want to be upset, be upset, but your beef is with me. Slyie looted what I told him to loot, in a scenario where I could be considered the ranking person. He followed my orders, and had EVERY right to loot that belt. <br>
<br>
In regards to VI's rules, everyone engaged at once, whoever gets XP gets the loot. Slyie was apart of the &quot;force&quot; that got xp, and Slyie was the one who got the loot. I even shot a tell to the GM-Admin after you guys said you petitioned 50 times in ooc/shout, he said I was in the right and could of even just destroyed it for all intents and purposes as it was my groups choice on the fate of the belt. This is also when I found out it wasnt an actual event, later reaffirmed on boards all over.<br>
<br>
Like I said, you wanna be upset, be upset, but be upset at me as it was my call. <br>

You know those fuckers have a huge aggro range, stop being a cunt for once in your life you prick<br>
<br>
I've done this event before, its not hard its not rocket science, the difference when we did it?? we didn't have some tard wizzy feel he had the right to dictate who got what, we left it all to the GM to sort it out, even though my group got the xp and he dropped the wing and the belt<br>
<br>
And would you believe it he waited until everyone was ressed and we sorted out the loot, we fought off repops of the nibblers and then we engaged the second dragon<br>
<br>
As I said n00b mistake to make and to then deem yourself lootwhore, erh master, sorry I got to stop doing that, and ignoring everyone else at the event proves you are a muppet<br>

<br>
Sorry we didnt have a GM at the event, the GM admin I talked to was in karnors actually =0 ) That kinda service isnt on normal servers yet =/<br>
<br>
And we did pull him to the corner, or tried to anyways, which we did do on the second attempt on the kerafym look a like as well(just went smoother). Where he died, was not right where the second dragon spawned, but it was close. Mobs dont get positioned perfectly all the time with a well oiled raiding group (YAYAYAY FIREPOTS, tell me any different and you along with everyone else will know your lying), so 30-35 organized and 30-35 unorganized mix from level 40-60 and to bitch about positioning? hahah ok.<br>
<br>
Hell we positioned the kerafym look-a-like perfect for the first 40% of his life or so till someone overaggrod across the water and he then started warping all over. <br>

We organized and attempted the dragon. Hell you guys didnt HAVE to follow us =)<br>
<br>
In regards to the pull, the front corner, where the angle is 90 or so degrees into the tunnel is where we tried to pull him to, but that didnt work well on the first dragon. But that spot is well out of aggro range, once aggro was established and the positioning was getting fubard, I called for people to burn. As I said in my first post, which was at 90 or so percent, so no, it wasnt off the cuff burning as you imply =0)<br>
<br>
Stormhammer comment came fromt he fact thats the only way you could of fought him prior to them going on live servers. Although my last comment probably wasnt necessary. Not trying to get into a flamefest, as there is no point.
