I have a theory as to why there is so much dog crap in the streets over there.  It started in 1940 when the nazi's came rolling over the Marginal Line.  Every French soldier dumped their bowels out before running away and then held a meating to state that officially &quot;Its all the dogs we have.&quot;<br>

Americans are stupid.  We send more aid to other countries in terms of cash, people, military, food, medicine, and help than ANY other country out there.  We are morons for that.  We aid governments.  We make loans that we know are not going to be repaid.  We help train foreign troops in some situations.  We are a major contributor in crime fighting efforts.  We spend obscene amounts of resources to keep India and Pakistan from nuking each other.  Why do we do all this?  Largely so we can let the UN crap all over us for our efforts.<br>
<br>
The US is the big kid on the block.  Every move we make is clearly rampant imperialism.  Anything we do is purely window dressing because we have so much more we could give.  We have no concept of sacrifice because all that we do is but a pittance of what we could do.  We should simply pay more, and stay out of all situations.<br>
<br>
Kuwait should belong to Iraq.  India and Pakistan should nuke each other.  The Serbs and Bosnians should slaughter each other.  All the Jews in Israel should be slaughtered by the Arabs there.<br>
<br>
The following is a monologue by Dennis Miller.  I find it appropriate.<br>
<br>
&quot;A brief overview of the situation is always valuable, so as a service to all Americans who still don't get it, I now offer you the story of the Middle East in just a few paragraphs, which is all you really need.  Don't thank me. I'm a giver. Here we go: <br>
<br>
The Palestinians want their own country. There's just one thing about that: There are no Palestinians. It's a made up word. Israel was called Palestine for two thousand years. Like &quot;Wiccan,&quot; &quot;Palestinian&quot; sounds ancient but is really a modern invention. Before the Israelis won the land in war, Gaza was owned by Egypt, and there were no &quot;Palestinians&quot; <br>
then, and the West Bank was owned by Jordan, and there were no &quot;Palestinians&quot; then. As soon as the Jews took over and started growing oranges as big as basketballs, what do you know, say hello to the &quot;Palestinians,&quot; weeping for their deep bond with their lost &quot;land&quot; and &quot;nation.&quot; So for the sake of honesty, let's not use the word &quot;Palestinian&quot; any more to describe these delightful folks, who dance for joy at our deaths until someone points out they're being taped. Instead, <br>
let's call them what they are: &quot;Other Arabs From The Same General Area Who Are In Deep Denial About Never Being Able To Accomplish Anything In Life And Would Rather Wrap Themselves In The Seductive Melodrama Of Eternal Struggle And Death.&quot; I know that's a bit unwieldy to expect to <br>
see on CNN. How about this, then: &quot;Adjacent Jew-Haters.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Okay, so the Adjacent Jew-Haters want their own country. Oops, just one more thing. No, they don't. They could've had their own country any time in the last thirty years, especially two years ago at Camp David. But if you have your own country, you have to have traffic lights and garbage trucks and Chambers of Commerce, and, worse, you actually have <br>
to figure out some way to make a living. That's no fun. No, they want what all the other Jew-Haters in the region want: Israel. They also want a big pile of dead Jews, of course-that's where the real fun is-but mostly they want Israel. Why? For one thing, trying to destroy Israel-or &quot;The Zionist Entity&quot; as their textbooks call it-for the last fifty years has allowed the rulers of Arab countries to divert the attention of <br>
their own people away from the fact that they're the blue-ribbon most illiterate, poorest, and tribally backward on God's Earth, and if you've ever been around God's Earth, you know that's really saying something. It makes me roll my eyes every time one of our pundits waxes poetic about the great history and culture of the Muslim Mideast. Unless I'm missing something, the Arabs haven't given anything to the world since Algebra, and, by the way, thanks a hell of a lot for that one. <br>

Makino, while the original thread wasn't particurly indicative of heightened mental acuity, you are every bit as guilty of promoting the same mindless bigotry.  However, the original post was half in jest.  You appear to be serious and don't have the intellectual honesty to see the irony.  In summation, you are a worthless bastard.

Chew this around and spit it out: Five hundred million Arabs; five million Jews. Think of all the Arab countries as a football field, and Israel as a pack of matches sitting in the middle of it. And now these same folks swear that if Israel gives them half of that pack of matches, everyone will be pals. Really? Wow, what neat news. Hey, but what about the string of wars to obliterate the tiny country and the constant din of rabid blood oaths to drive every Jew into the sea? Oh, that? We were just kidding. <br>
<br>
My friend Kevin Rooney made a gorgeous point the other day: Just reverse the numbers. Imagine five hundred million Jews and five million Arabs. I was stunned at the simple brilliance of <br>
it. Can anyone picture the Jews strapping belts of razorblades and dynamite to themselves? Of course not. Or marshaling every fiber and force at their disposal for generations to drive a tiny Arab state into the sea? Nonsense. Or dancing for joy at the murder of innocents? Impossible.

Sure, we've lost lives.  We may even have been asking for it.  And no, asking for it doesnt justify it.  In this case the end does not justify the means.  We got blown up so the Taliban could wave and go &quot;look at me!  look at me!&quot;  then run and hide in caves.  Wooooooo, go Taliban; we really fear you now. We blow you up now. <br>
<br>
Some countries have been going through events just as bad, if not worse, for hundreds of years.  So while you're sitting around feeling bad for the friend, cousin, uncle, neighbor, boy from school who lost a mom, uncle, sister, ex girlfriend, gay lover in the bombing, dont forget the rest of the world has, and is suffering too.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think we should pull our noses out of all the other little places babbling over whatever they choose to babble over, and let them blow each other sky high if they want to.  It would sure help the overpopulation problem, we wouldnt get blamed and bombed for it, and hey, its one more lawn for us to mow over and build a mini-mall on.  Call it capitalizm if you want.  I call it minding our own buisness.<br>

<br>
But its right when you bomb them for their political stance?  The only difference is that you are using laser guided precision munitions that you deploy from fighter jets while they use passenger jetliners full of civilians and ram them into buildings.<br>
<br>
But then again, Al-Qaeda doesnt have the luxury of F-15's and what not.  So they have make do with what limited resources they have. <br>
