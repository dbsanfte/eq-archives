<br>
Oh, and Cald, honestly - most western 'tradition' comes straight (as in do-not-pass-go, do-not-collect-$200) right from ancient Rome.  Our system of law, our government, even our political structure are direct descendants of an empire which was a whole lot bigger and a whole lot more successful than anything around today.<br>
<br>
Corruption eventually brought it down, and I'm calling the same shenanigans on Bush and company, using scare tactics and the possibility of some evidence of something they're not quite sure of to further their interests.<br>
<br>
Christian influence brought about only one thing in the western world's history, and that was the Dark Ages.  The church made damn sure to keep the common people down, because they were a whole lot easier to control.  The &quot;rebirth&quot; of science, art, and education is what led us back to western society of today, which America is only the latest, greatest example of.<br>
<br>
So before you go looking to the Good Book to thank for America's amazing success and world dominance, check out the civilization who killed Jesus and compare what they did, and what led to their downfall, to what has transpired in the last 200 years or so.  You may be surprised. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A> at: 2/24/03 7:59:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 668<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/24/03 10:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> Wolvar, try to at least be coherent if you're going to post something.<br>

<br>
That's a lot of bloodshed for peace-loving Buddhists.<br>
<br>
Tuwene, we can argue about the influence of religion on the development of western culture later =)  I will only point out that Christian influence, and the Catholic Church in particular, was absolutely essential to not only the Renaissance, but the development of basically every Western thinker there is.  It's a complex deal, but at any rate the road (or Roman Via?) there isn't what I'm interested in... where we are now is.<br>
<br>
I've said it before, but I'll say it again... we've switched topics here.  I'm not talking about &quot;morality&quot; any more, I'm talking about ideas and the very broad concept of civic culture.  I'm not saying that Christian values are superior to Buudhist values because of relative prosperity.  The ideas I'm talking about are not peculariarly Christian at all, except in that they were refined and implemented by Christians and Deists in their final forms - that of the Western democracy.  I do believe that, despite this, they are exportable to any culture, including that of Iraq, which was brought us to this whole debate in the first place.<br>
<br>
The superiority thing comes into play here - I am willing to state broadly that Western style democracies are superior to all other forms of government.  This obviously covers a lot of ground, and leaves a lot of room for shifting around here and there; there are many implementations of Western style democracy.  Sometimes the system fails, too.  When this occurs, however, it is most often due to a lack of trust in the system and a loss of legitimacy for whatever reason.  The root cause, then?  Insufficient civic culture, insufficient public faith in the root ideals of democracy.  So the problem is, how do you reinforce these ideals?  How can a culture be changed to value Western ideas and foster democracy?<br>
<br>
This is not a radical viewpoint.  There are hundreds of academic papers on the topic, and I've even read a few of them.  Any political scientist who isn't an outright Communist will easily tell you that democracy is the theoretically best system of government for any nation.  I say theoretically because not every democratizing nation is going to have the benefit of the United States as its direct patron like Iraq (hopefully) will, and therefore sometimes democracy is simply not feasible immediately.  The problem lies in getting it to work properly, and the reason it sometimes might not work is that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>people don't believe in it, or its underlying ideas</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
So I agree with you, Shehbahn, that Iraq is going to be a mess of a place when Saddam is gone.  Where I disagree with you is in your assumption that it will never get fixed.  It is not only in Iraq's best interest to adopt a democracy, it is in ours.  Think of it as a reverse domino effect - Saudi Arabia and Iran do, for sure.  If we can demonstrate that democracy in an Arabic Islamic Middle Eastern state can work, and that we are willing to give our support to such states as they transition, then I think people will begin to support us more and more.  People like being free, after all.  Ask any Iraqi.  The trick is going to be in getting it set up in the first place.  With Turkey as a model, and with her support behind us, and given enough effort on our part, I think democracy in Iraq can happen... and once it does, that alone will strike a bigger blow against Islamic fundamentalist terrorism than any hundred or thousand of bombs or raids.  We're going to have an enormous groundswell of support from the Iraqi people once we free them, and if we don't squander it with 5 years of military government, but instead immediately do our utmost to forge an Iraqi-lead democratic government and then support it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>for as long as it takes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, it can be done.  For the good of Iraq, the U.S., and the entire world.<br>

<br>
Reading comprehension : stop putting words in my mouth. Where did you read it would *never* get fixed ?<br>
<br>
&gt;People like being free, after all.<br>
<br>
People need to figure out what &quot;free&quot; means, meaning they need to accept to separate church from state, which their religion and culture in its current form will never permit. That is the stumbling block you seem to have problems with. To build a democracy you first need a sense of nationalism. That doesn't exist. There is no such thing as &quot;Iraqi&quot;, all you have is a collection of tribes (some of them nomads that sedentarised in the last 50 years only). And they are all at each others throat.<br>
<br>
&gt;The trick is going to be in getting it set up in the first place.<br>
<br>
This is no &quot;trick&quot; - you can't force a national identity where there is no ethnic common ground ! The soviets tried it - look at what happened in Jugoslavia. The minute the red army left, the place imploded and is now divided again along ethnic boundaries.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;With Turkey as a model,<br>
<br>
Yeah - Turkey is a model... riiiight. They follow in lockstep right behind NK in human rights abuse. Great role model. The Iraqi are gonna love them when they find out they took a couple of oil fields in the bargain too. Or did you miss that part of the deal ?<br>
<br>
&gt;that alone will strike a bigger blow against Islamic fundamentalist terrorism <br>
<br>
Excuse me while i guffaw. You think that all the terrorist wanna-be's are going to be sitting by and watching you trying to build your puppet toy democracy ?  Just look at Israel : not two days without bodies coming in plastic bags. Yeah... the Israeli feel really free with their democracy right now within their 30 feet walls and tanks patrolling the streets.<br>
<br>
&gt;We're going to have an enormous groundswell of support from the Iraqi people once we free them<br>

<br>
They seem to accept it right now.  Saddam's claims to be the Defender of the Faithful are as obviously laughable to Muslims as they are to us.  Besides, read what I said about Turkey - they claim that democracy need not necessarily mean 100% separation of church and state.  I think this is problematic, but if it means that democratization, however imperfect, is possible, I am all for it.  Call it an intermediary step, but it's a huge step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Go look up the term &quot;consociational democracy&quot;.  That's just one of the many ideas for dealing with the exact problem you describe.  It's not as hopeless as that.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is no &quot;trick&quot; - you can't force a national identity where there is no ethnic common ground ! The soviets tried it - look at what happened in Jugoslavia. The minute the red army left, the place imploded and is now divided again along ethnic boundaries.&quot;<br>
<br>
On the contrary.<br>
<br>
Yugoslavia was pulled together by Tito, and his personal leadership kept it together.  Interestingly, many of his programs to re-educate Yugoslavs into thinking of themselves as Yugoslavs rather than Bosnians, Serbs, Croats, etc. worked somewhat.  A large part of the reason why they did not had to do with the corrupt Communist government which was in place and the tendency for the best and brightest to flee the country to try and build a better life elsewhere.  The fact remains, however, that significant numbers *were* beginning to identify with the new state.<br>
<br>
Things went wrong when, after Tito's death, the Serbs began a campaign to dominate the nation, led by Milosevic.  Without his enormous ambition and heavyhanded repression, and given significant reforms, it is very possible that Yugoslavia could have remained a perfectly viable nation.  If only Tito had died 10 years later.  If only the Communist Party leaders had actually tried to work together rather than Milosevic trumpeting a new Serb domination and forcing a new fracturing of identity... the problems began not in the 1990s, but in the 1980s.  Who can say how it would have gone had a nation like the U.S. been there to guide them?  If there had actually been free elections after Tito's death, rather than the old corrupt Communist Party bosses sharing power in an inadequate rotational system and vying for resources that were shared and distributed (somewhat) fairly by Tito?<br>
<br>
National leaders can make an enormous difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah - Turkey is a model... riiiight. They follow in lockstep right behind NK in human rights abuse.&quot;<br>
<br>
What are you referring to?  The WWI Ottoman-era Armenian massacre?  That's old news, Shehbahn.  You might as well accuse Bush of human rights abuses because of the Trail of Tears.<br>
<br>
Note that I never claimed Turkey was perfect, of course.  Their freedom of the press is suspect, and they are not a &quot;model democracy&quot; by any means, but they are an Islamic nation which is also a democracy, and one which manages to survive just fine without being bombed by radical fundamentalists over its status as such.<br>
<br>
No, I didn't catch the oil field thing.  Are they asking for an actual territorial cession, or just the rights to them?  At any rate, I think it's a very minor point in the larger view of things.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think that all the terrorist wanna-be's are going to be sitting by and watching you trying to build your puppet toy democracy?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not all of them, no.  But I'm not talking short term.  The bin Laden types will be blowing things, but don't they do that anyway?  I didn't say it was going to be easy, but if we let ourselves be intimidated by the threat of terrorism, haven't the terrorists just won anyway?<br>
<br>
&quot;Just look at Israel : not two days without bodies coming in plastic bags. Yeah... the Israeli feel really free with their democracy right now within their 30 feet walls and tanks patrolling the streets.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jews are still flocking into Israel.  It's still prosperous, and free.  The tanks are patrolling the streets in the West Bank, not Jerusalem.  So, your point?  Besides, Iraqis are not Jews.  There is nowhere near the same hatred.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh - and there will be manna raining from the sky too!&quot;<br>
<br>
You disagree?  Show me an article, a news piece, anything where Iraqis not under duress from Saddam state that they don't want regime change.  Just saying &quot;Their culture says we hate the U.S.&quot; isn't good enough.  We're going into a nation that has been starved, tortured, mistreated, and misruled on a grand scale.  And you think that as soon as we arrive they will all rise up and cry, &quot;The Great Satan is here!!  We must fight!!&quot;?  I guess that's why Iraqi soldiers surrendered en masse in the first Gulf War, and why Iraqis were begging us to finish the job, just as they are now...<br>

Besides, I thought you were one of the ones who thought that radical fundamentalist Islam was a fringe movement anyway, and that 99% of Muslims were peace-loving moderates?  /shrug  Not putting words into your mouth... trying to figure out a considerable contradiction if that is the case... <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

<br>
In my opinion, morality is based on culture, religion, and circumstance. There are no moral absolutes.  If you look at the natural law of life among animals the strong prey on the weak, the strong steal eggs from their prey, animals kill and fight each other over mates, animals eat their young to survive, animals rape other animals against their will.<br>
<br>
In the natural order, there is no morality, there is only the natural process of life, the realities of predator and prey, and the struggle of survival.<br>
<br>
When you bring man into the equation...man created civilization, or rather a code of ethics that man should live by in order to further our survival as a species. Throughout time, we pass down these morals to our children based on our culture. In some cultures it used to be ok to burn witches. In Aztec culture, human sacrifice was ok too. In the Amazon, cannibalism of your enemy tribe was morally a-ok up until recently as well. <br>
<br>
There are no moral rules than what society and our culture dictates. Morality is constantly evolving with humanity. <p><p><center>

<br>
First, what is a culture?<br>
<br>
Am I a culture?  Are two people a culture? Would you say that your family is a culture?  Your school?  Your town?  Your state?  Your region (Midwest for example)?  Your nation?<br>
<br>
Can you belong to more than one culture at once?<br>
<br>
Can I just decide to be part of this culture one day and that culture the next as long as it suites my needs?<br>
<br>
If morality is dependant upon culture and you recognize this is entirely subjective then how do you justify questioning or passing judgment on another culture's morals? After-all it is all relative so their ways are no better or worse than yours.<br>
<br>
This philosophy seems to contradict itself since it relies on universal tolerance yet simultaneously argues against any universal norms. <br>
<br>
It also rules out any basis for judging horrendous crimes that are sanctioned by the standards of the culture or era (such as the Holocaust).<br>
<br>
It eliminates a place for cultural reformers since they would be opposing the accepted moral standard without basis.  Martin Luther King, for instance, would be the immoral one for opposing racial inequality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1676<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/25/03 11:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=73>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> You can question another culture's morales all you like.

If the action is severe enough, such as the holocaust, then yes, I think that judging another culture should be done.  Tolerance for another's moral values has it's limits.  I think 6 million jews is a bit over that limit.<br>

I didn't say it would be immoral.  I said you have no basis to do such a thing, because if all morality is relative you have no basis to judge another culture's morals.  I covered that already.  By saying &quot;morality is relative to culture&quot; you must accept that your moral values are no better or worse than another's BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVE.  You have no grounds for telling others that they should or should not behave a particular way.<br>

<br>
I covered this in my post.

How could another culture's values be wrong if they are all relative, Wolvar?  That's the fundamental basis behind moral relativism: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>there is no wrong way</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Whatever works for you is the right way.<br>
