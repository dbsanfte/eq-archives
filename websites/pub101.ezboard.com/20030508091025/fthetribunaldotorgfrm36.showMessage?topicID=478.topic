The guest was some analyist with a military background and presented information that France had rebuilt Iraq's oil refineries and facilities at a cost of some 8 Billion USD, most of which was still owed to France.  Therefore, if the US &quot;liberated&quot; Iraq, France would be left holding an empty bag.  While 8 Billion USD is only a speed bump to some nations, it could or would bankrupt the French companies which did the rebuild.  I tried to find support for this on the web, with only vague and mixed results.  However, I did find that France, as well as Russia and China have a huge financial investment in Iraq, which will only continue as long as Saddam is in power, and the US backed war is blocked or delayed as long as possible.<br>
<br>
I did find this reference and a number along the same lines:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.gulfstatesnews.com/gulf_data/iraq.html">www.gulfstatesnews.com/gu.../iraq.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
.....The volume of Iraqi oil exports has increased in 1999, with exports in October 1999 running close to 2.4 million b/d. Around 40% of Iraqi oil sold during the six-month phase of the U.N. oil-for-food deal, which ended on November 24, was sold initially to Russian firms. Other large purchasers included French and Chinese companies. Oil was then resold to a variety of oil companies, including U.S.-based...<br>
<br>
I believe the Iraq Air Force is made up of Mirage Fighters (French), and Leapord helicopters (French), for which the French have a spare parts and replacement contract.<br>
<br>
...so if  &gt;&gt;IF&lt;&lt;  France, China, and Russia are vetoing the new resolutions in the UN purely for financial reasons, does this not invalidate the UN Security Counsel pretty much?  Does it not make the UN Security Counsel just an enforcer for the financial betterment of its member nations?  Might it therefore be in the best interests of the US to withdraw from the UN; withdraw ALL its financial and military support? <br>
<br>
And just for Loegan - Is the US mostly looking to get its share of the Iraqi oil &quot;pie&quot;, while France, China, Russia, and Germany want to keep it all to themselves?<br>
<br>
We will know shortly, one way or the other.  The US led collation IS going to war.  Complete disarmament has always been secondary to a reguiem change, and I dont see Saddam packing an overnighter and heading for Hawaaii.  Once the change has been made, we'll find out who gets the oil.  I'm hoping its the Iraqi people, but am pretty sure it is not going to be France, Germany, Russia, and China.<br>

But I do not think it is the driving force of the French resistance to our action. Sure, I think it motivates some people, but not the majority, nor the people who are in charge.<br>
<br>
I think their motivations are mainly out of pacifism, hatred for dominate structures (such as big business or America), and envy and suspicion of our power and success.<br>
<br>
Saying they are all about oil is about as intelligent as the dumbass with the purple hair who holds a sign of Bush with a Hitler mustache who still thinks WE are still in it for the Oil. Apparently nobody gave him the memo about why yelling, &quot;No Blood for Oil&quot; was getting so many ironic looks.<br>
<br>
One thing that we do agree on. The French fucking suck. We have known it for so long, but it seems like all of a sudden we have been proven right.<br>
<br>
I don't care about how Americans have spilled blood for them. That isn't how the world works. The world forgets. We forget. I feel no loyalty to Tennessee for sending over people to help my state against the Mexicans. Just because it is old news. I do however like to tell the French that they would be speaking German if it wasn't for us JUST because I know it pisses them the fuck off.<br>
<br>
They are women. They are cowards. They a critics. They are not doers. They ask us for help and then rag on us. They feel the need to tell us their opinion on everything even though they hold no significance in the world. They are the world's worst backseat drivers. They are the world's worst mother-in-law. They smell bad and dress like shit and thus consider themselves more enlightened. They fuck other people's wives and laugh at our sexual repression. At the same time they tell call our males oversexed cowboys. I think that one comes from when we fucked all their women in WWII. I think they may have been surprised that women don't like cowards.<br>
<br>
I hear shit about people boycotting French products and stuff. I don't think it will work. Mainly because I don't know of any French products. At least with Japanesse boycotts you knew what to fucking boycott.<br>
<br>
I hate seeing them on the fucking TV. Because they do not listen. They just keep saying cowboy, aggressive, warlovers, whatever and don't listen to any of the fucking points. I don't know why people have them on their goddamn shows. You ask them a question and they just start ragging on Bush that has nothing to do with the fucking question.<br>
<br>
ANd that is another thing. Bush had the fucking say on going with the war before this whole goddamn UN thing. He could have just fucking gone and kicked Saddam around when he first got congressional approval. But then someone who sounded reasonable said, &quot;lets try and get the UN to put a little pressure on Saddam and possibly get this done diplomatically.&quot; ANd it sounded good. I thought it was a good idea myself. This was before the fucking French pissed all over it. So Bush fucking decided to try and get Saddam to get rid of his WMD diplomatically and then the UN decided to turn it into a fucking Easter Egg hunt and rag on Bush for being aggressive. The fucking irony is, that there would have been no fucking critisism of Bush being an agressive cowboy if he had actually been an agressive cowboy and said, &quot;fuck the UN&quot; from the beginning.<br>
<br>
So not only are we going to be going at it with just Britian, Australia, Spain and Canada like we would have originally, but now we have allowed the UN to become a fucking worthless piece of shit just because the goddamn French want everyone to think they have a big penis.<br>
<br>
Fuck the french. They suck ass. Fuck them. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/DLadida.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

<br>
2. The UK are more glabal minded than Bush (hell, the Beverly Hillbillies were more global minded than Bush) and wanted UN backing.<br>
<br>
3. The UN gives the war legitamcy which would help quell terrorism after the war.<br>
<br>
<br>
The problem is. dumbass Bush went in like cowboy from the very beginning saying he would go to war no matter what the vote was. He is about as diplomatic as jailhouse rapist and just pissed off the UN from the very beginning.<br>
<br>
You guys can sing the praises of Bush all you want, but 90% of our problems are directly related to his big mouth and cowboy mentality. This UN vote seriously could have been a walk in the park if not for dipshits like Rumsfeld and Bush who only antagonize amd provoke people with their shock jock rhetoric. <p><br>

Our SecofState. Powell is a good man. And it was completely reasonable. I imagine he is pissed as well now of course.<br>
<br>
I keep forgetting how you blame Bush for what others do. Like him calling Korea Evil made them break a major treaty and threaten us with nuclear weapons. Or Bush demanding that Iraq turn over his weapons made France turn into fucking pussies.<br>
<br>
What exactly did he do wrong Loegan? I remember when he went in there and presented his case against Iraq, they FULLY supported him. Not a single nay in the building. Are you actually telling us that him getting pissed about how it turned into a fucking easter egg hunt by country leaders who won on their anti-american stances actually turned it into an easter egg hunt?<br>
<br>
Are you saying we would not have had Blair's support if we hadn't have gone to the UN? But for some reason now we do even though we are going to go outside of the UN?<br>
<br>
I can sing all my praises for Bush all I want. Because he is right. He is blunt and honest and that is why he comes of as undiplomatic to you, but you don't like blunt and honest people. You like people who lie to you. Like Clinton. You have actually convinced yourself that a fucking liar with no moral backbone would be better than a person who tells it how it is. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/DLadida.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

Although the money is probably a factor, you're right, the French are just being French.  Its been decades since France has even had a chance to influence any global situation, and as usually, it will probably blow back in their face.  Germany, China, and Russia are still there grabbing all they can while it lasts though.  <br>
<br>
Why is it Loegan, that Bush is responsible for every thing bad that happens in the world?  You are such a far left liberal, that you probably blame him for drought, famine, AIDS, and the melting of the ice sheet.  The shuttle disaster was probably his fault also.  You hate Bush so much I bet you aint been laid in two years.  You hate Bush so much, everytime you get your pepperoni near your wife's &quot;bush&quot;, it turns into a maccroni.  I'm betting you took your Troy-built and mowed down every bush in you neighborhood.<br>
<br>
Unless you're French, get a grip man.  At worse, Bush is just another politition who's views differ greatly from yours, and at best he is a caring and dedicated president trying to bring a little freedom to people brutally abused by a despot like Saddam.  Actually somewhere in between really.  We have allowed the diplomats to handle this situaion for 12 years with things only getting worse.  Maybe we DO need one of the old story book cowboys.  I think this man Bush is the real thing.  We're going to know in a few months.<br>

Maybe because someone fucking hated us and decided destroy two of our buildings? (Must have been Bush's fault). Then all of a sudden everyone was like oh fuck. Poor America. And they quit making American jokes for about a week. Jesus christ man, even our most cynical self-hating americans were patriotic for about a week. BUT BUSH IS AT FAULT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T STAY THAT WAY? HAHAHHAHAHAH! Do people actually give you credibility for what you spew out around here?<br>
<br>
It isn't like the German fucknut got elected simply on how much everyone hates us. How did Bush do that by the way? Did he talk about Hitler around them. That is fun to do by the way. Nothing makes Germans more uncomfortable than if you try and get a good conversation going with them about how they gassed the Jews.<br>
<br>
Hey Loegan, maybe I should give Bush the credit for anti-american sentiment going away for awhile to unprecedented global support! WAY TO GO BUSH! Never have people loved Americans so much! Don't know how you did it, but it sure was a wonderful week! I will never forget the basket of fruit I got from Peru.<br>
<br>
And I know you are going to continue avoid telling us what Bush did to piss everyone off, but first avoid telling us what should Bush have done? Should he have been less angry about the UN turning what should have been diplomatic pressure on Iraq into a bunch of blue hats running around trying to find what we know they already have? It is a fucking circus. Think about what your hero the liar would have done. Would he have screwed around on his wife or given France a charming wink and stick his thumb halfway up? Only Super Clinton can save us from this horrible predicament!<br>
<br>
BUSH IS THE REASON FRANCE HATES US! EXTRA EXTRA!<br>
<br>
Hahahahhahahahahah! <br>
<br>
Do you even believe yourself? Or are you like the other's who are no longer laughing at Bush, but a little worried about his influence, determination and strength? You guys thought you had a guy who couldn't tie his own shoes. Bushism were the rage. Then he started getting shit passed. Then he tore the fuck out of Dems in the elections. And he has done it all while being Honest and Blunt. He hasn't tried to avoid the issues like your hero would, but has rather hit them head on. Instead of making fun of him with laughter like you once did, there is now terror in your voice. Now you people yell out in panic and blame him for everything you can without explaining it. <br>
<br>
Democrats are actually counting on anti-american feelings to boost their political capital! Hahahahaha! That is so fucking pathetic.<br>
<br>
And all you can do is tell us that he just sucks because France hates us. He just sucks man. A liberal reporter doesn't like him! He sucks! Hahahahahahahha! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/DLadida.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

So I finish my taxes, get out of their parking lot and take a side street to a busy street, and as soon as I get on the busy street I see a little mini-mall that has recruitment offices for every major military branch.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I remembered about &quot;America's Army&quot;, its a squad based simulation FPS that was designed and developed by the US Army as a recruitment tool.  The game actually got some excellent reviews and I've been meaning to pick it up in the past few months.  So I swerve into the lot, walk in and I'm like &quot;Where's my game?&quot;.  The recruitment NCO there says he'll give me the game if I listen to what he has to say.  So I'm thinking, this wont take more than 10 minutes, I'll listen to him - as soon as he stops for a breath of air, I'll say no, get my game and walk out.<br>
<br>
I spent like an hour there, listening to him,  80% of the time we didnt even talk about recruitment, we just talked about military hardware.  I never knew there was a combat vehicle called &quot;Avenger&quot;.  Eventually he started getting boring, so I ask if I can go now.  He says not yet and keeps talking and keeps shoving forms and a pen to me.  So I sign some shit, finally he gives me my game and I walk out after spending about an hour there.<br>
<br>
Then I get home, open the game up and the requirements are too high for my PC, all that shit for nothing.<br>
<br>
Anyways, if I stop posting in like 2 weeks, that means that I signed something that I shouldn't have and I'm at Fort Benning learning how to bayonet people or being court martialed or maybe even in the Gulf, working in the cafeteria. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadaetidalstorm>Jadae Tidalstorm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~jadae/pain.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 351<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 12:40:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Merton ya fruit =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuwene>Tuwene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beware the paladin<br>with a map & a plan</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 6:35:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and at best he is a caring and dedicated president trying to bring a little freedom to people brutally abused by a despot like Saddam. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Or maybe he's just trying to repay all those campaign contributors.  Or if this was about morality and/or terrorism, why are they ALREADY AWARDING CONTRACTS to oil companies to take over the oil fields there?  Sure seems mighty premature if this thing may have a diplomatic ending.  Big IF...<br>
