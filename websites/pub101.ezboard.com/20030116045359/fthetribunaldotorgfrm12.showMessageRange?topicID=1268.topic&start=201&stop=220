Your posts are so fucking ass backwards its amazing you are even employed, but I can imagine a day of work for you:<br>
<br>
Jaeron: Thank you for calling Pizza Village how can I help you?<br>
Customer: Yes I want a large pizza with everything<br>
Jaeron: You want a large pizza with everything but with nothing on it?<br>
Customer: Huh? no I want stuff on it<br>
Jaeron: I am not saying you dont want stuff on it, but I am asking if ya dont want stuff on it, and if so what everything did you not want on it?<br>
Customer: Are you for real? I want a large pizza with everything.<br>
Jaeron: Sir you arent listening, Dont make me come there and kick yer ass, I said you wanted a small pizza with nothing on it, and I know thats what you said, and stop acting like a dick to me!<br>
Customer: Ohhhhhhh kaaayyy I am gonna call Domino's<br>
Jaeron: Fine but I am right, I know what I said and what you said, you just dont understand dickwad.<br>
<br>
Jaeron I am glad you read the original prints of EQ, which did say how Necromancers should be the only class that solos because of their dark nature, but everything changed with Kunark and introduction of the Fungi Tunic. The Fungi Tunic has made almost every hybrid/melee class soloable.<br>
<br>
Merton I did play a monk when Kunark came out, in fact I made an iksar monk and didnt have shit gear, but once I got the fungi tunic it made all the difference in the world. I sold almost everything I had at the time to buy one, the irony is now they are even more expensive then when I bought mine ( 30K ). I understand the frustrations of monk, and I do agree I wanted a god like class, thus I became a monk, my god, I watched as we barely had no monks and the monk class always appealed to me, but they had gotten the shaft in terms of gear and items for a long time, and it wasnt till I started to see that monks could be workable that I became one. Destroyed my iksar monk cause I find iksars ugly as shit and went with human, once again, stuck a haste item, fungi and quick weapon on the monk, its soloable till 50. <br>
<br>
I have seen this done and its possible to do this pretty easy with other classes like ranger, sk/pal, warrior, rogue when ya toss the fungi on them and haste. Its the fungi that made monks so easy to solo along with other classes. <br>
<br>
Its not that we are uber powerful, but we did start carving our own niche and displayed great melee power and the ability to drag mobs back to groups, and no we couldnt tank as well as a pure tank, the hp difference does come in play. <br>
<br>
As for the slow weapon coming from ssra or vex thal, I just didnt want people to bitch monks got an easy to get slow weapon, if ya want a slow weapon to drop from tovn, more power to ya, just saying toss one in the game.<br>
<br>
As for the difference in silentfist and thunderkick, I was saying improve one or the other. At the current silentfist hits for around 30dmg if that, and was just saying, maybe crank it up to 80 or 100. I do think Thunderkick should also have a stun component, but shouldnt effect mobs 55 and less where silentfist should effect 58 and below. That way there is a difference in the reason for using them.<br>
<br>
If they remove ac they should also crank up dodge for monks. We are supposed to be lightly armored damage dealers, and the idea of a monk is one who can avoid hits but when a hit does land it hurts like a bitch. <br>
<br>
As for rangers bitching, check yer cool hybrid aa skills compared to monks, with yer bonuses you can quickly outstrip a monk in hps if that is the route you take.<br>
<br>
And as for damage we do, check the damage tables we barely are on a better damage table then warriors who are supposed to not do that great amount of damage. Go to that list and check if monks are on their own damage table, I dont believe they are.<br>
<br>
Monks do need some tuning if this effects go in, and sadly this balancing shit was supposed to be done already and they are still balancing before planes of power comes out and it ruins the game even more. <br>

Also, &quot;cranking up&quot; the Monk's avoidance ability is exactly what has happened on test.  Monks are reporting an ~5% increase in avoidance across the board.

<br>
I would just like to point out that monks are perfectly soloable to 60 without fungi and without iksar regen (but you do need kunark weapons I think, armour matters less). Plenty of fungiless human monks have gone from say 52 to 60 in SolB. Monks can bandage to 70% already at level 51 (and it used to be unique to monks, other pure melee get it too but at a later level), and mend will take you right up to 95%. So while it's perfectly true that the fungi made monks very soloable monks bandage skill + mend always made soloing a viable alternative for monks. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3528">

And the place was crowded.  30 drunk EQ players all running around, 90% of 'em drunk and 90% of 'em wanting to talk everyone else's ear off.  If I didn't shake yer hand, it was prolly cuz you had a drink in yours, or it was crowded as shit and going for a handshake might net a handful of crotch and or ass.<br>
<br>
And no, I didn't start a fight with drunk-Boston-boy when he ran up to Ruffo and knocked the camera outta his hand cuz he was taking pictures of his bleeding friend and pointing and laughing.  Nobody was physically hit.  Does it make me a pussy for not starting a fight?  I dunno... you seem to place great value on losing your temper and threatening and or inflicting physical harm.<br>

I won't say I won't mention violent measures again because I'd be lying.. I'm an adrenaline fighter, and when I get pissed, people know it.  I like flame boards because they allow me to take out a little aggression, and often times I'm actually TRYING to piss people off.  That's primarily because I no longer live in the ghetto that I used to live in, so I don't fight as often as I'd like to.  Your civil response basically justifies an apology for the loose threat.

Its hard to flame someone who considers his sixth grade year his senior year and jr high as a form of higher education like Jaeron.<br>
<br>
What Jaeron is doing with these posts is backing out slowly, much like his boyfriend Steve does when they engage in anal sex ( from his 'This is the truth about me' post 2001 ), he is trying to save face and pretend he is all cool after making himself look like a total ass. Way to go man, why dont ya give him one of those hearty handshakes and a nice pat on his shoulder, or maybe a psuedo home boy hug. Its all good right?<br>
<br>
Go back to explaining the zone in difficulities of Cazic Thule or why Necromancers are the only class who should be able to solo, your insights on the game are so stunning and new that I find myself soiling my jeans when I see yer name on a post because I know there is a new angle to which you put things which totally defys all logic but you do it with such moranic back peddling and stupid cross wording that people often stop reading yer posts for fear they will lose brain cells trying to make sense of the jibber jabber ya spew.<br>
<br>
Jaeron we do love you dog, peace out homie, and dont be pulling a mega wedgie bomb home slice, talk to you after fourth period, laters!! <p><center>

You created a monk in the era of godly defense with second best damage in the game, the ability to wear insane armor, mend healing, feign death, ability to solo, with very little, if any, downsides.  You mention the difficulties of Cazic Thule, and why Necros are the only class who should be able to solo.. but these are not my theories.  I said in my opinion no classes should be able to solo.  Necros being able to solo was not my idea, but the content design teams.  I'm sorry that you don't seem to know enough about the games design to know this, but being that someone posted this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
At one point, before and during early Kunark, it was stated that Necromancers were supposed to be the solo class, and that is why they weren't very &quot;raid friendly.&quot; Mages were next in line, and then Druids.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It seems that there are others out there that can remember further back then last week.<br>
<br>
I think NO class should be able to solo.  If every class can solo, they're pretty damn more powerful then the mobs they're fighting so if you stick six classes together that are already more powerful alone against that mob, there's even less of a challenge.  Then basically you're removing what makes this game.. the multiplayer aspect.  This is an MMORPG.. if you're not willing to play with others, go the hell away.  I'm sorry dude but you can say all you want that I make this stuff up.  I'm not.  I just apparently remember more then you do.  It was stated that the necro was designed to be able to solo a bit by VI.  If you don't like that, too damn bad, suffer.<br>
<br>
Oh and as for all of the sixth grade education flames and all, is that the best you got?  Cause if so, you need to find a new hobby.  You don't even play EQ anymore so I know your time isn't spent there..  I'm sure you have your reasons for not playing EQ atm, like you're upset that you didn't get enough loot, or that you get yelled at for doing your job wrong and such, but I don't think you're gonna cut it on the flameboard with lame crap like that bro.. try something that involves my mother in a flame.. it might work a little better then what you've got now.. Or wait.. watch this..<br>
<br>
I can't be held responsable for your actions.<br>
<br>
Flame me for spelling responsible wrong.. you know you want to.<br>
<br>
I don't backpeddle.  I haven't changed a thing I said since I started on this post.  Since you're the king of quotes, why don't you show me what I've changed in quotes if you really feel I backpeddle?  The only peddle going on here is your mom pedling my balls while she rides my dick!<br>
<br>
There ya go big guy.. you should find a spelling flame to make, and I made fun of your mother after telling you how lame it would be to flame someones mother.. you should have more then enough ammo to actually be creative this time.<br>
<br>
Now please 'scuse me while I go study for my test tomorrow.. being in the 6th grade is taxing you know!<br>
<br>

<br>
Sorry FoH fanboy, but you really need to actually play a class to 60, and not have Crush powerlevel one for you and hand it to you and then pull strings to get a putz like you loot. Oh yes, thats what he did, he looked out for your dumb ass. I watched Crush powerlevel the Jaeron rogue in the hole, see I actually hasted him and the rogue with the characters I leveled on my own. So when yer ass who couldnt even hack it on Veeshan came here had a 50 plus rogue to take over. I am sure that was a hard job. Sorry you lack the skills to even have leveled yer druid to 60 which is oh so sad as druids are also great soloers and pretty easy to powerlevel, but considering your small brain, it seems pretty easy to figure out you couldnt even cast snare and a dot properly.<br>
<br>
So keep pretending ya are this grand well of knowledge, you are a large empty space, but you are lacking the knowledge. You backpeddle and cross over your own words so much you probably dont even realize it. <br>
<br>
All classes should be able to solo some mobs, but there are some mobs which require multiple classes to defeat, and the ideal of a group is also that you save mana/health by combing forces. <br>
<br>
I know this is a hard concept for you, as you can solo a shroom, but you cannot solo a Temple Guard, you can solo Sun Rev but you cannot solo Vex Thal zone mob. See look, mobs in the same general level, but with different hitpoints and resists. Wow that was hard. All classes can solo the right mobs with the right gear. Why do you think people hung out in Skyshrine? for their health? they could solo a ton of mobs in the scar and the shrine yet couldnt handle the bosses alone.<br>
<br>
Grouping was designed to save downtime and promote a more social game. See there was a time in the game there was no clarity Jaeron, where ya grouped because the bigger yer group, the more mana everyone had because the less ya used to take down a mob so ya could take down more faster. Nifty concept eh? It wasnt about being gods you fucking moron. If they didnt want people to be gods, they wouldnt have added half the gear they did. <br>
<br>
So yes you can rag on me for making a monk during Kunark, but at least I leveled him on my own, I didnt ask a buddy from another server to present with a pre made toon because I couldnt hack it as an FOH fanboy. So fuck off you stupid piece of shit.<br>
<br>
As for not playing, its been made pretty apparent why I am not playing, but once again, that whole reading and understanding thing has yer brain in a tither. Though I might of played more if I had Crush as my best bud making sure I got items I didnt even deserve and leveling my character. You are just a jackass who couldnt hack it on another server and can barely hack it here. Hold tight to yer friend, because otherwise you wouldnt have made it and would be writing rants about how FOH is such a mean guild on everlore boards.<br>
