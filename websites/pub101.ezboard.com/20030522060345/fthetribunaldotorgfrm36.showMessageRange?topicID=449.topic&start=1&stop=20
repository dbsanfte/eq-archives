I am a soldier, convinced that I am acting on behalf of soldiers. I believe that this War, on which I entered as a war of defence and liberation, has now become a war of aggression and conquest. I believe that the purpose for which I and my fellow soldiers entered upon this war should have been so clearly stated as to have made it impossible to change them, and that, had this been done, the objects which actuated us would now be attainable by negotiation. I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops, and I can no longer be a party to prolong these sufferings for ends which I believe to be evil and unjust. I am not protesting against the conduct of the war, but against the political errors and insincerities for which the fighting men are being sacrificed. On behalf of those who are suffering now I make this protest against the deception which is being practised on them; also I believe that I may help to destroy the callous complacency with which the majority of those at home regard the contrivance of agonies which they do not, and which they have not sufficient imagination to realize&quot;.<br>

<br>
Maybe they should take some of that 326 billion + and place some AAM's in New York and other major cities besides DC. Put on another I Luv NY T-shirt Mr. President. I am sure they believe you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe they ought to take some of that 326 billion + to fund our first responders here at home instead of vetoing funding for them. Seems Bush considers it more important to attack Iraq than to ensure the care of US citizens... citizens who will be under an even greater threat of attack after we invade.<br>
<br>
Maybe Homeland Security ought to be more than a fuckin joke to give false security to US citizens while we spend our money attacking a guy who isn't an immediate nor imminent threat.<br>
<br>
Now we learn from the Washington Post that the US plans on setting up it's own government in Iraq for 5 years or more and to control it's oil. How much is that going to fuckin cost? Gonna be fun watching our men get picked off by snipers and try to head off suicide bombers (and yes it's suicide, not homicide bombers Mr President) for 5 years.  <br>

Sorry, I am having a bad night and right now I am pissed that a President without a fuckin mandate... a President that couldn't even win the popular vote, is cramming this war down the worlds throat while he gives tax breaks to the rich and ignores the needs and safety of our citizens here at home. <p><br>

An ounce of prevention?  Besides, that wouldn't make any sense anyway.  How many people would even use their gas masks?  How many would throw them in the closet and forget about them?  Would it truly be a good return on our investment (which would be huge).  It probably is when you consider that Congressmen and Pentagon employees realize how critical their job is, especially in the event of a terrorist attack.  Proposals like this are really rather silly if you sit down and think about it, though.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe they should take some of that 326 billion + and place some AAM's in New York and other major cities besides DC.&quot;<br>
<br>
They put missiles around D.C. because it is the nerve center of our government.  New York is not.  The purpose of the missiles is not to protect the civilian population, but the government and the military.  And again, think cost vs. benefit.  We put missiles around New York, ok, so the terrorists go somewhere else.  How many cities do we build a missile ring around?  How much will it cost?  How much good will it do?<br>
<br>
&quot;Seems Bush considers it more important to attack Iraq than to ensure the care of US citizens.&quot;<br>
<br>
What are are missing here is that attacking Iraq IS ensuring the care of U.S. citizens.  That is the purpose of the money!!  Your whole rant makes absolutely no sense, Loegan.  We are invading Iraq first and foremost for reasons of security.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now we learn from the Washington Post that the US plans on setting up it's own government in Iraq for 5 years or more and to control it's oil. How much is that going to fuckin cost?&quot;<br>
<br>
Uhh, no.  The purpose of the provisional military government will not be to control the oil.  I don't like the idea myself, because I think we need to set up a provisional government with Iraqis in charge and develop at least a semblance of a democracy as soon as possible, but the plan has nothing to do with oil.  In fact, the whole reason we are leaning toward the military government plan is that we are being pressured into it by Saudi Arabia and the other Middle Eastern nations!<br>
<br>
&quot;How much of an idiot do I feel like posting how stupid the war for oil theory was?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hopefully not much of one, considering you were correct.<br>
<br>
&quot;How great is this - we have the best allies money can buy and we leave our citizens with their ass to the wind.&quot;<br>
<br>
There's simply no evidence of this.  Maybe if you could show that by spending gobs more money on the Homeland Defense department we would be safe, it would make sense.  Personally, I don't place much stock in it at all.  Giving gas masks to citizens won't accomplish jack diddly.  Placing missiles around every U.S. city is silly.  Our intelligence is working very hard, they have been un-handcuffed by recent legislation, and Homeland Defense is doing their thing, whatever that is.<br>
<br>
I realize you don't think Iraq is a threat.  I am somewhat surprised, since you said you now support the war, but that is a reasonable argument against the war and against spending the money on it.  Surely you must realize, however, that Bush and the entire administration disagree with you, including men like Powell, Schwartzkopf, and others.  They would not support this war if they did not believe that Iraq posed a threat, and that the money spent in a war against it would prove to be better used in that war than spent buying gas masks for every U.S. citizen.  So, where do you stand exactly?<br>
<br>
&quot;President without a fuckin mandate&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh... he won every recount, you know.  He has well over 50% approval.  The system worked the way it's supposed to.  It's time to put this behind us.<br>
<br>
&quot;tax breaks to the rich&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh... more propoganda.  How in the world could he lower the taxes of &quot;poor&quot; people much more without eliminating them altogether?  Besides, the purpose of the tax breaks are to stimulate the economy, not further reinforce the already graduated tax system. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

Hey folks, we are at high alert - there is nothing you can do and you have nothing to protect yourself with. Just thought you'd like to know.<br>

Isreal gives every one of their citizens personal protection kits which include gas masks. Seems if our government believes the risk is as high as they say that they should give us the same benefit.<br>

DC, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco. All coastal cities with dense populations that accept international flights. But I guess that's less important than spending 14 billion (deal made today I guess) to bribe Turkey.<br>

Ensure our security? By destroying missiles that go 135 miles instead of 93 miles? By destroying Mustard gas stocks? By attacking a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 and using the war on terrorism as an excuse? By making pre-emptive strikes and opening Pandoras Box? By defying the UN (Mexico just stated they will not support military action in Iraq - 5 more to go) By setting up a US controlled government in Iraq which will infuriate every radical and moderate in the Middle East?

That was before Powell gave his &quot;concrete evidence&quot; that turned out to be utter Bushit. Every piece of evidence they have shown is Bushit.<br>
<br>
plagerized 12 year old material, <br>
<br>
satellite photos that show nothing even remotely close to evidence, <br>
<br>
tapes of OBL that make it clear that he thinks Saddam is an infidel,   <br>
<br>
proof that  a missile which Iraq declared in it's report, goes 20 - 40 miles further than it's supposed to - BFD.<br>
<br>
It's all Bushit. After months of hearing how we would be shown conclusive evidence to support a war, we get that load of crap and I am supposed to be satisfied?<br>
<br>
Powell is now obviously in Bush's pocket. His evidence was pathetic.<br>
<br>
Bush has no evidence so he has to use intimidation:<br>
<br>
You are either with us or against us<br>
<br>
France and Germany represent the Old Europe. They are irrelevant.<br>
<br>
If the UN does not support military action against Iraq it is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
5 million protestors are only a focus group.<br>
<br>
<br>
If he had a convincing case he wouldn't need threats and bribes to have this war. But they see through us. <br>
<br>
Iraq releases a full report as ordered - Bush calls it lies - we have to go to war.<br>
<br>
Iraq allows U2 flights - Bush claims it means nothing - we need to go to war.<br>
<br>
Iraq agrees to destroy the missiles - Bush scoffs at them and we need to go to war.<br>
<br>
Blitz says Iraq has co-operated and they need more time - Bush's says we need to go to war.<br>
<br>
Then we find out the US is taking over Iraqs oil fields and determine what companies get them? What kind of shit is this?<br>
<br>
And the world is supposed to be stupid enough to still think that there is anything that Iraq could do to avoid war now? Bush is going to invade Iraq no matter what. And he is going to make it Americas foot hold in the Middle East. Dress it up and put all the icing on it you want, this is emperialism, it helps OBL and makes us a bigger target than ever.<br>
<br>
***EDIT***<br>
<br>
Sounds like I was wrong. Geraldo Riveria on Fox just used the same number - 26 billion, to get Turkey to let us use their territory.<br>

The differnce is I don't trust Bush, I don't like Bush, so it's easy for me to see this as total BS. If it was Clinton, I probably would still be holding out hope, but there comes a time when you have to take a hard look at what's been presented and ask yourself if they really had such strong proof, why the hell wouldn't they present it? Especially when Tony Blair is facing 70% opposition and the numbers are growing?<br>
<br>
When Powell said he had &quot;concrete proof&quot; of the Iraq - al Qaeda tie link and then presented that pathetic load of Bushit, I had to back off from him as much as I respected him.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the evidence exists. With the global resistance being presented and the support here at home dropping, they would have presented it if they had it. They have presented what they have and if you are extremely biased against Iraq, then I guess it's enough, but it's about as weak as it gets for anyone who has an ounce of doubt in this administration... which it appears alot of people on this planet do.<br>

8&lt;================================================<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If You Want To Win An Election, Just Control The Voting Machines&quot;<br>
Thom Hartmann,  February 26, 2003<br>
<br>
Maybe Nebraska Republican Chuck Hagel honestly won two U.S. Senate elections. Maybe it's true that the citizens of Georgia simply decided that incumbent Democratic Senator Max Cleland, a wildly popular war veteran who lost three limbs in Vietnam, was, as his successful Republican challenger suggested in his campaign ads, too unpatriotic to remain in the Senate. Maybe George W. Bush, Alabama's new Republican governor Bob Riley, and a small but congressionally decisive handful of other long-shot Republican candidates really did win those states where conventional wisdom and straw polls showed them losing in the last few election cycles.<br>
<br>
Perhaps, after a half-century of fine-tuning exit polling to such a science that it's now sometimes used to verify how clean elections are in Third World countries, it really did suddenly become inaccurate in the United States in the past six years and just won't work here anymore. Perhaps it's just a coincidence that the sudden rise of inaccurate exit polls happened around the same time corporate-programmed, computer-controlled, modem-capable voting machines began recording and tabulating ballots.<br>
<br>
But if any of this is true, there's not much of a paper trail from the voters' hand to prove it.<br>
<br>
You'd think in an open democracy that the government - answerable to all its citizens rather than a handful of corporate officers and stockholders - would program, repair, and control the voting machines. You'd think the computers that handle our cherished ballots would be open and their software and programming available for public scrutiny. You'd think there would be a paper trail of the vote, which could be followed and audited if a there was evidence of voting fraud or if exit polls disagreed with computerized vote counts.<br>
<br>
You'd be wrong.<br>
<br>
The respected Washington, DC publication The Hill has confirmed that former conservative radio talk-show host and now Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel was the head of, and continues to own part interest in, the company that owns the company that installed, programmed, and largely ran the voting machines that were used by most of the citizens of Nebraska.<br>
<br>
Back when Hagel first ran there for the U.S. Senate in 1996, his company's computer-controlled voting machines showed he'd won stunning upsets in both the primaries and the general election. The Washington Post (1/13/1997) said Hagel's &quot;Senate victory against an incumbent Democratic governor was the major Republican upset in the November election.&quot; According to Bev Harris of www.blackboxvoting.com, Hagel won virtually every demographic group, including many largely Black communities that had never before voted Republican. Hagel was the first Republican in 24 years to win a Senate seat in Nebraska.<br>
<br>
Six years later Hagel ran again, this time against Democrat Charlie Matulka in 2002, and won in a landslide. As his hagel.senate.gov website says, Hagel &quot;was re-elected to his second term in the United States Senate on November 5, 2002 with 83% of the vote. That represents the biggest political victory in the history of Nebraska.&quot;<br>
<br>
What Hagel's website fails to disclose is that about 80 percent of those votes were counted by computer-controlled voting machines put in place by the company affiliated with Hagel. Built by that company. Programmed by that company.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a big story, bigger than Watergate ever was,&quot; said Hagel's Democratic opponent in the 2002 Senate race, Charlie Matulka. &quot;They say Hagel shocked the world, but he didn't shock me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Is Matulka the sore loser the Hagel campaign paints him as, or is he democracy's proverbial canary in the mineshaft?<br>
<br>
In Georgia, Democratic incumbent and war-hero Max Cleland was defeated by Saxby Chambliss, who'd avoided service in Vietnam with a &quot;medical deferment&quot; but ran his campaign on the theme that he was more patriotic than Cleland. While many in Georgia expected a big win by Cleland, the computerized voting machines said that Chambliss had won.<br>
<br>
The BBC summed up Georgia voters' reaction in a 6 November 2002 headline: &quot;GEORGIA UPSET STUNS DEMOCRATS.&quot; The BBC echoed the confusion of many Georgia voters when they wrote, &quot;Mr. Cleland - an army veteran who lost three limbs in a grenade explosion during the Vietnam War - had long been considered 'untouchable' on questions of defense and national security.&quot;<br>
<br>
Between them, Hagel and Chambliss' victories sealed Republican control of the Senate. Odds are both won fair and square, the American way, using huge piles of corporate money to carpet-bomb voters with television advertising. But either the appearance or the possibility of impropriety in an election casts a shadow over American democracy.<br>
<br>
&quot;The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by which all other rights are protected,&quot; wrote Thomas Paine over 200 years ago. &quot;To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery...&quot;<br>
<br>
That slavery, according to Hagel's last opponent Charlie Matulka, is at our doorstep.<br>
<br>
&quot;They can take over our country without firing a shot,&quot; Matulka said, &quot;just by taking over our election systems.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking over our election systems? Is that really possible in the USA?<br>
<br>
Bev Harris of www.talion.com and www.blackboxvoting.com looked into the situation in depth and thinks Matulka may be on to something. The company tied to Hagel even threatened her with legal action when she went public about his company having built the machines that counted his landslide votes. (Her response was to put the law firm's threat letter on her website and send a press release to 4000 editors, inviting them to check it out)<br>
<br>
&quot;I suspect they're getting ready to do this all across all the states,&quot; Matulka said in a January 30, 2003 interview. &quot;God help us if Bush gets his touch screens all across the country,&quot; he added, &quot;because they leave no paper trail. These corporations are taking over America, and they just about have control of our voting machines.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the meantime, exit-polling organizations have quietly gone out of business, and the news arms of the huge multinational corporations that own our networks are suggesting the days of exit polls are over. Virtually none were reported in 2002, creating an odd and unsettling silence that caused unease for the many American voters who had come to view exit polls as proof of the integrity of their election systems.<br>
<br>
As all this comes to light, many citizens and even a few politicians are wondering if it's a good idea for corporations to be so involved in the guts of our voting systems. The whole idea of a democratic republic was to create a common institution (the government itself) owned by its citizens, answerable to its citizens, and authorized to exist and continue existing solely &quot;by the consent of the governed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Prior to 1886 - when, law schools incorrectly tell law students, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporations are &quot;persons&quot; with equal protection and other &quot;human rights&quot; - it was illegal in most states for corporations to involve themselves in politics at all, much less to service the core mechanism of politics. And during the era of Teddy Roosevelt, who said, &quot;There can be no effective control of corporations while their political activity remains,&quot; numerous additional laws were passed to restrain corporations from involvement in politics.<br>
<br>
Wisconsin, for example, had a law that explicitly stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;No corporation doing business in this state shall pay or contribute, or offer consent or agree to pay or contribute, directly or indirectly, any money, property, free service of its officers or employees or thing of value to any political party, organization, committee or individual for any political purpose whatsoever, or for the purpose of influencing legislation of any kind, or to promote or defeat the candidacy of any person for nomination, appointment or election to any political office.&quot;<br>
<br>
The penalty for violating that law was dissolution of the corporation, and &quot;any officer, employee, agent or attorney or other representative of any corporation, acting for and in behalf of such corporation&quot; would be subject to &quot;imprisonment in the state prison for a period of not less than one nor more than five years&quot; and a substantial fine.<br>
<br>
However, the recent political trend has moved us in the opposite direction, with governments answerable to &quot;We, The People&quot; turning over administration of our commons to corporations answerable only to CEOs, boards, and stockholders. The result is the enrichment of corporations and the appearance that democracy in America has started to resemble its parody in banana republics.<br>
<br>
But if America still is a democratic republic, then We, The People still own our government. And the way our ownership and management of our common government (and its assets) is asserted is through the vote.<br>
<br>
On most levels, privatization is only a &quot;small sin&quot; against democracy. Turning a nation's or community's water, septic, roadway, prisons, airwaves, or health care commons over to private corporations has so far demonstrably degraded the quality of life for average citizens and enriched a few of the most powerful campaign contributors. But it hasn't been the end of democracy (although some wonder about what the FCC is preparing to do - but that's a separate story).<br>
<br>
Many citizens believe, however, that turning the programming and maintenance of voting over to private, for-profit corporations, answerable only to their owners, officers, and stockholders, puts democracy itself at peril.<br>
<br>
And, argues Charlie Matulka, for a former officer of one of those corporations to then place himself into an election without disclosing such an apparent conflict of interest is to create a parody of democracy.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Matulka's been reading too many conspiracy theory tracts. Or maybe he's on to something. We won't know until a truly independent government agency looks into the matter.<br>
<br>
When Bev Harris and The Hill's Alexander Bolton pressed the Chief Counsel and Director of the Senate Ethics Committee, the man responsible for ensuring that FEC disclosures are complete, asking him why he'd not questioned Hagel's 1995, 1996, and 2001 failures to disclose the details of his ownership in the company that owned the voting machine company when he ran for the Senate, the Director reportedly met with Hagel's office on Friday, January 25, 2003 and Monday, January 27, 2003. After the second meeting, on the afternoon of January 27th, the Director of the Senate Ethics Committee resigned his job.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, back in Nebraska, Charlie Matulka had requested a hand count of the vote in the election he lost to Hagel. He just learned his request was denied because, he said, Nebraska has a just-passed law that prohibits government-employee election workers from looking at the ballots, even in a recount. The only machines permitted to count votes in Nebraska, he said, are those made and programmed by the corporation formerly run by Hagel.<br>
<br>
Matulka shared his news with me, then sighed loud and long on the phone, as if he were watching his children's future evaporate.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you want to win the election,&quot; he finally said, &quot;just control the machines.&quot;<br>
