<br>
<br>
      Darkness.....I open my eyes and all I see is darkness. I feel the burning in my right eye. I reach up to feel the warm blood of the fresh wound. The pain is unbearable, I lose consciousness. More blackness.... Images of orcs floating in my mind. My home burnt to the ground. My parents slaughtered. Consciousness slams into my mind. I hear orcish laughter. I hear their foul plans for me.<br>
     Than I hear nothing but a voice. Not a soft, soothing, voice like that of my mother. Rather the strained fiery voice of hatred. It calls to me....promising me the the power to have my vengeance on these orcs. Use your hate repeats the voice over and over again. My anger and hatred grows and I feel the strength returning to my body. I allow my hatred to course through my body making me ever stronger. <br>
     This new strength coursing though my body I clutch a short sword from the body of a servant. I plunge straight at the orcs. I move as if I am in a dream. I hit the first orc at full charge cleaving his head from his shoulders. The others are aware of me now. The second has not the time to swing his club as an upward slash from my blade removes his arm. He screams in pain I smile. Moving quickly to the next,I spin as his long sword flashes inches from my face,my blade drawing a jagged line across his midsection. He screams has his life pours to the ground. Two left they take up battle stances shoulder to shoulder. I rush in...the first swings low I jump and tuck into a roll as the second swings where my head was just moments ago. I hit the ground swinging my first cut removing the leg of the orc to my right and a downward thrust lodges the blade between the shoulders of the last orc. I draw my blade out and he tumbles to the ground. The two injured orcs howl in pain as their lifeblood ebbs away. I raise my sword to finish them, but I stop.<br>
   The voice again...&quot;Make them suffer as you have suffered&quot;.<br>
   I lower my sword. Their howls only serve to anger me further. I curse them to die in pain.<br>
    The battle over I feel the strength slipping from my body. I lose consciousness once again.<br>
   When next I awake I see only darkness. I smell the dampness of tunnels. The smell becomes nauseating it becomes apparent that this is a sewer and not a cave at all. Waves of nausea hit me till I lose consciousness once again.<br>
   I awaken in a dimly lit room the foul smell all but gone. I reach to my eye there is a clean dressing and I know from this day fourth I will never have the use of it.<br>
   A man steps into my chamber. He introduces himself as Pietro Zarn and with no so much as a &quot;How are you&quot; he says &quot;Time to start your training.&quot;<br>
   Over the weeks that follow I am trained no stop in the arts of warfare. Endless sparring matches with the other four students. Then real weapons are introduced to the matches. The sparring is now to the death. My hatred burning inside of me I quickly defeat my first opponent. I wait to see the outcome of the other battle. One student will not fight. A red glow erupts from the hands of a priest. The life instantly is drained from the noncombatant. The remaining two began to fight. I must wait the outcome of this battle. Of the combatants one is an Iksar, I marvel at his speed and grace. The other,an Ogre,is not so graceful. What he lacks in grace he more than compensates for in brute strength. His strength proves not to be enough as the Iksar wares him down and eventually moves in for the kill.<br>
     I come face to face with the Iksar. He is the first I have ever seen. The battle begins. My astonishment with the creature leads to a cut above my left knee. This snaps me back to the matter at hand. His blades flashing I do all I can to hold him off. But hold him off I must,for just as the Ogre lost due to the overuse of strength, this lizard's speed will ware him down as well. The battle seams to last forever, eventually I began to find holes in his defenses. I can wait no more I lunge my blade angled at his throat..I know I will hit my mark. What I didn't realize was his blade coming in from the side.  As my blade hits its mark I try to spin to block his thrust...too late. I feel the warm flow of blood on my left side. I am unlucky the wound is fatal but it will take hours for my passing. The lizard is the lucky one his light was extinguished at the twist of my wrist. <br>
   The voice again...&quot;Do you wish to live Sethin?<br>
    &quot;If you see fit to spare me than do so, I will not beg for my life.&quot; I reply in anger.<br>
   &quot; I will spare you for you shall be my burning sword of hate from this day on. Go out into the world of Norrath and destroy all that stand in your way.&quot;<br>
    A greenish blue cloud encircles my body. My wounds began to close. I get to my feet healed. <br>
    I am soon escorted to the hidden entrance to the sewers. The short sword which I used to defeat the orcs is handed to me as well as some food and water. <br>
   &quot;Come back when you have adventured more.&quot; are the only words spoken to me.<br>
   &quot;What shall I do now?&quot; I ask.<br>
   &quot;Let your hatred be your guide. Destroy that which vexes you most.&quot; is the reply.<br>
  Thus my journey begins..... <br>

Still more has changed since that day.<br>
  My mind wanders back to those early years. At first wandering the East Commons destroying anything and everything that fell in my path. Slaying orcs by the scores with burning hatred that would not be sated. Man or beast it was all the same as they fell beneath my sword. I killed indiscriminately, with no remorse. My skills grew daily. Soon I was a very efficient killer. I took great pains to please my new Father,and he smiled on me with the gift of magic. This new tool was quickly added to my growing power.<br>
  I traveled farther and farther from Freeport in the seasons that followed. I ventured into the dungeons of Befallen to battle the undead. Traveled through Kithcor Forest to Highpass Hold where legions of orcs and gnolls met their doom by my hand. Exploring inside Highpass Keep it self to destroy the goblin infestation that dwells beneath its floors.<br>
  It was during my stay in Highkeep that I realized not all people feared my, or hated me for it. I came to know a young priest by the name of Linamar. He and I shared a battlefield one evening against a common foe,goblins. In an unfortunate turn of events our position was overrun by the dirty little creatures. Two of the group had fallen to the onslaught. The others in the party began to flee without warning. A pair of the foul creatures stood between me and the door. I had nearly finished one off when my lifeforce began to slip away. I gave up on any chance of leaving that place alive. Than in a sparkle of blue crystals my strength came back to me. I knew this was not Innoruuks hand saving me this time. I charged down the last goblin,and as my life would ebb out it would be renewed by the same magic time and again. Having dispatched the beast I turned to see Linamar still holding his position against the wall. He had stayed when warriors had ran. He had saved me when he could have saved himself. He knew what I was and who my lord was yet he did not scorn me for it. From that day on we fought side by side in many a battle. I had made a friend in a world where I did not think it was possible.<br>
