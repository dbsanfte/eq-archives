I think the randomness with which they enforce the naming rules is the main concern.  Makes you wonder how players can have a name for 2 years and then all of a sudden, they are deemed inappropriate...not like these players have never been seen/in the presence of a gm/guide before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ufleviuskot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>flevius KoT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/02 11:52:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> guide approved names</span><hr size=1> My current theory is that when no guides are available (or not many) like late and night and such they just get checked for uniqueness and cursing.  <br>

I'd wager that the GMs indeed rarely waste their time on some ridiculous witch hunt for names. However, being that it's their jobs if some asshead complains, they have to do something about it. Simple as that. <br>
<br>
Example of what I mean? Let's try a simple one. Skateboarders. You know em, they're those teenagers in the black t-shirts that ride on those wheeled plank thingies, doing things that kids do. Now I'm a cop, and I gotta tell you from my own perspective I dont give a damn what skateboarders do or where they go. But every skateboarder who reads this has a 'cops harrassed me' cry of foul on their lips. Well guess what? The reason they did that is because some tight ass dipshit anonymously called the police and reported that some 'ruffian skateboarders' were gonna start 'slacking' at any moment! This is a police priority! Well... it's a call, and it has to be answered... and if it isnt dealt with then anon dickhead is gonna keep calling and calling and calling... and while you're dealing with scowling teenagers who hate your ass, the criminals or issues you need and WANT to be after are running amok (I think I'm taking about Babilove here... but I might be off track..)<br>
<br>
Um, what was I saying? Oh yeah, Naeamian you're still a shitheal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Seriously, if such a person exists (and I believe the world is full of anonymous petitoners and other cockless people who begged for the chance to take names while the teacher was out of the room) we need to find him, and take his balls. <p><IMG SRC=http://pacifictrim.homestead.com/files/strife.jpg><BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24955>PORNO.</a>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
I hope that with this email I am able to shed some light on this situation and give our stance on this issue so that you all understand where ruling to remove the name came from thus helping ease your mind. Anytime we have to enforce our naming policy, we do run the risk that we will not be held with the highest regards by the customer affected by this enforcement as well as his or her friends. It appears that this is the case here and that all of you are unhappy with this ruling. It is my hope that I will be able to explain to you and your friends as to why we feel that Alwaysoom is a phrase and thus a violation of the naming policy per Section 11.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is the definition of Always from Websters:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Main Entry: al·ways <br>
Pronunciation: 'ol-wEz, -w&amp;z, -(&quot;)wAz also 'o-<br>
Function: adverb<br>
Etymology: Middle English alwayes, from alwey<br>
Date: 14th century<br>
1 : at all times : INVARIABLY<br>
2 : FOREVER, PERPETUALLY<br>
3 : at any rate : in any event &lt;as a last resort one can always work&gt;<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The important thing to note in the definition is under Function. Always is an adverb not an adjective or a noun. The general rule that we use here is that only adjectives or nouns can be used to start descriptive compounds. There are, of course, exceptions to this since English is a rather dynamic language. It's really hard to nail this down and write a policy for what makes a descriptive compound and what doesn't. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The last part of the surname in question is OOM. OOM is not a word but an acronym for Out of Mana which is a phrase by itself. I know that people have taken to pronouncing it as a word instead of pronouncing each letter (another great example of this is SoW) but it still remains what it really is... an acronym for a phrase.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now we take and put it all together we have Always Out of Mana. This, to us, is clearly a defined phrase which does violate the policy under Section 11. As such, the ruling will stand and the surname will not be restored.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Once again, I do understand, David, that you have had this surname for a long time and that it's hard to have it taken away. It's always our focus and goal to make our customers as happy as possible and provide them with prompt quality service when able. At the same time, it's also important that we uphold the standard and policies that we have set for ourselves, Everquest and the populous of Norrath. In cases such as names and surname changes, those two usually clash and we have unhappy customers. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Another point that I wanted to make sure that I addressed since it was brought up several times was Aerendar changing the surname without notification. Several of you have submitted the section from our naming policy posted on our website that for category 3-13 violations that the customer will be notified first via in-game tell or email. This only applies to first names. It does not apply to surnames at all. First names are far more important to a character then surnames are because first names are what you are identified by. They are what your friends list search for. They are what comes up on a /who all in a zone. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I hope that I have accomplished my goal in this email and have explained our stance on this issue thoroughly and concisely. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If you should have further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.<br>

Yes, they could easily refute any of those accusations by simply saying that it's very hard to monitor as many people as EQ encompasses at any given time That combined with the difference in playing time of the player versus the working time of the GM's, are all valid defenses. But realistically, How long have you been on EQ Hav? my guess is at least 2 years, if not closer to 3. <br>
<br>
2-and half years almost, you've had that last name. You aren't a casual player (taken into context of what defines casual in the EQ realm), and only now, they remove the last name. That is how long it took them to realize your &quot;violation&quot; And they talk about how the first name is more imporant the surname. Agreed, but they really underestimate the importance of the surname too. You may not be searched by it, but you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> remembered</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> by it.

I guess alwaysfighting, alwaysbroke, alwayslaughing, alwaysinpain, always hurt, sometimesthinking, nevercaring wouldnt work because of 'always', 'sometimes' or 'never;<br>
 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now when someone says im alwaysplayingeq, neverstudying, and sometimesbraindead, i can slap them around and scream &quot;those arent descriptive words, neener neener neener&quot; or something to that effect<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;There are, of course, exceptions to this since English is a rather dynamic language.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really? Wow, wonder if any of the ones i listed were. Guess if they were, alwaysoom would be too, so that doesnt work either.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's really hard to nail this down and write a policy for what makes a descriptive compound and what doesn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
And yet you say 'alwaysoom' isnt a descriptive compound word because it starts with 'always' yet you state there are exceptions. So... whats your point<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The last part of the surname in question is OOM. OOM is not a word but an acronym for Out of Mana which is a phrase by itself. I know that people have taken to pronouncing it as a word instead of pronouncing each letter (another great example of this is SoW) but it still remains what it really is... an acronym for a phrase.&quot;<br>
<br>
Too bad sow is a word. /nod.  And who the fuck is to tell someone Alwaysoom is read &quot;always out of mana&quot;? To me its alway-zoom /shrug<br>
<br>
Guess we should never forget that everquest caused the english language to be created.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to see the response from someone who makes the decisions in vi, but they cant post to boards, so ive likely broken down a letter from someone who couldnt give a shit anyway<br>
