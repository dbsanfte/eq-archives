All major religions involve afterlives or reincarnations of some sort and it was argued that this was an evolutionary defensive mechanism. If you took two humans, one with a &quot;God center&quot; and one without, and let them lead their lives the one with the afterlife reward system would thrive much easier (have a purpose) than the one with the intelligence to be conscious of itself but with a nihilist attitude and no drive to continue itself or propogate offspring since &quot;none of this matters anyway&quot;. Basically, they would over think themselves out of existance.<br>
<br>
Even now, it's hard to find a true nihilist, since they are usualy so depressed they end up killing themselves or at best are extremely reclusive. The gene that fosters that nihilism is then hopefully lost to the breeding pool. This is the essence of evolution. Result: lots of happy shiny hard working people who believe we all go to a better place when we are done, passing on their happy shiny &quot;god center&quot; genes. Oh I forgot, this only applies if you obey all the social rules! You can call this karma, or being &quot;good&quot;, or following the golden rule. It's all the same, and coincidentally, helps the species grow stronger through social order.<br>
<br>
Its a pretty interesting theory. Makes sense to me, even if it is unprovable. But since it fits the most number of current observations its got my vote along with evolution theory. When a new theory comes along that fits even more observations I will probably switch to that one. This is the biggest problem I have with most religions. They do not fit very many observations and the only explaination for contradiction is faith, or worded a different way, &quot;just because&quot;. Sorry, I'm not that guible. When I was four I was fooled by my mother into believing the sky was blue because she painted it that way, but today I am a bit more discerning in the theories I look to for answers.<br>
<br>
As for proof of God because of &quot;knowing God&quot;, there are a ton of people who have &quot;experienced God&quot; by taking mind altering drugs, singing loudly in church, running a grueling marathon, holding a deadly snake, almost dying in a car crash, or watching a beautiful sunset. Makes me think that it's all chemical stimulus in your brain like all euphorias. If God really was involved I'd think she would make it a miraculous and scientifically dumbfounding event and not something so ordinary it can be measured by a gradschool chemist.<br>
<br>
By the way, I am God. You can't prove me wrong so you have no choice but to accept my claim and worship me as such. If you don't you are a heretic and I won't let you live in the afterlife. Deal with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 572<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/3/03 1:54:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> Kij : i think you want to read what the Pope had to say on the subject.<br>

Being more or less a mathematician by trade I have the &quot;necessity of proof&quot; pretty deeply ingrained, paired with a natural skepticism. So i tend to view most of the religious &quot;sacred word&quot; as mythology and parable : (poor) attempts at explaining what couldn't be explained with the knowledge of the time. <br>
<br>
Projecting the debate into a cosmological dimension, the Bible is utterly anthropomorphic. How would your creationist theology conform to sapient extra-terrestrial life (and we already discussed the odds of that event... in doubt investigate the Drake equation) ? Were those E.Ts also modeled from the same primordial clay then ? Do they have souls ? Because if they don't, we could be making slaves of them and it would be &quot;A-Ok&quot; wouldn't it ? <br>
<br>
Gallileo had the time of his life to just shed the geocentric aspects from our &quot;bibilical truths&quot;. A few centuries later, it's not really a surprise that we find other aspects of the dusty (translated and adapted) text to be equally incoherent on other topics. It doesn't necessarily mean that the message is irrelevant. It means that we are starting to understand it with more clarity now that we can better understand it's context, our Universe.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Jesus went to Hell for 3 days and paid a visit to his old friend Lucifer.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't remember any story like this. The only mentions of hell (called hades) are in the New Testiment when jesus tells the story of the rich man and the begger . Jesus warns of men who are thrown into hell (loose translation of the place where worms do not die). And the famous quote, &quot;It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.&quot; Also there is a mention in some bibles about angels who disobeyed and were sent to hell (translated from Tartarus) to await the judgement.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Bible also makes refrences to the story of how the angel Lucifer believed that he was more powerful than god, took some other &quot;corrupt&quot; angels, and was kicked out of the gates of Heaven.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This was written by John Milton. Paradise lost. He made this shit up, man. Or I guess you could say, God told him about! He must have been a prophet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Bible also mentions that in the final days, the Devil will be thrown into a pit of burning sulfur<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sorry, no devil mentioned in this fashion. In fact the word devil is loosely translated into many modern bibles from the word tempter. Jesus does mention this tempter a couple times as a warning, but no where in the old testiment is this found. You could say Jesus just made the shit up. Or more acurately, the men who wrote the bible made it up. This Jesus who preched love sure did talk about the devil alot. I guess the devil was kicked out of heaven, as you put it, in the couple thousand years between the old and new testiment? Interesting.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There are numerous times in which Satan is mentioned in the Bible.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, this is true! Satan is the name of an angel translated as The Accuser. He is in the book of Job and is a servant of God. When he points out to god that there is a guy down there that only worships him because God has blessed him, God tries to prove Satan's theory wrong by killing Job's animals, deseasing his family and killing his sons, taking his home and generally making his life a living hell. When Job finally breaks down and questions his faith in God and why God would do this to him God comes down from heaven and bitches him out. It's a great story and exactly what I'd expect from such a loving god. Uh huh. Regardless, Satan isn't cast in a bad light anywhere in the old testiment and it's not until Jesus starts spouting his shit that the words devil and satan appear. All bad translations, of course. But go ahead and believe popular Xianity written by John Milton. We're all going to burn in hell! Haha, bring it on Church Lady!<br>

<br>
Do christians really read Paradise Lost and confuse it with the Bible?  What about Dante, who recalls the ancient greek/roman Elysium/Tartarus myths in a Christian light?<br>
<br>
Don't forget that the Old Testament is a collection of stories of How-To-Survive-In-The-Desert mixed with a decent smattering of re-visited Roman mythology (which in turn was a re-visiting of Greek mythology and Etruscan..)  The New Testament is a big bunch of PR - a bunch of guys who wanted to spread their religion around quickly and effectively came up with it, and it's a very impressive piece of marketing.<br>
<br>
I've got a friend who is a Jehovah's Witness.  They're an interesting bunch because they take the bible LITERALLY.  I mean like every single word, with no interpretation.  They don't even celebrate birthdays, because every time someone in the bible celebrates a birthday, something bad happens to them.  Taken literally... that means celebrating birthdays is bad.  Forget that the bible doesn't mention the other 10 million people around who were celebrating their birthdays without incident...<br>
<br>
Kij, I don't take you for a religious fanatic at all - actually I just see you as a person with a great deal of Faith.  Unfortunately, having BLIND faith precludes you from ever being able to have discussions with those without absolute, blind faith because we're unable to comprehend that you accept everything a priest tells you without question (sounds like brainwashing to me, but that's cuz I don't buy into it), and you can't comprehend that I don't accept god.<br>

<br>
Evolution, the way most people use it, is the theory that 4 billion or whatever years ago, primordial goo spontaneously turned into an organism which was the basis for all life on earth, and everyone can trace their ancestory back to that pile of slop.<br>
<br>
That theory is incompatible with Christianity, because Genesis clearly states that man was made separate from and above all the other creatures.<br>
<br>
&quot;If a species adapts significantly enough that it really is a new creature, didn't it just evolve?&quot;<br>
<br>
You could say that, i suppose.  That is not incompatible with a creationist theory.  As dynamic as our environment is, it would be shortsighted of an omniscient Got to not give us mechanisms to change with a dynamic world.<br>
<br>
Whenever i see creation debates, smug atheists portray all christians as ignorant fools, i.e. mertons mentality of a child remark from earlier.  Sheheban was more subtle about it, imply that being oriented towards math is inconsistent with religion.<br>
<br>
I have a bs in computer science and a minor in math.  The two (religion and education) never cross and are perfectly consistent.<br>
<br>
I'll also throw this out there: the most powerful man in the world is a christian.<br>

<br>
Careful Dumai - don't confuse faith and religion. Science does interfere with a significant portion of religious dogma, mostly the antequated metaphysical part. It's not necessarily incompatible with &quot;faith&quot; though. If you want me to be blunt : yes i usually tend to think that creationists are more than a little retarded when  waving their bibles in front of the massive body of scientific evidence for evolutionary theory. If they want to disprove evolution, fine. But do it scientifically with rigorous proof.<br>
<br>
I'll be equally direct in telling you that i do not know the meaning of life either, and that is probably admitting that i do not have faith. Unlike most true &quot;believers&quot; though, that thought doesn't fill me terror, it just gives me more incentive to make the best use out of whatever short time i am being given.<br>

<br>
&quot;quomodo cecidisti de caelo <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>lucifer</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> qui mane oriebaris corruisti in terram qui vulnerabas gentes&quot; (Isaiah 14:12).<br>
I did a goggle search to find a Latin Isaiah 14:12 my Latin is not any good, haha.<br>
<br>
This is a bad translation of light bringer. Modern bibles carry it over as: &quot;how art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning.&quot; The sad thing is the person who translated it totaly misread what was going on and the son of the morning is actually a reference to Nebachadnezzar (sp?). They got it so wrong that the meaning is forever changed and now we have this mythical fallen angel refered to where a Babylonian once stood. This is why blind faith in a book thousands of years old written in dead languages sucks.<br>
<br>
Well, Milton ran with it, along with the vaguely worded and poorly transcribed account of the fallen angels waiting for the Judgement in the place where worms do not die. He came up with such great terms as Lucifer, the devil, satan, and hell. It's a nice poem, but it's just a work of fiction. But like Christmas and Santa Claus it is engrained into Xian mythology and now bibles which were hard to read are made easier to digest by substituting words in the common vernacular. Satan, devil, and hell, get inserted and the way a passage reads changes drastically.<br>
<br>
It's a vicious cycle. Soon, the term &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; will be inserted into the bible. His name will be &quot;Hitler&quot;, and the sheeple who read the bible will go, &quot;Ahhh... I knew that was a bad word! Look, it's in the bible! Hitler is the Anti-Christ fallen from heaven.&quot; This is how things change. You can't fight it.<br>
<br>
Rewrite the bible to say good is good and bad is not so good and you have the message of God. The definition of good and bad is up to your interpretation.

I assume that's meant to refer to the President of the USA.... In which case, I must say he's not a very good christian.  That whole turn the other cheek thing just doesn't sit well with leaders of great nations in general. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know some people that I would consider very faithful, that is full of faith.  But, I know very few people that I would consider good christians in a strict sense of the word.  I mean if you read the new testament, say just the first four books, it's pretty obvious that any of us that can afford to waste our cash on ISPs, Computers, Video Games, Cable TV and so on... Are not being very good christians.  How about all those poor people out there that we should be giving everything too?<br>
<br>
The whole idea of an omniscient and omnipotent god just doesn't jibe with the idea of free will.  Without free will, it's kinda hard to hold anyone accountable for their actions.  I mean, if god is all knowing, then our choices in life are only free in that we are ignorant of them until the time comes.  God already knows what choice we're going to make, so we don't really have a choice in anything do we?  So if we don't have a choice, and God is the ultimate creator who set it all in motion, then God is responsible for the whole mess.  So how the hell can anyone be judged as good or bad?  We just are.... as we were made BY GOD.<br>
<br>
Omnipotence itself is a logical impossibility really.  If I'm all powerful then I can create anything right?  How about creating a rock so big that I can't lift it?  If I can't create it then I'm not all powerful and likewise if I can't lift it, I'm not all powerful. DOH!  It's all smoke and mirrors...  <br>
<br>
As far as creationism vs evolutionary theory or Science vs. Religion...  Science is a belief system not all that distant from 'religion' really.  The Natural LAWS that some spout off aren't laws at all as far as nature is concerned, they're simply patterns that humans have recognized and in many cases put to our use.  A scientific law is just a theory that hasn't been shown to be false YET.  So you are still using faith to some extent when you speak of scientific laws.  You have faith that once again that law will hold true, but really you don't know a thing until after it happens... That's the funny thing about knowledge and our inability to see into the future.  One can only have knowledge of the past, the rest is just prediction albeit based on patterns that we've seen repeated time and time again which may or may not be worth more than religious beliefs depending on who you are I suppose.<br>
<br>
I'd like to believe that there's some afterlife or reincarnation or at least some purpose or meaning to my existance.  But... If we're talking from a scientific standpoint and basing our conclusions on past observations and recognized patterns/laws/whatever... the harsh likelyhood is that I'm probably just another animal and the only meaning to my life is whatever I create for it.  The only chance at immortality I have is that someone will remember me and pass that memory on down through the generations.  I could be wrong, but I could also be right... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=361026">Sciek</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> &lt;Sol Invictus&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 1053<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/3/03 6:26:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/Sphynx5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> Shebahn, look at a Young's Literal Translation Bible, they use hades for just about everything.

It actualy makes more sense as death and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hades</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were cast into hell (or lake of fire). The bible is full of these kinds of judgement calls. You can't avoid it. But to be fair, the old testament does not have these inconsistancies because it doesn't discuss a &quot;hell&quot;, as Xians have come to think of it, so had no need for such loose interpretations. The first translations from Latin new testament in the Vulgate used hades instead of hell because John Milton hadn't written his novel yet. At least that's the way I've always interpreted the interpreting of the interpretations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kij>Kij</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/3/03 7:03:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> Scripture time:<br>

Isaiah 14:12<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. <br>

Matthew 4:1<br>
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. <br>
<br>
Luke 4:1<br>
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: And in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. <br>

Genesis 3:1<br>
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. <br>

Job 1:6<br>
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath [is] in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. <br>

Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. <br>

Revelation 20:1<br>
And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection. Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. <br>

This has been hashed out by a million philosophists, theologists, and nutty sci fi writers.  The only way &quot;destiny&quot; could be avoided in such a situation would be for the omniscient or prescient being to let you know what you would do.  This is why, according to Christians, one of the primary objectives of Satan is to prove Biblical predictions and such false, for this would prove God wrong and thus not only fallible but also not all knowing.  This is the most common and easily palatable explanation of the matter, and no, I didn't get it all from Minority Report, although it does serve as a decent example.<br>
<br>
As for the whole &quot;rock so big he can't pick it up&quot; thing... pure sophistry.  If you're going to claim that omnipotence or omniscience are logical impossibilities anyway, why even go on to justify yourself with a paradox?  Either you believe that a Biblical God (omniscience, omnipotent, infallible, etc.) exists or you don't.  Like all the rest of it, it has to do with faith.  Philosophical arguments about the existence or non-existence of God always end up depending upon faith or lack of it, it's impossible to get around.  There's several theories for both positions, none of them convincing unless you already believe in their conclusion.  If you want to see them, go take an intro to philosophy course or buy a book about it.<br>
<br>
As for the Bible as evolved mistranslation, I would suggest putting away the Latin and looking at the original Hebrew and Greek.  I personally mistrust any Bible scholar who isn't firmly grounded in both, and is able to read the original text.  As for your Milton writing the Bible claim, my first impulse is of course that it's incorrect, but not having studied the original texts I would not be able to make an informed judgement on the matter.  If I get ambitious enough I may write to a couple people who do read Greek and Hebrew as well as study the Bible and see what they say, but don't hold your breath.  I feel laziness sweeping over me already.<br>
<br>
I don't really expect any arguments here to convince anyone ayway, after all =)  At least not on this topic.<br>

PS- On a side note, I looked up the verses you posted Hayzen. The first one in particular does show much to prove God as unknowing. He was simply asking near rhetorical questions to Eve. He knew the sin she had committed, He simply wanted her to confess. As with the last one, from what I read of the whole passage (not just the one verse) God already knew the outcome, yet he wanted only a confession of man. Not sure on your second verse as I didn't see anything relating to God not being all knowing (possibly I looked up the wrong verse, I am tired sorry =x). <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20548">Kijiro</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->RETIRED -4- LIFE</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

God's omniscience is not gravity.  There is no comparison one can make.  Time works differently from any other phenomena.  We are trapped in it.  God, as defined by Christianity, is not.  How can you controvert the empirical evidence of free will?  Is it not obvious that you can choose to type &quot;a&quot; just as easily as &quot;b&quot;, or do anything else?  Of course, God, who exists in the next second just as he did (does) while I was typing those letters, knew (knows) what I was going to type, but that did not change my ability to type one thing or another.  I guess I've just made my peace with the idea.  If you haven't, that's fine, but don't expect arguments based on the incompatibility of free will with God's omniscience to dissuade many people of God's existence.<br>
<br>
Second - What is a square circle anyway but a construct of language which we humans have devised?  How could this puny thing possibly limit an all powerful and all knowing God?  These are constructs devised by men to test God.  God does not submit to tests; he has no need to.  He knows his own abilities.  Humans accept them on faith or not at all; that is the way He prefers it.  One who will only accept something when it is proven incontrovertibly, scientifically, is of no use to Him.<br>
<br>
Third - When God called to Adam asking &quot;Where are you?&quot;, he was not asking due to a lack of knowledge, but rather in order to make Adam acutely aware of his own situation, i.e. that he was in hiding.  There had never before been a need to hide - why would he?  Even in this case, hiding was pointless, since God is in fact omniscient.  The question demonstrated, however, in an extremely clever way, the full extent to which Adam had fallen.  It was not a question asked in order to glean information, but rather as an illustrative device.<br>
<br>
As for the Tower of Babel line, again, it just depends on your interpretation.  Just as you could easily say, &quot;Nope, you're wrong, He didn't know where Adam was.&quot; to me above, you can point to this and say &quot;Aha!  God needed to see the tower for himself, so He &quot;came down&quot;, says the NIV.&quot;  It seems more of a rhetorical device to me, demonstrating that He was paying particular attention to the building of the Tower, confirmed by His spoken thoughts on the matter in the next verse (why would God talk to himself?  It's obviously just elucidation for our benefit).<br>
<br>
In your last passage, God is talking to Abraham.  Similar to the second in that He is communicating with man, he must make Himself understood in terms we can easily follow.  Speaking in the future tense of something that He will &quot;go down and see&quot; does not indicate lack of knowledge, but rather reassurance that He will grant particular attention to this matter as Abraham requests.<br>
<br>
Kij - send him an email, ask him for a little help.  A little expert exegesis here wouldn't hurt at all, since you and I are obviously not up to the task of refuting Arleanna, and I think it would be difficult to find exactly what we need in an online paper or journal. <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

Funny because it's one of the passages in the old testament that's told quite differently in another book.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Samuel 24:1<br>

The old Hebrew only has &quot;an adversary&quot; not Adversary, indicating the angel Satan. King James writes it as:<br>
And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.<br>
<br>
Where as the literal translation from Latin is:<br>
And there standeth up an adversary against Israel, and persuadeth David to number Israel<br>
<br>
The latin text doesn't mention The Adversary in the (or The Accuser) in the same way as it does in Job. This leads some people to believe that &quot;an adversary&quot; refers to someone in chronical 20. But as you mentioned later in Samuel it says more clearly that it is the Lord. So, even if they are talking abou the angel Satan he is only there to do the lords bidding, as he does in Job. This is not too hard to believe that God is the source of &quot;Evil&quot; in the bible since she never says to be free of evil, only sin. Whatever. <br>
<br>
I have conceded that the evil figure in the New Testament which is later translated to Satan, Lucifer, Devil is definately there. But that is New Testament and is even looser in it's translation. The only mention I have found of actualy name callng is the latin Diablo, which is of course, devil. As in The devil temped Jesus in the dessert. But all other translations are Adversary or Accuser. Does any of this matter? Well, kinda, if you want to get things right, there is no mention of the angel Satan falling from grace after a battle in heaven. This is all Milton, Vondal (sp?) and later Dante. It's great literature, but has nothing to do with the Bible thumping. If anything these mis translations and free wheeling with the text make for huge misunderstandings and divides in the denominations. How did the name of Lucifer, Latin for light bearer, venus, and the morning star, which is the name Jesus refers to himself at least twice, become synonmous with &quot;the devil&quot;?<br>
<br>
Anyway, great discussion so far. Now for my favorite bible quote, even if it is a bit mistranslated, haha:<br>
<br>
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? (Ga 4:16) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arleanna>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WERE YOU NOT<br>ENTERTAINED?!</span><br>  Posts: 1056<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/3/03 8:29:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/Sphynx5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creationism, Evolutionism, and Faith</span><hr size=1> Um, as a quick example of denomination splits due to misinterpretation take the Mormoms. Now I don't know a ton about mormonism but I do know that they are big time Lucifer haters, he is mentioned very promenantly and often. The reason? When Smith translated the golden tablets (um, yeah golden tablets... right) from Hebrew to the book of Mormom he wrote the story about Lucifer and emblished a lot. The only problem is he didn't know Hebrew so was in fact reading from the King James bible and took the &quot;O Lucifer&quot; wording, which was added to KJ as a mistake, right out of it! Haha, oops!<br>
<br>
So now we have a whole religion that is even more intolerant of this made up angel, Lucifer, than regular Xians. Crazy.<br>
<br>
Note: I have never read the book of mormom, this is just how I understand it from my mormom friends. Weirdos, all of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=389.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=389.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=389.topic&start=61&stop=75>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=389.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=389.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=389.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=389.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=389.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=389.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
