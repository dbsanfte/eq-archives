<br>
Just like Isreal never learns that abusing resistors only strengthens their resolve and increases violence, the US doesn't learn that the way Bush does things only increases anti-Americanism and terrorist activity.<br>
<br>
Just keep using the baseball bat method, arrogant rhetoric and setting up governments in a region where we are not wanted and watch us end up just like Isreal with a never ending cycle of violence.<br>
<br>
Occupying Iraq is about as dumb a move as I have ever seen an administration make. Cornering a guy and putting him in a position with nothing to lose in that area of the world is asking for chaos. And using the reasons we are giving for doing it and ignoring the UN is begging for global consequences that will effect how things are done on this planet for decades to come. <p><br>

<br>
Loegan, I'm not going to rehash the entire Iraq argument again, as this is where this thread is now headed, but I'm forced to say that you really have no grasp of the importance of these violations. &quot;Oh, those missiles don't travel <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> far, let's give Iraq a free pass&quot;. &quot;Oh, these chemical filled drones are easily defended against, so it doesn't matter that they are forbidden to have this particular drone, let's give Iraq a free pass.&quot; If you can't see why people think you're an overly liberal Saddam appologist, you are either very naive or very blind. I don't view you as such a person, but you really are stretching things with this logic of yours.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, what say you about the cluster bombs, Loegan?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, this drone is now said to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>larger</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than the one Powell mentioned in February. That one was said to have traveled 500km, and this one could have greater capabilities. Drones have the same 150km limit that missiles have, Loegan. Your argument about the missiles was it only went just a few feet further than it was supposed to. This one may go 350km further than allowed, that's more than enough to reach Iraq's neighbors and spray chemicals on troops, civilians and other targets, so your argument that it's &quot;no big violation&quot; doesn't hold here. If it travels low enough, it can go undetected by radar. There's a reason there were such strict limits placed on these drones.<br>
<br>
Explain again how this is &quot;more hype over nothing&quot;. And please do some research before you reply, and don't rely on someone on television saying that there's no way that an attack by a drone could be successful. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 3/10/03 9:50:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

<br>
It would be self defense in this case. FFS he has an invading army on his borders who has clearly stated that they have every intention of invading and occupying his country. WTF would you do? Sit and wait idly by for the hammer to fall? I am damn sure the US wouldn't play it that way, but we expect him to just give up. <br>
<br>
This crisis situation was created by us. We are making all the threats, we are making all the hostile moves. You can use missiles that go 19 miles over a limit or drone planes as justification, but it doesn't change the fact that WE are the agressor in this particular situation. Are you going to sit there and tell me that if Suddam attacks us today that it is not self defense? Whether you like him or not, whether you believe he should be removed or not, the fact is that WE are the agressors and that means that we are open to all the repercussions that can result from that.<br>
<br>
So yes, if he attacked our soldiers and invaded Kuwait, it would be 100% Bush fault. Suddam was no threat to us until we moved on him. Now he will do what he has to to defend his country, just like we would. And don't give me this BS about we wouldn't have been in this situation because we would have complied with the UN, because it is clear we have -0- respect for the UN, yet we expect Saddam to.<br>
<br>
We talk the talk, but we don't walk the walk when we say what other countries should do. We say we have the right to invade Iraq because they didn't follow a UN resolution, yet if the UN vetos us we have stated we will invade Iraq anyway. Funny how it all depends on who it is whether the UN's will should be followed or not.<br>
<br>
I'll say it again - I have no love for Saddam, but I also know BS when I smell it, and we are shoveling it by the truckload on this one.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW speaking of free passes - How many UN resolution has Isreal violated? Do you even know how they got their nukes? Seems they get alot of free passes. <p><br>

Excuse me, but do we border Iraq?<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
Do we have territory next to Iraqi borders?<br>
<br>
No<br>
<br>
Do we have a huge number of troops (over 200k) on his borders?<br>
<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
Have we voiced any intention of attacking or invading Iraq?<br>
<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
Have we already bombed many targets within Iraqi borders?<br>
<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
Has Iraq attacked us or our allies in 12 years?<br>
<br>
no<br>
<br>
Again, have we attacked Iraq in the past, up to and including the past few days?<br>
<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe you shouldn't take yourself seriously.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh - One last point. Are we in Iraq at the request of a country who has been attacked and wants aid in defending themselves such as was the case with Kuwait in '91?<br>
<br>
no<br>

Whether or not we are justified in being the agressor is another argument, but by definition, any action Saddam takes at this point is certainly self defense in the face of an self declared invader on his borders. <p><br>
