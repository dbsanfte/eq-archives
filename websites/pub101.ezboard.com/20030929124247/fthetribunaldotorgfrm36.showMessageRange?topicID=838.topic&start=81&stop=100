<br>
And now the Loving Caring Great American Eagle/Saviour has gracefully swooped to their aid, killing more people in one month than Sadaam did in 20 years and guess what?  THEY WANT AMERICA TO LEAVE.  The majority does, they stand in awe at the bodies of their people and say GET OUT.<br>

That is simply an idiotic statement. Why do you exagerate the number of civillian casualties caused by Americans but casually cut out thousands and thousands and thousands caused by Saddam? What is your motive here, if it's not you simply desperately trying to defend your position? Catch the various human rights groups' reports. I don't think they buy much into American propaganda, but if you think they do, check French, German and Russian reports.<br>

I say the majority say PLEASE STAY. Give me a source, Enzo. I'll give mine. All extensive reports and polls I've seen say that the MAJORITY want AMERICANS TO STAY. What's your source to say that the MAJORITY WANT AMERICANS OUT RIGHT NOW?

question on whether you've ever even SPOKE TO PEOPLE FROM IRAQ and if you were able to form or alter your opinions based on that personal experience gained from personal knowledge.<br>
<br>
My sources follow. Question the accuracy if you wish, but I at least can provide evidence to back up my claim that the majority do not want us to 'get out' now.<br>

The Guardian:<br>
<br>
Most Iraqis want troops to stay, says poll<br>
<br>
Michael Howard, Baghdad<br>
Thursday July 17, 2003<br>
The Guardian<br>
<br>
A majority of Baghdad residents(798 respondents) feel US and British troops should stay in Iraq for at least a year, according to the first attempt at an opinion poll.<br>
<br>
The You.Gov poll results were released as news emerged that a ground-to-air missile was fired at a US military plane near Baghdad airport.<br>
<br>
The poll said 31% wanted troops to stay &quot;a few years&quot;, while 25% said &quot;about a year.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only 13% said they should leave now, while 20% said they should go &quot;within 12 months&quot;.<br>
<br>
The survey also found that half thought the US-led coalition was right to invade. <br>

Hey look, an amazing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>9%</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> said they prefer Saddam over the infidel Americans!<br>

Again, question the accuracy of those polls if you wish, but I highly doubt that that 9% would suddenly shift to the large number that you believe to be truth unless Saddam himself were the one asking the questions. <br>

What the fuck?  Are you blaming your own ignorance on a vast government conspiracy to make sure you don't open a book and read about Russian literature or history?  My high school days were at the tail end of the Cold War, but our textbooks (which were running at the tail end of an edition, so dated four or five years) had plenty to say about the millions of Russians that died on the Eastern Front while the other Allies were fighting at the South and the West.  Not to mention, there's this thing called the LIBRARY, inside which some students go to research projects that they have to do.  I know pot's fun and all, but sometimes people do productive stuff in high school.<br>

<br>
There was at least one major revolt that was quelched, as well as several minor movements, that occured during that time.  Since there was no U.S. occupation, hippies didn't get to hear about it because it wasn't on every news station, every day, for months as new developments arise.  But then again, see response above and consider the small amount of high school students that pick up a newspaper now and then.<br>

<br>
Break it down for ya, Most Iraqi's(50%) felt it was right for the Coalition to get rid of Sadaam, yet most (47%) felt they did this to secure oil reserves and more(41%) felt they did this to help Israel.  Only 23% felt they did this to relieve them of Sadaam and, (of course), only 6% believed the wmd story.<br>
<br>
9% preferr Sadaam, but only 29% prefer Americans and the majority(47%) don't care, (my guess wanna be let alone).<br>
<br>
The majority want an American/British style democracy, but it's a slim majority(32%) where 20% want Islamic rule still and 26% don't care.<br>
<br>
Not a great poll, 768 people, but it seems an ok sample.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Large, there simply was no mention of Russia in our history books, though granted they were light on WWII and very strong on Civil war stuff etc.  I would have graduated in 1983 if I didn't join the Navy, so there's a time line.  It was at the height of the cold war and we were systematically trained to hate Russians on every front.  Even a nod to Russia from a history teacher would have gotten him called a pinko and probably yelled at by the soccer moms.  Almost all my training in the Navy was geared with killing Russian's in mind.<br>

<br>
And? Your arguments were that they don't want us there and that the majority of the country wanted Saddam Hussein. Both those arguments are disputed in the poll. That they think we did it for oil and for Israel strengthens my argument that they wanted Saddam gone. Even with our 'true motives', over 50% still think that what we did was in their best interest. They've considered the biggest benefit of what we've done while at the same time accepting that it was us who did it.<br>

Sunni is it? and the Baathist party - both of whom got preferential treatment).<br>
<br>
I will agree that the US does not mention his good works. He had the largest literacy program in history. He is the sole reason that Iraq was modern and westernized. He did keep order among the warring factions and he did not gas the Kurds except during times of revolt to defend his government from overthrow.<br>
<br>
But all that being said, he was a brutal dictator who allowed his son (who most likely was insane) to kill people for no reason other than his own pleasure. He did torture and kill those who spoke against him and often tortured and killed their families as well.<br>
<br>
There are only two ways to rule people. Either through respect (be it respect of the government, the leader himself, the cause they are involved in, the country, the benefits they are getting or whatever) or fear. One can rule a country by fear if he has a brutal core of troops around him who will crush anyone who opposes them and Saddam did have this core.<br>
<br>
Enzo - think about it... Saddam never slept in the same bed for two nights in a row. If the people were following him willingly, why would he have to have so many palaces and remain on the move for all these years?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, there were and are far worse dictators than Saddam and the US did make him out to be worse than what he was. But to believe that he ruled with the support of his people is very misguided. He ruled through fear.<br>
<br>
EDIT<br>

Do you know how he started off his 35 year reign? The first act he did after coming to power was walk into the council chambers and fire a bullet in the head of those government officials he didn't trust. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A> at: 8/24/03 1:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enzoblueksies>Enzo Blueksies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 465<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/24/03 7:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> So he ruled like a Mafia Don ?

This is starting to make sense then, although it still must have been a good living so long as you stayed out of his way.  Like America where people stop caring about whose in government and just take care of their own.<br>
<br>
You know Russia is now ran by the Mafia?  I heard is was all good and getting capatalistic, then I learned 80% of all businesses are paying off a don somewhere.  Man, the saw that opportunity coming.  How do you putsch against a Mafia?  The More I learn, the more the world sucks.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
The reason I hold out so long guys is I still have faith in humanity. I don't WANT to believe this crap.

Considering the state of the world, and history in general, I find it very difficult to believe that anyone can really think that People are, in general, Innately Good.  It makes for great warm fuzzies, but it just doesn't bear up under any sort of investigation.

Pretty much, though he only had to suspect you of saying anything against him to sign your death warrant. He had a group (not the Republican guard... begins with an F, but the name escapes atm) that was something like the USSRs KGB was. They were constantly looking for traitors and would &quot;disappear&quot; you at the drop of a hat. People were so frightened that even weeks after Saddam had left, they still would not say anything to reporters for fear of his return.<br>
<br>
You've read my posts through this whole Iraqi conflict, so you know I am not one to exaggerate the evils of Saddam, but this is one area where his reputation is well deserved.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That and they were making a profit too I imagine.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Maybe his tribe and the Baathists, but at the end of his reign, those were the only people well off. Surprisingly enough he started out being very generous to his people. He made sure they were all educated and he built the modern infrastructure of a westernized country. His goal was to build up Iraq and eventually the whole Arab world into a strong, modern force to attain a place of respect in the world. He shared the wealth with all the people (except the Kurds of course who are not really Iraqis) in the beginning. Unfortunately the Iran war changed all that and then we put the nails in the Iraqi coffin with our sanctions that started in 91. Once the Iran war started, he acted much like NK's KJI in that he diverted most of the funds to the military and eventually into his own private accounts.<br>

That was easier said than done if you can believe the stories. For example, it seems his son Uday, would grab women off the street if they happened to spark his lust and then he would rape them in front of their husbands. Sometimes he would kill the husband for protesting. Sometimes he would even kill the woman and feed her to his animals. This guy was one fucked up unit from what I have read.<br>
<br>
I don't know if our efforts will make them any better off on the whole... in fact the numbers who suffer may actually be more if the country falls into the chaos that Saddam kept in check with his iron fist. But make no mistake - Saddam caused a chaos all his own and even though the numbers effected may have been lower than they would have been without his control, the fate of those who were unfortunate enough to be included in that number was pretty much as bad as it gets imo.<br>
<br>
EDIT<br>
<br>
One more Uday story - seems he was left with a limp after an attempt on his life and became very self conscious about it. His answer to this problem was to have his friends legs broken, so they would have a limp like he did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Not really much to add, personally, except to agree with Loegan's assessment of Iraq's history under Saddam pretty uniformly.  Hopefully, the country with some of the oldest history in the world can return to some semblance of civilization and maybe (gasp!) become a First World country unlike many of its geographical neighbors and religious brethren. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naeamian>Naeamian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 978<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/25/03 3:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>become a First World country unlike many of its geographical neighbors and religious brethren. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Your last post had zero input and was made soley to cut me down.  That's not what this board is for.<br>
<br>
It did not take 1 post, I felt it coming a few posts back but held out.  For me, it's what being a man is.  Stand by your convictions so long as they prove true, have the wisdom to know when they're not true.<br>
<br>
It also serves another purpose.  Everyone here that posted now know more.  Even if they new all the facts beforehand, they now know that there are reasonable people in the opposing viewpoints.  Not all their 'enemies' are mindless drones that stick to what their dad's taught them, (Yes my dad was a flower child, now lives as a hermit in Alabama last I heard).  This shores up their faith in humanity too, I like to think, and goes a good way toward making life better.<br>
<br>
What I could have done, if I were a lesser man, would be to stick to my original convictions and bury this conversation in google searched rhetoric until they grew bored and threw up their hands and left, being defeated but only by pretzel logic and insomnia.  I'm above that though, as it only breeds mediocraty and doubt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/25/03 6:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=97>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Glad you're &quot;above it all&quot;.
