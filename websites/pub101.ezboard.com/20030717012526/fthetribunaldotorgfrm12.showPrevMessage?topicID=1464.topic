Tonight, while I was outside wth my dog, I went to check on the bowl of antifreeze I leave on a bird feeder for the squirrels. Now just hold onto that &quot;awwww...&quot; you were about to sigh, before you get all gushy on me you have to remember that squirrels are a huge menace here and really they're just rats with a bushy tail and a better PR firm.<br>
<br>
Anyway, a couple yards away from The Bowl of Green Liquid Death was a poor dying cat. One of the ugly grey ones that lives on the farm next door, I think. Little bastard was a great squirrel killer. I've seen him bring down a squirrel the size of a 79 pinto. I bet they are all high fiving with their little rat paws. I started to blame myself for his death until I remembered that he has a nasty habit of crapping in my Jeep when I don't put it in the garage. So now I think it was karma. I was going to leave him on my neighbor's porch with a &quot;Merry Xmas&quot; note tied to him but the farm house is like a hundred yards away. That's way too much energy just for a joke. So I'll bury him somewhere in the backyard tomorrow, somewhere the squirrels can dance on him with their little rat feet. Or should I throw him in the trash? What do you usualy do with a dead feral cat?<br>
<br>
I feel bad the little squirrel killing machine is dead, of course; now I'll have to step up my efforts to rid my property of the tree dwelling rodents. Maybe two bowls of antifreeze? But I am glad my Jeep will no longer smell like cat piss.<br>
<br>
Anyone else ever made baby Jesus cry during the holidays? Tell me your most fucked up Christ-mas story. I promise I won't make fun of you. Unless your story sucks.<br>

<br>
The problem is that the cat isnt social.<br>
<br>
He just comes over to my house, back and front yard... and when we open the door to go out, or walk around our yard the cat just takes off.<br>
<br>
He doesnt come over to say hello, he just peels off.<br>
<br>
I actually thought of leaving some anti-freeze out at first because he was pissing me off.  If the fucking thing is going to camp mice and birds in my lawn he can come over and say hello once in a while.<br>
<br>
But after a while he grew on me.  I am a cat person. so now.<br>
<br>
I walk well around the cat in my lawn now.  As to not disturb him.  <br>
<br>
I think he is happy with me , that I am now learning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fazzaryaayrazzaf>Fazzarya Ayrazzaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/02 8:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I made baby Jesus cry on Xmas eve</span><hr size=1> I grew up in Montana, and one Christmas eve a rancher decided he would suprise his kids by putting &quot;santa&quot; tracks on the roof of his house for the kids to find the next day. So while he was up there he made some noise and one of his ranch hands was awakened by the noise. That area of Montana was having a problem at the particular time with a group if crow reservation indians(think it was crow I could be wrong) breaking into people's houses and stealing firearms. So the ranchhand got scared and shot the man with a .270 rifle and he was dead before he hit the ground.

This girl I was living with had this annoying little yorkie that my shephard could fit in his mouth with ease.  The little fucker was old and senile.  Anyway, I came home drunk one night and let both dogs out.  The little bastard wouldn't listen to me and he took off running.  I said 'fuck it' and went back inside with my dog.  A few minutes later my girlfriend asked where her dog was.  I remembered what I had done and got up to go call for him ( usually he would run away, but come back shortly when he wanted back in. )  So we started calling for him but he wasn't coming.  We called and called, back yard, front yard, you name it.  I sent my dog to go get him .. no luck.  Finally she started freaking out, got a flashlight, and went looking ( I went and got a cold beer. )<br>
<br>
Suddenly I hear loud cries from out in the street in front of the house.  She comes back with a bloody mut in her hands and gives it to me to check.  &quot;Yup, he's dead alright&quot; I said while my shirt got soaked with blood and my dog stood there trying to lick it.  After some loud crying and a final calming period, I told her I would take him to this park and bury him in a special spot where he wouldn't get dug up ( it was midnight or so, there was no place open to take him. )<br>
<br>
So my dog and I got in the car with the freshly slain yorkie, and we drove about 4 miles to this dumpster I knew of, and that was that.<br>
<br>
She kept asking why I was only gone for like 10 minutes if I buried him in the park .......... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ladmovonwallace>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Poop... it's what's for dinner.</span><br>  Posts: 2298<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/02 9:59 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I made baby Jesus cry on Xmas eve</span><hr size=1> now thats a cool x-mass story  <p>retired poo slinger</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hodur>Hodur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/24/02 2:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I made baby Jesus cry on Xmas eve</span><hr size=1> I just have this stroy to share..<br>
