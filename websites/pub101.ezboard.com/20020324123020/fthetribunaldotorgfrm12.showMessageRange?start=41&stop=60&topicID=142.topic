<br>
They had opened up for people to sue, if the mother had NOT been informed that she had the option of abortion, when they discovered that the fetus had some kinda problem. The way they presented it (CNN online I think) was that the KID could sue because he hadn't been aborted. Obviously, the parents sued on the child's behalf, but that was the way it was angled: that the kid was now living a sub-par life, and it was the government, or the hospital's fault. <br>

<br>
Dumn nut it wasnt because she didnt want it with me it was because she was to scared to tell her parents. You DONT know the &quot;hard fucking truth&quot;. Yeah im a fucking nut who was upset to see his fucking kid killed. When I have sex I know the risk and im willing to take it.<br>
<br>
It was my own fault for posting rl shit like that in here. I have no idea why I posted it in the first place..seeing there is no edit I cant fix it. So, just leave my post alone and drive through.<br>

Before I argue this, lets give morality a definition however, so this doesnt get all mixed up.  Morality simply put is nothing more than obedience of customs, or the traditional way of behaving.  Now to analyze how this fits with abortion:<br>
Abortions are a relatively new concept, they havent been &quot;mainstream&quot; till the late 1900's.  Our culture right now is controlled by the media, TV, movies and music define language, behavior, and yes, beliefs...  One example for this is drugs, most children are &quot;brainwashed&quot; into believing drugs are bad while in school. This is done through comic books, cartoon idols telling them not to, comercials with kids avoiding peer pressure, etc... you've all seen this at some time I'm sure.  However, very little of this so called &quot;education&quot; actually teaches you about the drugs, just some of the problems addicts have/had.  This sort of education doesnt approach teaching whether its right or wrong, just what the government wants you to do, therefore legislating morality.<br>
Now, this easily ties into my arguements on abortion.  I am strongly pro-life.  If a woman chooses to have an abortion from a relationship, its because she was too irresponsible to deal with the consequences of her bedroom activities, and she shouldnt be allowed to take a life (even a future life if you want to argue whether they are alive or not) to alleviate her of responsibility for her actions.  This argument fits in with most circumstances of abortion, if not all.  Rape is the big stretch for this one, however the same philosophy applies here.  Using the legislated morality, we can look on TV and see violence easy, hear it in the music, and hear about it in the news.  Some of this seems to be advocating this, and others firmly against it.  This puts the ideal of Rape into our culture, and depending on your influences, you will have a moral stance with backing for it, however weak it is.  As long as our culture can in any way advocate rape, it is our responsibility to deal with it and its outcomes.  When we decide to legislate morality against rape, then we can take a different stance on the responsibility we have.<br>
<br>
So, in an easy summary, having sex and becoming impregnated implies a responsibilty upon yourself that is wrong to allieviat by destroying life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uguddyearplaysureblimp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guddyear Playsureblimp</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/saltire.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Good Times</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/01 9:33:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortions: can't live with them, can't live with--uh han</span><hr size=1> There is also a responsibilty that they do not overpopulate the planet and drain yet more of it's resources.<br>
<br>
So effectively what you would have happen is a world with millions more unhappy children living in poverty without a chance of an education because of a sensation of guilt you feel when someone decides what is in fact life and what isnt.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah while we are on the subject of life. You consider that a live, concious, non human animal is less alive than an undeveloped foetus with barely any semblance of a nervous system? Isn't that more than a little arrogant? Fact is you dont accept that one of the consequences of having sex is abortion. Y'see what you don't realise is that noone makes the choice easily, if they do then I guaruntee that they were not fit to be a parent.<br>
<br>
Abortion is the cure to overpopulation caused by promiscuity. We could of course prevent it by not having sex till we are financially and emotionally equipped, you cannot legislate that.<br>
<br>
Without choice available the ghettos and shanty towns would only become larger and I would be paying for it.

So you would have me mutilate myself, you first! I am lazy? Really, well let's look at the facts here shall we. I said that I was glad that there are people out there that have the choice to abort because it was FINANCIALLY better for me, not that I couldnt be bothered to look after my child.<br>
<br>
As for it being murder or killing, first of all please define how this is murder? This is preventing from someone producing an UNWANTED child. At what point is contraception murder? Do we have to store all the sperm we waste daily when we beat off because all of those COULD be someones children? MILDRED! GET THE SPERM JUG PLEASE IM BEATING OFF!!!!<br>
<br>
I already pay for my child to make sure she has a good education is well clothed and fed. Noone else does. So no I am not lazy but you make several assumptions fucknugget,  the fact remains you are suddenly realising that you are wrong, you dont have all the facts and your arguements are as good as 4 week old milk that has been sitting on the radiator.<br>
<br>
Tell me, do you have children? Do you get any kind of government support for them? Do you have any concept of how hard bringing up children with little or no money is?<br>

I see you questioning some of my descriptions, but no more. You try to prove your responsiblity by saying that you yourself pays for your childs upbringing, but this is bs... who went to college to teach your child, who makes his clothing, who grows the food you buy to sell him, was this all you too? are you that commited to your child? If you were, you would be a good, completely self-reliant parent... but you arent... you have to rely on a society to help raise your kid, and even worse, you love them so much, that you think that in some other circumstance, you should be able to have prevented her life (not even going to call it murder). Quit this nitpicking bs too, its old.  sperm alone obviously doesnt make a child, nor will an egg, once they conceive, then you have a seperate lifeform growing, it may be inside the female, but it isnt her... Now Im going to ask you a question, how do you earn the freedom of choice?  What responsibilty must you uphold to be able to take away the future of a conceived life form?<br>
<br>
I guess I will waste more time to address this one:<br>
&quot;Tell me, do you have children? Do you get any kind of government support for them? Do you have any concept of how hard bringing up children with little or no money is?&quot;<br>

<br>
Since you state that life begins at the moment of conception, what about the fact that the preponderence of fertilized eggs fail to implant in the uterine wall?  Are they &quot;abortions&quot;?  Did your god give them a soul at conception only so they could be whisked off to purgatory without a chance to be saved?<br>
<br>
And what about birth control (i.e. &quot;the pill&quot;) that works by preventing implantation in the uterine wall?  By your definition of &quot;life&quot; all women on the pill are murderers.  <br>
<br>
And what about RU 486?  Murder?  It does keep the fertilized egg from implanting...<br>
<br>

I dont see that as being a concsious individual I see it as a collection of relatively undifferentiated cells. My responsibility is to the child NOT to any other law or moral ethos and if I dont have the means to bring up a child properly, I'll do the right thing and wait.<br>

My parents brought me into the world but I sure as hell dont owe them anything for it.<br>

IF my childhood sucked Id blame them for it.... huh GO FIGURE.... DUH!<br>

I was trying to illustrate the difference between what you consider being 'life'. Fact is in the end you don't really know I do, I have a relatively good idea WHEN a foetus actually becomes Conscious. You clearly have some misrepresented or misinformed view. You do not know what it's like and you dont know what you would do.<br>
<br>
like I said before you blind slack jawed moron is that I ALREADY PAY..... this includes the teachers and the people that make the clothes and the fuckwits that have unwanted children. So don't play the pointless sob story.<br>
<br>
In the end, it's not your choice, it's always with the woman and you need to have the strength of character to support them in whatever they decide.<br>

When did I ever talk about it being conscious?  I just said when it was an individual life form... and I havent seen you presenting your enlightened estimate of when this event takes place...<br>

hmm...if you delete the child, I would have to say that your responsibility is only to yourself, and if you know your not ready, use a condom, dont screw around, whatever, but dont kill the kid<br>

No, you said that you pay for your child and that nobody else does... quit being so thickheaded, society pays with time and effort to raise a child, I also sincerely doubt that you have a child of your own<br>

<br>
There are valid reasons why there should be abortions.<br>
<br>
In my opinion they DO NOT include your typical unplanned pregnancy.  However, making abortion illegal under any circumstance is a mistake, IMO.<br>
<br>
Guddyear, what planet are you from?  Abortion for your typical unplanned pregancy is the BIGGEST reason for abortions these days.  Rape, Incest, Birthdefects, are ALL in the minority.  And as far as it not being a common occurance because it is difficult and traumatic.. well, you have a VERY LARGE group of people (some represented here) who it doens't bother in the slightest.  I have a female friend who has had 7 abortions.  She is 28.  It doesn't bother her, except the procedure is an annoyance.  NONE of these pregnancies was Rape, Incest, or Birthdefect.  Oh, and None of them threatened her life or health in any way. <br>
<br>
I still want to hear your &quot;Estimated Time of Whatever..&quot;  When does a fetus become a human being?  When it has definable arms and legs?  Time to abort all the amputees I guess.  When it can think and process information?  Damn, kill all the babies under a few months old or so.  When do you think it's okay?  If you're gonna argue, argue, but don't fart and call it insight, okay?<br>
<br>
Pregnancy is not that big a deal any more, because there is an easy alternative.  I feel sick for the women for whom this IS a difficult and traumatic experience, because there are women for whom this is nothing more than a quick visit to the doctor.  I feel sick for the men for whom this is a tragic thing, because of the men who think since they aren't the one's having it done, it's a convenience to them.<br>
<br>
I'm not pro-life or pro-choice, I'm pro-sense.  Use your brain.  Abortion sucks, but it is necessary at times.  <br>
<br>
Karthunk, I had a similar thing happen to me... I think the life of a man's unborn child being taken totally without his consent is sickening.  If she consented to have sex with me, and got pregnant, then she consented to the possibility of getting pregnant.  MY unborn child, MY rights.  I feel for the woman not wanting to carry a child for nine months, I really do, but not to the extent of taking a man's child away.<br>
<br>
People have to take responsibility for thier actions.  Using abortion as a way to avoid responsibility sickens me.<br>
<br>
Pro-Choice:  As I said there are valid reasons why abortion needs to be an option.  But I think you tend to swing too far in the mindless idiot direction when trying to defend your stand.<br>
<br>
Pro-Life:  Leave Jesus out of it, it weakens your stand.  The fucking idiots shooting doctors also tend to make your view a bit shakey.  When to try to completely restrict a person's rights, even when you truly believe it to be in thier best interest, you will gain little besides thier contempt.<br>

I am strongly pro-life. If a woman chooses to have an abortion from a relationship, its because she was too irresponsible to deal with the consequences of her bedroom activities, and she shouldnt be allowed to take a life (even a future life if you want to argue whether they are alive or not) to alleviate her of responsibility for her actions. This argument fits in with most circumstances of abortion, if not all. Rape is the big stretch for this one, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> however the same philosophy applies here.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Using the legislated morality, we can look on TV and see violence easy, hear it in the music, and hear about it in the news. Some of this seems to be advocating this, and others firmly against it. This puts the ideal of Rape into our culture, and depending on your influences, you will have a moral stance with backing for it, however weak it is. As long as our culture can in any way advocate rape, it is our responsibility to deal with it and its outcomes. When we decide to legislate morality against rape, then we can take a different stance on the responsibility we have.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Could I possibly be reading the ignorant, medieval attitude I think I'm reading? Are you actually suggesting that if I, or any other woman, happen to get raped, we all have to deal with a resulting pregnancy because SOCIETY doesn't prevent the attitudes leading to the rape? I'm hoping not, but what else can I assume from this crap? Why don't you just come out and say &quot;She was a loose woman, she wore provocative clothing, she was out alone after dark, she deserved to be raped&quot;? Where the fuck are you from, Afghanistan? Shall I be stoned to death if I take a lover before I'm married, too? <br>
<br>
Buying a clue for you because you're obviously too poor to afford one: Rape is NOT A SEXUAL ACT. It is a sex act (big difference, not that I expect you to understand it), but it is not about violent movies, TV, pornographic magazines, or even strip clubs. It's not about what turns a man on, it's not about what his society says is okay. It's about anger and control, period. It occurs in every society on earth, including the ones in which women are NOT allowed to wear provocative clothing, go ouside alone, or even see a doctor when they're ill, societies in which men are not allowed to watch violent movies or even most movies at all. <br>
<br>
I for one will never agree that a woman should be forced to carry the child of her rapist to term because some numbnuts MAN thinks that society doesn't do enough to discourage attitudes leading to rape. You try being pregnant against your will some time, see how it feels. You will never know the feeling of violation, you can never understand. I hope the Creator brings you back as a woman who is raped and gets pregnant. Then see if you can still have your holier than thou attitude against abortion in cases of rape, until then, stuff it.<br>

If a parent has done his/her job, and has kept this up till the teens, then all the music video games etc. will not change this morality. Now for a sociopath with a real mental problem this won't work, but we aren't overrun by sociopaths.<br>
