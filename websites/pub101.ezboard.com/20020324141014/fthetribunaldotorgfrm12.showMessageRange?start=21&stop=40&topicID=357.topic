I will explain in what I hope will be a short post.<br>
<br>
The person Naeamian refers to in his ill advised post, is me.<br>
  <br>
We once were in the same guild, a mid level guild called Remnants.  <br>
<br>
A large part of that guild left to form another guild called Forsaken Lords (Levels 40 and up- some mid 30's sprinkled in), the reasons we left are not important.  <br>
<br>
The reason Naeamian has gotten his panties into a knot revolves around a post that he read on OUR BOARD and took as a personal attack or flame on him.  I assure you, it had nothing to do with him. Sadly his ego prevents him from understanding or accepting this.<br>
<br>
He started his tiradeby leaving a somewhat rude remark on OUR BOARD and went off to the Remnants board and made an equally rude post in their Hall of Shame continuing his flame.  He has also seen fit to post here in an effort to... I don't know... flame me some more?  Ruin the reputation of a new guild?<br>
<br>
Anyway,  since his comments and posts, his former guild has denounced him, many of his former guild members have distanced themselves from him, his remarks and comments and so on and so forth... it appears he is no longer welcome in Remnants.<br>
<br>
So yes, you have not heard of us, we come from the unknown masses... and I for one, am sorry that I have been &quot;introduced&quot; so to speak,  by this person who does not understand that with every word he spews... he's digging his own hole...<br>

For several reasons the guild split apart. The people that chose to leave voted that Morit should become the guild leader of the new guild. Nae was one of those that chose not to leave but stay.<br>
Anyway, now for some odd reason Nae thinks that anything and everything Morit does or says in connection to do with EQ is aimed at him. He way wide of the mark.<br>
To sum it up as to who these people are :-<br>
Morit - guild leader of Forsaken Lords, nice guy, helpful and adult<br>
Nae - A mere child in serious need of growing up<br>

<br>
and for what its worth tanje, as information goes.. (but of course, every arguemetn is liek this, no?) i think my information on the situation differs just a tid.. but in the effort of giving both sides of the story, here goes:<br>
<br>
hmm.. few months back the guild starts going downhill so morit writes up this big reform thing that basically restructurizes our entire leadership and the way we do things.. its posted  ont eh msg board for about a week.. everyone drops in and makes little comments and such.. nothing major.. then the thread is closed and a officer meeting is set for that friday.. that friday, all of the officers (wait.. i think morit was like 45 minutes late to this thing.. *shrug*) meet and we are discussing the reforms 1 by 1 when morits turn to speak comes up.. rather than continue the discussion he says, and i quote &quot;time to vote&quot; ... half the officers hadnt spoken yet, and t hat was quite frankly some bullshit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
so anyway, the guild leader is like 'meeting is ajourned NOW' before we can vote and he has some words with morit (what they were im not entirely sure) but morit goes off and starts what i believe to be this big ass scheme.. all of the sudden members are flying off left and right, several if not all give reports that various members of what i call the &quot;defectees&quot; were sending them msgs.. not just informing them of the guild, but promising them big and better things to come.. plane raids, dragon raids.. the whole package.. something members of the guild had at the time only dreamt about.. so i stand up and say 'wow thats pretty fucking lame' (i used more words) and then morit goes into denial mode.. but as things went, i was the only person who publically said anything on the matter... so things cool down  for awhile and then the other day morit posts something about a PoH raid his new guild had gone on.. kudos to them, congrats on a successful raid.. but he also throws in a little knock.. &quot;to all the people who said yaddayaddayadda PFFFFFFFFT&quot; ... i was the  only person who said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> publically, so i took major offense to that.. its like he's taking his plane raid and trying to cram it down my throat.. but  no sir, im not going to fucking stand for that.. so i reply.. conversation progresses and morit goes back into this 'peopel dont leave unless they want to' shit.. which is true.. but how did they come about 'wanting to'? were they pressured? were they promised something?  but thast all inconsequential now.. it really does not matter.. what matters to me at this moment, is that i watched morit and a few other people dismantle a perfectly fine guild out of total fucking selfishness and it pisses me off<br>
<br>
tiffa, people left because of me? people left because i stook  up for the guild while  morit pulled his backstabbing shit on them? good fucking riddance then<br>
<br>
and on that note, this is over<br>

<br>
Did he mention your name?  Did he say to all those who spoke out publicly, or just those who had something to say?  Could he have meant people who said things in tells?  I am not seeing him mention you directly.  Sounds like from my very impartial view here at Ladida Drawer Heights, the new apartment complex, that you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> assumed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he meant you and went off the deep end.  Let me break it down...assume = [ass]out of <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> and [me], ya dig? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> conversation progresses and morit goes back into this 'peopel dont leave unless they want to' shit.. which is true.. but how did they come about 'wanting to'? were they pressured? were they promised something?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps people agreed with him? Perhaps they were his friend and wanted to stay with him? (sorry, I am assuming Morit is a guy when I prolly shouldn't but 90% of eqers are men - I am part of the other 10% but that is neither here nor there)  Maybe they didn't like the way things were going with the reform and wanted a new start?  Why just assume (there it is again) that they were pressured??  But if that is the case that is lame.  I hate the &quot;Timmy come to my house cause my Mom doesn't buy generic popsicles like Kevin's mom does&quot; defense.<br>

Let go of your EGO little man... it's consuming you!  I don't know what sort of &quot;I'm so macho&quot; trip you're on that makes you think you were the only one &quot;who stood up to Morit&quot; as you put it... there were a few others who sent me tells in game and did what you decided to do publicly, face to face.  <br>
<br>
As for dismantling a perfectly fine guild (a guild which by the way wants nothing to do with you and has disowned you after this little fiasco) you can believe what you want, it's obvious you can't let go.  <br>
<br>
So if you want to show your ass and show these people what a brave and oh so noble person you are... I think you've failed miserably.  After reading through this thread, I think you should rename the thread &quot;Naeamian&quot; since most of the flames are directed in your direction.  Though you'll probably deny that as well, given your skewed perspective on things...  <br>
<br>
And again... let me try to get this though your skull one LAST time... The post had nothing to do with you.  Try to get that through your head and I promise... you will see the light.  Doesn't the fact that Remnants has disowned you tell you anything?  Aren't any warning bells going off in your head by now? Give it a rest dude...<br>

<br>
What Naeamian fails to mention in his post is that the reason the subject of &quot;reform&quot; was even brought up was because there were many unhappy people in Remnants (most of which are now in Forsaken Lords) who wanted some change to take place in the guild.  These people, unless change were enacted, were planning on leaving anyway... after the meeting Naeamian refers to went to shit, alot of those people decided that perhaps the time to leave was upon us.  I and a few others were resigned to quit, and perhaps look for a new guild where we could remain together.  But when we were contacted by several more people that also wanted the change but wanted to remain together, the idea for a new guild was hatched.  A vote was taken, and I was asked to be the leader.  And it took off from there.  And while we did let others know that a new guild was being formed and that they were always welcome should they decide to join (Naeamian among them - what a goof that almost was!) we did not promise anyone anything except for a fresh start.<br>
