<br>
This thread began with a question regarding FCFS on the Tribunal. Well here's the facts:<br>
<br>
-- Eienye was there and assisted with the killing of Naggy. That pretty much makes her about as early as possible unless someone has some new gimp way of camping rage before killing Naggy.<br>
<br>
-- Eienye was the one who won the roll when a random was called for.<br>
<br>
-- Eienye was the one who turned in her pearl first when a GM over-ruled the random and declared it a turn in race.<br>
<br>
-- Eienye was the one who's guild, with help, brought down Ragefire.<br>
<br>
What the hell more do you want from her? If she had soloed Rage would this make you happier?  I say congratulate her for getting her epic and then STFU!<br>
<br>
Were members of Legendary dissaponted because they spent a lot of time waiting for this spawn?<br>
<br>
I imagine so.<br>
<br>
Were other people who were in the zone that got trained repeatedly by Legendary while Legendary waited for spawn upset?<br>
<br>
I know they were.<br>

<br>
If there is a Cleric sitting there camping Ragefire, how does anyone else know he's up? I would assume if you wanted RF you'd do a camp check just like anything else at the zone, and if someone answered you'd go about your merry way, just like any other camp.<br>
<br>
It's not in an easy to get to place, so how does one see if RF is up without actually being there? Understanding someone could track it obviously, but if there is someone camping it, what business do you have tracking for it and calling anyone to begin with if he is up?<br>
<br>
Only other option I see is if 2 clerics go down there at different times and both camp out there, and end up both seeing him up at the same time, but this seems most of the time to not be the case. It's always this petty shit of KNOWING someone is camping it and still trying to assemble your force faster with the sole intent to fuck over someone else.<br>

Everyone else is sitting there with the cleric or in guilkdchat, or the cleric has phone numbers to wake them up<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;so how does one see if RF is up without actually being there&quot;<br>
<br>
tracking, but if you see him on track, its probably too late<br>

<br>
the clerics that want him will not camp out, they will sit there for hours and hours with no sleep until he pops. Or they will get lucky and wander into an empty lair and see him pop<br>
<br>
&quot;I really don't understand it, anyone explain it please? &quot;<br>
<br>
You want rage, you get there as soon as naggy dies, you have friends, you have some strange games to play while staring at a blank wall for 4-72 hours. Bring booze, food, and fun for your eq friends, and nodoze, endless amounts of sugar, and a good rest the night before for yourself.<br>
<br>
That or get lucky.<br>

I understand that part, what I meant was how does anyone outside of that cleric and his / her guild know....like you said there is the track thing, but if you call out to see if anyone is camping him, you really don't have any business tracking and trying to get people there to run over the cleric anyway. And you're right, chances are if he's on track it's too late anyway.<br>
<br>
So the question still stands. How does anyone outside of the camping cleric and his guild know if he pops? Obviously barring the fact that someone in the guild could just be being a cock and telling everyone.<br>

First, I thought it was rather pathetic that there was only a 53 cleric, a druid and a monk sitting in the room ready to spawn Ragefire.  That seemed to me the most rediculous thing in the world.  It is like if I snared Lodizal and ran him around the zone while waiting for people to port over... it just isnt logical.  <br>
<br>
I mean, they had THREE people in the room... Perkins and the female druid he was cybering in the FG bedroom doesn't count because you can't kill Ragefire typing with one hand.<br>
<br>
This whole whining of training the room is lame, because to them... perhaps more than a 2 mob pull is a train... to us, 15+ mobs is a good practice for exp... and it keeps us awake.  If anyone died, it was Legendary... and at least looting my corpse while waiting for RF gave me something to do.<br>
<br>
If Shining Path had wanted to continue along with their guild's &quot;wonderful reputation&quot; they should have had the mentality to realize that a force of three people can not kill RF.  And if they have to bring in other guilds to help them, that is just sad, because we had the people and the support the whole night.<br>

However, I will state that you thinking that we sat round waiting to wipe rage2 out is extremely offensive.<br>
<br>
We were sat there trying to res our dead after chatja had done the CR as your cleric refused point blank to allow a legendary CR team in to drag the legos that died when SP had their arses handed to them when they spawned the dragon, not a massive amount we could do really, it was either leave solb nekkid and or sit and wait until your cleric had pulled her head out her arse and allowed us to get our corpses back (as it was Chatja turned up with the comps and sorted it, to which I owe them my thanks)<br>

If you haven't realized by now, gimp tactics don't go over too well with people in-game.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udarmuthdaystar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darmuth Daystar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/10/02 4:47:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=601.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weak Ragefire Practice</span><hr size=1> Fact:  Legendary Cleric has helped kill Naggy for 8 Weeks.<br>
Fact:  Legendary Enchanter has helped Kill Naggy for 4 Weeks.<br>
Fact:  Legendary Cleric/Druid/SK/Wiz Camped RF frim the time Naggy was killed NON-Stop.<br>
Fact:  Legendary kept Fire Giants cleared, with the excetion of one time when SP cleric tried to train them on Legendary SK that was FD at RF camp.<br>
Fact:  This camp is OFTEN camped by 3+ guilds at same time using Monks/Clerics/what ever and has never been such a BS agument because someone didn't think they had to share.<br>
Fact:  SP didn't show up until 30+ hours into the spawn time, when the Cleric decided she had &quot;Camp&quot; rights even with a Legendary member still there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now either you belive me or you don't, I don't care, that is the truth.<br>
<br>
I am not here to flame, just to set down the facts.  The camp used to be respectable, Clerics from guilds such as RNG and EH sent tells to not only my-self but to the Legendary Cleric there saying they would not interfer/camp RF because they knew he had been there for 8 weeks and even offered to help.<br>
<br>
3 other guilds that we helped to kill Naggy offered to send groups to aid us with RF.<br>
<br>
This is not directed at all of SP but the actions of 2 members of that guild.  SP is a respectable guild and I have many friends who call SP &quot;home&quot;.<br>
<br>
I am all for competition when your mature about it (Verina Tomb in Neriak comes to mind), but if someone has obviously put alot of time and effort into something you should have the respect not to send tells about how I shouldn't be there becasue you are.  I could post the log but as we all know people would just say I made them up, so I won't waste my/your time with them.<br>

Two-three weeks ago while camping RF, Herbal/and a cleric from Transended were sharing the camp, Trans got RF because we didn't have the forces in position to kill RF.<br>
<br>
If you ask how do I know what was sent in tell to Herbal, it is because I was at his house helping him Camp RF so I know what was sent in /tell to both him and me for the 50+ hours we were there.<br>

This camp isn't about who deserves it, nor about how wonderful the people are nor how long they have camped it.  There are only a couple of relevant factors and they relate to force.<br>
<br>
While you are quite welcome to believe that SP spawned ragefire and would rather him despawn than someone else get him.  I would prefer to believe that they had no intentions of letting him despawn and merely spawned him to end the race which they felt they had won.<br>
<br>
Here are some facts for you.<br>
<br>
FACT: Shining path spawned Ragefire<br>
FACT: Shining path killed Ragefire before he despawned<br>
FACT: Shining path adhered to VI's policies with regard to this camp.<br>
<br>
Whine all you like, second guess all you like.  Nothing negates those facts.<br>
<br>
..now had SP failed and Ragefire despawned then there would certainly be reall ammunition for a flame thread; since they didn't, please quit whining. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>

<br>
Most of us know it isn't the guild as a whole and alot of effort has been put forth by SP members to say they are sorry for the way others acted.<br>
<br>
I have great respect for the guild as does most of my guild, it is just some people do not have any respect for otheres, it is all &quot;Me, Me, Me&quot; and if I can't have it no one will.  If the cleric had not made such a fool of herself and had treated us with respect then I for one would have helped her if needed.<br>
<br>
RF is a highly contested spawn and Clerics know each other, they usally respect each other (at least high end gamers do), in this case all I received was tells about how I should leave because SP was here....ect...<br>
<br>
Again I say SP is not the issue here, it is the conduct of the Cleric involved and one other member.<br>

I can't comment on vague insinuations of improper conduct without more knowledge of the circumstances, but I will tell you that people that I respect like this cleric.  Everyone has bad days and this camp brings out the worst in people sometimes. <br>
<br>
It's much more productive and shows better character to say Gratz SP and move on.<br>
