<br>
Certainly.  Now I can't say that I've met anyone who would tell stories about miracles about someone they were enamoured of, but there are some other problems with this theory.<br>
<br>
If the Bible is full of rampant exaggerations, how could Christianity have risen in the areas where Jesus performed these exaggerated mircales?  I mean if you told me you could raise the dead and came to my house and we talked, and then suddenly 40 people said that you made a monkey fly out of your ass while I was there, I for sure would not believe in your status as a diety, in fact I'd say &quot;I was there, and that's not what happened.&quot;  But there are no recounts of the life of Christ written anywhere near the time of his existance.  But then again, lack of proof does not necessarily equate to lack of argument, so I'll give you that it is possible.<br>
<br>

<br>
Saint Patrick was the one to put Christmas on December 25th.  The reason for this celebration was that he was trying to convert Celtic nations who practiced Paganism, and basically his idea was to come to them during winter Solstise and say &quot;I know you guys are having a party, we have those too, just for different reasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Christmas itself is practiced as more of a Pagan holiday than a Christian one.  The big Christmas Tree is just one indication of that.  It's pretty obvious that Jesus was not born in December, the bible clearly mentions shepherds in the fields, which did not occur until Spring or Fall.  So I agree that the date of Christmas was moved to convert others.<br>
<br>
The difference in this and the issue of the tainted bible theory you propose is simple - it's far easier to change the practices of a religion than the tenets.  I am willing to believe many things about how the Church viewed things, and many things about how the church worships, but I can't believe that the Bible was changed to fit with the views of Mithras.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, Mithraism pradated Christianity.  I granted you that.  But if you are to read the Jewish bible, the miracles and virgin birth are prophecied in Isiah, which was written YEARS before any sort of Mithriasm proof has been shown.  The first statues of him are shown to have surfaced circa 671 BC If I am correct, whereas Isiah and earlier prophets who predicted similar events were at the latest around 750 BC.<br>
<br>
So basically what I'm saying is this - if you are going to argue the Christianity borrowing from Mithriasm thing, I'm going to argue that Mithriasm was entirely a fabrication based on early Jewish texts as a way to bring about new followers of the Pagan faith.  The other big thing to note here - Mithrias was ONE god in the pantheon of Pagan Rome.  And he really didn't get a large following documentable namely by the number of statues and temples dedicated to him until approximately 300 AD, so that doesn't seem to make him widespread as a common diety until a good 270 years after the birth of Christianity.<br>

I will argue that Christianity is vastly different than it was when it origionated.  But what I do not grant you is that the bible has changed, there is just too much proof to show that it is remarkably unchanged and correct in translations.  I don't think my Church is anything like the ones Paul wrote to in the New Testament.  Perceptions and interpretations of the texts change, but in my opinion, the texts themselves do not.<br>
<br>
Where I think we are having confusion is that you seem to use the Bible and Christianity as a Church interchangably.  This is really not the case.  If you say the Church changes and Dogma changes every century, I fully agree.  But you stated that the Bible itself does - which archaeology has repeatedly proven to not be the case.<br>

<br>
You brought up some very good points. I find it refreshing that you question your pastor, as I have actually never witnessed anyone doing that before. As for my comments on churches, I am indeed making a blanket statement.  <br>
<br>
For the most part I am entirely against the concept of a 'church' in the form a  building that needs money and funds to continue operating. The Church should simply be everyone who believes in Christ as their savior. You don't need a building to do that. Today, churches are found in wealthy areas and suburbs left and right. Most churches are already preaching to the choir--so it is simply a place of worship. And I don't feel God enjoys a lot of people dressing up in their Sunday best to take an hour or two out to worship him, toss in a donation, and then head back home.<br>
<br>
As for the New Testament passages on homosexuality, I discount them all. Anything that is not in the First 5 books of the New Testament has nothing regarding what Jesus said. Paul was the first real pastor and used his letters to keep his budding flock in line. Therefore, anything in Timothy, Corinthians, Romans, etc. doesn't mean anything to me because Jesus didn't say it. <br>
<br>
I respect your beliefs and the beliefs of everyone, unless their beliefs are founded on hurting other people. Life has always been a journey about finding yourself and your place in this world, and I refuse to condemn atheists, Wiccans, Buddhists or Hindus for how they live or what they believe.  <p><p><center>
