Of all the people who died in that tragedy, I cannot think of anyone else who's memory less deserved to be tarnished thus.

<br>
MIAMI -- As the nation cheers the heroism and tireless efforts of New York City's firefighters, the conduct of two of their South Florida colleagues has stirred up a storm of criticism.<br>
<br>
The two refused to ride an engine flying the American flag, said Jack Hackman, a spokesman for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. When news got out about the incident, which Hackman said occurred Saturday, hundreds of angry people telephoned the city of Opa-Locka, where the firefighters are stationed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our switchboards have been crowded all morning,&quot; City Manager Newall Daughtrey said. &quot;I'm a Vietnam veteran, a former Marine, so clearly I support our country. We really hope they get this resolved.&quot;<br>
<br>
WIOD-AM, a local all-news radio station, identified the two firefighters as American Black Muslims. Hackman said that hadn't been confirmed, and that he had received contradictory information. He refused to identify the men, but said they took umbrage to a U.S. flag put on their engine by colleagues from the previous shift.<br>
<br>
&quot;Initial reports are that they refused to ride the firetruck while the flag was there,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We're trying to look into it and decide what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two firefighters now are on scheduled vacations, Hackman said.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hurt and anger most people are feeling is the same as our firefighters are feeling,&quot; Hackman said. &quot;They're calling us and saying: 'Say it isn't so.' It's hurtful and brings deep-seated anger to know that some of our brother firefighters would not be proud to serve under that flag.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Miami-Dade department employs 1,800 firefighters.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have 1,798 who are devoted to that flag,&quot; Hackman said. Some of them now are in New York, assisting in relief and recovery efforts, he noted.<br>
<br>
Since Saturday's incident, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Director David Paulison has made it mandatory for county fire engines to display the American flag as an emblem of patriotism and a tribute to New York City brethren who perished in the collapse of the World Trade Center. <br>

It's really sad that we have all these people in the world who &quot;can't see the forest because of the trees,&quot; to use a cliche.  If you look into Islam a bit, you'll find that it teaches to be tolerant of other people of the book, or some quote really damn close to that.  Basically, it says that they should tolerate Jews and Christians more than any other religion because they are all worshiping the same god.  But, you have these retards that want to use that as a tool to achieve some other agenda they have.  <br>
<br>
Then you look around our own country...  It's a sad fucking state of affairs.  We have a country full of wannabe lawyers and psychologists.  I read that there were several incidents like this.  Companies and even our own schools banning flags because &quot;it might offend someone&quot;.  WTF?!?!  This is the United States of America, right?  If the sight of our nations flag is offensive to someone, then they sure as fuck don't belong IN OUR NATION!  <br>
<br>
The initial report I read about the fireman said they felt the flag represented oppression and bigotry and thus wouldn't ride on the truck while it was displayed.  I read another article that was talking about a bunch of ultra left-wingers were saying that flying the flag right after the attacks was fine because it was a sign of solidarity and mourning with the nation.  Now that the president and congress are tossing the word &quot;war&quot; around though, it's suddenly not OK to display the flag because it's a sign that you support violence against the middle east somehow and shows us a bloody thirsty nation.  ?!?!  This is the kinda shit I mean when I say we have a nation full of fucking wannabe lawyers and shrinks.  What ever happened to the flag being a symbol for the USA.  Displaying the flag as simply a sign of patriotism and love of your country.   Sure, there can be many other feelings that an individual associates with that for themself, but that's beside the main fucking point.  You fly the flag to show your support for your country and belief in it.<br>
<br>
We have so many fucking special interest groups and extreme right and left wing lobbyists in the country anymore that even the really good ideas for laws and such are held up and nitpicked over and over because they read some inferred detail that doesn't jive with this or that particular faction so now the whole fucking thing has to be redone until it appease EVERYONE.  Hello, we have 300, 400 million people in the US or some shit now?  You're not going to be able to make a decision that makes everyone in the nation grin from ear to ear and cheer.<br>
<br>
People don't trust their government anymore, and in part, rightly so.  But, if we're going to question every fucking thing that's done and hold everything until 200 different independant committees verify that any action is acceptable to all the various special interests in the country, we'll never get jack shit done.  It's a sad fact that the mentality is everywhere now.  I see it in EQ all the time.  How many of you have been an officer in a guild where everytime a new rule was made there were a couple people in your guild, often your own fucking &quot;friends&quot;, who start jumping up and down screaming about how it's fucking over the little guy or something similar.  I mean we're talking about a game here, and people in charge that you most likely know personally, and it's still a problem.  <br>
<br>
It's just really sad, IMHO, that we have a representative democracy and yet overall we still have no faith in the leaders that WE elect to do their jobs.  It's even more sad that people not only take for granted all the great things we have like a free press, freedom of speech, freedom in general; but they abuse them.  Then they have the nerve to say that the US sucks, the government sucks, the flag represents oppresion and narrow-mindedness, blah blah blah.  It's not perfect here, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a more open-minded, truly FREE country than this one.  <br>
<br>
Bah, I've wasted my time ranting again.  Those that do get what I'm talking about aren't the problem, and those that don't get it, will likely just ignore this anyway so what's the point?  Vent...<br>

I don't go around saying &quot;God bless America&quot; because I'm not religious like that, but I also don't get offended when someone else does.  I know they mean well by it.  I don't support just blindly bombing the fuck out of afghanistan or the middle east in general.  Hell, I'm not really all that keen on sending troops to the middle east at all where they'll most likely be the targets of more attacks from terrorists as well as the general public in some areas, but what other option is there?  I remember in Snatch when they're going to buy the caravan from the pikers, Gorgeous George says, &quot;This will get ugly.&quot;  Ayup.<br>
<br>
We're going to have troops get killed, and quite possibly it will be a lot of them.  We may end up in an all out war with a country or two before all is said and done.  But when you look at the viable options, what else can we do?  <br>
<br>
We can start sending nukes to the middle east right now and make a big glass parking lot out of it.  Yeah, great idea there you numbnuts backwater hicks.  At least that's what I keep hearing at the construction company I work at.  I thought that general in Dr. Strangelove was a nutcase the first time I watched it, but now that I've gotten a bit older and been around I can honestly say that various incarnations of him are not all that uncommon.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We can be pacifists and do nothing.  Shrug our shoulders and say &quot;Imperial America&quot; brought this on ourselves and hope the radicals of the world see that we're nice people and decide to leave us alone now.  Be the apologist nation that many of the ultra left-wing want us to be.  Not likely.  Good way to throw our own country into chaos as everyone cowers in fear from possible terrorist attacks and we're turned into mewling kittens hoping the mean terrorists don't hold us underwater and drown us.<br>
<br>
We can go to the UN and ask for some &quot;resolution&quot; to be passed and half-ass commitment of force to enact said resolution, as has happened countless times before.  Sorry, but my personal opinion of the UN is that it's 95% talk, and 5% half assed action.  NATO on the other hand... They typically don't fuck around.  When they move into action, it's nto pretty but something gets done.<br>
<br>
We can take the initiative to start forming an international coalition to hunt down terrorists, break their financial backbones, and put them so badly on the run that they don't have time to attack us because they're busy trying to stay alive....  Hrmm, sound familiar?  I side with this option as does Bush it would seem.  Perfectly reasonable and expected to go to the international community like EU, NATO, and UN and get their support, but don't wait on them to get around to forming some coalition.  We need action to be taken and swiftly and that's just what's being done.  <br>
<br>
Amazing that I was against Bush in the election, but as I've always hoped, either choice has it's good points as well.  Overall, I have faith that the President of this country, whoever it may be at various times, WILL have the good of the nation in mind and will be led by that in his/her actions.  I think my optimistic attitude is justified in this case at least.<br>

You want to hear first amendment rights? I got the fucking right to rag on someone who I think is a dipshit &amp; pisses me off. So does everyone else.<br>
<br>
The first amendment does not protect you from critisism. Don't know if you know that or not.<br>

<br>
 We, as a people have become SO concerned with not offending anyone that we are voluntarily giving up our right to free speech. Why should anyone have to remove a flag because someone else dosen't like it? Or a sign or a T-shirt?<br>
<br>
No, the government is not putting anyone in jail, but we are allowing ourselves to be silenced because people &quot;feel&quot; they are offended. I remember a little rhyme from when I was a kid, &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.&quot;<br>

I guess thats why they live here and collect a paycheck every week or two.   What can you expect from a bunch of religious hypocrites I guess.   <br>
I would say we need tougher immigration laws, but whos to say these two are immigrants.  Just typical religious hypocrites.<br>
Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are good things.  These guys are free to be displeased with having a flag on a vehicle they work on.  We are free to call them assholes and to get the hell out our country.  Their bosses are free to fire their asses for not performing their duties of their job.<br>
<br>
Lets hope to see these guys looking in the want adds.  More likely though if they get fired they would find a lawyer and have a nice lawsuit about being unjustly fired!.<br>
AMERICA &quot;what a country!&quot;<br>
