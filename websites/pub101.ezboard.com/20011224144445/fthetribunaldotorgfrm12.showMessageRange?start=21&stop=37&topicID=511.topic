Pretty much what I was gonna say, only he beat me to it.  I like other languages, and learning other languages.  Forget who said it, but the quote was something akin to 'learn a new language, earn a new soul' or something, meaning you also learn culture, people, whole new viewpoints etc etc.<br>

Hmmm.... when a game's entire interface is in English- the dialogue, the controls, the commands- I would think it's pretty fucking safe to say that the game is aimed at an English speaking audience. If it was aimed at a French audience, then they would make the damn game in french. Ditto for Spanish, all 300 Chinese dialects, and whatever other languages people happen to speak.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/8/01 6:30:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://people.ne.mediaone.net/rx7gtu/images/nosey.JPG WIDTH=186 HEIGHT=178></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bloody fucking lame shit foreign cocksuckers</span><hr size=1> If people want to cluck and tick around you, either tolerate it or just don't group with them. <br>

For what it's worth -- on a serious note of basic, bare-bones multilingual etiquette, it is very bad form to use a language that excludes someone from the conversation. If there are members of your party that simply do not speak a common tongue, then of course there is little you can do about it. Also, someone's ability may be limited, and thus force them to switch to their native tongue for certain expressions -- but a translation should be provided. <br>
<br>
Is it intellectual laziness, or even arrogance that stops most native English speakers from learning another language? I dunno. I certainly know people who act that way, but you know -- that's their loss. <br>
<br>
English is the Lingua Franca of the computer world -- not just the internet. But that's not the point. The point is that if you can speak a tongue known to all present, you should do so -- even if your mastery of that language is far from perfect. Not doing so, is to be rude. <br>

<br>
As such, other countries tend to speak some english in addition to their native languages almost out of necessity.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with ignorance.  It has to do with &quot;we don't have to so why the fuck do it?&quot;  I can travel most places I would ever *want* to go in the world and get by just fine speaking only english.  Try heading to Japan and beeping and pinging at them in scandinavian and see if ya get anywhere  : P<br>
<br>
There will come a day that English is required learning in any civilized country.  It is almost at that point today.  So why the hell learn anything else?  Get rid of every other language in the world except one, and we'd all be better off.<br>

<br>
I won't want all the world to speak one language. And to insist that all the world should speak just one language, well -- that's not just unrealistic, it's just plain bad. Learn &quot;Common tongue&quot; (English) fine, ok, all well and good -- but if you add a new language to your skill list, that is a great way of expanding your mind -- your horizons. And that is very, very good. I'm no linguistic expert, I suck at languages. But I find em very interesting. <br>
<br>
(sorry this isn't a very good flameboard posting, but i can't help myself)<br>
<br>
I was at a Sushi restaurant the other night. Never been there before, but it seemed really good -- although bad (modern) decorations etc., but the sushi chefs (is there a special word for those guys?) greeted us with a lot of enthusiasm when we walked in, and I think that is a good thing. The superb movie Tampopo explored Ramen Noodle restaurants, and remarked that one place was dull and grim, and the only good thing about it was the gusto with which the cooks greeted the customers. <br>
<br>
I never know what the fuck to say to those guys, and I hate this. I just assume some stand-at-attention stance and nod a couple of times, while grinning like a round-eyed moron, and avert my eyes. <br>
<br>
I hear people say stuff like &quot;Konichi-wa&quot; etc., but I sorta think &quot;konba-wa&quot; or something is more appropriate. Hell I dunno if you're supposed to say anything at all. I only went into a sushi place in Tokyo twice (them Japanese folks aint into it as much as us. Honest). <br>
<br>
But well, I was pointing out some Japanese signs on some scrolls, that I recognized, and tried to explain them to my buddy... <br>
<br>
There were two kanji, pictograms, Chinese symbols. One said &quot;Root&quot; and one said &quot;sun&quot;. Root is made up of &quot;three&quot; with a small, horizontal line at its trunk -- fairly logical, I think. A tree, with a line to indicate where it meets the ground, thus: root. The character for sun was a bit harder to explain, and I went into a long tale about the sun, the eye, 100, white, light, all sorta crap (none of which most of the people I talk to remember -- uh, including me). <br>
<br>
But the cool thing about this is, &quot;root and &quot;sun&quot; together means Japan. <br>
<br>
Root = source, sun = sun. The origin of the sun. Land where the sun comes from. Land of the rising sun. Etc. <br>
<br>
Pretty cool. <br>
<br>
Now, while I'm jabbering on about this, the waitress brings us our miso soup and beer and asks me a question -- which I just didn't understand AT ALL. <br>
<br>
Then, I realized, I was talking about the kanji and hiragana and katakana on the scrolls on the walls. Japanese is NOT that hard of a language to learn (contrary to what most Japanese people like to think), but to learn the written language is really very hard. So I looked at her, and tried to replay what she had said, in my mind. <br>
<br>
Then, I said, uh? <br>
<br>
And she repeated herself, but I didn't understand a damn thing she was saying. <br>
<br>
I realized at this point, that it would be impossible for me to understand someone who spoke to me in Japanese, because I know a few elements of the written language, but I only know about three or four phrases from the language itself. <br>
<br>
One of them is, &quot;I speak a LITTLE Japanese, but I am not very good yet.&quot; <br>
<br>
Or, &quot;Watashi-wa Nihongo-ga SKOSHI wakarimas, demo yoyuyarimasen.&quot; (or something like that).<br>
<br>
Literary, &quot;I Japanese-language LITTLE understand but notverygoodyet.&quot; (or something like that). <br>
<br>
I thought, if she had said something like, &quot;Oh cool, you speak Japanese!&quot; I might be able to understand it -- although I only know like one or two phrases. But of course, when you learn a language, you learn shit like &quot;Pardon me please mister, where is the nearest public urinal, I have a gammy leg and my mother's hovercraft is filled with eels&quot;. <br>
<br>
Well, the waitress stared at me, I stared at her, and then she walked off. <br>
<br>
My buddy looked at me, saying &quot;What?&quot; <br>
<br>
So I said &quot;What, what?&quot; <br>
<br>
He said, &quot;Why'd she ask you THAT?&quot;<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;What?&quot; <br>
<br>
He said, &quot;About Harry Potter?&quot;<br>
<br>
- &quot;Harry Potter? What the hell are you talking about? <br>
- &quot;She asked you about Harry Potter!&quot;<br>
<br>
So, I tried not to panic, and sat back. What the fuck? <br>
<br>
When the girl brought us the sushi, my buddy asked her, what did she ask me about? I just sat there like a retard, not know what the hell was going on. <br>
<br>
After a bit of back and fourth, it turned out that she had just heard the last part of me explaining the kanji for Japan: ROOT and SUN... <br>
<br>
Ie., &quot;SOURCE OF THE SUN&quot;. She heard this as the American title for the first Harry Potter book, &quot;The Sourceror's Stone&quot; <br>
<br>
Source of the sun = Sourceror's Stone. <br>
<br>
OK that wasn't all that funny, but it was pretty cool nonetheless. <br>

One day towards the end of my mission, I had this companion who had been out just as long as me. One day we were riding on the tram going someplace when this guy came up to us and asked in English us how our day was going. My companion looked at him and said &quot;sorry, we dont speak German&quot;. The guy looked totally crushed and depressed, thinking his language sucked ass( I understood him fine), and he got off at the very next tram stop. I couldn't stop giggling and finally told my comp what he said.<br>
<br>
Of course now the situation is a bit different. Here in Utah, a fair amount of men (and a growing number of women) have served missions, most of them in Spanish speaking areas. At least once a day I get asked a question in Spanish, or someone tries to start a conversation with me in Spanish, based mostly on the idea that since I am a returned missionary, I obviously speak Spanish. The Hispanics that try this are either confused by my English reply, or totally blown away when I reply in a language they have never heard of. The ones I like get the 'no hablo espanol' reply, or whatever answer I am capable of providing.  <p><IMG SRC="http://home.sc.rr.com/guardians/Vaseelsig.jpg"WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=200></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udafistdafoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dafist Dafoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/10/01 3:45:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bloody fucking lame shit foreign cocksuckers</span><hr size=1> I speak Australian, my guild is slowly learning to understand it.<br>

If you ever have a problem understanding a group member, or your entire group for that matter, smoke a bowl. Then as the gibberish passes and time goes by just do random /g LOL or /g HAHAHAHA yep.<br>
<br>
I like it when I'm with a foreign group and I'm pulling. I once used a random language I made up and wrote all these hot keys. Had stuff like /g Ghuntax &quot;a tresrunt&quot; git BLASHFEMMmmmm. I had another one which used those symbols like it was swear words, stuff like %#DA&amp;!FF?*Y  O&amp;%W$#?NZ. The group had to ask me in english wot it all meant in both situations, I just continued randomly hitting the keyboard in my answers.<br>
<br>
One of those things where ya had to be there, but it annoyed the group so much that after about 4 hours I said &quot;see, annoying ain't it!&quot; We spoke english after that.<br>

<br>
Maybe english speaking people have a hard time relating to this, becuase they for the most part only speak one language well. EQ is mostly played by Americans, which makes in really nice when you from time to time encounter someone from your own coutry and get to speak in your native language for a change - and I think people should respect that.<br>
<br>
Us Europeans might as well say that it is rude when Americans discuss American TV shows or Football or whatever - because we really don't know much about that, thus making us feel left out. <p><br>

When you are in a group of 6 peoples its basic courtesy to not isolate some of your groupmates with a language, jeez, how this can be hard to understand? <p><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1116" target=_blank><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Tempus Sans ITC">Lejina Bloodbath</FONT>

<br>
The two examples you gave, are missing one important factor.<br>
<br>
Let's take the above example, and add the factor.  Let's say you are on a business trip to New York, for your international company.  You're working within a group of people from all over the world, all of which speak english.  Now you are in a conference room, working on your project, and have an ugre to have Pizza for lunch.  Now are you saying, you'd turn to your Dane friend and tell him that you'd like to have Pizza when you two head out for lunch?  What do you suppose would be the reaction of everyone else in that conference room?  They have no freak'n idea you are talking about pizza.  They'd feel excluded and would immediately ask what the hell you two are talking about.<br>
<br>
<br>
When you're in a group, you are working towards a goal, just like that project team I described above. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=511.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessage?topicID=529.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessage?topicID=517.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=511.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=511.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=511.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=511.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm33">Spell Traders<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm8">Cogito's Whacky Woondarland<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm2">Admin Stuff<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <table border=0><tr><td><form><font size="-1" face="verdana, arial"><b>EverQuest Links:</b>
