Wow...I've done nothing but watch anything to do with Sale and Pelletier this last 9 or 10 days (one because she's hot, 2 because justice should be and was done) and I never once saw them &quot;whine&quot; about anything.  As a matter of fact, they showed the best composure of anyone who was screwed ever, and they were very mature about it all.<br>
<br>
The only whiners I saw were the Russians (2 days before the awarding of the medals they stated that the judges made their decision or something to that effect and that the decision should stand as is, they &quot;can't have two gold medalists&quot;).  I think that's rather foolish, they knew they were beaten and they should've spoke up about how they should've been silver, the Russians would've won over a lot more fans and caught a piece of the &quot;money pie&quot; that Sale and Pelletier are now going to receive, and rightfully so.<br>
<br>
On another skating note, the womens individual skates held on 2/19/02 were judged horribly.  How Jennifer Robinson (from Canada) gets placed 8th after a flawless program and Maria Butyrskaya gets a 5th and SUCKED in her double combo jump, you got me...hell, how Jenn Robinson stayed on her feet the whole program should've atleast given her a bronze.  But again, the &quot;named figure skater&quot;, Michelle Kwan waltzes into first, when the 2-4 skaters were much better...it's all a popularity contest.<br>

Not sure why everyone rags on Canada so bad, they aren't bad neighbors, unlike our neighbor country to the south that despite having two coastlines, abundent natural resources, a huge amount of fertile farmland but still manages to be a piss pour country that is corrupt and has produced nothing, with the government officials recieving all the wealth while using the united states as a release valve for it's poor.  Our government certainly may be corrupt, but no more so than anyone elses, and we have accomplished so much.  So Mexico's only blame lies upon it's own people.<br>
<br>
Heck, you don't see millions of Canadians breaking into the country illegally, breaking our laws, trespassing across people's propertie to get here, playing the welfare system or just sneaking across a few weeks before their due date so they can give birth and then collect benefits paid for by American taxpayers.  Then of course many of them flat out refuse to learn the language, and I have talked to many during my cs days that think we should learn their language and adapt to them.  But again, they always manage to learn just enough english to collect their welfare checks.<br>
<br>
Then Mexico offered nothing after sept 11, Vincent fox was all buds with George W. right up till the attack then flat out disappeared, while Canada stood by us the whole time.  Yes maybe the terrorists did come in through canada, but if we would stop being politically correct and enforce our own immigration policies (Most of their visa's had expired) then they would have had a much harder time getting enough people to still pull off the hijackings.  Besides, If I were an arab terrorist, I would come up through Mexico passing myself off as an illegal imigrant so I could get welfare up until the time I decided to do my bombing, because Americans are too damn stupid and would rather spend their time dissing on Canada than stopping mexico from wrecking our economy.<br>
<br>
Kulvina, Lum, all you other canadians, as a citizen of the States I'd like to thank you guys for being a good neighbor.  As for mexico, if you guys want to help us, you can get off your corrupt asses, clean up your government, help your own people, and maybe give us one barrel of oil for every illegal immigrent we've raised, paid welfare for, and educated.<br>
