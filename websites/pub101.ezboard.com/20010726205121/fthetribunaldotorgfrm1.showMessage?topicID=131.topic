<br>
It is my firm belief that clerics are more giving, caring and kind then any other class in Everquest, can we make something work that the rest of our server can't.  It takes a special kind of person to be a cleric.  So post here if you feel we could make this work.  I would volunteer to manage it and I would volunteer that after a one week sign up period I would still be low man on list for Ragefire.<br>
<br>
List system for Ragefire.<br>
<br>
1.  To be eligible for the list you must be Level 50 or higher and have a pearl to spawn him.<br>
<br>
2.  When if is your turn on the list, you will be in Sol A until spawn, even if you are camping EL with friends and a ranger tracking.  <br>
<br>
3.  Once Ragefire spawns you have 1/2 hour to assemble a suitable force and engage or notify next cleric on list and give them a 1/2 to assemble a force.<br>
<br>
4.  Top three postions on list need to communicate with each other.  If position 1 is not online when Ragefire spawns then the Ragefire goes to the next person on list.<br>
<br>
5.  No selling positions on list.<br>
<br>
6.  If you must work or leave the camp for Real Life issues, please notify the next person on list who is online. (this would require that the top three positions keep a copy of the list with them when their time is near)<br>
<br>
In a good week we could clear 3 cleric epics and the tension and stress we all feel would go away and make the game much more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
I would like to hear from clerics from all guilds and I would like you to take it too your guild.  If we do decide to attempt this would the Tribunal.org give us our own forum????<br>

<br>
If you have suggestions please post them (Clerics only)<br>
<br>
I am asking to trust the clerics, not the guilds.  Can we do this as the Cleric community without guildtags getting in the way?  <br>
<br>
I don't trust the guilds, so the responsiblity would have to lie with each individual cleric.  To be added to list you could post in forum or email me or Send me a tell in game.  I keep logs and will simple cut and past the request to the board and add to list.  I will send tells to the clerics who are up.<br>
<br>
Maybe add a rule that if you are at the top of the list and miss three Ragefire spawns you get dropped to the bottom of the list.  This means if you only play one day a week, you better make an exception when you are up for this spawn. <p>Lodach Trueheart, cleric of her 53rd season<BR>

I can 897391851251% guarantee that any sort of scheduling system for Ragefire will fail, and fail badly, it's a LOT harder to schedule than the planes because a person can go from being not eligible for Ragefire to eligible for him in a day, and be placed on the back of a list that will make him wait 2 months before he even has a chance.  That type of person would never go for it, and would ruin it, so think up something new.<br>
<br>
The planes schedule didn't work, what makes you think a cleric one would?  It'd have an even smaller chance to succeed, imo.  WAY smaller.<br>

I think its complicated, hard to enforce, and inefficient.  I think we clerics know that Ragefire is a fair race and the person who gets the necessary forces there first can spawn him and kill him.  <br>
<br>
The biggest problem isnt Ragefire its Nagafen - and to be honest, Nagafen would die faster if he were FFA and not on a list system.  The last few weeks Ive seen more Nagafen repops than Id like to think about, and Ive unabashedly tried to drum up other guilds' raids to kill him.  Quite often I hear &quot;we'd like to but its not our turn&quot; and of course the guild whos turn it is is taking their sweet time.  If we could get Naggy killed within hours of the servers coming up (like Trak say) instead of 3 days, it would help ALOT on the Rage pressure.  <br>
<br>
But no, I think the current &quot;FCFS&quot; system - ugly as it can get - is the best.  It rewards clerics who sacrifice their time to clear FGs and Camp Rage more than others who dont - or others who dont as much.  The last Rage was spawned by Nerple not me becuase I went to bed at 4 in the morning and she stayed up to spawn it at 8.  Personally I dont have any problem with that at all - she sacrificed more.  Too bad that Rage ended up being wasted but I wont get into that whole mess. <br>
<br>
I wouldnt support a list system because I dont have a problem with a fair race and I think those who work harder at Rage deserve an increased chance at him.  Let the races continue and whoever is the first to have an adequate force TO WIN - not to loose - turn in the pearl and get it.  I think it would be incredibly poor taste to turn in the pearl to claim the mob knowing that youll die the first attempt but will have enough to win the second time.  I HOPE no one will do this.<br>
<br>
I applaud youre thoughts of a more &quot;civil&quot; list system but I dont think it would work, I dont think its fair, and I dont think its best suited for maximizing the number of Rages killed over time.<br>

I would agree to a list but it would need the full support of ALL the clerics Rage able and that is the hard part, especially with the greed flowing through people's veins these days. <br>

Ragefire's life expectancy is somewhere between 0 and 15 minutes and will remain the same until every cleric in every 50+ guild has their epic.<br>

The guilds who can get the required bodies into Sol B on short notice are the ones deserving of the Epic.

2) It rewards those who have waited the longest or the item.  Face it we are clerics, we have far better things to do for our guild then just sit around 24 / 7 waiting for this spawn.<br>
<br>
3) Finally does the cleric who can sit for 72 hours in a row want the item the most?  Or even could contribute the most for his or her guild after getting it?  No, the logic that suggests otherwise is flawed on 2 accounts.  The first assumes that those who are unemployed (or on vacation) and single are more deserving.  The second point is if this person is sitting in sol day in and day out it means they are not participating in raids or other things to help their guilds, therefore  it suggests that they are infect not going to be the most useful upon wielding the sprinkler.  <br>
<br>
Sitting for months with your pearl seems to be a fact of life for this quest, but at least this can be put a little at ease if you know that you will be getting it eventually and can go about your daily eq lives.<br>
