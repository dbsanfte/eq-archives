<br>
1) when grouping with an enchanter, Always use Sword Of Skyfire.  Make that chanter earn there keep.<br>
<br>
2) when you arent pulling, never assist, make sure you break any mezzed mobs. if the chanter cant take a hit screw um....<br>
<br>
3) Never taunt, this way you dont die....<br>
<br>
4) If a mob attacks the cleric let the mob beat him.. Hey he can heal himself cant he?? you just got bandaids.....(and they always get groups anyway you dont)<br>
<br>
5) Never ask your group for mana, if cleric chanter is Lom. go pull a few, get them off there ass.....(why the hell do they get to sit anyway?)<br>
<br>
6) If you pull too many mobs never eat a death and get rezzed make sure you train your group...<br>
<br>
7) once your group dies make sure you say its because "some monk" FD and trained you.<br>
<br>
8) If you zone a train make sure you run around and aggro a few more mobs, try to take out as many AFK people as possible....<br>
(hell they wont know what heppened will they?)<br>
<br>
9) Never admit to a bad pull.  <br>
<br>
10) back to Taunt.. taunting is bad..... make sure you do not build up aggro so mobs get a chance to attack the nukers.... see if they can take a hit....<br>
<br>
11) go AFK during fights..... never tell group you are gone.....<br>
<br>
12) pull singles when cleric is at full mana....<br>
<br>
13) If you have to die make sure you take out as many other people as you can.....( hopefully youll kill a cleric wholl rezz you)<br>
<br>
<br>
All i can think of for now im sure some more will pop in my head and i can add to this feel free to add some more good warrior tactics<br>

When a group mate is doing such big mistakes over and over, kick him out for your own and other group members salvation. Thats not like you have some sort of contract saying you must stay grouped with him till the camp is done. If hes the leader, jeez, everyone disband and reform w/o him.<br>

If noone dies, you will rarely see someone booted out of the group. At least, i never saw one. Correction. I saw it once. <br>
<br>
I booted out a guy once. He was afk for a long time (like 45 minutes). When he came back, he was like &quot;WTF, why did you remove me, i told you i was afk ??!!&quot;....Not to mention he said he was afk for like 5 minutes...<br>

And if you have another tank what's wrong with occasionally pulling back and practicing a little archery?  Point of the game is to have fun, if you can do that using your bow and not get the group killed what's the problem? <p><bold>Smokey the Bear<BR>

<br>
The WORST thing I have seen in a while (mind you I only have a 37 character) was warriors running around like a chicken with thier head cut off when they get low on health.  First off the mob was only at a spec of health and he could do some pretty mean cripiling blows, 2nd of all we had a cleric that was going to heal him, 3rd I had lay hands up and you can't do it to someone that is running away from you.  <br>
<br>
I was in a Frenzy group reasonly and I saw the bravest druid ever, she stayed in one place while the mob beat on her.  She ended up dying (which I feel really bad about) even with 2 paladins trying to LOH her.  We gladly payed for her rez, but the thing was, we wouldn't have even had the opertunity for LOH is she ran. <br>
<br>
*sigh* <br>
<br>
But that one warrior was the worst person I grouped with for a while.  I have to say that I have had a good string of groups the past month or so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><TABLE WIDTH="40%" BORDER="0">

<br>
I fully agree with Barnes.<br>
<br>
If you don't have faith in your Cleric, get a new one, leave the group, or play it safe.  The later can annoy the party but if they complain tell them to find you a better Cleric or take over the tanking.  Did B2 in Sebilis recently and the Cleric kept casting Divine Light on me, even when I was berserk.  Clerics can correct me on this but for 50 more mana you can cast a Complete Heal I believe.  When you have 4k+ hits it's not exactly mana efficient to DL a Warrior.  With Defensive on in a place like Sebilis there's plenty of time to cast CH even if you start when the Warrior is under 40% (Rangers are a different case :) ).<br>
<br>
Defensive skills such as Dodge, Parry, Riposte only work fromt he front.  If you're low on health the dumbest thing you can ever do is run.  Mobs WILL hit you more often and harder when you have your back to them.<br>
<br>
I've been saved numerous times on a pixel of red or even purples so I always have faith in the healer :).  Nothing more amusing than falling to the ground, bleeding to death and suddenly popping back to life.<br>
<br>
Then again, with a 56 Cleric in the group you don't even have to care if you die.  Even at 59 the exp drop is minimal.<br>

<br>
A running tank is a scared tank and usually a dead one because he dies faster (skills don't work, as you said Druu) and heal doesnt come enough fast.<br>
<br>
One thing all tanks don't understand yet is that Complete Heal is a TEN seconds spell casting and it usually lands when tank is almost dead (i try to avoid the &quot;purple bar effect&quot;, funny but all tanks don't appreciate and lag can be annoying :-p)<br>
<br>
Another thing all tanks don't understand yet is that they HAVE to keep aggro during the CH casting because a cleric can't heal another player during this time. Switching aggro may be looks safer (don't get me wrong, it is safer sometimes), but it means less mana efficiency on the CH and another healing spell incoming after it. Sometimes too late.<br>

Carry an inny stone and port them to hate.  Then turn on the log.  Amusement for hours to share with friends and family.  Sure it is 200pp but well worth the entertainment value.<br>

Now, I've never been to the druid evac spot there.  Have heard it's kind of nice, some couches and throwpillows and stuff.  However, the wiz evac spot is always a joy.
