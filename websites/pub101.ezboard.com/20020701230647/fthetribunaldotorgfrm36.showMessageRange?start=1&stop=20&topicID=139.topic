But the spitball hit a 14-year-old boy in the right eye, requiring a trip to the hospital and surgery.<br><br>Jeffrey and his 14-year-old brother Stephen, who allegedly urged Jeffrey to fire the spitball, both were charged with battery causing serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury, and mayhem.<br><br>Last Tuesday, Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Araceli Ramirez found Jeffrey guilty of battery causing serious bodily injury and mayhem, both felonies. His brother was found guilty on a lesser charge.<br><br>The Chronicle said that Jeffrey, who has had two heart surgeries and has Attention Deficit Disorder, now faces a sentence of up to eight years in a California Youth Authority prison when he is sentenced next month.<br><br>&quot;What we have is an unfortunate accident with injury to a child, but what one time had been horseplay has now been, by the D.A. (district attorney), elevated to felony status, just on the basis of the unfortunate outcome of an accidental act,&quot; said attorney Marek Reavis, who is representing Stephen Figueroa.<br><br>The district attorney's office declined to comment on the Figueroa case on Wednesday, saying that because it dealt with juveniles the court records had been sealed.<br><br>But Jeffrey Figueroa's mother, Yvette, told the Chronicle her son's possible prison term came as a shock.<br><br>&quot;All along we've had a lot of confidence that the judicial system would actually prove that Jeffrey and Stephen were innocent in this,&quot; she said. &quot;We're totally in shock that they've been overcharged for something that was a terrible accident.&quot; <br></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br><br><br>Is it just me or is convicting this boy of a felony insane?

The only charge I see that remotely fits this situation is Reckless Conduct, and even that is pushing it.<br><br>The judge was biased by the results of his action imo.

When I left EV, I said I would have MORE playtime with my new position, but I would be on call which meant I would most likely have to leave in the middle of raids on a regular basis.

It's not your intention for it to come down on the roof of an orphanage and kill everyone inside with a horrible fire. But if it happens you will still be convicted of felony manslaughter, and might serve jailtime. <br><br>Sentencing isnt for another month right? Hold of off on your justice system bashing until you know he is going to the gas chamber. He probably will get off much lighter than the kid who had to go through eye surgery due to his actions. Because he's a child he's already way ahead of other people who have been convicted because of mistakes. When he's 18 this will all be sealed forever. Or maybe not, since his mother thinks it's cool to put him on national TV so another person can brush off their responsibility due to public outcry from fat mulletheaded fathers that raised a dozen kids to believe that throwing spitwads is right of childhood handed down to Moses along with the other 10 commandments. Maybe we can change the law because of this. Children horsing around can no longer be convicted of a crime. EVER! It'll be so much fun handing out bottle rockets to all the kids in my neighborhood.

You felt unwanted much like you did here at the flameboard and you ran, you have a habit of doing that, running when you feel unwanted in the slightest.<br><br>Maybe its your arrogance getting the best of you again, &quot; my main role is a healer for caster groups &quot;, but godforbid EV makes due with a change in the lineup, we apparently cannot handle you leaving it would destroy a raid, is that how the great Loegan sees the raid revolving around his healing powers??? Seriously, we deal with cleric chains with people going OOM, or LD and you dont think we couldnt deal with you suddenly having to leave, once again it smells like bullshit to me, another excuse, and even worse, you try to make yourself look like a raid would have to be called off if the MIGHTY LOEGAN got called into work, god forbid!!! Since EV is such a NOOB guild without Loegan, we couldnt adjust to it......oh my, does your head swell when you write this believing you are the cornerstone of a raid with superior druid healing powers....<br><br>Yes I blew up about 9/11, forgive me oh great Loegan for being emotional about family members on that day, about being worried and angry, I suppose you didnt get angry or upset at all over 9/11, and if you did, dont go pointing fingers and telling me I didnt handle it well, no shit, alot of people didnt handle the attack and confusion of 9/11 well, and the post was ill timed and brought politics up into a guild function, where they dont belong. So you really need to get off your fucking high horse Loegan. <br><br>The truth is, you were playing less, saw the guild talking about cutting members who werent pulling their weight, you immediatly felt guilty and targeted and instead of being kicked out which you felt was coming as I did for me and you and people like Koshy, you used your job as an excuse which in reality you play more then when you were an EV member, dont bullshit man, its so unbecoming of you dear Loegan.<br><br>I love how you talk about your friends being able to discuss things without getting riled up, but you are unable to do that yourself with people on this board, you immediatly get rilled up if someone doesnt agree with you, so apparently the only people who are your friends are those who agree with the Mighty Loegan. How fucking sad is that to live in such a delluded world. You still blathering about your lesbian wife and sister getting it on, at least that was intresting, though you having sex with sister does explain alot, or did you say they only let you watch....I am not sure, you see saw so much on things you say.<br><br>And the relationship you speak of is funny indeed as I gave the guild a warning and backed off, and watched as people called me crazy for saying Anyane would fuck with people in the guild to use them, and what happened Loegan??? She did just that, so my crazy posts that you refer actually came to pass and indeed werent so crazy, but the truth. She fucked with the minds of members, played emotions of guildmembers, I tried to stop it, but it blew up anyway.<br><br>Anymore you would like to debate dear delluded ego driven Loegan, so sad I cannot extend a hand of friendship to you as you slap it away because it doesnt come with a &quot; Loegan is always right &quot; card that you demand of your &quot;real friends&quot;.<br><br>You are a joke, you should of stayed on your own board, at least I might of believed you are a man of conviction, instead, you give the board a glorious example of your flip flopping. Just another one of many, you Loeganed on the flameboard issue and have come crawling back, hoping no one notices you with that huge chunk of crow in your mouth. This board that restricted you is now something you come running back to....why? because you need someone to read your posts, to help build your ego, the glorious architecht of the Tribunal Board you seemed to describe yourself, telling everyone how you helped shaped the flameboard and it wouldnt be the same without you...once again your ego comes through.<br><br>So hide here in this forum, too afraid to post in the flameboard forum because of fear you will be shown for the laughing stock you are, so keep hiding here, pretending to be one of the intellectual elite, pretending to be part of a community you said was corrupted and blind to the injustices of the moderators. Its like you cried about communism, fled china, and when no one noticed, you come back to china, it wasnt about the principle of the matter, it was about you again, its always about you, and that fucking ego of yours.<br><br>So keep spewing drivel about how I have changed and how I am no longer cool according to your standards ( in Loegans mind being cool = agreeing with him ), I am sure that will distract people from seeing how much of a hypocritical egomanical ass you are. <br><br>It doesnt matter if I have changed and if I am not cool though Loegan, I am not going around talking about how I am a man of principle and integrity and then flip flopping on things, I dont go around talking about loyalty and honor and then sell out those I am supposed to be loyal to, see I am not playing the flip flop game, you are, and I call you on it, that is what drives you with such anger about me. You dont like being shown for the lying ass you are. I know you are going to hate me calling you a liar, but that is what you are. You will say you stand for something, but in reality you stand for nothing, you follow....like a little sheep, leaping to whatever side of the fence suits the arguement. If your opinion makes you unpopular ( gotta keep that self esteem intact by making people like you ), you flip flop and backpedal. <br><br>Read your posts again, look at your backpedaling, its amazing, seriously, you should like compete in backpedalling events. <br><br>I posted to welcome you back, but your ego was hurt by my poke at you and you lashed out, how sad. Please keep flip flopping, like I said before and again, we do need you, you are our jester, often inciting fits of laughter.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>What part of that didn't you understand?

You got scared and ran and used your job as an excuse, you know good and well as an EV member, no one is looked down upon for leaving a raid early if real life comes up, especially work, but alas, did poor Loegan not factor that in when he was looking for an excuse to leave. Keep giving me excuses as to why you now play more but have to raid less and not at all unless it with your &quot;real&quot; friends....its funny watching you blow smoke out your ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udumai01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Messiah of the Flameboard</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/18/02 3:54:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Spitball Could Land Boy in Prison</span><hr size=1> &quot;You are a joke, you should of stayed on your own board, at least I might of believed you are a man of conviction, instead, you give the board a glorious example of your flip flopping.&quot;<br><br>Wait a minute--who was it that posted on the flameboard for a long time, then suddenly stopped after i owned him because &quot;he didn't like what the flameboard brought out of him,&quot; and only recently came back?

You don't know how lucky you guys are to have my impeccable judgement at your disposable&quot;.<br><br>What a hypocrite you are Loegan. Why just last month I heard you say it was a bad day.

I can say anything and change my mind and nobody will call me on it because I am too good for that!&quot;<br><br>Nice try with that different state line. Even though the the sky is blue where you live, you don't see it as blue. I happen to remember that you posted last week that you can only see shades of red.
