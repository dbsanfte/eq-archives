<br>
Yeah, you are right, it might not all be factual, that is why, if and when you &quot;Hear it thru the grapevine&quot; you do a bit of askin, ask for a raid leader, send HIM/HER a tell, ask Them what guild/guilds, most people will be nice enough to list all 6/8 guilds attending+friends.  This has happened repeatedly, and you all have also posted how &quot;its not a repetitive problem&quot;.  Well, frankly, I see 2 guilds that follow the guidelines, FoV and CoE.  Other guilds officers and even leaders have inquired to me about signing up in the near future, asking my advice and my opinions, so they might be ready.  They see what we've done but they don't think themselves capable of the same, and I've literally been told by guildleaders that they would do Exactly what I've mentioned in my previous posts:get multiple guilds to sign up so they get more spots.  I'm not wanting guilds to &quot;Not have a shot&quot;, I'm just wanting all guilds to have an Equal Shot.<br>
<br>
Just to clear it up, and Please Read Carefully, for I've posted this at least 2 other times on this thread but it's been Ignored Totally.<br>
<br>
If 3 guilds sign up separately, and they WIN, and the next guild signed up is the SAME raid force, and they WIN again, and the next guild is the same raid force, and they WIN Again.  That is 3 dragons for basically one raid force, they can fail all they like, but they won't fail forever.  In the meantime, FoV and CoE and anyone else that is following the guidelines gets screwed out of rotation spot after rotation spot.  THAT is the issue, NOT THE FAILURES, But when they Succeed.  I'm trying to prevent a problem that anyone actually KILLING the dragons and involved in this topic INGAME would foresee.<br>
<br>
I'm not wanting &quot;Phat Lewts&quot;.  Quite the contrary, we as a guild have given away just about every loot that drops except for a CoF or an RBB, and those go to guildies on the raid.  Dragon bags have gone to guest, books, scales, i think even a mystical eyepatch went to a guest once.  So please understand, and please think this thru instead of always playing the &quot;Underdog&quot; card.  Just cause some of these guilds can't take the dragons, doesn't mean they are &quot;Younger guilds&quot; that need more tries.  Look at the other guilds on the rotation, or possible additions.  Southern Legion, a majority of thier guild is 55+, yeah, real young, real &quot;New&quot;.  Thanatos Incarnate, they have like 150 members, and can't get over 1 group for thier dragon raid, either people are to old, or not old enough, I can't control this, it's thier guilds choice whether to lvl up or not, and btw....FoV is like 4 months old, TI is what, a couple of years?<br>
<br>
People are choosing sides in what should be a neutral debate on a topic that is common sense.  We don't ask that you watch everyone constantly, we just ask that IF an incident is learned about prior to the actual raid, and it involves multiple guilds, all in small numbers, signing up for the dragon as multiple guilds, then please just say something to them.  THAT IS ALL.  Just an agreement amongst guilds and governing parties atm (Prach) that SHOULD the situation occur in the future, it won't be totally overlooked.<br>
<br>
One last thing, just as another example, so that maybe you will see where we're coming from.  Since you all seem to hold FoV to the reputation that was given it like 3 months ago on the boards,without knowing ANY of us ingame, we'll use FoV as the villain.<br>
<br>
Say FoV signs up for X Dragon as rotation slot 1.  THEN we take 2 members of another guild  (A), and sign up as THAT guilds raid for rotation spot 2.  Then we switch those 2 Guild A members out for 2 members of yet another guild (B).  We sign up for yet Another raid as Guild B.  We then kill the Dragon X 3 times, same basic raid force, with less than 1/3 of our raid force as the guild that signed up.  Technicallly, that is legal from the rules you are defending right now.  Then, CoE signs up and kills dragon X 1 time.  We start the rotation over and put FoV and it's cohorts back thru for another 3 rotations.  Rinse Repeat.<br>
<br>
Now, you see this example and you are prolly getting pissed off thinking we might actually do something like this.  Well, HELLO, read my other posts thru again and you will reallize that all I've been doing this entire time is Try and prevent just such an exploitation from occuring. ( Had to post this to head off anyone that misread what i was saying, Please read it thru again if you don't get it.)<br>
<br>
I respect alot of you guys, Daeja, and Naeamen, and Prach, and Tanje, but I feel like i'm bein persecuted, and my guild along with me.  I'm not new, I played Lazarux for a LONG LONG time before Reptylle, and have several other 50+ chars.  I may not be in Sol Invictus or Companions or E/V or even KoT or any of the mid tier guilds, but I've more friends lvl 63+ than I ever thought I would.  I'm not a newb and I think I deserve a bit of respect and courtesy, and maybe even a bit of this Sympathy that's getting thrown around all over the place.  I'm really working to make things happen as well, and I feel like atm, Prach is posting on the boards once every few days and he's getting praises to the sky for it, while I'm dealing with all the guilds and politics ingame.  I don't know if Prach has taken time to talk to other guilds about anything lately, maybe send a tell to leaders asking if they are aware of what some of thier guild is up to, or ask about plans on future raids. I know I have tho.  I didn't come onto this thread to just bitch and bitch, I came here and started this thread to get something done, to take initiative and do what I feel is right, not just for our guild, but for all guilds involved.<br>
<br>
The last thing i'm gonna post here is simply this, you keep tellin me, and I've read at least 2 or 3 times in this thread alone, that who are we to say who can do what with these dragons, those people pay money to play this game just like everyone else, why should we rob them of this chance.  Just to remind you, I pay for this game as well, just as much as the next joe.  I'm running 3 accounts, does that mean i get 3 times the respect? or 1/3?  Why should that guy get 3 times the shot at something I pay for just as much as he does?  Just because i'm smart enough to think things out, and plan ahead?  Just because me and My Friends looked at this from a different PoV and found something that works and made it work better, and made ourselves better, why should we deserve LESS respect or LESS of a chance to do this?  If you didn't notice, the dragons were all but abandoned, and no other guild had made a successful attempt at them in the last 9 months or so, except for one Naggy raid that Tuatha De Danann pulled off, and guess what, I Was There to.  I helped Tuatha pull the FG's, and since I wasn't in guild, I didn't roll for loot, 2 CoF's dropped, no rolls, and no fight. I didn't care, I was there for the kill, it's what I enjoy most about this game.  But NOW, now that FoV has been taking the dragons for a bit, and making it clear that they ARE beatable, NOW there are guilds signing up, and there will be more guilds signing up, as the word spreads that they are bein taken out again.  Interest will grow, and Prach's job will get complicated agian.  Now, FoV doesn't deserve it's equal shot, other guilds with half the patience and none of the dedication, they are goin to be allowed 2 or 3 or more shots to kill each dragon PER shot that we are given.  This is really workin for equal rights and privilages.  Sounds to me like people are pointing the finger at FoV still for a mistake made ONE time and thus appologized for over and over.  We have proven our good will toward the other people and if it sounds like we are arrogant or cocky, well, look at any high end guild on the normal boards, HELL, visit the fucking flameboard and just read the TITLES of the threads.  I'm being as patient as I can be, and so far, the ONLY people I've been hearing from, either 1) don't play the game anymore, or 2) have moved on past these, and just have to post their opinions.  I've YET to hear from any of the other guilds ON the rotation.  What do THEY Think of all of this?  I'm not bashing the elder members of our comunity, and I really REALLY do appreciate your PoV's, but we need to hear from the people involved with the dragons more.  Southern Legion, Thanatos Incarnate, Conclave of Eternity, and any other guild that is wishing a shot at the dragons in the near future, what have YOU to say about this?<br>
<br>
I don't want a fight, I am giving up after this post if i don't get a response other than another &quot;get over it and let the young ones play&quot;.   I'm tired of seeing that, or similar statements. My guild is almost entirely made up of individuals from the ages of 23 and down, with i think 2 exceptions.  We ARE the young ones for the most part.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if I offended anyone, and I'm sorry if you took anything out of context, this post was a Plead, not a brag or a rant.  I'm not angry or pissed off, just sad and tired, RL is rough and I use EQ to ease that, and right now, I'm bein pushed to far to handle.  Why can't we all just see this as the neutral situation it is and discuss it calmly? Why the posts that are only meant to piss other people off? Why all the hate and negative feelins?  Please people, we are adults, lets act it and talk about solutions instead of just saying why this WON&quot;T work, think of something to do Instead.<br>
<br>
thank you again<br>

Not wanting to 'flame' you - i just need to admit right now that I didn't read your entire post as it made my eyes swim. <br>
<br>
I just want to say that with all the griping going on - have we identified that cause of the problems? What I mean is - you mention Fov and CoE as abiding by the guidelines. However, if there are guilds/alliances who are not within guidelines set for the Dragon Rotation - have you mentioned the name of the guild to Prachlyn or to the guild leader?<br>
<br>
You've got to get to the root of the problem. Discussion is a good thing - but discussing the same issue over and over without resolution is going nowhere. I think instead of creating hypothetical situations - we need to address the situations as they occur.<br>
<br>
Only then can some resolution be found. <br>
<br>
Well, that's the way I see it anyway.<br>
<br>
For example - you used your guild as an example, so I'll do the same. <br>
<br>
If I were to witness Fov break one of the guidelines of the dragon rotation - instead of implying in my posts that some people or guilds are not adhering - I would email or speak with Prachlyn to advise him of such. OR I would speak with the GL of the guild in question. I suppose it depends on the situation. <br>
<br>
However - the way things are now - not everyone is going to be 100% happy. Before FoV, I didn't see much if of an issue regarding the scheduling. I realize that you guys are chomping at the bit - and damn, that's great! Competition is great. <br>
<br>
Just as you would like some sympathy and understanding in your direction - how about trying to give the same back to the others involved?  <p><table><tr><td><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdaeja><img

<br>
I think that part of the problem in this thread and why it has diverged into such a heated topic is due to the fact that I see us discussing two issues on one thread.<br>
Issue 1: The same raid force signs up in multiple slots on the rotation because they are made up of multiple guilds.  I believe this was the heart of Reptylle's original post.<br>
Issue 2: A guild who signs up takes along other people who are not in their guild.  These other people could be friends, allys, or strangers who they get through random tells and OOCs.  This seems to be the issue that is generating the controversy, and may be related to issue 1 but is not entirely the same.<br>
<br>
As for issue 1: I totally agree that this COULD be a problem.  My question is: IS this a current problem?  Are there groups that are doing this - signing up multiple times with basically the same force?  I don't believe this is happening, and that is why we are spinning our wheels here - there is nothing specific to discuss.  The rule regarding alliances is in place, but it does not seem to have been broken.<br>
<br>
Now, on issue 2: Personally, I see nothing wrong with a guild signing up on the rotation and then inviting other people along, whether they are friends in other guilds, random people the get in OOC, or whoever.  How they build their raid force is up to them.  Granted, they may not have as orderly a raid as others who only go in with people they know and who know how to work together.  There is a greater chance that they will fail to kill, and therefore the next guild will get their shot.<br>
<br>
Now, this does delay the dragon's death by a few days.  In my last post when I wondered why it was so important these guys go down every time they spawn, I did not know they only spawned once a week.<br>
<br>
I think Prachlyn has pointed out the problems with trying to create some kind of rules that basically say &quot;if you can't win don't sign up&quot;.  There is not really any good way to ensure that when a guild signs up that they take him down.  Yes, perhaps they should police themselves enough to say, &quot;Hey, we totally wiped, maybe we should take more time to plan this before we sign up again.&quot;  But the people controlling the schedule have no control over whether the guilds do this or not.<br>
<br>
The schedule is here to give people who want a shot to get their chance.  If they fail, that is their problem.  If people are exploiting the schedule (in any way, including the one that started this thread), then it is all of our problem and needs to be addressed when and if it happens.<br>

The incident that it derived from was with &quot;Thanatos Incarnate.&quot; Every Naggy raid they have had since we have been in existance; has consisted of about 6 to 8 of their people, and all the rest being from random guilds and the public (unguilded people). They are the ones Reptylle refers to that have asked him to come to their raid, the same ones who have ooc'd in nexus, etc. Hey if they were taking out the dragon with 9 people, 6 to 8 would be great. But! Since they have failed every time with no less than the mid 20's in numbers.... thats another story. This issue wasn't brought up for people to get all technical about &quot;gosh 79%, would they be allowed?&quot; It was to address what has been going on and try to resolve it. So like... lets do that and have a big group hug?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
And... to head off anyone with the following doubt -<br>
I know about the TI incidents, because I was in their chat channel just hangin out, seein how they were doing. I witnessed all that occurred, as did Reptylle. We don't speak from heresay, we speak from experience.<br>

Yes, i have been invited on TI Raids, not by Qanadil personally, but by other members of his guild, who were told, &quot;If you got a friend, invite them!!&quot;  I was also told by Qanadil himself that they raid with Southern Legion alot, he completely failed to mention that here.  And, SL was also on the boards for shots at Naggy.  So, TI and SL raiding together, and Q mentioned Dun Tyr and SoD, and DT has posted on This Very Thread, that they are planning on starting on the dragon rotations in the near future.  That makes 3 out of the 4 guilds raiding together, all of which have a separate spot on the rotation.  See what I'm getting at now? This is why i wanted a policy to be put into place with specific guidelines, instead of &quot;well, if you think you are an alliance, maybe sign up for one, if you want to, possibly&quot;....there are alot of If's and Maybe's in there that need to be addressed.  How long before SoD wants a shot at Naggy as well? And then we got 4 guilds raiding &quot;Semi-Alliance&quot;style with each other, taking up 4 spots on the rotation.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for my lack of paragraphs and/or grammar in this post, but it is late and i'm tired after a very long day.  I have just been handed exactly what i needed to put this issue to rest, now you have a specific incident and party to look at, what do you want to do to prevent this from getting out of hand?  I wanted to set up the rules so that this didn't happen to begin with, simply that.  Call it a Vaccine to a problem we don't have yet.  Kill the cause BEFORE it makes the host ill.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm not wanting to point fingers. I've kept specifics out of this as long as I could, simply to spare those parties any embarassment they might face, and to avoid all confrontation if possible, but now it is out there, and it needs to be solved. Please do not further inflame this, and lets solve it like rational adults.  I dont care HOW many people you take for Naggy Qanadil, and i don't care HOW many times you die, as long as your raid party does their thing in the time slot allotted, and doesn't screw guilds like CoE and yes, my own guild FoV out of our rightful equal shots at this Dragon.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Jay, it's now your question is answered.  Btw...are you just lookin to start fights or do you have anything actually useful to post?  I want to know, honestly?  Are you an Ex FoV member that is pissed off at Pyro or do you ahve a grudge agianst us or something.  Look up your posts, all you do is try and start fights instead of solving anything, I appreciate the fact that you deem us SO important to take 15 seconds out of your amazingly exciting life to put us as a guild down, I just wish i knew the motivation behind it.  /rant off, now back to the rest of my post.<br>
<br>
My suggestion from here, Q, would be to sit down with the Raid leaders/Officer Crews of the guilds you wish to have an alliance with, set up a FORMAL alliance, and post as such. Everyone would be happy, you get your raids, we get our raids, the boards would go back to the hum drum, We Won/We Lost posts and we all live happily ever after singing Kumbaya M'Lord around fire pits roastin Dragon Kabobs and marshmallows on our Extra swords and staves.<br>
<br>
I'm out....and literally about to Pass Out.....<br>

WHEN we are ready to start signing up on the list, we will NOT be exploiting the schedule by signing up ourselves and also going with someone else.<br>
<br>
Currently, a few of our members (no more than about 5 at a time) have gone along on Naggy with Thantos on their past couple attempts.  Qanadil had posted on the boards asking for help, and I knew we needed some experience on the dragons, so I contacted him and a few of us went along.<br>
<br>
When we start going ourselves, it will be mostly DunTyr's, probably pretty close to the 80%.  I personally would not consider my guild ready unless we think we can do it pretty much ourselves.<br>

<br>
Since you asked:<br>
<br>
I've never been a member of FoV; I am currently the guildleader of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://bhur.silverwordz.com" target="top">Bhur Gcairde</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and I've been a member for quite a while (getting close to 2 years)<br>
<br>
As far as something useful to post?  Well, My guild is a fairly small, very casual guild, but we'll eventually be looking to take down Nagafen and Vox.  I want to insure  that 1) They remain on some sort of rotation so that we don't have to race other guilds for them when we are ready; 2) Our members have the option to attend other guild's raids as guests; and 3) We can invite others to attend, or ally to kill them.<br>
<br>
When your *exGuildleader started posting, I posted: a correction about Prach's title (our resident dragon lord) and in favor of keeping a rotation; a second post that had a clarification of what I thought the issue was about and a spelling flame (since you started that post with a spelling flame); 3rd post was a sharp contradiction that knowing any of you personally would make anything different; final post was a response when you said &quot;Jay, what lvl are you again? Like 58 right?&quot;, and I admit it was pretty sarcastic...<br>
<br>
In this thread I posted twice (well, now 3 times), 1st in disagreeing with your request thht a guild field 2/3 of the raid force for the dragon, and then agreeing that guilds need to be posting; second was when pyro came in right after it looks like we've narrowed down the problem and starts saying that TI is basically running a Public raid, without actually claiming that they're taking up multiple slots, the 3rd is this one.<br>
<br>
Other than that I think I've posted once on the flameboard, and a couple of responses to questions in general.  All are fairly obviously aimed at making this schedule work like I want it to (3 points I posted earlier).  There's a couple that are sarcastic, and one that's pretty biting, though I don't name you or your guild specifically, just say that if you screw someone over, just the fact that we know them personally doesn't stop them from being scum...you only qualify if you do that...I think it was a pretty effective contradiction.<br>
<br>
*edit, read your post about FoV after I posted this, and left out the last paragraph when I cut and paste back from notepad (Wasn't willing to lose the post again)<br>
