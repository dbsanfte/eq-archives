Hillary’s Fable<br>
<br>
The lie she’s sticking with.<br>
<br>
By Dick Morris<br>
<br>
Hillary Clinton had a problem on Jan. 21, 1998, the day the Washington Post broke the story of Monica Lewinsky: She had to make sure her husband stayed in office. <br>
<br>
Despite her personal pain at his betrayal — and there was undoubtedly great pain — she couldn't both publicly defend Bill and admit that she knew of the affair with the White House intern. To be credible in protecting her husband, she had to deny knowledge. And now she needs to keep up the story. <br>
<br>
Hillary's formula for defending herself and Bill had always been to challenge their accusers to prove their charges. In sexual cases, it always boiled down to his word against her word and no proof was possible. <br>
<br>
Did Hillary believe her husband's denials? Come on. Get real. If Winona Ryder were caught running out of Bloomingdale's clutching an Armani dress with neither a receipt nor a bag, would you assume she hadn't shoplifted? <br>
<br>
When Bill told Hillary that all he was doing with Monica was &quot;ministering to a troubled young girl,&quot; how on earth was the First Lady supposed to believe him? When he added that she was blackmailing him, demanding that he have sex with her, or she'd go public claiming to have had sex with him, could a reasonable, sane person possibly buy his story? No. <br>
<br>
Yet in her new book Hillary insists she had no inkling that her husband had lied to her about Monica until the day before his grand-jury testimony. <br>
<br>
To buy this latest episode of Hillary's Fables, you'd have to accept that she believed him even after semen was found on Monica's blue dress — and after the FBI took a sample of his DNA, two weeks before his grand-jury testimony. <br>
<br>
You'd have to be a fool to buy all that. As I told the grand jury, Bill Clinton was truthful, if abstruse, with me in late January, 1998, when the story first came out about his affair with Monica. &quot;Ever since I got to the White House I've had to shut myself down, sexually I mean,&quot; he said. &quot;But I screwed up with this girl. I didn't do what they said I did, but I did do something and I may have done enough so that I can't prove my innocence.&quot; <br>
<br>
It took me months to deduce from the public evidence that this circumlocution was intended to deny sexual intercourse but affirm oral sex. But if he told me, he probably told his wife way back then. <br>
<br>
The fact is that Hillary and Bill have had a relationship based on a sick cycle of accusation-denial-admission-reward for decades. He is accused of an affair. He denies it. He admits it when he has no choice. Hillary forgives him and then Bill showers gifts upon her in gratitude. For putting up with Gennifer Flowers and going on 60 Minutes to &quot;stand by her man,&quot; she got control of health-care policy. For Monica, she got a Senate seat. Some guys give necklaces, some give Senate seats. <br>
<br>
Bill Clinton had been a serial adulterer for their entire marriage, as everybody with half a brain knows. <br>
<br>
 In 1988, he called me and said that he and Hillary were considering divorce and he had to get away from her for a while. I offered him my house in Key West, Fla. <br>
<br>
 Right before the 60 Minutes show during the 1992 campaign, he called for my advice and I suggested that he admit and apologize for the adultery with Flowers and he said &quot;If I did that, I'd have to find a new place to live.&quot; <br>
<br>
 In 1995, reviewing his testimony in the fraud trial of Susan McDougal, he asked me how he should handle his &quot;relationship&quot; with her. I said: &quot;If you had sex with her, admit it. Don't perjure yourself. We can always undo the political damage, but we can't undo the legal damage.&quot; He nodded. <br>
<br>
For Hillary to pretend injured innocence at this point has only one motive: She needs to somehow justify her strident public defense of her husband. <br>
<br>
She can't admit the truth: that she defended him because she didn't want him forced from office — ending both their political careers — because he'd been unfaithful to her. <br>
<br>
Hillary, give us a break.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 1276<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/03 11:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.woc.org/public/oneirodynia/images/srllogo.GIF height=180 width=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> all this from a man who paid for a prostitute with a check. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3417<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/03 11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> /shrug<br>

I think Hillary probably did know, but she and Bill are professional politicians first and husband and wife second. That is their business and has nothing to do with what I care about, which was how he performed as president.<br>
<br>
I know, I know - next comes the &quot;but he lied to the American people&quot; argument. Fuck that - if you ask a president if he is homosexual and he lies and says no, I could give a shit less because we don't have the right to ask in the first place. As much as I hate W, I don't care if he has a harem parading around in latex at his tumble weed ranch. I just don't have the interest in our presidents sex lives like the rest of you seem to and even if I did it still wouldn't effect my opinion of them as a president.<br>

If Hilary really did get the health care job and the senate seat because Bill was unfaithful then shouldn't that make Bill's unfaithfulness of interest to the American people? I realize political favors are the norm for any administration, but when the source of those favors are found the circumstanses behind the source are usualy investigated to find if any impropriety is found, such as blackmail or bribe. Because of the intense relationship between a husband and wife, infidelity should be investigated and controlled, or we could end up with a senate full of ex-presidental wives.<br>
<br>
Also, Monica was on her way to a very nice job at the President's recommendation when the news of thier sexual relationship broke. The motives behind this recomendaton are suspect and worthy of investigation. Ive seen Monica in interviews and read articles by her, and she is not the most intelligent person, in my opinion. It's a stretch for me to believe she was the right intern to endorse. It's not a stretch for me to believe she was blackmailing the President. At the very least, it's worth investigating.<br>
<br>
People have no problem investigating wether Haliburton was given preferential treatment in contracts involving the rebuilding of Iraq based on a previous relationship between Haliburton execs and the vice president. I have no problem with it, either. If any impropriety is found it should become public. So why would anyone have a problem investigating the president's sex life? Is sex and marrige fedelity between a husband and wife not as strong a motivativational force as money and frendship? Seems to me it would be an even bigger factor. Adultery by military members is against the UCMJ and is grounds for military justice for this reason. Its discouraging see a President who is above the standard of the people he commands. <br>
<br>
I guess it would have been better to turn blind eye to his actions and just let Monica take that nice undeserved job, while other interns who don't suck a mean a dick use thier other abilities to find work. We could have let Bill and Paula settle quietly out of court, if he would have settled at all with no investigation being done. And Hilary would have faded into ex-first lady nothingness.<br>
<br>
Democrats love to talk about class equality. Their icon can get away with sexual harrassment, preferential trementment based on infidelity, and purgery. Is it because they believe that all men should be able to do this? Or do they just have a double standard when it comes to the Political class? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3420<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/03 1:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Also, Monica was on her way to a very nice job at the President's recommendation when the news of thier sexual relationship broke.

<br>
I agree. When the affairs start leading to unfair promotions or special treatment that goes out of bounds (I think any boss is allowed to give special treatment <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>to a degree</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) then it should be investigated and discouraged.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It's not a stretch for me to believe she was blackmailing the President. At the very least, it's worth investigating.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It may be worth investigating, but Monica doesn't strike me as the type to blackmail Clinton at all. The story came out due to that wench who recorded the conversations and if anyone was looking for personal gain, my money is on her (can't think of the name right now). Monica seemed to back away from the story and imo tried to protect the President.<br>
<br>
Of course that's just my opinion, but I think the facts as they played out point that way.<br>
<br>

<br>
If that was the case then you'll get no argument from me that it should be addressed, but what we are talking about is something that only effects very few people - ie 3, the President, Monica and the person who would have gotten the job.<br>
<br>
The Haliburton contract involves much more and effects many more people. I am not justifying either one, but I think it needs to be kept in perspective.<br>

Well, I would be a little more careful with this. Jennifer Flowers was certainly under no threat and neither was the other one (having problems with names these days) and I think Suesan Dougal made it very clear where her loyalties are. Just because the man is promiscuous does not mean he used force or career blackmail to get the women he had. It also doesn't mean that he used bribery even he if was going to give Monica the promotion. Maybe he actually (gasp) liked her and wanted to do her a favor. Men certainly promote men they like faster than men they don't and I don't think we have any evidence to show this was any different... though it may be worth investigating as you say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3422<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/03 2:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If Hilary really did get the health care job and the senate seat because Bill was unfaithful then shouldn't that make Bill's unfaithfulness of interest to the American people? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

I must be missing something - how could Hillary get the Senate seat as a result of anything Bill did? You have to be elected to the senate... unless you are talking about something else having to do with the senate?<br>

For keeping her fat mouth shut, I would imagine the DNC found a way to get her into New York for the required residency and then helped downplay other potential Democratic party candidates.  I never followed that election though, so I don't know the particulars for certain; however, it is perfectly reasonable considering that preserving Slick in the White House was a considerable political victory.  If he had been booted from office, the backlash could very well have a large majority of Republicans (or, in essence, anything but Democrats) in the House and Senate, as well as in state governmental positions and the presidency.<br>
<br>
I'm at work, so I don't have time to research stuff, but it would be interesting to know what the election swing turned out to be in the various offices after Nixon resigned.  If there was a considerable swing in the amount of seats allocated to the two parties, it would lend some credence to this theory, at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 766<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/03 9:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> Actually, considering that moct of the public was firmly against booting Clinton from office, don't be to sure which way the backlash would have went.  <br>

As it was the Republican's lost significant ground in the next elections.  They did recover but they almost blew it over impeachment.<br>
<br>
Hiliary Clinton won here Senate seat for a couple reasons  She was an extremely strong canidate.  Her political skills come close to matching Bill's (though she can hamstring herself on ideology, she was always FAR more liberal than Bill was)  Rudy who was her original opposition had to drop out (and was dealing with his own extra-marital mess) was replaced by a bland, weak canidate.  <br>
<br>
You may not like her views, but there can be no doubt that H Clinton is going to be an effective Senator for the Dems.  Nothing in that relates to Bill and his control problem. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
Bill Clinton was a centrist, a modern democrat - socially liberal and fiscally conservative. He knew the value of ruling from the middle and I would be surprised if Hillary didn't learn that lesson as well. Surely she has to know that Bill would not have had the massive support he did if he was a traditional democrat. In fact, Bill Clinton is the reason why I changed parties. I have always been strong on social issues, but couldn't see going into massive debt and raising taxes sky high to support them. He showed that you could have a robust social program without spending into oblivion.<br>
<br>
If Clinton had been stronger on the military and a little less on gun control, I can't think of a President who matched my views closer than he did. And to be honest, I think most of the country is centrist these days, though you wouldn't know it after 9/11. Maybe 9/11 really changed all that, but I am hoping it is more temporary personally. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A> at: 6/6/03 9:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1250<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/03 11:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> heh<br>

<br>
The part that's hard to ignore is that Bush lost the popular vote against a canidate who very few people liked and who was viewed as having no personality.<br>
<br>
Will the the events of 9/11 and after be enough to turn the country conservative again? I'm afraid it will be and the sad part is I think that's largly due to exaggertaed fear. This country was so insecure that one successful terrorist attack turned everything on it's ear... even after one of the most prosperous periods in our nations history was brought about by a moderate.<br>
<br>
If people were reacting within reason to 9/11, I could much better handle the decision to swing to the right, but I honestly believe that we have severly overreacted and are jumping on the hardline right wing bandwagon thinking that jumping ugly on anyone who even looks suspicious is the way to defend ourselves.<br>
<br>
And when it comes to jumping ugly and using the military as the primary tool for foreign affairs, the right has it all over the left and will easily win the next election. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soprena>Soprena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 586<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/03 1:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bill Clinton was a centrist, a modern democrat - socially liberal and fiscally conservative. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

The moderates are much more conservative.<br>
<br>
A traditional liberal wouldn't have supported welfare reform in the form it was passed imo.<br>
<br>
I don't think the traditional liberals would have passed the crime bill that focused more on prosecution and enforcement than rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
I think the big problem with the far left is that their hearts are bigger than our wallets. They think that throwing money at a problem will solve it. A modern democrat realizes that solving problems requires money, but they are much more involved in how that money is spent and much less likely to be wasteful.<br>
<br>
I think Clinton found a balance on environmental issues and a traditional liberal would have gone too far to the detriment of business. Clinton's bills cost corporations some money to comply, but I don't think it was overboard and in some cases allowed loopholes that actually hurt the environment and benefited big business (as in where the power plants were allowed to continue having high pollution emissions until they upgraded their equipment - the result is they kept their old equipment and just repaired it rather than ever upgrading, so we saw next to no results).<br>
<br>
Those are some of the things. Conservatives have moderates too and I certainly wouldn't mind seeing one of them elected. I just think the days of the far right and far left should have been over awhile ago. Most polls show that Americans are drifting towards the middle... well until 9/11 they were anyway.<br>
<br>
I'll give an example of what Bush would have done if he was a moderate - when the tax cut was reduced to 350 billion (ok, it's really a much larger amount, but for this post let's call it as it was printed), he would have put that money to the people who make 30k a year or less as numbers show that they are the people who will spend that tax saving and stimulate the economy. Instead this group is seeing no tax relief.<br>
<br>
To me, moderates just vote along the lines of common sense instead of catering to the far end of their party. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elcheproudfoot>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 1281<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/03 2:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=716.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.woc.org/public/oneirodynia/images/srllogo.GIF height=180 width=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dick Morris on Hillary</span><hr size=1> can you give me an example from history of a &quot;traditional liberal&quot;?
