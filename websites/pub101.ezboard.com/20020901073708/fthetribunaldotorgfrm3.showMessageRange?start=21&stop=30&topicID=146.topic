And I'll have my serious moderator hat on while I type ok? Now anyone that knows me knows I don't agree with anyone just because they are my friends and I don't kiss anyone's ass. I dont care who I upset here so I'll tell you exactly the way I saw things, Rynnia. I don't expect a response to this post because either you will believe me, or you wont. If you believe me then great, it's all over and your questions will be answered. If you don't belive me, then there's no use replying except to call me a liar, at which point this discussion will be over for me anyway.<br>
<br>
OK, first off, I have no first hand knowledge of the Jadae or Loegan bannings. all I know is what was posted and I don't have any reason to not believe that Loegan was banned for spamming the same subject, and Jadae was banned for bumping old threads in a disruptive manner and harassing some of our nicer mods about wanting to be banned. This is all I know about it, so whatever, if you want to discuss it, discuss it with someone else. Make a new thread also, please.<br>
<br>
The board bumper who spammed the board after these three were banned has not been identified yet. The fact that this incident even happened has nothing to do with the three bannings from what I've seen. Of course, if we do confirm who did it they can expect to be perma banned, I believe.<br>
<br>
Up until Rynnia was banned I noticed borderline disruptive posting on the general board from both Rynnia and Jadae. No need to be cute here, we both know what you guys were doing. Pushing people's buttons is great and all, but the general board is not the place to do it. Everyone knows that, but I suspect that you two werent getting the reactions you were hoping for with this same behavior on the flameboard. It wasn't that bad, and I wouldn't call it so disruptive as to be bannable, but you did attract alot of attention to yourself by all the admins.<br>
<br>
I followed the posts where you and Cogs were exchanging the &quot;better be funny or I will ban you&quot; banter so I knew that the post calling for you to be banned was a joke. As such I told cogs several times that banning you wasn't a good idea. I like your posts too much for you to be banned and that's the truth. (Same for the other two that have recently been banned, in fact) But after a couple posts where cogs was begging (still joking around) for you to be banned for &quot;just a week&quot; I joined in on the joke. The only two people who wanted you banned were me and cogs. That's your big unanimous vote. Two people who were joking around. When Muse sees this a couple days later all she knows is you have been borderline disruptive and that me and Cogs want you banned. So she did. She doesn't have the time or energy to research every little thing on the board so she trusts her moderators. As soon as the other moderators questioned what was going on, you were unbanned and we got chewed out for fucking around.<br>
<br>
Now, for the apology. I'm sorry Rynnia. I wish I had the insight to know that Cogs posts and my replies would have been taken seriously by our messageboard admin, but I sometimes forget she cant follow every thread. The admin section is it's own sub communtiy and we have fun with our posts and are a bit like family. I'm sure cogito didn't expect to be taken seriously, just as I didn't. But, the joke is on us and in the future both Cogs and I will be paying for it. Do you really think our own Admins will ever take us seriously again? No. So if it's revenge you want, then have some comfort in that fact. If you are expecting me to be personaly sorry I made a joke at your expense I am not. I make jokes about you all the time as you do me. This one just happened to get caught up in something larger than I could've seen. Again, sorry about the result. I will have better forethought about what could happen in the future. First, and only time I've ever said, &quot;go ahead, ban someone&quot; (non anon) and it backfired. WTG, me!<br>
<br>
Now that I've apologized for my behavior behind closed doors, I have something to ask of anyone still reading. Please stop accusing Muse of impropriety in this matter. Like all things concerning this board, Muse does a thankless job without concern for reward. She has more character than all of us who are posting on this thread put together. Anyone who attacks her loses alot of points in my book. Stick to someone more deserving like me or Cogito, we don't care what you think of us anyway. The conspiriacy you people are alluding to never happened and if Muse said there was an agreement to ban you it never happened. She was just protecting me and Cogito. As for this being guild A against guild B, thats just assinine and doesn't deserve further comment. have you ran out of no better things to flame the mods with than that? Dumai, you are usualy smarter than that.<br>
<br>
Ok, your concern about images on the flameboard may be real, but there really is nothing that can be done about it short of just deleting the thread. But really, come on, you've been posting to FB how long? And you are just now shocked about something posted there? I have had things posted about me that &quot;my guildmates could see&quot;, but who is going to think less of me because of an image? Your even bringing it up as an issue to me is only a clever tactic, either to make muse feel bad about losing control somehow or to get a mod in trouble. Honestly, I have a very hard time believing all these years it was that simple to get your goat. I'm smarter than that to believe it, and your smarter than that to expect me to believe it. If it really does bother you, then fine I will remove the post, but then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will have to deal with the freespeach dumbasses who will scream bloody murder. I will point them in your direction and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> actualy will upset you. I'd much rather have an offensive picture directed at me and have the person look like an asshole than to be considered a pussy. I am willing to bet any amount of money you are the same. If not, let me know, it will be gone. but remember, Cogito doesnt have any special privlages on the FB, I've been looking for months now for a way to make him look stupid. He seems to do fine on his own though. But I'll get him somehow.<br>
<br>
Now Dumai if you want to attack any moderator other than me or Cogito please do so in another thread as you will only cloud the subject of Rynnia's being mistakenly banned. You seem to think that you can be banned for your opinion here, but I assure you, you cannot. Board disruption is the only way. It doesn't mean you can't say &quot;Fire!&quot; you just can't say it in a crowded theater. (Yeah I read that somewhere).<br>
<br>
If any other moderators or admins feel I'm out of line with what I've posted, let me know, I'll tell you what I think of the line.<br>
<br>
Ok Rynnia, I've been very frank with you, this is a rare oportunity to see the serious side of me posting. Don't expect it too much. Have fun on our board again and please don't be afraid to post to the flameboard. I enjoy your posts. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

<br>
FWIW, I told Cogs I wasn't going to make &quot;Strudel&quot; a moderator.<br>
<br>
FWIW, I tend to be pretty serious and don't like to fuck around. I didn't realize it was a joke, didn't pay enough attention to what was going on, and rubber-stamped my consent. I have no intentions of doing so again.<br>
<br>
And FWIW, the website is mainly under my control, so if you have any concerns about it, you can drop me an email and we can discuss them. If someone does something on the board, I have no intention of making that equate on the website and vice versa unless there is a VERY good reason to do so.<br>

<br>
Yes I would appreciate that picture removed.  I find no humor in it, honestly, and not because or if it is directed towards me, but the subject matter I find repulsive.  If you'd care for me to elaborate, I can, but I'd be rather shocked if any elaboration here was necessary.  I mean... I realize you can joke around about serious stuffs... but if someone posted a picture of the WTC being destroyed and compared it to the post bumper in some way messing with this board, I do not think it would stay up there as acceptable, either.  I really can't think of an exact parallel but perhaps a comparison like that with a more recent tragedy that should not have jokes about it will show you what I am getting at.<br>
<br>
Send the &quot;free speech&quot; people my way.  I'll not respond to them on the flameboard, but they are welcome to send me e-mail.  My address is :<br>
<br>
rx7gtu@attbi.com<br>
<br>
I'd be very surprised if I received even a single e-mail, which is serious in nature, with concerns about my view that a picture of a jewish man with a nazi holding a gun to his head posted for humor is &quot;inappropriate.&quot;  Either there is a line, or there is no line.  Show some respect to those who may have family who were involved in that shitty time in history.  I think the immediate responses after that picture was posted should tell you something.   I've not often seen that type of response on the flameboard.  Do the right thing and make it disappear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/27/02 12:06:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do me a favor, please.</span><hr size=1> Ok so I elaborated somewhat when I posted that if you needed elaboration just ask and I would... so if you need me to elaborate more than I elaborated, let me know and I will elaborate further.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uvaltic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>valtic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/27/02 12:25:33 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.truepath.com/valiso/valtic.jpg width=120 height=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do me a favor, please.</span><hr size=1> You guys type way to much. <p><center>
