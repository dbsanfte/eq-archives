<br>
I also don't think it's our job to get rid of every dictator on the planet or anything like that; that's the core of why this rubs me so much the wrong way.  And of course, you're right - that fundamental view isn't going to change with me, any more than you and Caledhon are going to continue to fundamentally believe that it's our job to keep Iraq and nations like it from becoming powerful evil dictatorships.<br>
<br>
To this end, we're at an impasse - so it makes more sense to continue to debate more specific topics, rather than the fundamental discussion.  It's like an abortion debate - in the end I'm not going to convince a pro-lifer to change their mind, or vice-versa, so it either becomes a circular flamewar or we find specific things ABOUT the abortion debate to talk about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ahxxy>Ahxxy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 9:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> I stand corrected...Bush is Methodist.<br>

Neither of us.  I was refering to Tuwene's mentioning of the belief floating around in the Middle East that the US is out on a holy crusade.  Those are the dillusions that I was talking about.  I was also referencing a conversation I had with Loegan about how he is concerned about other's misconceptions of the US.  He was saying that though he agrees that Saddam has to go, and that democracy for the Iraqi people would be good, he doesn't agree with how the President is going about accomplishing that task.  Since the method that the President is going about accomplishing it, will actually breed more problems than it will solve.<br>
<br>
Loegan has a very good point, but a lot of that negative reaction to the President's plan is like a chain reaction.  You have people of varying degree's of tolerance to the anti-american movement.  Meaning that once the anti-american drum beats to a certain point, these people will turn and attempt to stop whatever the US is doing.  The drum beat had reached a point that they feel the negatives out weight the positives.  As these people turn and join the push to stop the US, the drum's beat increase, which only brings more people to their side, which then again increases the beat.<br>
<br>
Now this isn't a cascading reaction, as in it isn't predetermined to happen every time people have a problem with US policy.  A lot of things go into how many people will try to pressure the US to stop whatever it's doing.  As I described the equation has two sides to it, the positive along with the negative.<br>
<br>
The President hasn't really built a strong enough case to shore up that positive side, in order to prevent the negative (whether preceived or actual) side from over powering the positive. (He has for me, but it is obvious that he hasn't for many people around the world.)<br>
<br>
That's why I don't automatically tag those that oppose war to be anti-american, or even unpatriotic.  They are simply voicing their opinion, though sometimes they may overstep even their own bounds and say things that could easily be said to be anti-american, or unpatriotic.  People aren't perfect, they make mistakes. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If he pulls off anything remotely positive there, it should help quell the Islamic based backlash at least.<br>
<br>
The problem is, if a guy like Clinton (whether you like him or not, it's hard to argue that he wasn't one of the best diplomats of all time) with all his patience couldn't pull it off, how is Bush, a man with little patience and pathetic diplomatic skills going to pull this off?<br>
<br>
Well, there is the possibility that the Palestinians and Isrealis are ready for peace and all Bush would have to do is act as a conduit for the already present goodwill. I highly doubt this though.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if there was one thing that could allow him to go to war and still come out of the shitstorm he created smelling like a rose, this is it. But considering the skills it would take to pull this off, I highly doubt it will work if he's running the show. Maybe he'll try to let Blair handle it, but giving the usual anti-semetism of Europe, I doubt Isreal will buy into that.<br>
<br>
I dunno, but this clusterfuck just keeps getting more and more entertaining. <p><br>

Yah, Lets hope Bush can pay off NK with more money again to keep them from threatining us for the rest of his Admin and Dump it off on whoever the next pres is.<br>
<br>
Your dillusions about Clinton are as bad as your Dillusions about Bush, I showed you in another post how almost everything he did fucked us in one way or another but you refuse to belive it.<br>
<br>
Clinton in the begining honestly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tried</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to help, For that I respected him. However towards mid way through his term he started getting warnings from nearly all the federal agencies about how his actions were going to blow up in all of our faces.<br>
<br>
Clinton chose to Ignore this, Because he knew it would not happen on his term, And he knew he was keeping people like you satisfied loegan with his 2 extra cops, And 230 Million Surplus. He knew people like you would never ask where he got the money for the cops, Or where he cut money for that surplus, Or how he was able to send more kids to college.<br>
<br>
Ever action Clinton made had a long term effect, Inluding but not Limited too NK. Bush is not breaking down ties we had with other nations, He is simply not letting them extort us anymore, Since when is Complying to Blackmail a diplomatic Solution, Oh wait nm we are speaking of Clinton.<br>

<br>
You mean like Bush is getting warnings now? Christ, he has to go to a remote island for his summit with his last two firends because any country they might go to would be overwhelmed with protests.<br>
<br>
He took a 250 billion surplus and has turned it into a 350 billion deficit and finally some people are taking notice.<br>
<br>
His own father is warning against going to war without the UN and he still is hell bent on going.<br>
<br>
He has finally turned to the Isreali/Palenstinian conflict after months of being warned about how the situation was getting ready to blow again, but only to serve his own interests in smoothing over his Iraq war.<br>
<br>
Clinton gave an address last night and stated that Bush has fumbled both the economy and the war on Iraq... and he is 100% correct.<br>
<br>
How much damage can this idiot do before you guys start catching on? You still like to hold to your fantasies that Clinton did things all wrong and Bush is doing things right, but I'll base my views on the situation today vs the situation during Clintons 8 years, thank you very much.<br>

Too bad your boy has fucked things up to the point where we can't even use Turkish air space. Was going to be tough enough without using Turkey as a staging area, but I really want to see how he works around not having access to Turkish air space. That means no northern front <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>at all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, unless he pulls some rabbit out of the hat.<br>
<br>
Christ, he couldn't even get Mexico's support, a country he has given a shitload of favors to.<br>
<br>
The worst part is, his ego is going to force him to go anyway, despite the obvious mess we are in. Every day the picture grows more grim, the protests grow louder and we burn more bridges. but yet every day he gets more determined to do what he wants despite the cost.<br>
<br>
Now he has to go off to a remote island 900 miles out in the Atlantic like some little Napolean in exile because even the countries whose leaders are supporting us have populations that are overwhelmingly against this war.<br>
<br>
The UN is in chaos. The White House is in chaos, saying one thing one day and doing the opposite of what they said the next. Nobody knows WTF to do and it is starting to show bigtime.<br>
<br>
But hey, stick with our warplans and this knucklehead. We all know what a bang up job he has done so far.<br>

Lemme see..    You want to have a quick summit conference in a high security, isolated, fairly neutral place.  Ack!  The Azores!  <br>
<br>
Pros: Small island.  US military base there long established.  Comings and goings to island easily control.  Chance of a militant Islamic cell inplace extremely unlikely.  Central to all parties.  Great ammenities.  Great climate this time of year.  No need for 25 million USD in crowd control.  No ass to kiss or pay off.<br>
<br>
Cons: Will look like we are sneaking off and hiding from Mexico, rabid extreme leftist liberals, and 98% of the press corps.<br>
<br>
Bah!  Lets take the chance and do it anyway!!  Screw the liberals!<br>

Why do you Dodge the question Loegan? Or try to retort the statement when you know it is true.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He took a 250 billion surplus and has turned it into a 350 billion deficit and finally some people are taking notice.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
 Loegan Read my post, There was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never ever ever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a surplus, Let me put it into terms you might Understand.<br>
<br>
I run a store, I make 10000$ a month off that store, But I have been spending 12,000$, Well one day I decide to fire everyone and run it with 3 people, And I also decide to stop using computers/Lights to make it more cost effective. My cost goes down too 6,000$, Hey there look I turned a deficet into a 4k gain!<br>
<br>
However in the next few months the lack of lights and the slow non computer check outs take thier tole, The customers stop coming in. The 3 people who now run the store are swamped with more work then they can handle, and things slip by them, Now it starts affecting the store. All of the sudden between lost transactions/Slower revenue the store is only making 4k a month.<br>
<br>
Do you get the Analogy now Loegan? Clinton Gutted many Federal Institues that were absolutly Neccasery to keep this goverment running, And then he quickly ran to People like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and said Lookey!! at all the money I saved you!<br>
<br>
The IRS during Clintons Admin had an almost 27% reduction in Federal Funds coming in, But federal spending actually went up!! So how the FUCK did clinton get this money for this &quot;Surplus&quot;, Thats right Loegan catching on now? by Liquidizing/Cutting costs on Goverment programs that people do not like...<br>
<br>
Such as. Military, IRS Criminal Investigation, Intel Agencies, FBI Staff. Which eventually led to higher corprate crime rates (which we warned him of but he blew us off for 4 fucking years becuase he knew it would not blow up until after he was out of office) Leaks in national security (Hello 9/11). yet you Ignore ALL of this Loegan! And simply quote the Numbers when YOU KNOW they are not true.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How much damage can this idiot do before you guys start catching on? You still like to hold to your fantasies that Clinton did things all wrong and Bush is doing things right, but I'll base my views on the situation today vs the situation during Clintons 8 years, thank you very much.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Bushit. There is no way in hell he could know nothing would happen till he left office. He was President for 8 fucking years. How could he possible know that none of this would blow up during his term? He couldn't.<br>
