Vesperr if you werent such a giant pussy im sure people would take more pleasure in fucking you. But, this is the flameboard so if you wanna come talk about RL and debate something with ur amazingly superior intellect than go back to circle jerkn Reverance and the rest of your group of &quot;i fucked around on my wife and got an STD&quot; bunch of morons. Cause if you cant take the heat get the flying fuck out of the kitchen. Or maybe you can go fuck Babyfatass and Romy and spread ur STD's. Just curious, did you bend your wife over and give her the STD too? Now that would be some ironic shit!<br>

If you used ROFL, you've been mudding for a long time, and if you were max level, and raided well with us a few times, you'd have a chance to be guilded.  Now I've seen ROFLOL and I have to say..

It DOES take 2 to tango.  I've admitted being a part of it.  I've admitted to my mistake.  I've paid very seriously for my mistake.  And yet, I still get to be made out the &quot;monster&quot; (right Aea?).  So why me and not Talvi?  Because I'm actually posting stuff about it so that people in the future can be a little leary of her?  Or, is it cause she's so gentle and giving in game?  Is it cause she's a perfect little flower?<br>
<br>
Gimmie a break.  This is starting to remind me of the good ole' Imajicaan days.  &quot;I don't understand!  Why are we asking him to step down, he's such a great guy!&quot;<br>
<br>
Aeaolena...you claim I'm a monster for coming to these boards to talk about this stuff.  And in part, you're right.  It's partly vindictive that I've posted a single inflamatory word towards Talvi.  But part of it was also in defense of myself.  <br>
<br>
I know things have been spread around by Talvi.  People have confronted me about it (long before the original post was made).  People know about it, and it could only have come from one person.  A lot of the stuff that's come back at me has been true.  But a lot of it wasn't.  A lot of it made Talvi look like some sort of poor little victim that I took advantage of and then tossed to the wayside like she had nothing to do with it.  Oh please.  I refer you to Bdan's statement...it takes 2 to tango.<br>
<br>
And who's really the monster?  Someone that commits, admits (in a public forum no-less), and learns from their mistakes, or someone that hides behind an innocent facade and uses an online game as their dating pool and attempts to drag person after person down with them?<br>

You, morons arent defending yourselves. Cause no one in the first place could give a fuck about your ex EQ playing arses. Its just your way of trying to form a bond of the game you once played. And Vesperr is just the guy that complains that someone is a slut cause he tried to get laid and got turned down. Hes that fuck that couldnt get laid with a 2 doller hooker. Honestly, Reverance you couldnt lead a fucking thing in this game and the best thing you ever did to help RNG was fucking quit. Thank the gods a dumbshit like you never came back you cuntslop.

<br>
1) Nice story about my ex wife.  Oh wait, I don't have an ex wife.  Sorry, try again.<br>
<br>
2) I was keeping this guild together long before you even joined us.  Just cause you didn't see (namely weren't around to see) any of the behind the scenes stuff, don't assume you have any idea who did what to keep the guild together.  <br>
<br>
3) If I wanted to keep a bond to this game, why would I cancel my account?  Why would I delete my main character and all his stuff?  Oh, and I'm sorry Revenge, but yes...that means all the stuff RNG got me and that I was so priveledged to wear is gone now.  Cause I know that's your biggest concern.  If I wanted to form some type of bond to this game through this method, I woulda posted about this shit LAST YEAR!  Cause news flash dumb ass, I didn't start the thread, but my name was mentioned.  I think that gives me some right to respond to it.  I don't happen to recall seeing your name in the posts though (until you decided to enter yourself).  Who's the one that needs the extra attention?<br>
<br>
4) What have you led besides your head up your ass?  The couple events that I even tried to lead went pretty damn well.  <br>
<br>
I was an Officer for a longer period of time than you've even been a member.  What have you done?  It was only after everyone and their mother held an officer position that I stepped down voluntarily.  And I musta done alright since Broshan asked me to come back a couple times.<br>
<br>
I don't recall you ever doing anything for RNG.  Oh, except whine about how people taking RNGs loot with them when they leave.  I thought it was particularly interesting that these comments were even made about people that were supposed to be your good friends (ie. Shurraco).  What was it you said?  Oh yeah...&quot;There goes all our loot.&quot;  Ok, maybe that's not exact, but it's been a while.  I forget the wording, but not the meaning.<br>
<br>
5) Is that the best you can do?  I state facts, you retort with a garbled mess of swearing.  /golf clap.  I must say though, I do find your stories rather amusing.  I look forward to the next heap of crap.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Needless to say, I've had a lot of bloodwork done with my recent surgery.  I'm clean as a whistle.  But wait...if Talvi didn't get anything from me, and I didn't get anything from her, she musta gotten it after we were together.  How can that be, she's little miss innocent?  /boggle <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.jsp?num=951" target=_blank>Reverance Echoblade</a><BR>

I am not the least bit afraid Would I get a quicker response from you at the PrivateEmail1@hotmail.com or the PrivateEmail2@hotmail account?<br>
I could post your social security # but that would be too low and a violation of the Privacy act.<br>
You still want a war?<br>
<br>
As for Revenge... pretty funny stuff coming from a skinny white college student with a less than average college transcript. You have been described to me as the guy that Offspring wrote 'pretty fly for a white guy' about. Since none of your insults have any originality-- just the same repetative wanna-be black trash. You are no longer of any consequence. I know a few people at your school that will be more than willing to pay you a visit for free signed gaming books anyhow...<br>
<br>
For the record... Talvi is well below my personal standards. Short heavy Amer-asians do nothing for me. Besides even at my lowest point on the joust circuit I could pick better-- even blind drunk. That is not to say she isn't a nice person at times. I was just verifying some of the accusations that were made before this.<br>
<br>
You two have still produced nothing to disprove the accusations that were made. The best post I have seen was from Avocet... (A guy from the deep Southwest btw.) and all he realy said was that it should not have been here in the first place. I agree with that, but as long as the personal attacks come at me. I will continue on here and take the fight to you if need be.<br>
I leave it up to you, either drop your ridiculous posturing and post something like-- yeah it may be true but you don't feel she deserves this treatment here and we can drop the whole thing. Maybe even ask for the thread to be deleted... or continue and you and Talvi continue to be bitchslapped both here and where you live.<br>
I didn't start this shit, but I am more than capable of finishing it.<br>
