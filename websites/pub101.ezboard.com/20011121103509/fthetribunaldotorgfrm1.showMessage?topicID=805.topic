<br>
The vid card (TnT 2) is gettting pasee already, the soundcard is a bare minimum thing and will need replacing, same with the modem.  <br>
<br>
What scares me the most is that they plan on giving you an incredible amount of useless software.  I'd be afraid that they will have alot of their own advertising etc included in this software, lots of unecessary start-up stuff and icons on you desktop popping up for great deals on something etc.<br>
<br>
If you can, I would finance a dell or gateway system if you want truly user friendly stuff.  I would never buy someone elses old system from ebay or anything, you're just asking for it there.<br>
<br>
Have any computer geek friends ??  I know a few that would have a blast spending someone elses money to make a system.  You'd still never be able to have your own pieced together for less than you could buy from Gateway or Dell.  They get rock bottom wholesale prices for everything and are hard to beat.<br>
<br>
I personally hand make my systems only because I can't afford to drop 800 - 1k all at once.  I buy a new part when I can and just keep upgrading in sections.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  Now when I think about it, I have NEVER bought a complete system before.  My first was a bare bones system that I filled in the blanks with, so maybe someone has some better advice. <p><hr>

Also the P4 doesn't have a true 400mhz bus anyway, it is really 4 100mhz lines on the bus which is good in high traffic cases but isn't as good in other cases.  If you can't work with dell or gateway, investigate your local computer store and see what they can offer, generic is alot easier to upgrade and repair. <p><p>Talamyen, Lvl 56 Ranger<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4286"> Tala's Equipment</a><br>

Due to the economic slowdown (which has hit the computer industry harder than most) you can be approved instantly by one of the 4 banks they use.<br>
<br>
I still would argue that you can't build a system of equal value cheaper than you can buy one these days, but you can buy the pieces a few at a time, which is like self financing. The pro to this is that you can ensure each and every piece is of high quality. The con is, not every piece of hardware will play nice with every other piece of hardware, so it is trial and error and can be very frustrating tracking down the culprit.<br>
<br>
Still, at this point in time I would buy if possible. I would go for a P4 system with a mainboard that uses the 850 chipset. DDR SDRAM is ok, but I think as time goes on RDRAM benefits will really shine.<br>
<br>
AMD is cheaper and offers good performance on todays software, but the Intel P4s on an 850 mainboard are the most stable hardware platform for home systems and offer the most headroom for the longrun. Also I think you'll see alot of software using the features Intel offers very soon.<br>
<br>
A 64mb DDR GeForce 3 for video if you can afford it, otherwise a GeForce2 Ultra.<br>
<br>
Haven't heard alot on SoundBlasters new card, but Live! has worked well for me.<br>
<br>
Go with 256mb of RAM if possible. 128mb is minimum these days and 512 is overkill on a home system imo. I don't think many OEMs will ship systems with more than 256mb RDRAM for some reason.<br>
<br>
Go with a CD-RW rather than a DVD if you have the choice imo. Get a DVD player if you can afford both, but a CD-RW is a must while a DVD is just a nice feature at this point.<br>
<br>
Get WinXP as the operating system, since it will be activated at the factory and uses the BIOS fingerprint rather than a hardware based hash for activation. This will save you alot of headache in the long run from what I have read.<br>
<br>
As far as hard drives, get as large as you can afford as long as it spins at 7200rpm +. Seems one can always find things to fill a HD, no matter how big it is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>

<br>
Let me tell you about what I just got about a week ago. I went with the Dell Deminsion 4300 series. I am VERY happy with it. I know that everyone told me to spring an extra 300 for the Ninvida 3 card, but the 2 is just as good for me. I went with a few changes from the orgional specs, I got the duel cd decks (one regular one, one burner). I got the p4 1.5 GHz chip, 256 sdram, 40 gig hard drive (that's way too much, but for an extra 20 oh well), Harmonic speakers, keyboard, mouse, free XP upgrade, and some other software. Total package was about 1146.00 I think. <br>
<br>
I love it! I would go with that one. Good for any gamer. <br>

<br>
I don't own AMD stocks :).  I always stuck with Intel in the earlier days up until the Celeron 300a's (a 300 rated CPU running at 504 with default H&S and voltage isn't something to gripe about).  In the present day there is no reason to purchase an Intel based machine.  The P4 2.0Gig can't even keep up witht he AMD1800+ (1.53Gig clock).<br>
<br>
Leogon said: "AMD is cheaper and offers good performance on todays software, but the Intel P4s on an 850 mainboard are the most stable hardware platform for home systems and offer the most headroom for the longrun.

<br>
I can't agree more that the AMD is cheaper, and offers great value for money.  But as of today (18Oct2001) the AMD is still the fastest mainstream (read: domestic) CPU on the market.  The P4 2.2Gig may be faster but it's not commercially avalialble yet.  Once you factor in price the AMD wins hands down.<br>
<br>
There's no difference in stability between the Intel and AMD platforms.  The chipsets for the AMD CPU's may have been unstable (ie. VIA266 in the early days) but they aren't today (ie. VIA266A).  The VIA133a was a very stable chipset.  In terms of expandability and headroom, once again there's little difference.  Intel are more likely to change socket configurations, connectors layouts, etc. than AMD.  Do your own research if you don't believe me.  Just look at history.<br>
<br>
The only things that use the enhanced instruction sets at the moment are those developed by Intel for demonstrations.  The AMD XP is fully SSE compliant.  By the time SSE2 becomes mainstream the next generation AMD will likely support it too.  Given the patterns in history the AMD lags about a generation behind Intel in terms of their proprietary instruction sets.  However, things like SSE are hardly the be all and end all of performance considerations.<br>
<br>
Intel brainwashing is obviously prevelant on this board.<br>
<br>
Have a look at http://www.tomshardware.com and http://www.anandtech.com to name just 2 good hardware sites for some technical reviews.<br>
