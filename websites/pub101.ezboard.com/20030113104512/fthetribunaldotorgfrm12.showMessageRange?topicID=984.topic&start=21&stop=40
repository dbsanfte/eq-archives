your guild's ebay franchise <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I didnt say who was part of the franchise, but you did have one, with people you worked with, according to you, who delivered your goods and even kept up with the ebay business when you got out. I never said your whole guild was part of it, just some other members then just you. Your franchise for defination was a small group of your friends within the guild who helped you aquire, sell and deliver items for you. That was the franchise within the guild you tried to grow, not everyone in AoK ebayed and many discouraged it, but not you and your group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Perhaps you would like to talk to some of the other leadership on the subject who you just accused of ebaying<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Who did I accuse of ebaying? Did I name any names? Did I say who in particular, and more so, I was talking about a small group of your friends from AoK who were ebaying, not SI, when SI was formed, it was common knowledge that the guild leaders coming in to form SI were adamite about a no ebay clause, now are you telling me, with your admitted past of ebay selling/buying, that they made this one clause on a whim, or was it just for your reputation or the reputation of your friends who also ebayed, or perhaps like you have said before, encouraged others to do it, as it was a quick way to make some cash. More players then just you were involved in the ebay scandal, but since you felt you got away with it, you ran your mouth about it, focusing the attention on you. So tell me again, if I was speaking about you and your friends who were ebaying from within AoK ( your franchise ), how does that translate to accusing SI leaders of ebaying, it looks like its a ploy for support from SI members. You have admitted to having partners in past posts, so my accusation has some basis, and more so I dont accuse the current leadership of SI of ebaying, so stop trying to put words in my mouth or spin it so you can get some back up when it doesnt even involve them. Lets break it down for you.<br>
<br>
1)So you are saying that Sol Invictus was an ebay franchise? <br>
  Nope, was talking about your crew from AoK.<br>
2)Does this encompass every member of Sol Invictus? <br>
  If I am not talking about SI then this question doesnt hold water, but I am sure there are some members left over from your ebay crew from the old AoK.<br>
3)who were the members involved?<br>
  You tell me, you are so willing to reveal customers of yours that burnt you or your friends, or insulted you on a board, that you should have problem revealing your buddies in this.  Now you did say you had a friend who helped deliver the items who took over for you, and more so you have been shown to encourage old AoK members to ebay as a quick way to make money. <br>
4)How were the items sold?<br>
  From your ebay crew in AoK, apparently through paypal and your ebay account ICUCME or something to that effect that you and your &quot;friend&quot; which could be more then one.<br>
5)If they were sold on ebay, what was the name used to sell them?<br>
  I dont know all your ebay cover names, sorry, but you might of done a good job covering your tracks, but ICUCME was one of the accounts you used. <br>
6)If they were sold direct, please post up any material you have proving that such a thing was done.<br>
  You have admitted to selling and buying items and characters on ebay, one being the monk named Hotcraw whose name you had changed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Sol Invictus does not tolerate ebaying of items. It's been that way since the guild was formed.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yep they wrote that clause in for you and whatever friends you had with you ebaying, they were worried about your reputation, and your past history of encouraging people to ebay to make quick cash if they could get away with it. That is why I said this. I never said SI did tolerate or encouraged it, I said you and your friends did, your little franchise.<br>
<br>

There are a few more then that, two from the old elitists who you used to tell your friends you helped bring down, Serone and Vanilla, I think you told our group once that you emailed their selling list to VI, though I wasnt playing on DM, I was playing on another character, a dark elf cleric who no longer plays. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
Perhaps that wasnt the deal, but I do know you did have communications with Verant about your ebay history and how you told them you were no longer doing and when you did it wasnt restricted by EULA, but ironically enough, your buddy who was delivering the goods for you, kept doing it, tell me, didnt he get busted with the help of the information you provided VI about your ebaying past?<br>

I give you great credit for actually posting the information, but be careful, that information can be used in a bad way, that is the point of all this, that you have just opened the door for all the freaks on the world wide web to come after you and your job and your family. That is the point of all this, perhaps when something happens to you as a result of this, you might begin to understand how dangerous of game you are playing by posting this information.

With this information, someone can either hurt you ( I pray they dont ), or assume your identity and get credit cards in your name, buy large expensive items, basically identity fraud and the downfall of this, if you kept it private by not posting it somewhere where people can come look at it free, and without any checks you are inviting some terrible things to happen and come your way. If someone searches this information out, there is trail, but when you post it, you dont know who has it now and what they will do with it. That is the point I am arguing, by posting the information, you dont know who has it and what they are going to do with it.<br>

What do you think might happen now? If your life is intruded on, it isnt unprovoked, you provoked it by posting the information, so anything that happens lies on your head, dont you understand that? If something terrible happens, you might regret posting this information because some people see as an invitation, and some people who might want to do you harm, now have an access way they might not have had before.<br>

It was retribution, you could of turned the information over to the police department and us post office ( mail fraud ), and they would of helped get the money back to those who had been wronged, you posted the information perhaps partly to be helpful, but you had to know he would also have been harrassed, and what if you were wrong, what right would have to do bring an intrusion into his real life unprovoked?

Now show me where I have slandered you. Did you or did you not sell/buy EQ items/characters <br>

<br>
With the libel, you really have to a stretch to prove libel in a forum like this, this is the flameboard, most everything said here can be considered libel if you really wanted to stretch it, but you wouldnt get a court in the world to convict someone of libel from a board where they themselves are guilty of libel. It is considered a back and forth and a wash. Or do you really believe you havent written slanderous statements about me and my artwork??? or anyone else???<br>

Ha, I knew you would restort this, as you are hopelessly lost.

Looks to me that I am presenting my observation of the facts as they stand. You on the other hand tried to say I was implicated SI in your ebay franchise, which I was clearly not.

Sorry Rynnia I would have to be talking about SI, and I wasnt, nor was I talking about all of AoK, just your little posse of ebay friends, who did ebay, which doesnt make it slander.....sorry. Its so sad to see you resort this on a flameboard, but like I said, even if you tried to make a case for it, it wouldnt stand, I didnt slander you or SI, trying to say I did, can also be construed as slander and we can play slap and tickle all day with slanderous talk on the flameboard.

Sorry pal, but you are the one propagating the use of private information, be it based on true information or not in a public forum, I just put the information out there like you, so what comes of it, isnt my responsibility, or are you contradicting yourself, that anything that happens to you from information ( you did ebay )on a public board isnt my responsibility...right, that is what you were proposing. <br>
<br>
Any harassment you recieve though isnt because of what I posted though, because it has been posted before, by you, so in effect, all harrassment you recieve in fact your fault, the republication of said statements you have made before are actually what will be responsible for any harrasment your guildmates recieve, so in effect you are responsible...wow, this Rynnia logic comes in handy...also, since I didnt implicate SI like you like to propose ( which is slander by you of me ), any harrassment that comes from that comes from you again, as you made the assumption it was SI I was speaking about when in fact I didnt name any guild, and didnt say SI was full of ebayers, but that is what you believe I said and wish to propogate that idea, any reprecussions are again your fault buddy.<br>

Um, no I think I clearly demonstrated how wrong you were in assumptions and your febel attempt to cast me under the net of slander on a flameboard for godsakes. I did look up slander; here it is again, for you<br>
    Slander-the utterance of false charges or misrepresentations which defame and damage another's reputation <br>
<br>
Explain to me the false charges and misrepentations which have defamed you. OMG people know of your ebay past know, how will you ever cope, oops that was already out there, you posted that you had a friend delivering the last of your orders for you and taking over for you, so there was more then just you do ebaying, you also farmed items for the purpose of selling on ebay with people in game who were fully aware, ( according to you ) that the items you were farming were going to sale on ebay. How does me bring up your ebay history and your friends ebay history defame you any more then you have defamed yourself or damage your reputation....you reputation was so trashed like I said, SI had to put in clause of no ebaying so they could start with a clean slate and they couldnt be questioned because of your reputation, I never SI ebayed, merely they made the clause for you because of your damaged reputation. I am still waiting for false charges....you told me about Serone and Vanilla in group chat, so its my word against yours, but it doesnt equal a false charge. You did post two people's real life info on this board, and you had admitted to that, so thats not false, please I am dying for this false charge I have made against you. Sounds like you got desperate and pulled out the slander/libel card without thinking.<br>

I would jail a gun seller if he sold guns to anyone regardless of age or criminal background. You gave out private information to people you dont know and dont know what they are going to do with it, so if the gun seller gives the gun to a minor on crack who has just threatened his parents ( Mind you the seller doesnt care as he is just putting the gun out there for anyone ), then when the kid shoots his parents, guess who they come after....umm yeah.....good example, keep making my own case.<br>

Yeah I will admit that was a pretty stupid example, sorry bout that one, didnt really make too much sense. I was trying to show you such an outrageous example that you might understand that you dont really have the right to post that information because you feel wronged and more so to show that their are consequences to your actions. I wont say its classless or clueless, but it was to make you realize that you are held responsible for actions in some way. Oh and no I wasnt using what happened on 9/11 as an example in comparison other to say, we never know what will happen so dont take anything for granted. Stop trying to garner support by making it look like you felt terrible and the evil Darkmask didnt feel anything for the victims of the attack. See in a way this could also be construed as slander.....omg I love it, anytime someone says something mean that isnt based in fact we can say slander and libel now!!<br>

Yep I crossed the line in that post and when I thought about it, I didnt have enough information to make a case about it, and I did apologize to you, almost two years ago......does that mean I havent garnered any new knowledge about you, that perhaps I felt bad because I thought you were half decent back then and come to find out what a piece of shit you are. I didnt post any untruth about Sol Invictus, I didnt post any untruths about you now, and your ebay past, I posted information I have gleamed from you from your various posts over the last two years. So does my apology still apply from two years ago? Um, no, sorry but I apologized for one post because I took it too far and was downright mean and like I said, back then I thought you might be a half decent guy, but I learned otherwise, from your posts, your constant button pushing you love to do, you moronic posts, you whining posts crying for people to stop picking on you but you are so willing to push others buttons or pick on them. Yeah I thought you were half decent, but I was wrong, if I knew then what I know about you, I wouldnt have sent you an apology, I would of realized I was right on the money about the piece of shit you are. <br>

Isnt that what you did when you posted DV's info, and this Jason's info, you posted their crap publically and beat your chest, so you are no better, get off your high horse. I apologized because I thought I was wrong and I that I might of hurt the feelings of a nice guy, but it turned out you are a whiney bitch who would sell out his friends to get ahead and delights in fucking with people for a rise. I am touched however you kept my email for two years, you must be frothing at the mouth to post it, to use it as a weapon, is that why you kept it for two years.....? Thats fucking pathethic.<br>

<br>
The United States is by far the most powerful nation in the world.  We have enjoyed the ability to reach out to other nations, shove our democracy down their throat, kill millions of them and never have any war reach our homeland since Pearl Harbor.  Sept 11 reminded us that we are touchable.  We didn't learn the lesson of 'we must be nicer now', we just upped the killing.<br>
<br>
I have a wavering faith that we will not abuse this power too much, but know that other countries are afraid of us now.  We can act with little or no impunity, there is no one strong enough to stand up against us.  This concerns me.<br>
<br>
If everyone was fully open to reprecussions for every action wether online or offline - whether right or wrong, people would inheirently become far less brazen, and far more meek, and the world would be far more peaceful.... and maybe far less interesting, but that's peace.<br>
<br>
Even the rich  and shameless in our own country enjoy a heathy dose of impunity and can get away with murder.<br>

By posting that I had a &quot;franchise&quot; and that &quot;friends&quot; from my guild were involved, without posting who said people are and or proof, you bring the whole guild suspect.  As such, you slander SI.  And yes, this is the flameboard.  Doesn't change the principle.<br>

It's totaly public information, but I'm too lazy to go look it up by doing a search on your name at the DMV. You shouldn't mind posting it here since it's public information, right?<br>
<br>
Once some total freak has your name and your social security number (since you admitted like a dumbass that your SSN and drivers licence are the same) they can play a game that is fun and profitable for them. They will apply for a department store card using your name and SSN, then charge it up to the limit and never pay it. If they use your home address then you're lucky because you'll get a bill and can start disputing it. But if they dont use your home address you wont find out for a year or so when you try to get an appartment and can't because your credit is totaly shot.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me this can't happen because it did to a friend of mine already. It's called identity theft and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, including you Rytardia. It's a painful process that can take years to straighten out with TRW and equifax. This public information as you call it, really is something you need to protect as if it were private. And it's the reason we don't want it posted on our messageboard.<br>
<br>
One could argue that a car is a private thing that is exposed publically. You can tell everyone that it's yours by registering it. But just because it's legaly yours should you always keep the keys in the ignition and unlocked? When someone wants to randomly steal some car for kicks will they go after the car with the alarm or the one with the keys in the ignition? <br>
<br>
Rynnia, when it comes to the internet you are definately a keys in the ignition kind of person. Life is all about risks and you are not living on the edge by posting your info, you're being a giant gulible dumbass ready to be taken for a long ride. It's going to be rough trying to develop any sympathy when something fucked up happens to you because of your distorted views on how the internet should be run. I'm sure you'l brush this off using the amazingly logical reasoning of: Well, nothing bad has happened yet. Wow! Good luck, thrill seeker. The train track are right over there, please let me watch you dodge those trains.<br>
<br>
The internet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should be</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a nice happy community and we should all respect eachother so much that no one will ever be screwed over by our fellow citizens. But the same can be said about our cars on the streets. And yet we still lock our cars and keep our keys in our pockets because even a child knows <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the reality</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is there are fucked up people out there. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if alot of them play EQ. In fact, I'm willing to bet any amount of money on it.<br>
<br>
If you want to go through life posting your public information, as you call it, on every webboard you read and leaving the keys to your car in the ignition, that's your own business and I can't stop you. But don't put the keys to other people's cars on the sidewalk and then claim no responsibily if something happens. If you know someone's identity keep it to yourself, Kojack.<br>
<br>
You have posted numerous times that Ebay of EQ stuff isn't so terrible and you don't do it any more only because VI says you can't. You've also posted that there's nothing wrong with posting someone's publically available, yet personaly sensitive, information for any crack smoking anonymous loser to see. I think it's safe to say you are in the minority when it comes to socialogical values in both these cases. You should be wondering why you're one of the very few that thinks like you do right about now.<br>
<br>
PS: States do not have the right to make you use your social for drivers license tracking purposes. If you are the least bit serious about protecting your SSN (which is 100 times more important then your car) you should tell them they can't use it, and to reassign you a new number. This is how my friend got fucked over. Hawaii uses SSN for drivers licenses and he got burnt hard by some fuck who saw his license once but memorized the name and number. Gay ass fucking dickless losers out there. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

But the people you condone having their information posted have never posted anything about anyone either. If you follow your own logic you might see why people become upset about posting stuff like this.

Why can't I have your SSN Rynnia? Come on it's public imformation. Just stop being a little bitch and post it for everyone to see. What's the big deal?<br>

Hey, I know why you are reluctant to post your SSN! BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF MY FUCKING BUSINESS! You are just some dork who plays the same video game as me. End of relationship!

The guy in the cross-post link that was put up, had his public information (no matter how you look at it) posted because of something he did IN everquest. All the examples being brought up are incidences where RL information was exposed for actual crimes they commited. I don't neccessarily agree with that method of reporting him to the authorities, because I think a decent person would keep as few people as neccessary involved (basically its nobodies business other then the criminal, the victims, and the authorites). But I wouldn't say that the person who commited the crime wasn't asking for it to happen, and therefore as mean spirited as it would be to post his information to a messageboard of bloodthirsty spectators, it wouldn't be wrong. But like I said before, doing that is being as underhanded as the guy who commited the crime.<br>
<br>
My question is; is it right to list all of this guy's info with the hopes that people take it and ruin his life, justified for the things he did in a *game*. There was no real crime. There was no real money or real property stolen. Did he deserve to have his RL put in jeopardy? I argue that it was wrong. That the maximum extent of this guy's punishment, should be to make his EQ experience and reputation as misreable as possible, to the point where he quit playing because he could no longer walk anywhere without being noticed and harassed. That is the closest thing to incarceration that is possible in Everquest; a game where you reputation is one of the most important factors. But did he deserve to have his RL brought into play? That is point I made before, and that has been overlooked since the beggining of this thread. It's moved onto a pissing contest (and a damn good flamewar I must admit) with people accusing and justifying the actions of using RL info to bring RL internet-masked criminals to justice. *That* was never the issue, but thats what this has become about. So if no one want's to focus on whether or not Malakai Iscariot, deserved the treatment he got on that board, I got nothing left to contribute. flame on. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162713" target="_blank"><b>Croneus Titanis</b></a><Br>

<br>
I didn't get to read the thread where his RL info came out, seems it was deleted.  From reading the other one though, seems to me he was a low-down piece of shit with some serious esteem problems who took the trust of an entire guild and quashed it for money then openly laughed about it -- so whatever he got, I'm sure it wasn't enough.  Fuck the little bastard, I hope someone wrestles the gun away from him and makes him break down and cry.  With any luck, press someone wound that tight hard enough he'll off himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucroneustitanis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Croneus Titanis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 614<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/1/02 8:58:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.animatedgif.net/cartoons/flhumpy_e0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hey Rynnia</span><hr size=1> It's people with that mentality, that I'm really afraid of. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162713" target="_blank"><b>Croneus Titanis</b></a><Br>
