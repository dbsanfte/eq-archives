Kinda sounds like what wil happen within a few months if we go to war...<br>
<br>
And if you're going to use that Black Hawk Down somali militia reference, you might want to include some more objective facts, dumbass.<br>
<br>
Like- a) The person the Americans were attempting to overthrow was a Somalian warlord who was stealing international food supplies and using them to further his own dominance. 250,000+ people died of starvation alone under his reign. When <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> his</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> militia shot down American black hawks over the small portion of the city that was still hostile, they responded by going into the city to rescue their own fucking men. Leave no man behind and whatnot. <br>
<br>
To say that it wasn't fucking justified is just ignorant. Look at the whole damn picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Hiroshima... we were at war. They fucking attacked *US* first... you know, Pearl Harbor? Japan had steadfastly refused to surrender, leaving us with no choice but to deliver the fatal blow. The choices?<br>
<br>
a) Send a massive amounts of troops in to Japan, resulting in huge casualties, American and Japanese<br>
<br>
b) Nuke them, spare the American lives.<br>
<br>
From a utilitarian standpoint, at least, there isn't a reason in the world not to choose choice b.<br>
<br>
Just remember that the war against Japan was done completely in response to an unprovoked attack on our men. They got greedy, seeing that we were all that stood between them and Pacific dominance, tried to fuck the fleet over, and the rest is history.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Atom... you fucking disgust me. It's because of blatantly fucked up, flagwaving bigots that my Muslim friends are scared for their fucking safety quite often in this country, regardless of the fact that they're just as appalled about 9/11 as we all are.<br>
<br>
And Bush sucks. Honestly, I have total confidence in my ability to do a far better job with the economy than he did. He fucked it up, and, the way he's going now, he's going to fuck up diplomatically even worse.<br>
<br>
What did Canada, Colin Powell, and Kofi Annan, among others, say? Don't go to war, or at *least* don't do it until you have some ground to fucking stand on. You think the middle east is fucked now? Wait until we overthrow the Iraqi government, and they are both more hateful towards the US and more unstable than they were before. That'll be fucking <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p><center><img src=http://web.ecomplanet.com/P6020/ServerContent/MyCustomImages/P6020CustomImage0091544.gif></center>

Is that terrorism?  Well...some will say yes, some say no.  Of course some of those protecting Manuel were civi's...and you can thus take that stand that this was terrorism by the US.  <br>
<br>
Operation Just Cause (Panama).  Again...as Wenin said, this WAS a military operation, gone cluster sadly.  It also was a major jolt to the US, losing face internationally.  And as he said, civilians die in war.  Period.<br>

People start conversations, say things, and generalize. Does this mean everyone of them deserve it? No. When we talk about Japan bombing Pearl Harbor, do you think EVERY Japanese person was for it? No. I am sure there were a few against it, but what their leader chose, brough sufforing upon them all.<br>
<br>
When I talk about muslims, do I mean them all? No. I may say I do, but like I said before, I was mad, generalizing, and kind of getting ahead of myself. You have to understand Mr. Osama Bin-towelhead, is a muslim. As being such, people all over the world turn a pondering eye towards any muslim they see now.<br>
<br>
If Bush fucks up, and invades Iraq, do you think they will pin eveything on Bush? Or do you think they will generalize it to say that the American Public was for it. Even if 40% of the American Population doesn't support it, its not what we, the Americans see, its what the rest of the world sees. Americans being stupid fucking idiots and finishing a job that should have finished right the first time 10 years ago.<br>

In closing, I just want to remind everyone, I am racist. Don't deny it. I hate Trolls, Ogres, Barbarians, and Muslims alike. Get over it.<br>

So in a war it is perfectly alright to exterminate massive amounts of civilians?<br>
<br>
Because that is basically what you're saying.  That it was ok to to vaporize 150,000 Japanese civilians in 2 bombing runs because it was war.<br>
<br>
The decision was made because the estimates (as faulty as they might have been) claimed that about quarter of a million American soldiers would end up as casulaties if a land invasion of Japan was to commence.<br>
<br>
Now, you might not have signed an official declaration of war with Al-Qaeda or what not, but it doesn't really matter since if Al-Qaeda believes that it is at war with U.S., the tactics that it uses to to achieve our goals are no different from the TERROR tactics that U.S. used to force japan into a surrender in August of 1945.<br>

They FAILED. The religious extremists made it fail, and then blamed the western world for the failure. Not only that, they then blame the western world for their current state.

No, what really happened is that after World War II began Pax Americana and so Americans became belligerent and arrogant.  And thus they spent the last 50 years constantly manipulating countries in the Middle East, pitting them against each other, and supporting their enemies like Israel.  Supplying the Taliban with arms and supplies and training in Afghanistan, Iran Contra, funding Israel, attacking Iraq.  The list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
Dont try to pin the blame back on the countries of Middle East who have never even tried changing to the wastern ways of life and remained primarily fundamentalist to this day like Saudi Arabia.  The countries that have tried western reforms such as Jordan have a strong leadership present in the country to make sure those reforms are accurately carried through.<br>
<br>
America has no one to blame but itself for the constant hate that they receive from the Middle East.<br>
<br>
They are not some religious fools who believe that the Devil is magically helping U.S.  Give them some credit, they are not some backward hicks.  But they are religiously fervent, and will use fiery rhetoric to justify their cause, their actions, even going as far as mentioning the name of the Devil.<br>

Aha, I see.<br>
<br>
So according to you, killing 150,000 Japanese civilians in 2 days was a military campaign.  Invading Panama in 1989 to extract ONE man because he would no longer cooperate with CIA and was deemed to be a liability was a military campaign.  Attacking Cuba in an effort to try and topple Fidel and failing was a military campaign.<br>
<br>
Well, ever consideredd the fact that Al-Qaeda considers itself to be at war with U.S. and thus the 9/11 attacks were a military campaign for them?<br>

What you don't seem to understand is that the japanese were all willing to pick up arms and fight for their cause.  Hell they gave their kids sticks with forks attached to the end to use as a spear.  There were only 2 ways of ending it, and only 1 didn't involve huge american casualties.  Hell if we landed on Japan and did a land campaign there, i guarantee you that there would have been many many more japanese lives lost. <p><center><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdaejafrm46><img src=http://liquid2k.com/surefoot/eondil.gif></a><br>

So this country that is bringing the food attempts to take out the mad man leader of new york who is killing thousands...The leaders suporters take up ARMS (Making them armed COMBANTENTS not people working in a fucking building) againts the troops trying to take out thier leader....Both sides fight new york loses 5 thousand men who suported the warlord who was starving me and my family...Oh did I mention they were all armed and fighting?<br>
<br>
What do I think of that?...If I lived in new york at the time this mad man was starving me? Fuck I woulda been helping whoever was trying to kill him...But hell thats just me as an american and all I would not want to live under tyrany.So no sheb somalia was not a terrorist action.<br>

HAHAHA, oh the irony!<br>
<br>
The fact that you would try to pass off an intended vaporization of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND (150,000) civilians in TWO (2) bombing runs as a &quot;military campaign&quot;!  And yet when an organization (Al-Qaeda) slams 2 planes into civilian targets and kills what is roughly 2 PERCENT (3,000 people) of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki casualties - they are dubbed terrorists.  There was absolutely zero intent to destroy military targets with atomic bombs.  The purpose of dropping the atomic bombs was to terrorize the population into submission, hence it was an act of terrorism.<br>
<br>
You are a blind patriot and a liar who espouses that it is ok for U.S. to attack civilian targets to achieve its goals, but if anybody else does the same (and on a much, much, much, much lesser scale) then they are dubbed terrorists.<br>
<br>
You are a hypocrite.  And since you have ZERO foundation to argue on, you come at me with this horseshit...<br>

Anyways, how were you pitted in Korea and Vietnam to protect the world?  Lets NOT pass off the Korean and Vietnam War as the wars that were fought on behalf of humanity, on behalf of the civilization, on behalf of the world.  They were fought strictly for the interests of U.S. and nobody elses since U.S. was paranoid about having to contain communism.  You werent even wanted in Vietnam and after spending 13 years there, losing 55,000 of your own soldiers, indiscriminately napalming the native population, raping and murdering the native people, you left in 1975, leaving that country completely in shambles and OVERRUN WITH NVA AND VC.  Way to protect the world, tough guy.  But then again, most of the world didnt even give a shit about Vietnam and the war wasnt even supported in U.S.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was hoping to watch some daytime soaps today to further wallow in the Western crapulence of the TV-Land, and to fully westernize myself as a capitalist pig.  Yet I was foiled with all these assinine 9/11 memorial services.  The NY memorial ceremony consisted of people with flags, not even American flags mind you, walking around the WTC crater in circles multiple times like lobotomized sheep.  And I probably had to sit through about 60 different minutes of silences that they had at every memorial service, multiple times, for each tower that collapsed, for each plane crash, etc.  I would rather watch them combine all those minutes of silence into a nice solid 60 minute block and shut the fuck up for an hour. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usashanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sashanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/02 2:33:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> I dont hate America.  I think that its made some amazing contributions to the world in science, math and the humanities due to its incredibly talented population.  I also think that it has made some really awful and tragic blunders.  <br>
<br>
What does piss me off is that the general American population seems to be incredibly stupid and incapable of thinking for themselves.  I learned today that many Americans believed that they were electing George Bush Snr. to the presidency when they elected him.  I dont expect the average store clerk in Des Moines to understand that no president may serve for more than two terms - but I sure as hell expect them to know the difference between a former president and the son of the former president.  You can bet your ass that the average store clerk in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan knows the difference.  (Saskatchewan is a province in Canada mkay?)<br>
<br>
I take back the example about Somalia - because as many posters have pointed out - the situation there really was murky and I believe that the soldiers on the ground (and the Administration for that matter) genuinely believed that they were there to solve Somalia's problems.  <br>
<br>
Yes I was trying to start a fight with my former posts - but only because I want people to stop and think at least for a few seconds.  <br>
<br>
The current push by the Bush administration to go to war with Iraq has very thin support on a global basis - and if you guys go in there - you are going in on your own.  Your closest allies, Canada, UK, Australia, have all said (very politely) that they will not support this military action.  You guys go in there - and you are on your own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucecelsoulhealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cecel Soulhealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/02 2:46:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> Holy Fuck...some of you folks needa look outta the goddamn box once in a blue moon and realize some shit.

<br>
The fact is that U.S. purposely targetted civilian populations in order to TERRORIZE them (which is typically the main purpose of a terrorist act! wow!).  And the reason it wanted to TERRORIZE them was because it wanted them to submit so it wouldnt have to invade japan.<br>
<br>
The amount of American soldiers that would have died attacking japan is irrelevant, because no matter which way you try to twist it - the dropping of the atomic bombs was intended to kill civilians.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the little disclaimer that everyone seems to make, I probably should as well.  I don't hate America, I've lived in it for over a decade.  What I do hate is the blind patriots, the misinformed cretins, and the regular uninformed populace that doesnt even know where Afghanistan is, much less anything else about the global affairs.  The same cadre of halfbaked morons then comes out here and trots out the same trite and predictable cards like Saving the World in WW2, Saving Asia from Communism in Vietnam War, and saving everyone who ever needed saving without even as a smidgeon of acknowledgement for all the wrongs, and all the mistakes that U.S. has committed.<br>
<br>
The fact of that matter is that the American populace cant be bothered to turn off Will and Grace to learn the basic elements of history and why U.S. is hated and loved throughout the world.  That is what I truly hate, the black hole of ignorance and stupidity that U.S. is spinning around in, like a turd in the toilet of the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoctraculapinkerton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Octracula Pinkerton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I put the O in Oh Shit Its That Guy.</span><br>  Posts: 1623<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/02 3:39:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.bullshitjob.com/officespace/peter.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> If you're going to be bigot, try not to be a bigot who is wrong.

The fundamental difference here- We were at war with Japan. We were both engaged in military action, they bombed us first, we tried to get them to surrender, they refused, we finished the job. <br>
It wasn't flying into 2 buildings of a nation that was caught totally off guard for the purpose of starting a war.<br>
<br>
Remember, even the day before pearl harbor, america was opposed to entering world war 2. Right or wrong, we wanted nothing to do with foreign affairs. It took the bombing of our fleet, killing thousands of men, to even get us to fight back. <br>
<br>
To me, the fact that we sought to end a war, while the Al qaeda sought to start one speaks volumes.<br>
