Associated Press<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON - A tax cut advocacy group plans television ads in Ohio, Maine and New York that will focus on lawmakers who opposed President Bush's proposed $726 billion tax cut.<br>
<br>
Republican Sens. George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe of Maine refused to support tax cuts of more than $350 billion, which effectively blocked passage of anything higher than that in the Senate. Republican Rep. Amo Houghton of New York voted against the measure in the House.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not only is this a defeat for the president, it is a defeat for the Republican Party,&quot; said Stephen Moore, president of the Club For Growth, a conservative tax cut group.<br>
<br>
Moore compared Voinovich, Snowe and Houghton to countries that refused to support military action in Iraq.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are his so-called allies in the House and Senate so eager to impede economic progress? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>These 'Franco Republicans'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are as dependable as France was in taking down Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein,&quot; Moore said.<br>
<br>
Marcie Ridgway, a spokeswoman from Voinovich's office, said the senator supports tax cuts but only when they can be paid for without increasing the size of the federal deficit.<br>
<br>
The ads will start Saturday and air in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio; Portland, Maine; and Elmira, N.Y.<br>

<br>
This thing with the French goes far beyond partisan politics and this is really disturbing to me. The French did nothing more than to use their veto power to try and stop something they saw as inherently wrong, but the way the US has reacted to their stance is ridiculous and even somewhat scary imo.<br>
<br>
France is hardly the only country who opposed this war, but they somehow have been targeted for all of our righteous anger over it. <br>
<br>
I think we really need to pull our heads out of our asses and be a little (ok -ALOT) more tolerant of dissenting views. The US is not the ultimate authority on right and wrong. <p><br><br><br>

<br>
We are tolerant of different views. We aren't so tolerant of people like Chirac...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The US is not the ultimate authority on right and wrong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You act as if Chirac was thinking about &quot;right and wrong&quot;. People in his own party are pissed at him and making it known. Most notably are his defense and interior ministers. Both are somewhat in disbelief by the way he treated the US and Britain and do not really want to be assosiated with him anymore. And many others in the country have flat out said he based way too many of his actions on anti Americanism. Not so in Russia(not much anyways), China or Germany. Russia and Germany have now pretty much abandoned France. They too were concerned with Chirac's tone and decisions in the run up to war.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why you think we should be tolerant of France. Chirac beat the shit out of us for months and I would have to say he was definately not too &quot;tolerant&quot; of America's position. He was accused of &quot;forcing&quot; the US into war, by those in his own party. I think we need to step up post war cooperation with Russia and Germany, but keep on further decreasing cooperation with France. If you don't like the way we're reacting now, I think you're going to have to be prepared for even tougher reactions in the near future.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, one interesting note about France, from a recent Washington Post article that was mainly about intelligence sources' take on the quick fall of Baghdad but contained this tidbit at the very end:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The intelligence officials offered a tantalizing coda for conspiracy-mongers.

Tolerant of dissenting views? You are speaking of the US here right?  If we are tolerant of dissenting views, then give Bill Maher his job back.  Give Peter Arnett his job back. Give Michael Moore 10 minutes on the radio to speak his piece. All they had was a dissenting view and had the balls to say something.  Guess they were unamerican.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>M Chirac's popularity remains high at 70 per cent in the latest poll, but senior members of his own party are breaking ranks. Most prominent are the interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has realistic hopes of succeeding M Chirac in 2007, and the defence minister, Michele Alliot-Marie.<br>
<br>
Both believe that France has gone too far in antagonising Washington and neither wants his political future tarnished by association with a failed policy of anti-Americanism. They command broad support on the French Right and share a mistrust for the high-handed and ambitious M de Villepin.<br>
<br>
On the Left, M Chirac's leading critic has been the Socialist ex-health minister, Bernard Kouchner. As a former head of the United Nations mission in Kosovo and a co-founder of the Nobel prize-winning aid organisation Médécins Sans Frontières, M Kouchner is widely respected in France, especially when he talks about human rights and the minutiae of post-war nation building.<br>
<br>
He believes that M Chirac disastrously misunderstood America's determination over Iraq and the change in US attitudes to the Middle East following September 11.<br>
<br>
He accuses France of trivial anti-Americanism and of &quot;breaking the game&quot; on Iraq when it vowed to veto any UN resolution authorising military action. &quot;Afterwards it was impossible. France pushed America into the war,&quot; he said yesterday.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can't find the articles dealing with Russia and Germany's split with France, but I think that's pretty clear without a link. The NATO 'crisis' with Turkey is a good example of anti-war countries distancing themselves away from France's tough talk and bullheadedness as well. Russia and Germany <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/04/wfranc104.xml">stopped  the tough talk</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> almost immediately after the war started, while France continued on as viciously as ever, though they too muzzled themselves somewhat after the images of the statues being pulled down in Baghdad popped up. <br>

<br>
The Maher situation was so much more about money than people not being tolerant of a different view. It was only a vocal minority that spoke up, but during that particular time period a vocal minority could have accomplished damn near anything that was related to terrorism. It was just a couple weeks after September 11th, a vocal minority sent in complaints, it was getting media attention... if you were an advertiser, what would you do? If Bill Maher had instead made his remarks tonight, the situation would be far different, now that bin Laden is daily material for comedies and appears in popular music videos.<br>

The idea is to stimulate the economy.  That might mean running up some debt right now.

<br>
- despite what the Telegraph seems to imply : Kouchner isn't exactly a reference of integrity... i don't have the time to go and dig up some of the scandals his ministry got involved into but i remember it being colorful. &quot;widely respected&quot; is certainly not what comes to mind though. His argument doesn't hold water anyway - but that's the core of the whole debate, so i won't go there for the nth. time.<br>
<br>
- Sarkozy : before this whole mess, Chirac's popularity was going down the toilet. he won the last election by &quot;default&quot; of a credible candidate (his oposition was the &quot;miraculous&quot; second round fascist FN rep...). As the article points out, Sarkozy is in direct opposition : can't expect him to send flowers...<br>
<br>
right now i can't claim that i can make a whole lot of sense of the european late policies, but i don't think anyone can either. 10 new members added this week, the alliances over the war shifting (Aznar has already changed tune and now watch Blair double dipping yet again...)... My lucky guess is that France / Germany &amp; Russia are trying to salvage their investments by lobbying the UN for the &quot;central role&quot; in rebuilding the country. Less flamboyant rhetoric, more behind the scene action. Quoting Shroeder from last week : &quot;we will get our money back&quot; from Iraq. <br>

<br>
The republican's have a problem in that there are a fair number of them in the Senate who are fiscal conservatives, they want to work withing the budget as given.  They don't like excess spending OR tax cuts that lead to more deficiet spending.  If Bush had packaged his tax cuts with compensatory spending cuts he would get everyone in line.<br>
<br>
As to the theory about tax cuts encourageing growth (and in the process increase revenue to compensate)  As my first exhibit I give you the---80's.  It didn't work then, it ain't going to work now, human nature and the government dynamic won't allow it.  Our debt quadrupled in the 80's and it sits at that level to this day.  We pay a huge amount of interest every year.  It can be argued that our current level of debt IS maintainable, but we cannot continueally add to that debt without eventually dragging the rest of the economy down.<br>
<br>
We need to live within our means.  You want tax cut, cut spending, want more spending, better find a way to cough up the revenue for it.  It is just to dman easy for the Federal Government to borrow and spend.  Tax cuts are easy to vote for, someone needs to show some balls and cut the spending, course they won't do that.  For me Democrats and Republicans (except for a few moderates from both parties) are big huge walking windbags of hypocricy when it come to fiscal matters. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

However the skinny of these tax cuts is that they are almost all fair. Many of the taxes that are being cut should have been reqorked years ago. As laws piled on top of laws and tax code piled on older tax code things got fubared.<br>

Until you have what you have today, 3 different taxes on one source of income....<br>

That only proves what a lot of people back THEN said, and still feel today - that supply-side (&quot;voodoo&quot;) economics don't work.  Tax cuts will only stimulate the economy when every dollar given back to someone will be subsequently spent.<br>
<br>
The flaw in reaganomics (and in Bush's current plan) is that it assumes that tax cuts for those who already have money (large profitable corporations and the wealthy) will &quot;trickle down&quot; because it means those companies/people will have more money to employ middle class people - and therefore pump more money into the middle class, who will then spend it and fuel the economy.<br>
<br>
The reality of the 80s (and 1996-2000) was that when corporations had more money to spend - they hoarded it.  Wealthy individuals did much the same.  Very little of that money translated into $$$ for the middle class, who were eager to spend it if they had it.<br>
<br>
Tax cuts for the poor don't help a ton - and tax cuts for the wealthy (including very profitable corporations - companies making money but not a whole lot count as the corporate &quot;middle class&quot; and *DO* deserve tax breaks, since they WILL create jobs and try to grow) also don't result in much money going back into the economy.<br>
<br>
It's tax cuts for the small businesses and middle class where you can be nearly certain every dollar you give them will go back into the economy.  Supply-side is nothing but a joke. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sethry>Sethry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/18/03 3:34:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=635.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqrealms.homestead.com/files/dollies/sethryimg00.gif Height=199 Width=82></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I guess 'Franco' is the new intimidation word</span><hr size=1> Not gonna reply point fer point )  i was just trying to stir some shit while bored and drunk... heh  <br>
