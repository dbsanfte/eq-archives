IF this was a sarcastic remark, your clueless. I have ties with some of your members that goes so far beyond any relationship you might have with them it's not even funny. There are people in Revolution that I have known longer then you have had EQ installed on your Hardrive. Yes, I do have concern for my friends. There were quite a few people who were in Revolution or were contemplating joining after I left Emperium almost two years ago that after I saw you raving about being the &quot;new uber guild&quot; and not being scared of the &quot;ubers&quot; I pleaded with them to leave and find greener pastures. Some left, some didn't.<br>
<br>
Flat out, I heard a rumor Xaviere, and I hate rumors. So I went to the source of the rumor and asked straight out if it was true. After hearing Rifkind's response, until someone can prove to me otherwise, when I hear some know-it-all bashing Revo for going to legends to buy VT power sources I can tell them to stfu.<br>
<br>
Some of the people I was reffering to in my original post replied to this post. <br>
<br>
Also would like to add you apparently have zero reading comprehension because I didn't see the word's YES or NO anywhere in your reply. Just a weak, uninformed flame.<br>

As for being classy enough to ask....it has been asked straight up before, your husband dodged and dipped and danced around it with vauge comments about hair dressers..yet he never had to balls to answer because, he knows what I know...as in above...basically he uses you Riffy to be his nice face to all the shit he pulls, hiding behind you and your reputation...<br>

You are a tool of this ass, and its so sad you dont even realize it.

You heard some rumor .. and it troubled you.. So you posted on the flame board ..   You must not be as close as you thought to these SOULMATES you have in my guild... They could have answered your question for you..<br>

Instead you came here and were condascending ..   Pardon me for not caring what you heard or what you believe..  If any of your friends in Revo still wont leave..  let me know and I'll try and give em a little push.. <br>

The entire point was to get someone of leadership to confirm on deny the shizzit. Not a friend give their honest opinion, or relay the info through the grapevine.<br>
<br>
As for the flameboard, c'mon. This shit has flame potential. People like you will get your panties all knotted the fuck up and start saying the shit you said... it was fucking inevitable.<br>

And, it had to be on the flameboard, so that if (when) you fucking contradicted yourself you could get called on it.<br>

...Just what in the hell is your problem. Did I flame you in my original post? Did I put you or your guild down in some way?<br>
<br>
Let me explain this to you again, and I am going to ask that you read the following without assuming anything.<br>
<br>
I heard a rumor about people from Revolution going to Legends to try to buy power sources for the Vex Thall key. I thought that was absurd. Very soon after though, I had a few people in game mention in passing some joke about Revolution trying to buy their way into VT. Then I see all this crap on the flameboards from SO godam many people that I start to wonder. At this point this rumor is just that, a rumor, and as I said I dislike rumors and rumor-mongers. So I came out and asked a straight up, simple question of the Leader of the guild that the rumor was about. <br>
<br>
How godam hard is this to grasp? What about that simple question did you find pretentious, or self-important? Do you even know what the dam word pretentious means? Your so wrapped up in your need to defend yourself that everything directed your way is de-coded as an attack on you. I wasn't attacking anyone Xaviera, I was asking a simple question. And you didn't even answer it either.<br>
<br>

Members of Revolution have to be the largest group of self-loathing, no-self esteem, weak minded individuals on the server to follow such a poor excuse for a man, much less a guildleader.<br>

<br>
FACT (as opposed to the bullshit rhetoric that Xaveria spews ): Revolution was camping shards.  There is no mistake about this.  They were trying to obtain VT keys, even though they're not a strong enough guild to fight there, or even come close to killing the Emperor. <p><br>

If you have a question for me..  shoot me a tell in game.. <br>
<br>
If you are gonna post it here on the flameboard.. and post it in the PRETENTIOUS and CONDASCENDING manner that you used here..  Expect me to laugh at you for the Slapnutz that you are.. <br>
<br>
Let me know one reason why I should give a fuck about you, your opinion , or who your friends are ? <br>
<br>
If your friends are still refusing to leave Revo..  Please shoot me a tell in game and I will do all I can to urge them to listen to you..  I dont want anyone in my guild who needs YOU looking out for them..  All of MY guildmates and friends are more than capable of looking out for themselves..<br>
<br>
Hey Darkmask..  jump on the crusade to get Fazzy to NAME NAMES of the people in Revolution who are so gullible and weak willed that they need the GREAT FAZZARYA to look out for their best interests.. <br>
<br>
You insult your own self proclaimed &quot;friends&quot; with this post..  I wonder if they are aware how weak and in need of your protection they are.. <br>

Thats an assinine question..  You must have never done exp in the Deep before..  GOOD .. stay out .. EXP sucks there and there is NO LOOT except for the shards.  I recommend everyone stay out until they are ready for Vex Thal.. NOBODY has ANY reason to be in the deep.. Except for Vex Thal keys .  Anyone who goes there is delusional and/or up to something and shouldn't be trusted. <br>

trying to spin WHAT off ?   Fazzy's question ? .. Read my post to Fazzy to find out exactly how important her opinion is to me.. <br>
<br>
I LIKE all these idiots dreaming up these conspiracy theories.. its HILARIOUS ...  I could give a fuck what very few people who are not in Revo think.. and there are even less here on this board I could give a fuck about..<br>
<br>
Whatever you think I did..  I did it TWICE ..  <br>
<br>
and the second time.. I was on the phone with your mother while doing it.. <br>

Umm the xp in both of those camp suck.  Especially the FG royal camp.  Even after giving xp bonuses for higher level mobs you can practically gain more xp an hour turning in crushbone belts.  Anyone who xp's off Shiknar Royals and aren't camping for shards or pathetic loot is delusional or an idiot. <p>Witzy<BR>
