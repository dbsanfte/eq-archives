Where do you fall?</span><hr size=1> Maxa: Don't know if you forgot to mention it or didn't know, but the start of the 1967 war, Jordanian artillery were firing over the border into Israel.  Within hours after the start of the shelling did Israel conduct their &quot;pre-emptive&quot; attacks.  Their Arab countries weren't just &quot;saying&quot; they were going to destroy Israel.<br>
<br>
Radgen: Yes and that point is an interesting one.  Since it would allow the Arabs to continue their war against the Israelis from within their borders far easier.  Arafat wasn't looking after the families that were displaced, he was wanting to put his people in a good position to again attempt to destroy Israel.<br>
<br>
You're also the first person that I've heard suggest that the Palestinians have a &quot;distinct culture&quot;, that they have their own customs.  It does matter how they came to being.  Evertything is centered around these poor displaced souls.  They lost their land passed down for centuries.  When claims like this are made, questions as to the people's origin are created.<br>
<br>
I do, agree that Israel's continued &quot;occupation&quot; of the land obtained in 1967 is one of their biggest problems.  It would be interesting to see how things would have turned out if Israel had given back that land instead of trying to claim it.  But that is to far back in history to really give much consideration beyond dreaming.  I rather like to look at the 2000 talks, and wonder why peace wasn't brokered then.  That was the last time that true peace could have been reached.  Then I'm left seeing who caused that peace to not happen.  When you look at that, what happened 50, 100, 700, 1800 years ago, means jack shit.<br>
<br>
Mistakes and poor decisions have been made by both sides in their history together.  It's good to understand what they were, and how they came about, but attempting to place blame on the living for what the dead did, just doesn't fly all that far.  It's what they do now is all that matters, since you can't change history.<br>
<br>
Tuwene: Israel is a great fighting force, but much of their current abilities are enhanced by US built military equipment.  The 1948 war was fought without any official help from the west, while the 1967 war was fought with US sold equipment.<br>
<br>
Nukes are not a weapon that you ever wish to see used in any way, nor is the Israeli possession of them constitute the Israeli's being able to handle themselves in a fight.<br>
<br>
Your teenage self should have moved to China, where they took the drug offenders out into the city center and shot them.  Leaving their bodies to be carried away by their families.<br>
<br>
Erlaak:  Both sides are filled with fanatics doing what God/Allah told them to do.  Why would it have been ok for one group of people to annihilate another 40 years ago?  When is that ever ok?<br>
<br>
Merton: STFU.  LOL  Did you forget, you don't have a leg to stand on?  You're the one that said he won't give his opinion.  Like being tagged a Nazi, or anti-semite would really change anyone's opinion of you.  What do you care about anyhow? You've said you didn't care what people thought of you, in the past.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, my stance is fairly simple.  I want peace.  So I'd like to have he 2000 agreement to be ratified.  The Palestinians would have their own country, making them no longer the ass end of the Arab community.  <br>

That was actually the original idea put forth by the British after WW2 - to give the jews an indepedent state in the north western regions of Australia. History has shown us how that eventuated...<br>

<br>
The United Nations, and the international community at large, does recognise Palestine as a &quot;nation&quot;, meaning the Palestinians are considered to have their own distinct language, culture, society, etc. However, the international community does not recognise Palestine as a &quot;state&quot;, meaning they have no exercise of sovereignty or control over their land. Palestine actually has the status of being an international organisation under international law.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the chances of peace happening anytime soon are zero. Ariel Sharon is a wanted war criminal and Israel leads the 91 nations currently in breach of UN Security Council resolutions with a staggering unquestionable 32 breaches - and several more which are arguable. While the United States continues to shield Israel from any harm by the UN Security Council using its veto power (upto 73 vetos and 25 abstainations so far), the Palestinians have no reason to believe that peace can ever be a reality that will be legally enforced. That would also be if Israel were even interested in peace, and while they continue to occupy the West Bank, they clearly are not. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jesus saves...with an 8 or better on a d12</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dumai01>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Messiah of the Flameboard</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/03 4:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War on Iraq.

Where do you fall?</span><hr size=1> ARE YOU ALL EXCITED? Dumai has promised to give you his racist views about Palestinians!<br>
<br>
Like all extreme right-wingers, he will deny his views are based on hate and tempt you with a heavy dressing of &quot;evidence&quot; that doesn't actually make sense when you investigate it. He could even give you a few facts, conveniently leaving out the information that completes the story.<br>
<br>
He will try his best to make you feel that because Palestinians &quot;don't exist&quot; in his view, that killing Palestinians is less evil than killing other people. That Jews are absolutely right 100% of the time and that every Palestinian is equally guilty and supports terrorism. He will completely ignore the fact that there is terrible wrong on both sides, but more importantly he will ignore the fact that most people are just trying to live their lives and are not even involved, but are still being killed by both sides.<br>
<br>
The historical coincidence that his own side of politics was responsible for the massacre of Jews during WW2 may even be twisted to give today's right-wing Israeli government license to kill at will. If you call him on it, he will inform you that Communists killed people just like the Nazis, serving as a convenient distraction from the fact that any such killing is wrong.<br>
<br>
Right-wing politics is all done to a formula of hate, not heartfelt belief. Dumai is just a disciple of right-wing web sites that exist to support the belief in getting richer by destroying the environment and abandoning minority groups such as the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
So come on Dumai, give us your biased links! Maybe some pastes from right-wing columnists? Let's see.<br>

The U.S. had strong Anti War setiment, As did Britain And France, Instead of correcting the problem with Force (Which would have saved tens of  Millions), They chose to not interfere with Germany...<br>

Alot of people hold the blame for the massacre of the Jews, But I doubt it was any one side Liberal or no...The fact is Men with Power chose to do NOTHING in the face of a manical Dictator that was taking agressive actions and building his military....<br>

Would you sign a treaty with someone who, while shaking your hand and smiling, is still stabbing you in the back?

<br>
Erlaak, how was Israel a threat in 1967, that initiated the attack from the arab nations surrounding it?<br>
<br>
If being an invader is all that is needed to qualify a nation to be placed on the list of erradication, I suppose you would have supported the erradication of Russia, UK, Canada, and the US as they invaded various nations when fighting in WWII?  Of course you wouldn't, they were attacking in defense of themselves.  Much like Israel invaded Jordan and Eygpt in 1967, as they were reacting to being attacked first.  Anyhow, Israel wasn't a colony 40 years ago.<br>
<br>
Since you're able to understand the Palestinian hatred of Israelis, you should also understand the hatred Israel has for Arabs.  In the end, so what?  They hate each other, intensely.... and??<br>

Horton is a &quot;human shield&quot; for Arafat and/or Hussein who was interviewed for this article.  My point, however, and its relevance to the turn this thread has taken is contained in the following quote:<br>

“Horton had to enter Israel under false pretenses, pretending he was a backpacker going to party at the beaches. Once he got past suspicious immigration officers, he went straight to a training session with pro-Palestinian activists in Tel Aviv.”<br>

Jews are not infallible, but Israel is a democracy, the only free nation in the entire region (except for Turkey).  Not every Palestinian is guilty and supports terrorism either, but most of them do, and most of the ones who don't will not tell you so.  Why?  They are not free to do so.  They are not free to truly oppose Arafat or the terrorism which runs rampant through their society and culture.  You will see the occasional dissident; I read an article by the father of a suicide bomber who was sickened by his son's life being thrown away.  Far too many other fathers are beamingly proud.  It is wrong to say that they all support it.  It is not incorrect to say that it is a widespread, culturally accepted and even mandated policy, which is a great deal of the problem.<br>

I am very well aware that nearly every single Israeli would like nothing more than to live their life in peace.

This is where you go so wrong, so often, Grozzer.

I consider myself extremely moderate and can often appreciate some of the things both Grozzer and Dumai say - often on an issue-by-issue basis (I certainly am against US war in the mideast, but I also am horribly against socialism and couldn't care less about the environment).  But watching Grozzer and Dumai argue has the unfortunate effect oftentimes of seeing both of them slip too deeply into the extremes of their ideals and attacking one another on that merit, completely losing sight of the actual issue being discussed at hand.<br>
<br>
I use Grozzer and Dumai's names *only* as good examples of extremists arguing, and the effect it has - this is in NO way meant to single either of them out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 967<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/03 12:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War on Iraq.

Where do you fall?</span><hr size=1> I bet the idea of founding a Jewish nation on land that was theirs and which they lived on for centuries, and millenia even, is not quite so silly to many Jews who are acutely aware of their unique history and role in this world.  Whether you agree or disagree with the judgement that they &quot;deserve&quot; a state on their ancestral homeland, or should even have a state there at all, has nothing to do with the fact that they have one now, unless you are willing to take the position that the Israelis should all be driven out or subjugated, which is what the Muslim Arabs want.  They have proven that they do not want peace... they want Israeli to be destroyed.  All you have to do is listen to the sermons that pour from the (state-sanctioned and funded) imams daily.  Try www.MEMRI.org - it is an excellent website devoted to translating Arabic news releases and quotes into English.  You just might be shocked at some of the things that are routinely said and believed.  That is the primary obstacle that must be overcome.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Wenin, for clarifying that point as well.  One of the primary reasons for which Israel is holding onto the West Bank and Golan Heights is defense purposes.  If the Muslim Arabs could be trusted to actually live together in peace, it would not be such a big deal to give them the land... unfortunately, doing so exposes Israel's soft underbelly, so to speak, militarily.  Were you Israel, would you trust the Arab nations, after their history of unprovoked attacks and virulently anti-Jewish rhetoric?<br>
<br>
The Israelis are willing to live in peace with Arab Muslims.  They would love to do so.  They do not persecute those who live within their borders - that was the point of my quote - that there is such freedom in Israel that pro-Palestinian activists are allowed to set up training camps to oppose Israeli policy!  Unimaginable anywhere else in the region - opposition to the &quot;martyrs&quot; is brutally suppressed and not tolerated in the Muslim world, that is for sure.<br>
<br>
Tuwene - The problem is not people who hold views like Grozzer and Dumai... the problem is when they harden, and begin to believe that not only are they right and the other &quot;side&quot; wrong, but the other &quot;side&quot; is obviously either stupid or controlled by animal emotions to the point where their capacity to reason is impaired... obviously, one or the other is the case since they don't agree with ME.<br>
<br>
I believe that some of the policies advocated by Green or left-wing leaning people have a lot to do with emotion, but that doesn't mean that they are invalid.  People possess different value systems which lead them to draw different conclusions from the same things.  While I am not a relativist, believing that neither side is right, just different, I do believe that both sides are worth listening to as long as their make their arguments in terms of rational explanation based on facts, explained through theory.  The theories might be wrong, for whatever reason... mistaken facts, what have you.  But how is one to learn if not by considering what other people have to say?  What you would label &quot;Extremists&quot;, however, are convinced that their opponents in debate are not rational, but rather irrational and often stupid or immature, making debate pointless, and making their arguments take on more of the character of religious pleas...<br>
<br>
I believe I am right, and I'll tell you so and what I think.  If you disagree, I'll argue and discuss the theories... if I'm interested enough I'll try to find some of the facts those theories are based on.  You still may not be convinced, but that's ok... people draw different conclusions.  A lot of the time those conclusions are drawn based on underlying beliefs or a weltanschaung that is too dearly held to accept the others' conclusion.  That's basically how these sort of debates work out, and both parties walk away hopefully more informed and entertained.  When one party sinks to the &quot;You're obviously just a stupid airheaded emotional idiot&quot; level, though, it turns the whole thing into a Flameboard style post, which as enjoyable as they can be, is not what I come to this forum for...<br>
<br>
Oh, and ditto to Wenin's next post... I was honestly surprised at the time with how much Israel was willing to give up for peace, not just in terms of land but security as well, since that is what the land essentially grants... and then to have it all thrown back in its face! <p>Caledhon TelRana - Champion<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701"><br>

Erlaak, I'd side more on the Palestinian side if 1967 never occurred, or if Israel had started the 1967 war. Your claims of Israel wanting all the land is laughable, since they wouldn't be in the west bank if it wasn't for their neighbor's aggressions. Jordan and Egypt picked a fight and got their asses handed to them.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You know, if my claims are laughable, so are yours, when you say that Palestinians wants it all. They fight because they're fed up.<br>
All right, should i say the extremists want it all, on both side? I think that would be better. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And tell me something : if the Israelis (again, i don't like to say &quot;the Israelis&quot;, and i don't like to say &quot;the Palestinians&quot;, it generalizes too much) don't want the whole territory, then why the hell did the Israelis started to build new colonies in Palestine after they had agreed (Rabin government actualy) to stop? I mean... at last they were *almost* in peace, some Israelis and Palestinians even lived together... and were friends!<br>
They very well knew that the dust had just started to settle down...<br>
and that such a move would set the powders on fire again... that and all what i said above (the &quot;stuff&quot; that resulted into the 2nd Inti Fada).<br>
<br>
If someone knows, if i missed a part of History, please tell us.<br>
<br>
I'd like to know a few things : at that time, could they afford to occupy all the conquered countries, knowing that there would be a strong resistance?<br>
<br>

Until the occupied country gives up the land (Palestine recognized the existence of Israel when Arafat and Rabin agreed) i'd say.<br>

Islamic Jihad... check out their releases, and what they stand for.<br>
<br>
Palestinians, Saudis, Egyptians, Jordanians, Syrians, Moroccans (they fought too), all want Israel destroyed utterly.  They will take what they can get, they will lie to Western governments and media, claiming they just want peace too, but they then tell their own people over and over that they promise to utterly destroy Israel.  The PLO has done this, and said exactly that.  Recently.<br>
<br>
I will help you:<br>
<br>
This one's positive... unfortunately opinions like this are far too scarce.  <br>
