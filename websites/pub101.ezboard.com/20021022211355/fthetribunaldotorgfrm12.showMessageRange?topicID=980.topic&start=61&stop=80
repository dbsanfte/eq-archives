Its a good thing.<br>
Those that speak out against it dont have it.<br>
My advice..<br>
Get it. &quot;<br>
<br>
Phalanx aside here....<br>
<br>
Does this mean when 50 retards get off a bus and start yelling like Corky Thatcher when the aliens came down (or so he thought) that that is comraderie?  It is.<br>
<br>
If I was subjected to that constantly it would get fucking annoying.  If it was obtrusive to the point it was infringing upon me, I might speak out against it.<br>
<br>
Would I be jealous?   No.  Comraderie is shown in many different ways.  Spamming a zone with shouts may be one.  Perhaps other guilds spam their own guildchat with WOOHOO! or the like.  Some may be fairly quiet and content with a silent company.<br>
<br>
<br>
The age old argument of &quot;You are only complaining because you are jealous&quot; which is essentially what you are saying here, holds little weight.  I enjoy the comraderie of my own guild.  I enjoy the celebration in guildchat when we accomplish something.  I prefer that over zonewide shouts or a silent acknowledgment (dunno if any guilds do that.... but I bet it's freaky! : P ) and as such, would not be jealous of either, because I am content with my own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugoombahdelgato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GoombahDelGato</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/28/02 8:05:35 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dusted.net/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Phalanx</span><hr size=1> Jesus christ mor, i didn't know you could articulate so well =D<br>

<br>
i joined when they &quot;absorbed&quot; AoS.. which, btw, absorbing other guilds doesnt really sound very nice.. but anyways...  after 4 days, i have yet to see so much as a &quot;hello&quot;  from anyone in guildchat.  &quot;anyone need a chanter?&quot;  --no answer, ever..  no big deal, i go off with my friends.   <br>
<br>
an old friend notices my Phalanx tag..  he says &quot;Phalanx is known for screwing smaller guilds and then tagging them to make themeselves look bigger and stronger&quot;    ......not a very nice rep there guys.<br>
<br>
same day:  a friend from the AoS days is told -no- by 3 different enchanters when she asks for clarity and the reason?  she's in Phalanx.   thats just stupid.  <br>
<br>
within 2 weeks, at -least- half of the people i knew in AoS had removed themselves from phalanx.     all they had to say was how self-righteous Phalanx is and how horribly they were treated there.  <br>
<br>
oh yeah, and if you agree to absorb a guild, dont tell -member-   of guild they cant join, because they're too low lvl.   if you take a guild in, you take the whole guild.. its not a pick and choose operation.<br>

<br>
Someone reminded me recently where I first saw your name Moron.  It was in Kael arena (right side to be specific).  You wanted to come tag faction or some shit like that.  Not a big deal but the problem is shit for brains you brought half the mobs from between see invis to the arena with you when you came.  Trained us and died in the process yourself.  We debated for a few minutes on whether to give you a revive or let you get your exp back.  Let's just say you're lucky Celby is as nice as she is.  Most of group died on that little stunt of yours.  <br>
<br>
So if that's a comment on your &quot;skill&quot; as a monk I don't know how you made it to 60.  <br>
<br>
You were in Trans at the time, and it was also the same day Yommomo (or whatever) insulted one of our clerics then trained us and died, then couldn't understand why we didn't rez him.  I got a real bad taste in my mouth for Trans that day.  My opinion of Trans has changed a little since then, but my opinion of  you sure hasn't.<br>
<br>
So great Phalanx has given you a second chance.  Maybe you've pulled your head from your ass.  My opinion once an idiot always an idiot, you got that tag long ago in my eyes and you have shown how much you deserve it since then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrufgrifteer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gruf Grifteer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/28/02 11:10:52 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.epiccenter.com/EpicCenter/images/artist/discography/EK65747.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nevermore</span><hr size=1> you win some you lose some, but i did get ya in the first round, Mage - pet = dead<br>

Doregin... I'm not sure what /ooc'ing you're talking about other than me laughing my ass off while VS slaughtered everyone. We did have a lot of FL there, but it was very obvious that we had no chance of killing him before anything happened and we evac'd most everyone out and back to CS for DN. The few of us that were left behind (about 5 or 6 except me ~thx feign) all got slaughtered when 'whoever' pulled VS to the zone (I'm not pointing fingers... there was some level 55 paladin who was shouting to the zone constantly 'SOMEONE PLZ PORT ME OUT OF VS ROOM... leading you to wonder how the fuck her got there in the first place, much less what happened when he decided to leave). <br>
<br>
But no, none of us attempted a misguided pull, we left as soon as we realized you guys had a sizeable force in the buff room. Going ahead and pulling something like that would be a real Loveseeker move. ALSO, while I'm at it, I helped with the CR on a few of your members after that cocked up slaughter. I don't have any problems with your guild.. there are actually some damn good people in it.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand, seem like a fucking dick. I hope you got your ass eaten up first. <p><IMG SRC=http://pacifictrim.homestead.com/files/strife.jpg>

<br>
First of all, what was the point of this thread?  Someone didn't get into Phalanx?  Someone doesn't like them?  I'm proud to be not only a member of Phalanx, but also an officer.  And I'm proud at this point that we didn't take someone who would start a thread like this.  If you aren't mature enough to come to our board and state your feelings, then you don't belong with us.<br>
<br>
As far as VS, I wasn't there this weekend, I don't know what happened.  Phalanx doesn't run around zones training people.  We don't have to.  We have the force to kill things, if something goes wrong, we clean up our messes.  From this post it doesn't seem like Phalanx did the training, but even if they did, for the love of god, doesn't it happen?  Has no other guild ever had a bad pull and innocent people get hurt?  Obvviously not by this thread, all other guilds are perfect.  <br>
<br>
You are not going to like all of our members, as I don't like all of the members in every other guild.  We give people a shot, if they do not live up to the Phalanx standards while they are a member, trust me, we have no trouble guildremoving someone.  We set very high standards for our guild, and our members.  We do not take someone because they are an unguilded level 60, we are not trying to make an army, we are trying to make a guild that can kill shit and have fun in the process. <br>
<br>
<br>
Shouting &quot;Danger&quot;, what harm does it do?  We are proud of our guild, and our friendships within.  Trust me, I would rather read a guild shouting a battlecry as they enter a zone, or as they kill something for the first time, then half the shit that I have to read from miscellaneous whiners and people bitching in shout and OOC.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a real problem with Phalanx, I ask that you come to our message board and post your complaints.  Comments on here are taken with a grain of salt.  This is my first trip to the flameboard, and I only came here because someone posted the link to this thread.  I'm sure that is why you see so many posts from our guild.  <br>

Hell, you could probably fucking bitch and an angry female teenager out of sears. It would appear to any normal human being that you are a fucking useless opinionated scrap Loegan. All you do is bitch about how mommy beat you when you were young, aborting fetuses and shit, and how you shoot up drugs and hate it when muslims walk around with guns in Utah. Go run for president or something bro, check your fucking baggage at the door with the others. No one gives a shit that you think on sundays jewish people need to face south america and by some divine right, will them to have food to support people who aborted once on a chinese new year. Most people don't get the experience of smelling the rectums of goats Loegan, why don't you give us a detailed description of it while you lecture us on the ways of John Walker and suicide bombers in the middle east.

Could you please use less words when you say nothing? It's kind of irritating to read a long ass paragraph, only to get to the end and find it had no salient point, no basis in fact and no fuckin entertainment value.<br>

I think Jewish people need to face South America on Sundays? What kind of gibbersh is this shit? Sounds like cult speak to me.<br>
