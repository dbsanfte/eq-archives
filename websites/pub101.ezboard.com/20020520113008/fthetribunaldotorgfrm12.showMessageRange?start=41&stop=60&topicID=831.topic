I was just clearing up the crap in the original post.<br>
<br>
It was inplied:<br>
1) We only went to Ssra to fuck with SI. Not true.<br>
2) We CoH a bunch of people to Rhag 2 in some frenzy to fuck you over. Not true.<br>
3) We somehow prevented your little guild from attempting AL. Not true.<br>
4) You guild leaders were shocked to see us there. Not true.<br>
5) We jumped you because of loot. Not true.<br>
<br>
I don't know why you got jumped last night. Maybe it's because your guildmembers petition for the stupidest cry baby things. Your guild has jumped other guilds before and so have we. You think this post will make the server somehow look at either of our guilds in a new light because our true colors just now shine? You are too bright are you? We have always been better than SI and you will always get jumped. Nothing changed, except now you are petitioning for people inspecting you. Way to go cry baby! Keep it up and the GMs will know SI for the cry babies they are also. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

Why did we do it? Just so you would cry and petition. and I can guess<br>
                                           what the guide told you too since I never heard from him/her.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guide told me that they would contact a GM in chat, that they were the only Guide online and they could not enter a majority of the high level zones in the game.<br>
<br>
Later that evening, about 4 hours later : P  A GM did come online to speak with me, but you were not online.  This GM assured me that the Rhag spawns were usually considered one spawn, since killing one spawns another and they are part of a sequence, and that I would need to petition and speak with Aerendar when he returned next week.  I was told that a majority of the &quot;uber&quot; kills (most things red to 60) are logged as to who kills and loots them and where the loot travels, at least for a time.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           At any rate, I think I'm gonna stop being nice and go back to being the asshole you all love. VI has so fucked up this game to the point that any gimp with 70 people<br>
                                           can kill pretty much anything. I liked it better when ToV was hard, (and yes it used to be).&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah so NTOV is no longer as &quot;hard&quot; as it used to be?  Quite the contrary from popular opinion.  The pulls are definately easier on the Lords and Ladies, but they do have considerably more hitpoints.   Fact is that NTOV was always &quot;easy&quot; but just a time sink, and when it evolved into a 1 day run verant changed it a bit to make it somewhat harder.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           btw rynniabay, keep petitioning me, the word is already out that most of it is all bullshit anyway and eventually the guides and gm's will moan when they see a Rynnia<br>
                                           petition and just delete it.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's &quot;Rynnebay.&quot;   If you are gonna toss that out, please get it right  : )   &quot;The word is already out&quot;   Is this some fuckin' schoolyard here?  (judging from the actions and behavior of some, it may as well be) and most of it is not bullshit.  I'll petition ya wherever and whenever ya try and pull stupid shit again such as your actions last night.  Typically the best course of action when you are in a heated and emotional state is no action at all.  You acted irrationally last night.  Perhaps you should have taken a little afk time.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           Also, I never really had any beef with you before last night rynnia. I never wanted to fuck over SI, but now its personal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok so now you &quot;do&quot; want to &quot;fuck over SI?&quot;  Wonderful.  Look out guys... this time it's PERSONAL!  He never &quot;wanted&quot; to fuck over SI before... (so when he did... it wasn't personal so it was okay) but now we can expect to be fucked over and have the personal nature of the conflict blamed on it.   &quot;Personally&quot; I don't give two shits (yeah baby that's TWO shits) what the fuck you do.  I'll deal with things as the game allows and we'll make due regardless.  If you wish to waste your guild's time and effort &quot;fucking us over&quot; then please go ahead, and let The Companions scoop up all the server firsts.<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           Your guild is still complete shit. I wished Manglodin would come back, he was the only person I've ever talked to in SI that I could tolerate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good job generalizing every member of the guild. : )<br>
<br>
&quot;                                           oh and is Rynnia even the GL now, or one of her characters she bought even? &quot;<br>
<br>
Is that &quot;even&quot; a sentence?  No I'm not the guildleader.  Seems alot of people ask me that, and I'm not sure where that comes from.  I take care of the raids, for the most part, the negotiations with other guilds, especially where rotations and such are concerned.  I play Rynnia and Nosey.
