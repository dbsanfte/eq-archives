<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And now, the winners:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cowdar</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - shaman, alt character of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cowtippy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Ninja looted a flayed barbarian mask from the AoW kill of NGoH.  Turned into a bear at the last minute so no one could see him looting.  Petitions by NGoH finally turned up that Cowdar looted it and the mask was returned.  When NGoH brought it here, the bastard denied it and got all of his friends to back him up for 14 pages.  Turns out he fucked them over too because he was lying.  He finally admitted taking the mask.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fuzzeylyest</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Cleric.  Everyone has a Fuzzy story.  It has all the basic angst of a good novel - training, idiocy, scamming, despair, denial.  PoI seems to be his favorite training ground and he can be found in his private Casino in the Bazaar.  Steer clear of his ninja group invites!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mythmunk,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> monk/ <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mythwinn,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Halfling Warrior. Likes to scam people out of high end items then lie about it.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Markey,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> male erudite necromancer, a killstealing asshole. He is the only person on Thistleburr's ignore list. With good reason. His Markey Mark name gay as shit, but that isn't the reason why he is here. He uses the lowest methods to get what he wants including killing quest turn-in mobs for spite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Oron,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> male human ranger. Huge assbag. He recently kill-stole a triggered quest mob and then fucked his own mother.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kindas</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a male wood elf druid. He helped Oron kill the triggered mob and then helped fuck Oron's mother. Avoid these two. They are extemely fucked up.<br>

Also plays <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Vegas, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> High-Elf Cleric, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Sigfree, </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> High-Elf Enchanter, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>      Clawes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. He is a 31 year old total fucking loser. He will harasses female players of any age into cybering with him. Upon refusal, he goes ape shit on them and does his best to make their game life and sometimes their real life a living hell. Female characters have had to leave our server because of him. He is truly a twisted fuck that our world could do without.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Kaspian,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Necro. Ninjalooted some shit off of Doomshade over a dispute on the kill. Thought he was doing his guild a favor. Not surprising. But they booted his sorry ass. Hopefully he will eat shit and die.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Calabok,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Midlevel Human Warrior. Been caught scamming people in the bizarre. Recently took 15K off one dude. Don't trade with this fucknut or allow him into your guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Supernus,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Dwarf Paladin. Enjoys walks on the beach, Kill stealing, training people, and laughing about it. He played one of Biff's cronies on BTTF. Also he hates his father and lashes out at everyone to expess his anger.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natakaz</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Enjoys training people to take their camps. Likes to hang out with that jackass Supernus. He has been kicked out of at least 4 guilds for his actions. Good luck if you take him into yours.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Ialan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This twisted fuck will lure younger female characters into a bindable KOS area with promises of money or items. He will them start harassing them to cyber with him, and if they reject him, he will bind them, let their invis go out, and let them go through a death cycle. <br>
<br>

Has even managed to scam a Cobalt Breastplate. Also likes to scam while pretending to help with Multiquesting. Or asking to try things on.

Twinks include: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Mamalo. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Apparently, he is an annoying little shit, but the reason he made this thread is because he stole a bag of resist gear from a guildmate who was trying to help him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Loli – </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Moved to a different server. He is a well-known crook who has scammed on multiple occations. If you are so stupid to even let him in your group, do not be so stupid as to let him be the master looter. Also known for training. He is a highly unbalanced Frenchman who will go psycho on you. Putting him on your ignore list is a very very very very good thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>              Alexandr-</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Necro of some sort. Also plays Munyo his monk. This guy has ninjaed more loot that anyone else on the server.

Give me details about them, as in class, level &amp; race. If I feel that they are worthy, I will add them. I also want to hear details on what they have done. I don't want you to say they are dumbfucks or assholes. I want specicicicifity.<br>
<br>
I will then delete your post. If the name has been added, then I felt he/she belonged up there. If  not, then I didn’t.<br>
<br>
If you spam this thread, I will lock it &amp; put your name up there &amp; make some shit up about you. If I get bored doing this, then I will lock it. If virgins are not sacrificed, then I will lock it.<br>
<br>
Also, a side note, I do not want this to turn into a personal grudge thread. I will not post people who you just hate, or who are clueless about their class, who have called you names, you have gotten mad at you over an arguement, or who is just retarded. This is for the true assholes of the Tribunal. THe people who scam. The people who train, the people who are intentionally malicious &amp; seek to cause harm. This is for the Jaya's, not the Jenni's.<br>
<br>
You can fucking bitch about arguements over camps and mobs, but do it on a seperate fucking post on the flameboard. Because I am not going to add your new little enemy to the thread just because you think he is ebayed or he called you names or you and him got in a fight over who was first in a spot. You do that sort of pussy ass crying on the flameboard.<br>
<br>
This thread is for the worst of the worst. The shit piles. Not for whatever fag you have a personal grudge over. It's for the people that we don't know why the GMs have not permanently banned yet.<br>

<br>
First of all, yeah yeah i know... don't give someone you dont know gear ect ect... but i loaned Reconcilation / Liladare ( yes a server transfer) a bunch of gear ( one nice item, some culturlal and a few misc other pieces i had layin in bank) to help give her a leg up and to make her more effective on our raids.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, she disappears for a week straight, when i saw her on tonight, she denies knowing who i am, or that i loaned her any gear and flat out refused to return any of the items. She also claims over 8 people have access to this account /shrug<br>
<br>
She's a server transfer with a changed named ( yeah i know should of brought up a HUGE red flag ) Lvl 65 high elf cleric. Supposedly flagged for Elementals with over 370+ AAs.<br>
<br>
Not tryin to flame here, I'm honestly just giving a warning to all the guilds... She talks a good game, tells you what you want to hear and then pulls the &quot;who the heck are you&quot; card.<br>
I was suckered in by her flags and AAs and how she spoke. Please don't let that happen to you all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Ran into this guy in PoJ the other day. He was kiting thru 2 groups and when his mob attacked me my pet did what it is suppose to do...attacked the mob. He asked me to back my pet off...I did and explained to him that if he had not been kiting thru groups he would not have this happen. He then proceeded to rant and rave in /ooc. He sat in the middle of our group and as our puller pulled a mob and he got he he began nuking and ksed us. When we asked him to stop he began talking about how the mob attacked him and he had every right to attack it. He is a real pain and would NOT go away. We began ignoring him and he started talking trash about all the dif guilds in the group. Needless to say he is now on my /ignore list but I was wondering who (if he has one) his main may be. One of my group members asked if he was Tabbun or Fuzzlyvest(sp).<br>
I know that for most of you this is not a big deal and please dont flame me for asking. Just curious.<br>

First I know that what I am about to say will get scouls and flames but my intentions where good.  I purchased an account, shame on me yes.  The reason was to add the ability for me to bring many aspects to a group for the times I played.  At the time it seemed right and now I know better.  anyway to the point.  <br>
<br>
Balorf the SOB has sold his account more than once and recovered the password to scam people out of money in RL.  He goes beyond fookin you in EQ to bending you over in RL.  then he will tell you some bullshit line like &quot;oh a friend gave it to me&quot;.
