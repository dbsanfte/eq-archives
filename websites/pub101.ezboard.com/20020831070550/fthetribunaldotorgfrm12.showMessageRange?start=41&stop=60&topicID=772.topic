<br>
Arleanna i wont get into detail with a lot of your post, its ok to see things from a diff perspective. It will happen, and often when in reguards to religion and politics there is no way to bridge them. One thing, however i had to comment on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 5. Allowed research into stem cells perhaps allowing a cure for Alzheimers<br>
<br>
This is true, but we are also way behind other counties in this area. A stronger president could have done more.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A stronger president? Explain that to me, cause that is just fucking vague.<br>
<br>
Fact is, in our country, the fanatical religious factions we have are inbedded into our political functions. They are the ones lobbying to stop this research. Using outdated, and down right idiotic reasonings to stop the research. The moral implications are obvious to these people. The realistic details are hard to deal with when you are having money shoved up you ass 2 fist style. So define a Strong president. To be honest, i think thats a double negative<br>
<br>
This research can do more than offer a way to combat Alzheimers, that just happens to be one of the major uses. DNA research lead us to understanding how stem cells are vaulable to people with genetic deseases. With the advances in reguards to cloning, it is possible to some day see these cells cloned with no possible way to use the &quot;human life-abortion&quot; arguement. But SHIT, Cloning is also bad. Guess grandma rots away strapped to a bed in your spare room untill our political process catches up with the free thinking world.<br>

You can't be serious. Ok, you have forced me to resort to posting hard facts. It sucks, but you leave me no choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually I am gonna cheat and copy. Here is a timeline I had that I copied from somewhere (CNN or MSNBC I think). I edited out all the good stuff and just left in the negatives (excluding political junk) for this post.<br>
<br>
----------------- 1993 ---------------<br>
February<br>
A terrorist bomb explodes at the World Trade Center in New York on February 26, killing six people, injuring more than 1,000 others, and causing more than $500 million in damage. <br>
<br>
April<br>
The Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, burns on April 19 after a 51-day standoff between the FBI and the religious sect, killing about 80 of the sect members. <br>
<br>

<br>
October 7<br>
Clinton orders military reinforcements to Somalia after an attack on U.N. peacekeeping troops leaves 18 U.S. soldiers dead. Nearly all U.S. forces are withdrawn from Somalia over the next six months. <br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
---------- 1995 ---------<br>
<br>
April 19<br>
A bomb destroys a federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people; Clinton visits the scene a few days later. <br>

A Jewish extremist assassinates Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. <br>
<br>
<br>
November 6<br>
Clinton attends the funeral of assassinated Israeli Prime Minster Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem. <br>
<br>
December 25<br>
The partial shutdown of the government, triggered by a confrontation between the White House and the Republican leadership over the budget, enters its ninth day -- a record. <br>
<br>
---------- 1996 -------------<br>
<br>
January 6<br>
Government shutdown ends when both sides agree to a budget deal. <br>

<br>
July 17<br>
TWA Flight 800, en route to Paris from New York, crashes into the Atlantic Ocean on shortly after takeoff, killing all 230 on board. <br>

A homemade bomb explodes at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, killing one person and injuring 111 others. <br>
<br>
September 3<br>

<br>
September 27<br>
Forces of the Taliban, a militant Islamic group, take control of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, hanging the former president and his brother. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------- 1997 ----------<br>
<br>
March 26<br>
Thirty-nine members of the Heaven's Gate cult, including their leader, are found dead on in a San Diego suburb. Apparently they believed they would leave their bodies and join alien travelers in a space ship behind the Hale-Bopp comet. <br>
<br>
August 31<br>
Britain's Princess Diana is killed in a Paris car accident. <br>
<br>
------------ 1998 ---------<br>
<br>
May<br>
Pakistan becomes nuclear power and along with India carries out underground nuclear tests. <br>
<br>
August 7<br>
Car bombs explode outside the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing hundreds of people. Two weeks later, Washington retaliates as ships launch missile attacks at suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan reportedly run by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden. <br>
<br>
<br>
August 20<br>
The U.S. fires cruise missiles at targets in Sudan (right) and Afghanistan in response to what Clinton calls an &quot;imminent&quot; terrorist threat from a network run by Osama bin Laden. The strikes follow attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier in the month. <br>

<br>
June 28<br>
After a seven months of wrangling over his welfare, young shipwreck victim Elian Gonzalez returns to Cuba. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This also doesn't include all the Iraqi stuff, cause I am sure there was at least 3 or 4 campaigns during Clintons terms.<br>
<br>
I'll admit, there is no WWII calibar stuff, but with Oaklahoma, the first bombing of WTC, Columbine, the embassy bombings, government shutdown and at least two attacks on the White House... I would hardly call it an uneventful 8 years.<br>

<br>
Bush only treads lightly when someone is there to instruct him. Believe you me, this campaign against terror ws not engineered by Bush, but Bush has gained some confidence and has taken it over and that will be our downfall.<br>
<br>
The man doesn't know when to quit. The only reason he pulled the arab nations support was because of the enormity of 9/11, but if he thinks that carries enough momentum to go into Simolia, Iraq (who we have been bullying for what...11 years?) and start raising hell there... welcome to WWIII or damn close to it.<br>
<br>
I imagine his staff (Colin Powell in particular) will keep him in check though. At least I hope the hell so. Just because we suffered few casualties in Agfganistan does not mean we can continue on in the same manner. Hell, we are running out of tactical ammunition, Saudi is ready to kick our ass out and if I find it hard to believe Pakistan is gonna remain our best buddy for much longer.<br>
<br>
Russia has been great so far, but if we start fucking up their oil supply... they will get out of bed with us fast.<br>
<br>
The time has come to go to the covert war imo. We have about run the length on brute force and bribary. <p><br>

THis thread has turned fucking gay. All of our presidents have been losers and winners depending on different peoples points of view. I heard an angry black NY city councilman arguing for the removal of GW's picture since he thought GW sucked ass.<br>
<br>
I know people who still fucking love Nixon and will defend all the things he did.<br>
<br>
Hell, Nixon and Clinton have both proved that a few criminal activities and less than moral actions mean nothing. All that matters is the kind of job you did in the office. Not what kind of person you are.<br>

Nah, most people disagree with *full human cloning*, like making one more copy of Tarj, or one more copy of Lou Ferrigno.

1.  I am not a democrat and in fact hate them as much as any other politician.  I leave the goose stepping to others, I educate myself and make my own decisions.<br>
2.  I personally dislike Clinton but that has nothing to do with the subject at hand, all politicians are crooked but the onus on his dalliances scream of superficial numbnuts trying to oust a president of the wrong party.<br>
3.  Keep religion out of my public policy, period.  That means abortion, euthanasia and stem cell research.  I believe in God but this country was founded by deists, not christians.<br>
4.  Cogito I have proof there is a god.  Reagan halted stem cell research and now Nancy is wiping his ass.  I hope he lives to 100. <p>Tritorie Mendicuss<BR>

Right before or after this picture was taken Elvis presented Nixon with a gift of a very nice revolver. Everyone was quite agasp because Elvis had walked right into the Oval office carrying a firearm and noone had noticed.<br>

Dubya basically bribed the american people during his campaign with his tax rebate (hey vote me president and Ill give you money).  Overall I think clinton did a good job as president he just got caught with his dick in the picklejar by an overzealous lawyer looking to get his name in the headlines (ken starr).<br>
<br>
Stem cell research basically turns into pro-abortion vs no-abortion because the vast majority of stem cell research material comes from aborted fetus'.   I really hope we can avoid another of THOSE discussions on this thread.  Personally Im all about it,  cloning tissue and curing alsheimers as a result of something that was going to be done regardless (an abortion) seems like a win win situation to me.  <br>
It actually will take a strong president because the president holds the Veto Button and hes going to have a bunch of Pro life claptrap thrown at him.   <br>

Thankfully many of these baby boomers that are the constant roadblocks to any change that doesnt agree with their antiquated religious beliefs are dieing off. <p><br><br><center>Bractos Bootstrap, <br>Warlord of the Tribunal<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47476>Inspect me</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ualajan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alajan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sly Rake</span><br>  Posts: 461<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/5/02 7:56:40 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.health-tracker.com/pics/sp_logo.jpg width=150 length=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Billy</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Hey, I got an idea, lets all argue over something completely boring and subjective.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Thread has gotten old and politics is a bore.  Also, not a one of us truly gives a crap about any one of the rest of our opinions.  Most are a bore and the rest are ill advised.  So the debate is null and void baby.  Were it a debate we would come to a conclusive end, which will never occur here.  <br>

Yeah, you really should stop fucking them in the ass with broken glass bottles.  But you're just asking for it by intervening in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Russia still considers Georgia to be its backyard and has made numerous attempts to install a pro-russian government there, even going as far as making multiple attempts at the life of President of Georgia, Eduard Shevarnadze (Former Soviet Foreign Minister).  Oh and of course, they dont want any western powers around Chechnya. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=181&stop=191>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=772.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=772.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=772.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=772.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=772.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=772.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
