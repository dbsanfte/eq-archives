Loveseeker gets flamed for how she acts.  Looks or lack thereof do nothing to change that.

Ok when I first started playing i played in seb in my 40's nothing was ever said thats when it first came out Kunark and such. I sent her up to seb at 38 and had her get to lvl 40 with cheal. ! thats all a cleric needs for seb in a good group ! i know i was her lvl 56 cleric that did all the ressing for her ! Ok so when people died and gave her shit cause they accused her of being there for loot your all wrong. Truth is over half the time she never got loot and the other times she got a few gems. In which didnt even make up for the amount she used in buffing gems. So after about 1 year of everyone on her ass and always treating her like shit well it was bound to happen she told you all off. and she did it with a super bang. So in the time it took you all to treat her like shit she has taken the time to make you all look like shit. I saw it comming and I stuck by her like many people did Clangeddins /Chowda/ Me / Mindee and much much more. So in the absence of her she post her to make you all realize that the Dueling and the constant fighting she did wasnt something she deserved but was something that happened if i wouldnt of pled her to lvl 35 to begin with she would of learned alot more game smarts but at that time the game smarts were only there with exsperienced players. Remember every time you treat someone like shit there is a reprecusion that comes back. I never posted this and alot of people wouldnt understand but when i met her for the first time cause she lived near me i wanted to help her so when people complain that in her 30's she wasnt all that great well ! Alot of people at the lvl 60 that are exsperienced players suck still just since she as one to prove you all wrong it gave her a bad name in which i take responceability so flame me fuck it people like VV and EV and all those that just couldnt leave her alone and thought that being a super dick to her. Your all in the wrong as much as me for not teaching her a lil more player edicate and helping her out ! So with that I think i made my point and your points are there but I and a couple other of us know for a fact she was willing to help anyone that gave her a chance and didnt turn there back on her form what people said.<br>

Personally I'm over hearing about your little midnight fantasy girl. She's gone, we're happy, who cares? So the next time you're working yourself into that wet nightmare, or thinking about her while you work on popping your next zit, remember how unimpressed people are with morons who think a person's character is forgiven because she doesn't look as trollish as she acts. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8968><center><img src = "http://mywebspace.sac.winfirst.com/cwright/public_html/kinvaras1.jpg"></center> </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uxexing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xexing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/16/02 3:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loveseeker and me at prom</span><hr size=1> And if you could fight and be a accual player as good as you are at posting then i guess i wouldnt find the need to flame worthless trash like you!

KINVARAS YOUR THE PIECE OF SHIT EVERY FAT MOMMA WORRIES ABOUT WHEN THERE DAUGHTERS GO OUT AT NIGHT. WELL FRANKLY THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR FAT ASS SITTING ON THEM IS A GOOD REASON LET ALONE YOU HAVENT BEEN LAID IN ABOUT 20 YEARS SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING. I PERSONALLY THINK ITS SAD THAT SOMEONE LIKE YOU CANT EVEN PAY FOR SEX TO GET YOURSELF OFF. I THINK ITS SUPER SAD WHEN YOU WERE BORNTHAT THE DOCTOR HAD TO SMACK YOUR MOTHER FOR HAVING A CHILD SO FUCKING UGLY AS YOU. AND THAT THE MILK MAN CAN ONLY CONCLUDE TO KNOWING YOUR DAD BY THE MOST COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION ABOUT HOW HE TASTE EVERY TIME YOUR MOM KISSES YOUR DAD. SO JUST REMEMBER THERE'S MEANER THINGS TO BE SAID.

You should really come work for me. Up until recently I've merely been whoring out Mandoman, but I see some potential in you. I think that we could easily get you an hourly wage increase to $4 an hour for your service. We'll just need to clean you up a bit. I found Mandoman in some backwards town in Indiana and now, thanks to me, he has an education and a premier client list. You are obviously in dire need of both. <br>

EXCLUSIVE  <br>
<br>
Stuff has obtained the essay written by a Cambridge High School student which saw him stood down for five days after staff deemed the essay sexually offensive. <br>
The Waikato Times reported that Mike Scherger, 15, had to write a story in his year 10 English class titled: How does your body betray you? He wrote about an embarrassed teenager whom he described as having &quot;a boner&quot; (an erection), while in class and not wanting to leave his seat when called to the front of the class.<br>
<br>
His English teacher showed the story to principal Alison Annan who said it was &quot;sexually offensive&quot; and &quot;totally inappropriate&quot;.<br>
<br>
As a result he was stood down for five days, the longest period allowed.<br>
<br>
Mrs Annan said: &quot;There are some things you learn at a very young age you just don't write about.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He was told twice by the teacher the story was inappropriate, but he handed it in anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stuff has received a flood of responses to the Waikato Times story, some of which can be read by clicking on the link below.<br>
<br>
An unedited version of the essay follows:<br>
<br>
Betrayal By Body<br>
<br>
Joe just moved to Hamilton last weekend, his mother was offered a job at Waikato Hospital as head nurse. Joe was ready for his first day at school, Berklay intermediate.<br>
<br>
He was really excited when his mother dropped him off at the front of the school, &quot;go get 'em champ, she said to him. He walked with pride steadily up through the middle of the school walkway, he finally reached his classroom and walked in cautiously. He was quite nervous but not at all worried.<br>
<br>
He walked straight through the door and right up to the teacher, &quot;Oh you must be Joe, yes the principal told me about you.&quot; She said kindly. &quot;Class we have a new student today, go introduce yourself,&quot; she said to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, my name is Joe,&quot; he said quite calmly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Joe,&quot; the class replied promptly. He sat down at one of the desks near the front that was free.<br>
<br>
There was the prettiest looking girl he'd ever seen right next to him. They started talking on and on, she was so cool, she had a really great personality, plus she was soooo hot. The next thing he heard was, &quot;Joe will you please come up to the front of the room and solve this problem,&quot; the teacher said quite sternly.<br>
<br>
He looked at the teacher and then looked at his uprising pants, it was so humiliating. &quot;No, I can't come to the front miss, there is just no way,&quot; he replied calmly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are coming whether u like it or not,&quot; she said again very loudly and without warning she pulled him out of his chair and the class burst out with laughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hahahahahaha, look at his boner&quot; one boy said. Others started making very harsh comments about him, it was the most humiliated he had ever been in his life. When he got home that day straight away he burst into tears and told his mum what had happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm never going back to that school ever again,&quot; he said sobbingly. His mother knew it would be very shame for him to go back so she allowed her son Joe to go to boarding school in Auckland.<br>
<br>
His problem with his pants have never happened since.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
this is sad <br>
HAHA<br>

Jesus christ man, if you think that skinny ass dimestore trailer trash bitch is hot, then you need to quit smacking your little zit-covered pecker at toons on EQ for a while before you select your next photograph off the internet to try to BS the flameboard with. If she's the only ass you've ever waxed (highly probable), then trust me dude, you're still a virgin. <br>
<br>
Actually on second thought I take that last part back, it has to be true. Not saying you're not a fucking idiot, but it would probably take an even bigger idiot than you to actually find a pic of two high school morons like this one and claim it was themselves haha. Believe me man, you've done yourself a grave injustice here. Before, people only thought you were fucking dorks, now you've gone and proven it lol. <br>
