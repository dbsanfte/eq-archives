Was it about that movie he did about the aliens taking over earth and the only way to see the aliens was to put on these special glasses so you could see the aliens hidden in human form? And with the 15 minute long fight scene with that other guy? That was pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I still think the current situation would have been much more entertaining to read if Ladida showed favoritism. With the situation now, it's hard for many people to trust what Loegan says, though they may be wrong, and everyone just has to believe what the mods/admins are saying, so when 2 people try to speak up, most label them as a couple of silly people that blindly believe whatever the banned Loegan tells them, though those labelers may be wrong. So you see, it's so unfair and such, but if favoritism was shown, we'd have 2 evenly divided factions, instead of 50 against 2+1. <br>
<br>
But enough about that. Did you know that Roddy Piper lives in Portland? I tried to sneak into his yard once, but I fell and broke one of his yard gnomes. ah well <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladidahohum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ladida Hohum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey baby...<br>Ever done it in a drawer?</span><br>  Posts: 2134<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/20/02 9:15:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1073.topic&index=487>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ladida5000.homestead.com/files/ladidadwarf3.jpg height=147 width=132></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the fuck is up with the Vagrants</span><hr size=1> I did not delete any posts.<br>
<br>
I imagine his Darkmask post got deleted with his other 6 posts about Germany being better than the US, when the admin/mod saw them all.<br>
<br>
I banned Loegan at that time right before the messages got deleted. He was not banned 4 hours later when I talked to him. The announcement post was made the next day though, since the other admins seem to tell when they ban people, and I thought I would too, especially since he was a long time guy.<br>
<br>
He was not banned for posting a lot of posts I disagreed with. He was banned for posting the same topic over and over for the purpose of getting banned and being a martyr for his cause. I figured I would let him have that at least.<br>
<br>
That is the extent that I am going to bash him about this though. Let me know if you have any more questions or crazy theories. I will be sure to help explain things to you. <p><BR>

<br>
As far as Loegan's side - this is from AIM - if you want confirmation, send Loegan a message and ask:<br>
<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Hey Bro =) The BS is running thick tonght from Ladida. Spamming, what BS<br>
JSmiff69: well, I do remember seeing 3-4 new topics from you in like a 10 minute period that got deleted<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Yes, we were joking just Like Rynnia did when she was calling Ladida fat and he deleted it, Rynnia hit back and reposted and they went back and forth.<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: He didn't ban Rynnia, cause they knew it was a joke. Same thing here, except he needed an excuse 4 hours later and that was all he could come up with<br>
<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: You were there, did you see the titles?<br>
JSmiff69: yes, and of the 3-4, at least 2 were valid, imo<br>
JSmiff69: the Darkmask one sure as hell was<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: It was a joke and he knew it. He wasn't mad at the time.<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: That was a real flame they deleted<br>
JSmiff69: yup<br>
JSmiff69: check my latest post on the &quot;WTF ... Vagrants&quot; thread<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: I can't believe they don't even get their stories straight<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: ok, checking<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Thanks bro =) Nice to know at least some people care what happens on this board<br>
JSmiff69: It's pissing me off... it's all well and good for the mods to have fun by ADDING IN CONTENT... but when they start fucking with entire posts and bannings, it ain't right.<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: I agree 100%. They need to calm down. Right now they are asserting their authority, making it clear they can do whatever they want. They need to wise up before it's only them posting here<br>
<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: I don't know what his problem is, but when this is the only Trib board, he should be more mature. Not like pople can just go post somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Thanks, I appreciate that. I really do. I will be surprised if they unban me though. I think they would rather do anything than give in<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Would have worked better if thy all had the same story though<br>
JSmiff69: haha, yeah<br>
JSmiff69: or if the reason were valid<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Technically it is, but he knew it was a joke or he would have banned me then, not 4 hours later during an argument on AIM<br>
<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: I just hit a nerve and he retaliated<br>
<br>
JSmiff69: okay - could you post before he posted the ban or no?<br>
JSmiff69: as in - he says the ban was done before he posted about it...<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: I could post until I talked to him on AIM. Then all of a sudden my screen froze for a sec, then reloaded with the ban message<br>
JSmiff69: ok<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: that was 4 hours after the posts<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Course they deleted all the posts so no point of reference<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: At least none we can access<br>
<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: Tanje told me in tells in game that Ladida told her it was an accident. I think he must have told Aat that too. That's why she was wondering why I said not to ban me<br>
Loegan Wolfheart: I told her, if it was an accident, why would he even ask me if I wanted it lifted? He would just do it. Besides, how do you accidently ban someone?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Feel free to counter anything here - this is the convo we had today regarding this.  I don't have the convo from yesterday, as I closed the window.<br>
<br>
So... which story is true?  Was it &quot;accidental&quot;?  Or was it on purpose?  And why are you telling the board staff differing stories?  And which mod/admin is deleting posts at a whim?<br>
<br>
You fuckers are drunk on power, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
While Loegan may have broken the rules, giving you an easy way to get rid of him, I haven't.  If this post, like others I have made, gets deleted, I will be reposting it. <p><center>

<br>
A few admins thought that Loegan was banned prematurely because right after banning him, I saw that all of his spamming was deleted by another admin. I imediately tried to unban him in hopes that he would keep spamming so I would have evidence of his spamming so little people who cry about conspiracy and whatever would be able to see the proof. <br>
<br>
He never did continue though. Later that night he told me that he was banned. I guess that the unban didn't work for some reason. I said he shouldn't be yet and that I would undo it. He said he didn't want me too. So I didn't and the next day I posted why he was banned. <p><BR>

Loegan Wolfheart: He said &quot; You shouldn't be banned YET, but I'll lift it if you want me to. I said why bother if you are going to ban me later, fuck it, will come down to this again anyway.<br>
<br>
As to the rest of it, you're right.  I know the mods/admins could give two shits about me and my posts.  I just hope y'all have fun deleting and editting.  Eventually you will run off all the people that make posts that are actually readable.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER - <br>

Yeah, I sure did make a whole ton of demands.  What's your next excuse going to be?<br>

They are not singling out just those that made demands. They are just letting everyone know that they can just like we showed Dumai and everyone else that we can be biased when he bitched at us for biasness. Ya see, instead of denying it, we embrace it, to let people know that yeah, you are right, we are completely unreasonable, unfair, and are not scared about being called on it. And no, we don't care about the popularity of the flameboard or making everyone happy.<br>
<br>
I imagine that you guys won't leave, just because you like the controversy and the madness and the entertainment. If you do go though, I don't mind. Like I have always said, some of the best times for me was when it was barely anyone at all flaming.<br>
<br>
This will pass after awhile, just like everything else has. And then, a few months later, someone will tell us about how we are ruining the board or how we are should do this or that or how unfair we are. And then we will have good fun again. Hell, we might even bring up Loegan's name, and maybe some people will know who we are talking about. <p><BR>
