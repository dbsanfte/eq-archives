<br>
Where did you see anyone &quot;defending&quot; blowing up school buses ? What me and Radgen are trying to put in front of your eyes is the fact that these people don't blow up kids and &quot;innocents&quot; for the sadistic pleasure of it. You run in this discussion waving your little patriotic flag screaming &quot;terrorists must be put to the chair&quot; when the real world out there is a little bit more complicated than the 5mn digest you get on CNN. Killing people is murder, no matter what military excuse you want to paint on it. But instead of just selling more &quot;defense&quot; tanks and bomb shells to Israel for mucho dinero, how about we actually try to make a real move toward peace ? <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;The consipiracy theory on Bush is quite entertaining though.<br>
<br>
It's far from being theory... all the elements i have posted are publicly accessible and can be verified. Go find out for yourself what company Bush Sr. was on the board of until last summer and when / why he resigned...  Then find out which oil consortium Bush Jr. is an executive officer of and where their corporate assest are being currently invested. <br>
<br>
Your civic commitment is commendable, but you should spend some time studying more history and economics. It also pays to access your &quot;information&quot; from a variety of sources to get both side of each story. If I can tell you how bad the Sun is, it's because i have actually bought it before, along with the Guardian, the Times, or Le Monde. A political opinion is only valuable when it's informed. However, achieving an informed opinion is more and more difficult in a mass media saturated environment where public opinion is manipulated for the profit of multinational corporations capitalistic interests. <br>

If you're unable to admit even that, then there is no hope for you.<br>
<br>
It would be one thing if the terrorists were running up and blowing up Check Points where the military is, or if they were to blow up government buildings.  No, these people are blowing up PUBLIC targets.  That is the difference between a terrorist and a rebel.<br>

What would be the solution to the situations where people that held government positions, move onto jobs in the public?  Any job these people take, can be scrutinized.  The main concern, are these ties flowing back to people currently in office, and these ties are affecting policy?<br>
<br>
From the link, it would appear that the only policy that is being affected, is how hard we are with Saudi Arabia, and how they handle terrorists.  Is there currently any country that we are hammering on in the public eye over their handling of the terrorist threat?  I know of Pakistan, but I think we can all agree that their situation is different, since they've been invaded by the rats running from the sinking ship in Afghanistan, right?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to be critical here, I just can't think of any other countries that are being fingered as handling this problem poorly.  Actually, I've really only heard of Saudi Arabia, and Iran as states that aren't doing what we'd (in the general sense) like them to do.<br>

<br>
A life is a life - and I am sure that Radgen in his kaki uniform doesn't think his is less valuable than yours or mine... You are accusing me of being deaf  to your arguments while to me it really seems that you are trying to ignore altogether the &quot;other side&quot; of the conflict. The only view you have been presenting was &quot;the terrorists vs the civilised world&quot;. Black and white. We support the poor israeli civilians against the evil fanatic terrorist who bomb their schools (which just also happens to coincide with the new governments &quot;war on terrorism&quot; propaganda... but that's another issue)<br>
<br>
Nevermind that :<br>
<br>
* Israeli military is in an occupation state of territories outside their borders (ie : invading a foreign country) under the flag of &quot;national defense&quot;, same as during the 6 days engagements over the Golan.<br>
<br>
* The settlements are a complete disruption for the original inhabitants of the region (roads are cut / water supplies abused...) who have populated this region for a couple of millenia<br>
<br>
* Israeli population has ELECTED an extremist government pro-war that has no intention of ever promoting peace or integration of both cultures and probably just wishes nothing more than a swift &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of those territories to open further settlements. A parallel could be the Kurd population genocide... although they are a little more subtle about it.<br>
<br>
* there is mucho dinero of various vested interests that have NO intention of promoting peace in the middle east and are far more responsible for the situation over the last 20 years than any terrorist bomb ever will.<br>
<br>
So of course, bombing kids on their way to school is not the solution. But this will continue so long as there will be repressed dissidence. How desperate do you think you have to be to educate your sons to sacrifice their own life for a cause ?<br>
<br>
As for the last link : watch now very closely which media group will carry this information. Who will jump on it first and who will not touch it with a barge pole... Just FYI : this has been published back in septembre in various european papers.<br>

Pretty much what you were doing. Re-read your post. The whole oppressed Palestinian angle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Still don't get the whole Bush thing. What are you trying to tie all those facts to? Since, you clearly state it is not a theory, I am wodering where all these facts lead to. I am not debating the facts of what you are saying, just want to know what that is all supposed to mean.<br>
<br>
The rest of your post regarding the whole flag waving, civic commitment nonsense - try to stick to the point at hand rather than telling me I don't know what I am talking about. Please, that is just weak.

Personally, I think the US should stay out of all this nonsense, stop buying oil from the Arabs all together and drill in Alaska. I don't think Israel / Palestine, ect. is any of our business. <br>

The hatred he engendered had more to do with his ham handed attempt at setting a new &quot;gays in the military&quot; policy and the fact that military personal lean republican.  He DID apologize for his youthful statements.  Hell I personally HEARD him do so at a base visit not once, but twice.   Now the military WAS one of his weak points, as I said somewhere else.  The use of force and its place in policy was something I don't think he really had a good grasp on till maybe the last couple years of his Presidency.  It was one of his legitamate flaws, however it is also a common trait for Presidents who come straight from State level politics to the Presidency.  It has little to do with who served and who didn't.  (Carter had the same problem and he had served in the Navy, FDR never served but was pretty dman good during WW2)<br>
<br>
His cuts were NOT to deep.  WE did not, and still don't need a regular military that was that large when he got into office(and the cuts started under Bush_01 and were inline with the original drawdown plans from the start.)  We could not afford to keep spending on the military like we did.    Even the threat we face now does not call for the large armor heavy force we have.  <br>
<br>
A large part of the problems occured from Congress setting specific spending goals IN the military budget without adding extra money to pay for it.  (Making the Pentegon buy 4 Seawolf submarines when they only wanted 2, same thing with the number of B2 bombers)  This shifted Billions of dollars from where it SHOULD have been spent to extra crap the pentegon didn't even want.  Congress treating military spending as a home district welfare system is as much to blame for the stretching thin of our forces as any cuts that were made (And it WAS a Republican congress who did not try real hard to fight any of those cuts.)<br>

Terrorism has no excuse.  Attacking civilians has no place in a conflict, no matter what the provacation.  However, BOTH Isreal and the Palestinians have legitamate concearns.   Both have also done things in support of the legitamate causes that are hard or impossible to defend.  (Palestinians bombing civilian targets, though they DO attack militray targets too, these obviously don't get the same kind of media coverage.  Isreal, while I don't think has specifically targeted civilians has shown a very callus disregard for civilian life in its military operations.  Also the Occupation and displacement of palestinians IS the underlying cause of the conflict.  Isreal has a right to exist, but so do the Palestinians.)<br>
<br>
The attitude &quot;We won't negotiate till the violence stops&quot; is a non-starter because as long as the underlying situation remains the same, the violence will NEVER stop.  This kind of conflict cannot be won by normal military force alone.  You don't make peace with your buddies.  You make peace with an enemy, it is the nature of the thing.<br>
<br>
And as long as we use oil, we will never be able to ignopre this.  More drilling in Alaska will do nothing to change this, it is a drop in the bucket of our oil use.  We remain very dependent on the Middle East (though no where near as much as Europe and Japan) and we will face serious roadblocks to both our anti-terrorist goals and the goal of removeing that Iraqi nut case as long as the Isreali/Palestinian conflict smolders. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
- The entire Occupation forces of Isreal is bullshit anyhow.  The land that the Palenstines are living on right now was taken from Israel back in ~1950.  How can you be called an occupation force, on land that was officially yours at one time, and was illegally taken?  There is no country called Palestine, there never WAS.  How can the Israelis be considered an occupation force on land that doesn't belong to any other country?<br>
<br>
- The settles are a complete disruption to the original inhabitants?  So what about all the inhabitants that were living on that land before Jordan and Egypt moved in back in 1950?<br>
<br>
- The Israelis have elected such a regime NOW, how about the LAST regime?  The one that WANTED and ACTIVELY pursued peace?  You do realize that the Palestines still have the SAME leadership as they had 4 years ago right?  When Clinton was on peace's DOOR step.  When Arafat went to bed, and came back the next day with MORE demands.  Palestine and the Arab nations do NOT want peace.  They've never wanted peace.  If they did, they wouldn't have attacked in 1950 and 1967.  Eygpt wouldn't have pulled the shit that shutdown Israel's access to the Suez Canal.<br>
<br>
- You also do realize that the Palestinians are shit on by Arab nations right?  That many relocation programs, as far back as 1949 have been proposed, but ALWAYS denied by the Arab Nations.  They don't WANT the Palestinians.  They like them just where they are, they enjoy using them as political pawns.  Oh the poor arab victims.<br>

Here, read through the following link and learn the history of Israel.<br>

<br>
FYI, take GOOD note that this mess is a British disaster.<br>
<br>
PS: I personally believe that Israel should cut it's losses, dismantle the settlements, relocate all the Jewish inhabitants in the &quot;occupied&quot; terroritories.  Only problem with this, the Arab Nations still won't give up, they will continue to harass, push and invade Israel, as they've shown themselves in the past.  The Arab Nations don't want Israel to exist.<br>

Exactly, and the area given to the Palestinians was on the EAST side of the Jordan river. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A> at: 6/21/02 12:58:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uradgen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/02 2:38:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silly Europeans</span><hr size=1> Umm.. Wenin, the West bank was never part of Isreal.  It was the Arab part of the partition that occured in 1948 when the British left.  Jordan controlled it till 1968.  It IS occupied territory.<br>
<br>
I don't know where you get the idea that Isreal controlled that territory before 1950, they didn't.  The current recognized borders of Isreal (does not include the west Bank, Gaza or the Golan Heights) are the borders set by the UN/British in 48.   <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
