*curtsies and squirms*<br>
<br>
I felt like exploring uncharted territories this evening and ended up in a desolate area known as Dagnor's Cauldron.  Aside from a group of rather helpful merchants who seem to be living there, all by myself (Only player in zone).  I was told this part of Faydwer was mostly known as a place adventurers go through on their way to better hunting grounds.  So I was there only expecting to see a new kind of landscape.  I was hunting for variety more than anything else.<br>
<br>
I was rather surprised by everything I found there however.  Named rats and snakes! O.o  The entire area is also filled with aqua goblins, most of which being good preys for a hunter of my experience (They give good XPs to a level 19 rogue, and I could solo a couple of them).  The aquagoblins don't carry the best loot on them, but I got two cracked staves and lots of hunting bows, all of which I could sell to the merchants right away.  These same merchants also protected me after I ran to them for help, a meanie on my heels.<br>
<br>
I know I will be spending some time there in the next few days.  I find this place exotic.  I love the challenges its landscape provides (as well as the opportunity to practice my safe fall skill).  But I also thought a well organized group could have a great time in this zone, preying on the goblin camp.  So I thought about organizing an expedition there.<br>
<br>
I was thinking:<br>
Thursday evening this week (january 31), at 9PM Eastern time, 6 PM central time.  The group would meet in Butcherblock mountains, near the zone line to Dagnor's Cauldron.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm still new at all this, so maybe hunting in this place is a bad idea.  Maybe there are risks I don't know about.  As a precaution, I will spend some time by myself first, to scout the area as best as possible.  I would also appreciate input from any knowledgable sister :-)<br>
<br>
My timing suggestion is just that: A suggestion.  I don't want to be group leader.  I'm just proposing something that I find exciting and different.  I don't think that many people have experience camping in Dagnor's Cauldron.<br>
<br>
I'll be eagerly reading any replies to this post.<br>
Luck and laughter to you :-)<br>

I'll be in Dagnor's Cauldron, no schedule for now.  Anyone looking for hunting partneror variety, feel free to join me or anyone else hunting there.<br>

I forgot the totems name, but I believe the gobos name is Sludge. I may be wrong as it has been forever since I have battled him. He is around 30-35th level, a shaman, around 1800 hps, and has a spawn time of 8 hours. How do I know this garbage? He drops the icon for the cleric breastplate quest in the Armor of Virtue quests in temple of Solsuk Ro as well as the totem. The totem I believe is the rare drop. He drops a belt as well which is good for most wisdom casters. So if you go hunting for him, prepare to wait for a long time, and bring a tracker.<br>

A couple things.<br>
<br>
Sorry Cariel for changing my plans about Dagnor's Cauldron.  I guess playing a &quot;discordant&quot; character is a good choice for me, it fits well with my online personality.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I thought I would update interested readers on my exploration of Dagnor's Cauldron in prevision of an eventual raid.  So far, I think that if well organized, it could work very well.  There would be enough aquagoblins to keep a full group busy.  Because some of these goblins have a tendency to run fast and swim in the water to get reinforcements, that group would need someone who can snare/root.  Having someone who can harmony/lure would also be very useful in taking down the camp, because pulling four goblins, including a tidal lord, and risking having random adds is NOT a good plan :-)<br>
<br>
To sum it up, the group would need:<br>
Someone who can snare/root.<br>
Someone who can lule/harmonize/charm/mez.<br>
And four other persons.<br>
<br>
The loot is better than I expected.  In two hours of soloing, I got four bronze weapons and four cracked staves.  Because it was making me heavy, I decided to go sell it in Butcherblock mountains instead of risking swimming to get to the merchants on the island.  I made 18 platinum pieces worth of loot that way.<br>
<br>
Selling to the merchant on the island is tempting.  You think you will save time that way, no zoning and running.  But that island is patrolled by tough goblins who tend to gang up on you.  Of course I died.  The lake is very deep ;-)  I had the worst time locating my corpse.  My swimming is at 90 something.  I barely had enough air to get to my corpse and drag it back to the surface once I found it.  So I would not recommend trying to sell to the merchant on the island.  I have better faction with the dwarves anyway ;-)<br>
<br>
There are four types of aquagoblins: Mariners, bosuns, tidal lords and shamans.  If the group's average level is 20, we should not have any problem at all with them.  The shamans are wimps.  I can easily solo them at level 19 and I am a rogue.  We could also hunt undertow skeletons.  They give great experience, dropped two bronze maces for me and are easy to kill.<br>
<br>
I found a nice spot where we could pull the aquagoblins from their camp and other assorted creatures.  It is within easy reach from the friendly NPC camp so we could run to them for protection if we pulled more than we could handle.  The path to get there has no high and dangerous cliffs also.<br>
<br>
Okay, I think I babbled long enough now.<br>
If anyone is still interested by such an adventure, please post a reply on this thread, indicating what time of day and day of week would be more appropriate for you.<br>
Thank you for your prolonged attention :-)<br>
