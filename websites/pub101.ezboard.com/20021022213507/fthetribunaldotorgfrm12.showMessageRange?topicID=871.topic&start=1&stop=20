A lot of the recent posts, like the one about stem cell research were clearly going to go up in flames, I did not see yours doing that so I moved it to the reality forum.<br>
<br>
The reason the reality forum was put there was for the threads about 9-11.  That sad occurrence will never really be over so the forum was kept.  I continue to put things in there like politics and such because I was under the impression this was an ezboard for a GAME, not a political discussion board.<br>
<br>
It is very rare that I say nasty things to anyone, even those that really deserve it.  Some of you have said some very nasty things about me and I do not appreciate it.  I don't have a &quot;board&quot; personality and a &quot;game&quot; personality to hide behind as so many of you are fond of creating.  What you see is what you get.  <br>
<br>
I posted this on the flameboard as this is where all of you seem to want to put things.<br>
<br>
**Edit:  I moved this thread on my own, not by request of Muse or Jas.  I agreed with Estevan that it shouldn't be there and moved it.  If you don't like Muse or Jas Loegan then so be it, but they had absolutely nothing to do with me moving your post.**<br>

The flameboard is the best forum to do that, and gets the most traffic.  There have been freaking TONS of non-eq related threads here, and many of them didn't generate much flameage.  You set a precedent by moving this which states nothing is sacred and the mods will do whatever the fuck they feel like doing.  Prior to that, most of us felt that our content would remain untouched for the most part with only comedy edits here and there.  I would have reacted exactly as Loegan did, try and empathize before you blow him off and say his opinions don't matter.<br>
<br>
If the posters' opinions don't matter, and the mods are unwilling to admit nor correct their mistakes, then you have failed in your unspoken duty to your community.  It should have been moved back not due to content, but because it was requested.  Unless you totally don't give a fuck, which wouldn't really surprise me at this point. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a>

<br>
Thing is, there were some really good posts in that thread.  I think Laryn (I am sorry if I mispelled your name) made some good points as well.  But instead of just saying hey, I disagree with you moving my post, there was a big giant blow up.  I don't think I am unreasonable, I don't see why I couldn't have been contacted to ask why I moved it.  <br>

The subject matter IS volatile. It brings out strong emotions no matter how you look at it, and is better suited to the flameboard imo.<br>

Not to the mods either obviously.<br>
<br>
To Loegan?  Assuredly.<br>
<br>
To some others that empathize with him?  Hell yes.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
Gonna address this to tanje since she started this thread, but it's really more to the other mods as while she moved it, she didn't blatantly refuse to move it back and she didn't flame loegan and ridicule his outrage.  I would think had she known the results of this thread move, she wouldn't have made it.<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Tanje, if you moved a post on your guild's messageboard and upset a guildmate so much that he threatened to deguild or stop posting anything, wouldn't you move it back??  I doubt that there is a moderator here that wouldn't have moved it back for a guildmate or a friend rather than cause hard feelings.  <br>
<br>
Loegan is a regular poster and member of this community, does he really deserve less respect than you would accord a guildmate on your guild messageboard?<br>
<br>
Since he's not really a person to the mods and isn't liked or whatever, he's blown off and portrayed as a whiner.  That's wrong.  Yer like the GMs that will bend the rules for their friends but won't give an inch for someone that they don't know.<br>
<br>
Sorry Loegan, it's not in the vision for your post to be in the flameboard.  What's that?  Selective enforcement of the rules? US?  Hell NO, not us.  Yer in OUR world now, don't question our judgement!<br>

I didn't sit at my keyboard and rub my hands together and say how can I fuck over Loegan today?  I actually like Loegan although I think the way he handled this was way off base and done purely because he doesn't like a few of the mods here.<br>
<br>
I was wrong in not asking Aatlaar or Ladida if I could move it, it is their forum and I apologize to them.  If Loegan had posted the way Layn did, with the reasons outlined or contacted me or asked to have it moved back, I would have.

All of this could have been avoided if Tanje had posted that because the thread wasn't generating flames, it would be moved, tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Or she could have contacted Loegan and let him know she was moving it. Or Loegan could have contacted her after it was moved and stated his case.<br>
<br>
What ended up happening was a general clusterfuck that hurt some feelings.  Maybe we can learn from this.<br>
<br>
Either this board, and particularly this forum is for everyone, or just a freak show with the moderators acting as puppeteers. Either one is fine as long as the intent is made clear.  Don't preach community if that ain't the way it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umusemischiefmaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muse Mischiefmaker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bored Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 549<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/15/02 8:29:56 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/sapphirez/images/muse-av2.gif height=163 width=74></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guess I should check the boards more on the weekend...</span><hr size=1> This controversy isn't good PR for the Tribunal.org's upcoming website rollout.

<br>
Youre right - a lot of real life threads get put in here. They shouldnt be, now that there is a RL issue section, but they get allowed to stay so we can all watch the slaughter that ensues.<br>
<br>
It seems from Loegan's post he objected to the move and saw it as an attempt to remove attention from stuff he had to say, which comes across as slightly egotistical.<br>
<br>
Loegan has usually posted arguments on the board which, although I dont always agree with them, have been well thought out and constructive. In light of this, I was surprised by irrationality of his decision to leave, and the fact that he posted that decision. After all, why not just leave quietly if thats what youre going to do?<br>
<br>
That came across as another cry for attention, which I hadnt found evident in his previous posts.<br>
<br>
The leaving thread has now turned into a separate issue, namely the supreme autocratic power of moderators and whether or not they need to justify their actions.<br>
<br>
Who knows? Not me.<br>

basically all that happened was Tanje moved a thread somewhere she thought was more appropiate (i happen to agree with her)... that's it... everything that has followed from this is due to the juvenile and provocative way in which it has been handled<br>
<br>
i'm sorry Tanje has been subjected to this much vehement idiocy because she innocently used her common sense... maybe she made an minor error but who in their right mind would really worry about it? she's apologized for this microscopic misjudgement, so perhaps its time Loegan just let it go, and the rest of this farce can subside <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 875<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/15/02 10:51:54 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guess I should check the boards more on the weekend...</span><hr size=1> Vehement Idiocy??<br>
