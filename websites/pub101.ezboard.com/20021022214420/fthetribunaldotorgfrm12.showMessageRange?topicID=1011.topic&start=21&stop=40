WHAT gives SENDRI the right to CLAIM she's quitting the game the 15 times she did?  WHAT GIVES TRIPOLAR THE RIGHT TO TELL ME WHO I CAN AND CAN'T TALK TO?<br>
<br>
Danmatsuma, it's YOU that needs to take some meds and chill out.  I recall hearing about an incident where you had a panic attack on a guild raid and nearly got kicked out of a guild. I also remember I ONLY kicked you out of OoA ONCE!!  If you got booted more than once it WASN'T ME.  As for the relationship with Trip?  You ONLY heard HIS side, which I'm sorry to say was a bit on the exaggerated side.  I can remember promises he made to me which were CONVENIENTLY forgotten when his &quot;close friend&quot; called and needed a ride.  You're right, Trip is with a better person and trust me, I could care less because the 2 of them deserve each other.  I'm just wondering how his &quot;close friend&quot; is going to survive when he moves half way across the country.<br>
<br>
I posted this so I could set the record straight, JUDE has NEVER lied to me once, JUDE has NEVER tried to pick my friends, and because JUDE was there for me when my &quot;boyfriend&quot; Tripolar was defending his &quot;close friend&quot; Danmatsuma and his other &quot;close friend&quot; Sendri.  Tell me this, if Sendri is such a sweet and honest person why did she lie about leaving the server all the times she did, why did she lie about quitting the game, and why does she CONTINUE to tell the same old lies about Jude?  If Trip is the harrassed ex-boyfriend why is it I always felt like he didn't give a crap about me even before Danmatsuma became such a presence in his life, why is it he made promises to me only to break them in order to go pick up his &quot;close friend&quot; Danmatsuma, and why did he try to pick my friends when it was so clear that he didn't care?<br>
<br>
It just boggles my mind how I've been told the lies about Jude in the last month when Ck and Trip CLAIM they don't talk about him.  I'd have to say they are lying again about that.  But with Ck's history that doesn't surprise me.  As for all of you that have been judging me here, I'd have to say that only GOD can see into my heart and my mind and I'll be judged by him when the time comes, it is NOT your place.  Don't like me?  Put me on ignore, NEVER ask me for a port, sow, or any other thing, it is THAT simple.  Feel free to run me into the ground, tell people that I have no honor, and spread lies about me.  In the end it's still just a game, you don't know me in real life, with a few exceptions, and for all you know I might be 15 years old, I'm not, but think about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/upribar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pribar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/17/02 5:37:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Apology</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
Let me say this to you, it took sendri 4 weeks to get moved to another server and 50 dollars due to being harassed by a certain person, who use to call my house at all hours of the night, he also told me how much he cared for sendri and i seen the tells that was sent to her.  <br>
<br>
Like anyone else people quit playing at times but miss there old hunting buddies and decide to come back.  As for Ckristana i asked her to come back to the game and join her family and friends.  I had so many tells asking about her that I asked her to return to her friends even if it was just to talk to them in game.<br>
<br>
All i ask now is that you stop this petty crap and leave ckristana, tripolar and our guild alone.<br>

Here is a few quotes from Kasha that she had posted about this PoS Jud guy.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Judeis is not a person I EVER want to associate with again, in fact all his characters have finally made it to my ignore list because of the bullshit he spreads around. He has a lvl 51 enchanter named Sigfree that I actually refused to let cast clarity on me that's how much I hate this man.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm confused, how does one go from that up there to this down below?<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 I'm going back because I have a lot of friends there, including Judeis and from this day forward I will defend Jude.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We're talking about the same guy right? The guy you wrote this about not too long ago? Right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Hmm. Stalker wasnt' the word I would have used. I would have used the phrase the lying sack of shit, abusin women, spyin, and only wants to use people ex bf.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hmmm... and I don't even know what to say about the quote below..... <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 &quot;But then I was his mindless drone for over a year, and the fact that he blames me for bringing down OoA to this day means he still thinks he's done nothin wrong. But then the majority of people on the tribunal have dealt with his river of BS so I'm not alone. People have left the server because of this guy&quot;.... &quot;The emotions this man brings up are NOT good and when I spend an hour shaking and crying thinking about him it isn't good&quot;.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The saga continues...As i told you before go get your head looked at.You are by far the most fucked up and confussed person that i have met in EQ.<br>
