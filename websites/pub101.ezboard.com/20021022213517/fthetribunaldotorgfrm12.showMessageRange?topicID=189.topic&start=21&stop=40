NOT!! I singled out Darkmask because he attempted to make an intelligent response when he didnt even comprehend what he was trying to respond to.His post was full of bullshit. BUT FUCKING WAIT!!!! Jugslug was the first dimwitted numb fuck to say something stupid and get flamed by me on this thread. So which of the 2 are you saying I singled out.  <br>
<br>
Craeven , your first post was riddled with sound advice. Why would i attack it? You actually used some sense and made some. Flame board or not only a mindless fuck would attack it. Damn shame you didnt quit while you were ahead because now you went stupid on me. As for the dumbasses like Mandoman, Talamay, and Merton.... It would be beneath me to even attempt to respond to the boorish drivel they have posted. <br>
<br>
So fuck off Creaven. your the third person I have been forced to Single out now for posting false information.<br>

Pud Thumpers like me eh? when did I jump your plane raid? Oh please tell me when, or are we playing in you world of hypersenstive reality where the mere thought of something happening means it happened to you, and your empathic skills demand you to feel terrible. <br>
<br>
See what you fail to understand is that, when the plane is empty, the list has been taken through, wait for the repop, thus you are first on the list. No one should hold a mob/plane for anyone else in this fucking game. You know how fucking stupid you sound? You want mobs to be waiting for you when you log on. Well what about the rest of the fucking shamans of no name guilds who want their armor, they could of been on all day, had a raid and gotten the armor, but since you asked so nicely, lets just bend over and make sure you get what you want. <br>
<br>
Hey Krik, I am waiting on uber mob X, when it spawns, dont kill it, everyone just stay away, I will be along very shortly, a few hours, or days depending on my lesiure. Make sure it is right there waiting for me.<br>

Hey the funny thing is, you would still lose. You know why? cause you lack the commitment.

But keep posting, ya remind of another good old girl who was on a crusade against the evil uber guilds, her name was Valkary.<br>
<br>
In your world I am the asshole uber who believes I am better then you, in my world, I am the asshole uber who knows I am better then some fucking newbie fuckwit who wishes to debate the scheduling system and how it was brought to a halt by me and people like me, which is good for a laugh, cause it proves you know nothing, nothing of the history of the game, nothing of what went on, and who the people you post with are. Go do some homework on the scheduling system and see why it fell to shit, see how E/V was one of the last to pull out of the system well after others had broken the rules and then pulled out. But indulge me bitch with your wisdom, you knowledge, speak to me about how uneducated I am, yet you drizzle shit out of you mouth about things you dont even know.<br>
<br>
But ask yourself these questions<br>
<br>
....Am I the only person playing this game? <br>
....Are my goals more important then the next guy?<br>
....Do I deserve armor more then anyone else?<br>
....Do I work as hard as some other people on this game?<br>
....Am I fighting this battle because I like being the little guy fighting against the large evil people?<br>
....How many plane raids have I lost because another guild swept in while we were raiding and took it from us?<br>
....Do I understand the game as well as I could?<br>
....Are there things yet left for me to learn?<br>
....When I log on, are my goals mapped out and a plan in hand, with secondary plans in case the something happens to the first plan?<br>
....Am I whining to get noticed?<br>
....Do I really believe there are people in the game against me, who are willing to race to a plane to just to mess up my raid?<br>
....Do I understand how much more time I will need to invest to reach level 60?<br>
....If I see a rare mob pop up, and I really want it, do I take it, or do I shout to the zone that the mob has popped, wait an hour to see if anyone who was offline was waiting on it, or zoning in, or heading to the zone?<br>

Stick to the flames, going after sig artwork is lame. Lime drew the piece and alot of people are more then willing to express themselves through artwork. Lime didnt insult you, but you felt obligated to rip her artwork, of course ya did it blindly, like some fucking newbie thinking ya could really make him feel bad.<br>
<br>
You should maybe familarize yourself with the people you are flaming, maybe read this board before you bring your preconceived notions. <br>
<br>
You dont understand what happened to the scheduling system, you are working off fiction. <br>
<br>
You dont know its not cool to slam someone's pic, because in most cases, the poster didnt draw it themselves.<br>
<br>
But hey, you know so fucking much, you are the intelligent bitch sent to save us from the evils of uber guilds and them getting hairs up their asses and ruining your fun.<br>
<br>
Could you prove yourself to be a bigger moron? seriously, I havent seen stupidity and ignorance on this level on this board in a good long time, but you really take the cake.<br>
<br>
BTW Lime, I actually really like the Mando pic, the form is nice.<br>

<br>
Exactly what false information did I post?  You're baiting people.  Looking for &quot;uber&quot; types to flame so you can seem somehow better then them because your &quot;the little guy?&quot;<br>
<br>
What exactly do you want?  Seriously?  Who are you to tell people what they can, and can not do, when they have exactly the same rights and responsabilities that you do?  You're nobody special... no one here is as far as the game is concerned.  So just assemble earlier, work harder, plan for multipul events, and shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
FYI, schedualing was broken by mid lvl guilds long before the large guilds started just ignoring it.  The very people schedualing benfited most destroyed it, hows that for some irony?  Think the flame board is rife with conflict now, should have seen the explosions of whiny bullshit from the old boards when plane-jumping occured.. its been alot more quiet 'round here since the schedual went away.<br>
<br>
Theres LOTS and LOTS of stuff to do other then the planes, and most people hate going... It's old hat now, can only log so many hours in one zone before you've seen every mob, every loot, and explored every nich, and basicaly sucked all the fun out of it.  Only reason most of the guilds you're apparently pissed off at go to a particular plane is for epic mobs or gods.  It was said before but just to repeat it for you, you're bitching at the wrong people.  The people you're really competiting with are you're peers.<br>

Someone spent alot of time and expresses themselves through their artwork and then i come in and crack on it. Some of us express ourselves through the hard work we do in game just to have people dis it like it isnt worth anything because they are big and uber and i am not. I guess it would be sweet if Boris would log on here and talk shit about all the artwork because he is big time and you all are nothing but little wanna be artist. Well Blow me. None of you senseless pricks have met me in game. None of you mouthy bastards have had the pleasure of hunting with me yet you accuse me of wanting equipment so i can show off. You accuse me of having no skills. So I accuse you of having lame artwork. Its all the same. I know not the artist. Never met them. Could care less about them. I can just make shit up about them just like you mindless fuzz nuts can make up shit about me. I found out about a month ago that the truth means very little in game. The only thing that means shit is the power you wield as a guild leader or a the power you command as a &quot;UBER GUILD&quot;. Fuck the truth and fuck the reasoning. War is not about whos right. Its about who has the biggest fucking guns. So I really dont give a flying fuck anymore. Fuck the Truth. Fuck the artwork. If I want to say its cheesey as hell I will. Doesnt matter if its true or not. Doesnt matter if someone spent alot of time on it. Doesnt matter if its someones way of expressing themselves. You all wanna dick my achievements Just like you were dicking Bowynn's achievements. If you wanna get somewhere in life then start dicking everyone around you. Thats the best goddamn way to make yourself look good is to make everyone around you look bad. FUCK personal merit. FUCK personal achievment. You un-godly mother fuckers have the same god damn mentallity as the fucking KKK or the white supremecist or the god damn black power movement. Its all about your precious social and pecking order. If someone achieves something but they are of a lower social order than you it doesnt mean a goddamn thing to you because you are of the upper echelon of Everquest gods. Yes you think we should all bow down to you and respect you because you can go where the fuck when the fuck you want. Someone tries to voice an opinion that is differant than your own and you pull the great SUCK MY DICK mentality. If anyone of you miserable cocksuckers were in a small guild with 40 or 50 members you would be singing a whole differant song. You post shit like I think you should wait for me and hold spawns and stupid fucking shit like that. No numb nuts thats not it at all. If i have Fear scheduled for 8:00pm and i am unable to make it or the entire group is wiped out and gives up then it should be FCFS until time for the next raid. Talking to you limp dicks is like talking to a fucking wall. Dissing someones artwork is really lame. Well you mighty cock suckers have mis-read my posts, made replies that have nothing to do with what it was that I was saying in a blatant attempt to make me look lame. So it gives me great pleasure to act as lame as you portray me. DM maybe you can get Lady Lime to do a little decent artwork for you. Hell ya i can be as lame as you want me to be.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uboinshar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boinshar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/5/01 11:39:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FCFS Sucks Royal Dick</span><hr size=1> mmmm.....single....big.....block....of.....unintelligable.....text....<br>
