(May <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - Authorities investigating a videotaped hazing in which high school girls were pummeled and showered with feces, paint and garbage are trying to determine whether parents supplied beer and some of the filth.<br>
<br>
The melee occurred Sunday during a touch football game between high school girls in a park in this well-to-do Chicago suburb. Seniors had invited juniors for what was described as an initiation into their senior year.<br>
<br>
Videotaped by students and shown repeatedly on national television, the hazing involved as many as 100 teenagers from Glenbrook North High. Five girls were hospitalized, including one who broke an ankle and another who suffered a cut that required 10 stitches in her head.<br>
<br>
Cook County Forest Preserve District police said Thursday that they will probably file criminal charges. Spokesman Steve Mayberry said he did not know the specific charges or how many people would be charged.<br>
<br>
Northbrook Deputy Chief Michael Green said that police were investigating whether parents provided alcohol. According to school board member Tom Shaer, two parents might have supplied keg beer.<br>
<br>
Police were also investigating whether a parent helped gather some of the feces, Shaer said.<br>
<br>
``This is brutality to another human being by drunken buffoons,'' said Judd Hack, 17, a junior, said outside the school Thursday.<br>
<br>
Another junior, 17-year-old Jon Lee, said he knows three people who were injured. ``I think that whatever the local law enforcement and school officials want to give out as punishment, they deserve it,'' Lee said.<br>
<br>
The students apparently arranged the event in secret, taking pains to make sure school administrators - who suspected the girls were planning something - did not find out the time and place.<br>
<br>
``We have determined the kids had a network of cell phones, pagers, text messages and Internet instant messages to keep each other informed,'' Shaer said.<br>
<br>
Some participants were not told of the time and location until an hour before, Glenbrook North Principal Michael Riggle said.<br>
<br>
For years, students at the school of more than 2,000 students have held a ``powder puff'' football game each spring as a rite of passage for incoming seniors.<br>
<br>
Shaer said in the past, administrators have been able to find out when and where the event was to take place in time to alert the police and prevent it from turning into the kind of melee that happened Sunday.<br>
<br>
Zack Blum, a student who videotaped the event, said that in the past, the hazing after the football game was limited to girls dumping food on other girls. ``People never got hurt before,'' he said.<br>
<br>
Rollin Soskin, a lawyer for three girls who were beaten, said there was no indication that this year would be any different.<br>
<br>
``They were told no physical pain would be inflicted, no hair cutting, they wouldn't be made to eat anything,'' he said. ``They expected to get whipped cream, ketchup, syrup in their hair, that kind of stuff.''<br>
<br>
What happened, Soskin said and the videotapes show, was far different.<br>
<br>
``One of the girls was being strangled with pig intestines,'' he said. ``They used pig intestines, minnows, coffee grounds, excrement.''<br>
<br>
Others were punched and kicked repeatedly, he said, adding that one of his clients had an earring ripped from her ear and broke her tailbone.<br>
<br>
Videotapes show girls in yellow jerseys punching, slapping and dumping paint on juniors kneeling on the ground. Some spectators hoist cups of beer.<br>
<br>
The seniors charged the juniors $35 to $40 and supplied them with jerseys, officials said.<br>
<br>
School officials stressed that the game took place off-campus without their knowledge but said the students could face school discipline.<br>

The kids who play sports or participate in other activities may have signed contracts that addressed off-campus conduct. They could be thrown off the team for breaking the contract.<br>

Private schools can set their own rules.

High school kids, and middle school too, can be just as disgusting and mean.  They often are, and often for without any sort of reason at all.  I'd love to see something done about it, but the first step is just getting school officials to admit that it happens.

It was entirely voluntary... something they do purely as tradition.<br>
<br>
I would argue that sorority/frat hazing is a bit different, because its a condition of acceptance into the organization (anyone who &quot;gets up and leaves&quot; is kicked out).  But in this case, its not like people who didn't sit through it couldn't become Seniors or something.<br>
<br>
This is no different than any other stupid shit teenagers do on their own time for amusement... it just got videotaped.  I don't think the school is in ANY way responsible for this, and while I do think these kids went WAY BEYOND what is acceptable (and well beyond anything that happened when I was a high-school kid), I don't think the school is legally entitled to expel them.<br>
<br>
I have found out that all the students had to sign a 'code of conduct' at the beginning of the year, something which they started a few years back (wasn't there in the 90s when I went through), so I suppose they could consider this a violation of that, but I have to wonder with a public school what sort of real &quot;teeth&quot; that has.  THis isn't a private organization that can do pretty much as it pleases, like our thread a while back on &quot;black-only colleges&quot; or something...<br>
<br>
Mostly I just laugh and can't wait to see a few of them get convicted by the State of Illinois and have their lives ruined.  For certain, any of them who are 18 will have names published and they can kiss college goodbye - any school would be justified in revoking an acceptance based on this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=subuarsolair>Subuar Solair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nocnivin's sex slave</span><br>  Posts: 775<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/10/03 8:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=682.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Merton, it still doesn't it keep it from being illegal.
