I can retort by saying that the vast majority of the Lend-lease aid came between 1943-45 at which point the Soviets were already winning. Which is true.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It isn't MY conjecture.  The information I gave came from EXPERTS on WWII.<br>
<br>
Lend Lease started in 1941 as a trickle.  It went into full swing shortly after the Soviet offensive in 1942, that freed up a route from the Middle East into Russia.  During 1941-1942 a portion of the supplies that Russia received were RADIOS.  These radios were KEY to the success of the 1942 offensive.  Without them, the offensive would not have been as large, nor would it have been coordinated.<br>

Do some reading.<br>
<br>
- The Russian military wasn't caught &quot;totally&quot; unaware for one.<br>
- Because of military &amp; political blunders, they were unprepared for the invasion.<br>
- Stalin repeatedly ignored information detailing when, how and who was invading.  Even when presented with the exact DAY of the invasion, Stalin's paranoia and misplaced trust of Hitler lead him to ignore the warnings.  (he thought that it was British disinformation, trying to get Russia and Germany at war) Stalin was so delusioned that he had flights of fancy of a Russian/Germany alliance to rule the world.  LOL<br>
- Yeah that grinding halt happened what? 300 miles from the original front.  They were gaining so much ground that they had to repeatedly stop and wait for their supplies to catch up to the new frontlines.  LOL<br>
- Thank Hitler himself for wanting to starve Leningrad to death, rather than invade and take it out.<br>
- That push in 1941 was the last real load the Russian military had left.  WOOT!! They gained a whole, what 100 miles?  Yay them!  Oh and all those villages that they retook and began killing their own people for &quot;helping&quot; the enemy.  Trumpt up charges and all.<br>
- Oh and I wouldn't be to surprised if that flag was shipped in a truck with USA stenciled on the side.<br>

How many of these moronic &quot;what if&quot; conjectures are you going to toss up? &quot;What if&quot; doesnt make for a good argument. I can argue that both operations would have been successful without Western aid. Look at your lend-lease numbers and check how much Lend-lease aid the Soviets actually got in 1942 when the Stalingrad counter-offensive began. Its a joke.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I have, Stalin did, Zhokov did, and experts on the war did.  They agreed.  The southern Russian Offensive of 1942 would not have been as successful without the aid, and the 1943 counter-offensive would not have happened.<br>

Russia had 92 Locomotives, the US supplied 1900. (The earlier shipments of these locomotives helped supply the Russian offensive in 1942, IE Stalingrad.)<br>
<br>
Russia produced 1,087 railway cars, 11,075 were produced via the Lend-Lease program.<br>
<br>
56 percent of the rails used to rebuild the Russian supply system came from the Lend-Lease program. One railway was specifically built to ship supplies for the 1942 Russian Offensive.<br>
<br>
Radios - Prior to 1941, the Russian military had few radios, and they weren't incorporated into their tactics like the Germans had (every German tank had a radio). With the losses in 1941 the availablility of radios decreased even further. The German military also triangulated Russian radio traffic, and attacked such command posts that used their radios, contributing to the losses of radios. (The earliest shipments of radios were used in the 1942 Russian Offensive, which was the largest they'd ever were able to mount, and was very successful. Lend Lease radios helped make that happen.)<br>
<br>
Trucks - In 1942, at the start of the 1st largely successful Russian offensive, only 5% of the military vehicles were foreign, but still aided in allowing the Russian military to maneuver quickly during the 1942 offensive.<br>
<br>
Food - In 1941, Leningrad was seeing the first supplies of food from the Lend-Lease program. The supply from the states during this period was only a trickle though, but if you knew the conditions within the seiged city, you'd know that every scrap of food helped. By 1942, during the Russian offensive, the troop's food rations were able to be increased. Around half of the shipped weight of goods to Russia was food. SPAM, the condensed meat product, was universally refered as &quot;second fronts&quot;.<br>
<br>
Aviation Fuel - 58 percent of the aviation fuel used by Russia during the war was shipped via the Lend Lease program. During the 1942 offensive, Russia's Air Force was of a strength that allowed them to fight effectively, with newly built Russian aircraft.<br>
<br>
All of these supplies and others allowed the Russian industry that was rebuilt and retooled by late 1942 to concentrate on the production of military weapons. (Tanks, Rifles, Planes, Ammunition) These additional weapons were first available in 1942 for the Russian offensive, but it wasn't until 1943 and the 2nd Russian offensive when things all came together. With the additional tanks, experience, food, radios, and most importantly Stalin stepping back and allowing his Generals to do their job. Allowed the Russian military deliver a crushing blow to the German army.<br>

Tell me merton, What percentage of the luftwaffe was engaged against the U.S./RAF during 1942-1945?<br>
<br>
You can say a large percentage of our bombs were droped from 43 onward but what of the air war that was going on before and during that time? Germany was only using 20% of its air power against Russia, But again I guess the war would have been NO diffrent had it been otherwise?<br>
<br>
What of all the non-war industries that were affected by Allied bombs? Textiles? Oil? Munitions(nitrogen)?Rubber?Steel? Transportation?Medical Suplies? Food?<br>
<br>
Even from your own numbers you say that Trucks/Cars/Planes took a 30% dive from where they should have been? So the Russians were fighting a german army that was only 70% as strong as it COULD have been?<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that between 30-35% of Germans troops were tied up in other theaters?<br>
<br>
Also What would have happened in the Japanese had invaded From the south thru the middle east? Would Russia have been able to keep on its great offensive with 2 armies fighting it?<br>
<br>
ALOT would have been diffrent, Russia WOULD have lost the war, In the same token The U.S. would have lost without Russia.<br>
<br>

America greatly helped in the successful outcome of WWII AS DID the Russians and anyone else who participated in it.<br>

Take any of those factors out and who knows what the hell the outcome would have been. Speculation on this is ludicrous at best.<br>

I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity, which is displayed in spades here.  I actually took the time to write those essay sized posts earlier in the thread to dispel the typical Western attitude towards the war in Europe.  Obviously, it was fruitless, much like talking to a brick wall.  Ironically, I probably invested more time and effort writing those posts than I have invested in all the school work put together that I've done this school quarter.  I'm not going to reargue the same points over and over.  Dont have the energy nor time to rehash the same arguments.  I, no longer, can stem this tide of idiocy.<br>

Is it all that surprising that before the 1942 offensive the Russian military was unable to organize in large units acting in concert with each other, being that one of the most modern piece of equipment they lacked were radios?  During 1941 they began with a lack of these radios, and German military further targeted command posts that utilized their radios, which made an already lacking piece of equipment all that much more rare.  The entire time Russia was continually having difficulties communicating with their units in order to mount an orderly defense.  Then in 1942 they were suddenly able to mount the largest offensive operation ever, and in a way that was coordinated enough to sweep through the German lines.  Yeah all those radios the US sent, meant nothing.<br>

Merton If Stalin himself came up to you today and told you flat out....&quot;Russia would have lost without the U.S.&quot; You would probably call him a  moron.<br>

 I am glad your receiving an American Eductaion, In an American City, Funded by American money. Its nice to see Russians everywhere still could not suceed without America! Its ok tho Merton keep telling yourself your not a yank. I am sure someone from mother Russia will belive you!<br>

At least Merton is correct about one thing, No matter how many facts/Figures are Thrown out there, He will NEVER see another side to the war. Other then the Russian Perspective.<br>

Not even the Russian perspective, but the Russian propagandist perspective.

Nor will you it seems. <br>
<br>
The point for me is not that USSR would not have succeeded without American support - because neither would the US without USSR. The point is that the USSR accomplished and sacrificed so much more than the US, that they certainly deserve Europe's gratitude and respect far more. The sole reason arguments like these arise is because of ignorant and arrogant statements such as; &quot;If it weren't for us and our righteous quest to selflessly save the world blah blah blah... /beat chest ...and thus you have no right to criticize our actions today&quot;. Of course you can always choose the easy way out and label people anti-American or American haters so you don't have to deal with reality with the chance of getting your egos bruised.<br>
<br>
I'll leave this argument like Merton - you guys can stick around a while and pat each others backs or take turns taking jabs at Merton and I - whatever you need to do to make you feel better.  <br>

Actually Jhave, The Russians were atacked...The U.S. Never had to help in your war vs Germany we chose too. You guys however left the U.S. to fend for itself against Japan.<br>
<br>
Americans Fought a war on two fronts and won. We held off an oponent that could have esily turned the tide of the Russian war by ourselves.Btw thanks guys for your help against the other half of the axis powers!<br>
<br>
I guess Defeating Japan, And helping with Germany as well as suplying Russia/Britain with  weapons/Food//Planes/Munitions was not enough? Tell me Jhave how much do we have to do to earn your respect and Gratitude? <br>
<br>
<br>
Of course Jhave you can always choose the easy way as well. Just label Americans as ignorant/blind with huge egoes that have no idea whats going on around them and are ignorant to everyone and everything. So there for if anyone has a differing Opinion then you then they must be wrong or just an ignorant American. <br>

Excuse me while I jump in my pick up truck now, Grab my two revolvers and ride around my one street town shooting up the saloon for no reason Yeeee haaa!<br>

That's pretty much Merton's stance.<br>
<br>
As for Jahve, he's ignored the fact that many of us (actually I don't think a one of has not) have said that the war wouldn't have been won without Russia's war.<br>
<br>
We are just fine being able to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;The war wouldn't have been won without Russia.&quot;<br>
<br>
But they get all hot and bothered when asked to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;The war wouldn't have been won without the US.&quot;<br>
<br>
It just eats them up from the inside, and makes their eye twich. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font> <!-- .. -->
