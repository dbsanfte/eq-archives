Dying in a war because you or your team were stupid is a bad way to go.

But in all seriousness, I picked the wrong time to fuck around on a topic that involves our soldiers and even though none of you took it the wrong way, I still apologize.<br>
<br>
The time for debate is over and now all I care about is our troops getting out of there alive. So Until the invasion is over I am suspending all arguments against Bush and this war. I know it's only symbolic and doesn't matter as far as the troops go, but it will make me feel like I am showing support for them anyway.<br>
<br>
But when the invasion is over and the occupation begins, the gloves are off again, so be ready cause you know I will have plenty of ammo for Bush by then <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>

I don't care WHAT they face, some things do not lend themselves to good dicsipline.  I see a soldier brandishing his personal weapon around like a toy, I see an undisciplined soldier AND he would at the least get a stronglt stated dressing down for it.  I see an entire unit doing it and I see a undisciplined unit.<br>
<br>
Hell I don't know how many of these kind of rally's I went to, but NEVER and I mean NEVER were our weapons used in such a manner.   Again there is a dman good reason for such rally's for morale and other reasons.   But just because they are about to go into combat does NOT excuse ANY kind of behavior.  <br>
<br>
In fact, if anything dicsipline and control needs to get tighter before combat ensues, your life will depend on it.  That is why I have an issue with it.  An undisciplined soldier and or unit becomes a danger to ME and there is enough to ^%$# worry about when the enemy is shooting at you. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
I fail to understand why you even asked that question in the first place...I mean...I didn't exactly say something along the lines of &quot;looking throughout history and what was written as acceptable, blah blah blah&quot; did I?  NOOooo, so um, nice trying to mix up one argument for which my history background has a major contribution with another subject in which it does not necessarily.  I'll just assume that its you, bein' an ass, trying to pick fun, even though my knowledge is Oh So much more vast than yours since I am the great ruler of your mom!  Or something.  Yea, that made about as much sense as you, I know.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>whats acceptable behavior for high school track team members is not always acceptable behavior for professional soldiers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
True true.  How unfortunate for your weak argument here that indeed this particular analogy can fit very nicely into proving the point because in this particular case it drives home the point that its ONLY YOUR OPINION that you are making claims with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What I can say is that I have been taught all my life that guns are to be taken extremely seriously, and to wave them around like that strikes me in retrospect as indicative of a lack of discipline.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Very understandable.  A point I would like to contribute to this, however, is that most people are taught when they are young &quot;guns are bad, dont touch guns, dont play with guns&quot; when in fact, guns aren't bad, you can touch guns, and you can even play with guns.  That is something that people's mothers teach them because they themselves do not know how to correctly use a potentially dangerous weapon.  Its kinda like when I was young I was told &quot;never look down the barrel of a gun&quot; when infact, there is actually nothing wrong with doing so if you know how to manage, clean, and check a gun correctly for amunition.  These are trained soldiers.  They are forced to clean their guns like, everyday.  They know EXACTLY how their weapons work.  Therefore, when such a person waves a gun around in the air, perhaps even shooting it (considering they are out in the middle of a desert), you can rest asure that they still know what they are doing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>At any rate, Countic, the military is not a sports team. Morale is important, but discipline is equally important<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree, not once did I say discipline was not important...its MORE important than morale.  The weird thing I gotta ask is, even though you say the military is not a sports team...why do you assume that discipline is not important for a sports team by making the following comparison?  There are ways in which they are different, neither morale nor discipline are one of those ways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You really ought to tone down your rhetoric a little bit and put some thought behind your statements - claiming we're all pissed about this because we hate guns is asinine.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Nah, its great logical thinking.  If it pummels opposing opinions into the ground then its assumed to be a bad thing?  Thats strange.  As for claiming that I'm claiming you are all pissed...which means you in particular caled since you think I'm directing at you...I think its important that you remember each time who I am responding to...in particular the person whose quote I placed above.  I don't think I have disagreed with a thing you, in particular, have said in the past two days.  So when I say &quot;you are pissed about this&quot;, in particular, I mean Wenin, the original poster who commented indeed that he is pissed about it.  Keep up with the flow of the argument and you won't find yourself feeling rammed by what I say...since I'm not targeting you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Just be safe doing it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think Arleanna is the only one that takes this to the &quot;correct&quot; level in how they acted.  Everyone has their opinion on what is safe and what is not.  Personally, shooting a weapon into the sky in a desert is a &quot;safe&quot; thing to me, especially when its soldiers that know their weapons.  Calling it unprofessional is perhaps an ok thing, saying you are pissed off that they are a bunch of idiots and they don't know anything and they suck and continuing to bash them for such a successful occasion is NOT an ok thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Good thing being a football couch isn't a prerequesite to being a military leader<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->.<br>
<br>
Now thats kinda funny, because the attitude of this manner that is displayed IS a prerequesite in that thats what gets you a recommendation.  Being able to bring your troops' morale up is key, and very looked up upon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I figured most people with common sense would know that branishing weapons was an unsafe action.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Thats because you don't have common sense, hence why you think that your sense is somehow the &quot;common&quot; sense.  <br>

<br>
Couldn't have been said any better.  Or better yet! I can add something to it!  If you think these soldiers aren't conducting their military action properly, go out there and do it yourself!  Come on!  DO IT YOU ASSES!  Until you go do it yourself, I have no respect for scum that sit back and pick at the imperfections.  Until I, myself, go serve military action I say &quot;they can do whatever the hell they want.  If they want to make some Iraqi dance in the sand by shooting bullets at his feet for pure amusement...so be it.&quot;  Of course, policy still remains to exclude the actual unnecessary injury/rape etc of those in the area.  Btw, &quot;unnecessary&quot; does not mean &quot;We had a gun fight for two hours and lost my best friend, after we handcuffed the guy I beat him for 5 minutes&quot; is unacceptable...&quot;unnecessary&quot; means &quot;after a battle is done and the troops are sitting around all calm that night they decide to go kill 5 Iraqis to get a kick out of it&quot;.  The difference...one is during a time in which I ALLOW the troops that protect me the option to not be perfect considering the stress and strain they are put under, and the other instance is one of pure cruelty for amusement.  And until you go out there and fight the war yourself, you have no other option but to allow it as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radgen>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 631<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/03 5:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=510.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid Shit...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I can add something to it!

Count, if you could learn to READ.  Both me and Wenin HAVE been there.   And have done this.  Panama, Haiti, Iraq to name a few for myself.

When war is apon you and death is a real fact you better have your game face on. I think the men in this pic are not at fault but the officers in charge. If I did that in any of my units I would be done and sent to the rear. War is no joke and should not be taken with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
If you don't act like a combat soldier then you will cost some one there life. It is just plan wrong to act like this.<br>
<br>
They might as well  wear a bandana over there faces and a bulls 23 jersey like the rest of the thrid world rebeals.<br>
