<br>
France, China and Syria all have a common reason for keeping American and British troops out of Iraq: the three nations may not want the world to discover that their nationals have been illicitly supplying Saddam Hussein with materials used in building long-range surface-to-surface missiles.<br>
<br>
We're not talking about short-range Al Samoud 2 missiles, which Saddam is ostentatiously destroying to help his protectors avert an invasion, nor his old mobile Scuds. The delivery system for mass destruction warheads requires a much more sophisticated propulsion system and fuels.<br>
<br>
If you were running the Iraqi ballistic missiles project, where in the world would you go to buy the chemical that is among the best binders for solid propellant?<br>
<br>
Answer: to 116 DaWu Road in Zibo, a city in the Shandong Province of China, where a company named Qilu Chemicals is a leading producer of a transparent liquid rubber named hydroxy terminated polybutadiene, familiarly known in the advanced-rocket trade as HTPB.<br>
<br>
But you wouldn't want the word &quot;chemicals&quot; to appear anywhere on the purchase because that might alert inspectors enforcing sanctions, so you employ a couple of cutouts. One is an import-export company with which Qilu Chemicals often does business.<br>
<br>
To be twice removed from the source, you would turn to CIS Paris, a Parisian broker that is active in dealings of many kinds with Baghdad. Its director is familiar with the order but denies being the agent.<br>
<br>
A shipment of 20 tons of HTPB, whose sale to Iraq is forbidden by U.N. resolutions and the oil-for-food agreement, left China in August 2002 in a 40-foot container. It arrived in the Syrian port of Tartus (fortified by the Knights Templar in 1183, and the Mediterranean terminus for an Iraqi oil pipeline today) and was received there by a trading company that was an intermediary for the Iraqi missile industry, the end user. The HTPB was then trucked across Syria to Iraq.<br>
<br>
Syria has no sophisticated missile-building program. What rocket weaponry it has comes off the shelf (and usually on credit) from Russia, so it therefore has no use for HTPB. But cash-starved Syria is the conduit for missile supplies to cash-flush Saddam, as this shipment demonstrates. We will have to wait until after the war to find out how much other weaponry, for what huge fees, Saddam has stored in currently un-inspectable Syrian warehouses.<br>
<br>
The French connection — brokering the deal among the Chinese producer, the Syrian land transporter and the Iraqi buyer — is no great secret to the world's arms merchants. French intelligence has long been aware of it. The requirement for a French export license as well as U.N. sanctions approval may have been averted by disguising it as a direct offshore sale from China to Syria.<br>
<br>
I'm also told that a contract was signed last April in Paris for five tons of 99 percent unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine, another advanced missile fuel, which is produced by France's Société Nationale des Poudre et Explosifs. In addition, Iraqi attempts to buy an oxidizer for solid propellant missiles, ammonium perchlorate, were successful, at least on paper. Both chemicals, like HTPB, require explicit approval by the U.N. Sanctions Committee before they can be sold to Iraq.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a few intrepid members of the Chirac Adoration Society, formerly known as the French media, will ask France's lax export-control authorities about these shipments. U.N. inspectors looking at Iraq's El Sirat trading company might try to follow its affiliate, the Gudia Bureau, to dealings in Paris.<br>
<br>
Is this account what journalists call a &quot;keeper,&quot; one held back for publication at a critical moment, made more newsworthy by the Security Council debate? No; I've been poking around for only about a week, starting with data originating from an Arab source, not from the C.I.A. (Anti-Kurdish analysts at Langley have it in for me for embarrassing them for 18 months on Al Qaeda's ties to Saddam, especially in the terrorist Ansar enclave in Iraqi Kurdistan.)<br>
<br>
This detail about the France-China-Syria-Iraq propellant collaboration makes for dull reading, but reveals some of the motivation behind the campaign of those nations to suppress the truth. The truth, however, will out.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 715<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/13/03 9:43:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More stink in the UN Security Counsel</span><hr size=1> Same article as Hayzen posted. I am not going to call it outright bullshit, but i have a few problems with it :<br>
<br>
HTPB == polyurethane - you find it in sealants, electrical coating, tires, rubbers, you name it. It's very cheap (~ $5 / kg). It is indeed a binder and you can buy it to make roket model kits.<br>
<br>
UDMH (hydrazine) is nowadays mostly used for pesticides. It was also Nasa's proppellant of choice in the 60s. Again : very cheap (~ $1 / kg). It is also the propellant of the Matra missiles fired by the Iraqi Mirages (that actually popped up right in Google).<br>
<br>
I went to the UN site and checked the lists : neither product is &quot;forbidden&quot;, both are restricted and require declarations. Lots of &quot;i am told&quot;, suppositions and scarce facts...<br>
<br>
It was a little harder, but I did find CIS in Paris (listed in the commercial registry) - by its statute it's a fairly small company (under 200 employees):<br>
<br>
RCS : 320129224   CIS PARIS<br>
7 Rue de Caumartin<br>
75009 PARIS<br>
Société à responsabilité limitée 515L - Commerce de gros de produits chimiques<br>
<br>
<br>
Soo...<br>
1) is Iraq trying to develop long range (ie. longer than spit distance over regulation) ? most likely<br>
2) are those compounds a stopping block ? no you wouldn't need those quantities<br>
3) would France or China bother to protect a market valuated in the 6 digits ? not very likely<br>
<br>
Let's see how many papers pick up this story...<br>

Seems to me we will have problems until we get a new administration. I'm not saying this is 100% Bush fault, but the lawmakers who have publicly made French jokes, renamed everything French to Freedom and are now starting this intiative are certainly following Bush's lead.<br>
<br>
I saw an interview last night where it was said that Clinton is upset that all the diplomatic ties he worked hard to give the US are now being destroyed by this administration. Even Chris Matthews said he missed the diplomatic arm of Clinton's administration.<br>
<br>
Guess I'm not the only one who's crazy.<br>
<br>
***EDIT***<br>
<br>
BTW I am not trying to imply our French ties had anything to do with Clinton. They were talking about places like NK and the fact that the Clinton admin was was far better at diplomacy overall. <p><br>

Unless there is some connection between these companies and their respective governments, I'm still left with thinking there must be more to this.  But then we are talking about other countries, perhaps they just think so differently that they don't see the similiarities between Iraq and Germany prior to WWII.<br>
<br>
Before anyone starts, I'm not trying to draw any lines between the Nazis and Saddam.  I'm just talking about a known agressor country that has been given restrictions on what weapons they are allowed to have, and not following those restrictions.

The pacifism we showed in the Nazi situation and making a pre-empitive strike against a country who has not attacked anyone in 13 years are far different situations. <p><br>

I'm also not trying to draw any comparison between our stance pre-WWII and now, because frankly you are 100% correct.  There is none, we sat back and the President at the time had to push Japan into striking the first blow to get the country involved.<br>
<br>
The parallel that does exist, is the French stance on the issue.  They are still being the pacifists.<br>
<br>
Also, Iraq didn't make just &quot;one mistake&quot;, come on.  By that regards, then Germany only made &quot;one simple mistake&quot; in WWI.<br>
<br>
Man, you only prove again, that you're an Iraqi apologist..... you're que to tell me to fuck off and not to question your patriotism. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
They had an 8 year war with Iran that we supported.<br>
<br>
They gassed the Kurds with weapons we helped them get and we never interfered or even spoke against it.<br>
<br>
They invaded Kuwait under the impression that the US didn't care (the one mistake).<br>
<br>
Other than that, I would like to know what exactly it is they have done since the time they were our buddy until the present time. <p><br>

<br>
The scary part is, I think alot of the right actually believe this. They think Saddam is like these Hamas suicide bombers and is willing to scarfice his country to get one shot off.<br>
<br>
Where they get this crap from is beyond me. He has never shown this type of mentality and in fact has shown quite the opposite. After 13 years of our attacks we still haven't seen any retaliation on his part (no real retaliation anyway - yes, he has shot at our planes in the no-fly zone).<br>
<br>
Saddam is a survivor, not a suicide bomber. <p><br>

<br>
Also, as far as Saddam and his suicidal tendencies.  No he isn't openly suicidal, but he has always portrayed himself as the savour of the Muslim people.  I've seen it talked about many times during documentries discussing Iraq.  They talk of all the images he has him protrayed as.  The military leader, the business man, the intellectual, and... the savour of the Muslims.  I forget the exact person in history that he has been associating himself with, but it is some hero among the islamic faith.  Anyhow, it is his desire to be intrumental in the destruction of Israel.  Given a nuke, would he pass up the chance to just nuke Israel off the map?  That's the real question, and you can debate it all you want, but I'd rather not gamble on it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

For the middle easterners to equate that to the Crusades is not even a STRETCH.  I'm not saying that this IS a religious crusade, with Bush trying to conquer Jerusalem and the land of Jesus and all that, but it could LOOK that way to your average middle easterner who sees him ranting about his God supporting his mission.<br>
<br>
Now, fine and well - I argue regularly on IMs with people outside the US and they tell me all the time about how this is a new imperialistic US, how we're hellbent on conquering the world, etc, and I try to explain that that isn't our culture.  But to the rest of the world, especially europeans, who seem to go through that about every third generation (the conquering of the americas, followed by Napoleon, followed by Hitler, etc) always have their eldest generation remembering the last maniacal dictator who tried to take over the known world.<br>
<br>
We americans have never had anythign like that, other that our conquering of the USA, which is a whole different topic, and mostly a moot point these days.  We traditionally have been isolationists, and prefer allies to conquered territories.  Look at Puerto Rico - probably one of the best places on the planet to live.  You get the full support of the US Gov't to build your infrastructure, pay for your schools, basically run like another US State, you even get to use the US $ as a currency and emigrate to the US without a visa.  But you're not a US citizen, you don't pay taxes, etc.  No wonder these guys keep rejecting becoming the 51st state every time we offer! <br>
<br>
Imperialism isn't in our blood.  But put yourself in a European's shoes, and you see this guy who has just a HORRIFIC presense internationally - I don't think ANYONE here will argue that the man makes an ass of himself when he opens his mouth (compared to the well-spokenness of a Clinton or especially a Reagan, or even his Dad, who was hardly IMPRESSIVE on a podium, but not an ass).  Now, this guy comes out and looks like a ranting maniac, talking about taking all his soldiers and eradicating evil in the world.  This SCARES people because they know damn well if we wanted to conquer the middle east - there's very little that could stop us (other than a billion chinese with nukes and I suppose a billion Indians with nukes, but India's not YET a superpower..give em 20 years...)  <br>
<br>
Honestly, the only thing that confuses me in all of this is that if Europe was trying to keep the US in check, and they knew this was going to end up with a US invasion regardless, they should have supported it 1000% so that it wasn't the start of a US-only conquering machine.  Nobody in 1991 would have accused the US of imperialism, but this time around it's not a far cry.  Not when we're already auctioning off Iraq's assets as if we own the place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>
