<br>
/IC The wind howls through the Paineel Pavilion, tugging at the clothes of the people sheltering there and whistling through the bones of the undead standing guard for the grim city beyond.  A barbarian woman, sitting in this circle of friends clears her throat and starts her story<br>
<br>
"In Halas, the shamans of the Tribunal act as judge, jury and executioner.  Some great shamans think that tae ARE tae law and are capable of great evil ! "<br>
<br>
"When I was a child in Halas, the shamans caught a famous horse-thief, called O'Riley.  They'd laid a trap fer him and caught him unawares; clouted him on tae head and dragged him back to the Pit in Halas, an iron chain around his neck.  There they would keep him fer a day and a night, before they hung him."<br>
<br>
"O'Riley’s daughter, heard her father was going tae hang.  She came running tae Halas, a bag of bright gold in her hand.  She made it to tae town on the day of her father's trial and threw her sack of money at the feet of the shaman-judge, begging fer mercy."<br>
<br>
"Now, tae shaman-judge was a old, hard and sour man, who was responsible fer much harshness and cruelty in tae name of tae Law.  Many's the young Halasman or woman who lost a hand to his court, fer only tae stealing of a chicken.  He looked down at O’Riley’s daughter and his old eyes deepened in his head."<br>
<br>
"He shook his old head at the offer of the bag of gold.  Alone in the Pit with only the daughter and the father to hear, the wicked judge spoke his price for the life of O'Riley : one night of his daughter's life instead.  "<br>
<br>
"I'm as good as dead" yelled O’Riley, "it's only ye this vermin wants !".  He fair shouted into his daughter’s face "My skin will surely crawl, if he touches ye at all, get back tae the Everfrost : Walk away !".  But she did not walk away.  She wanted her father to come back home with her, alive."  <br>
<br>
"That night tae fiercest storm anyone had ever seen came tae Halas, blowing tae gallows tree double in tae wind and drowning all tae sounds of tae town.  Waking late at tae time of tae hanging, O'Riley's daughter found that tae judge had said nothing.  Instead of her father walking free, she saw him dancing tae dance of death on the end of a rope."<br>
<br>
"Eyes blinded by tears, she spoke a curse on the cruel judge, as she could nae get vengeance on him any other way.  She called down seven curses, each one more terrible than tae last. "<br>
<br>
“Nae doctor shall never cure ye !, Nae healer shall ever heal ye !, No eye shall ever see ye !, No ear shall ever hear ye !, No wall shall ever hide ye!, No digger shall ever bury ye and Death shall never kill ye !  If there is justice in tae world, let it be done !”<br>
<br>
"She called upon Bristlebane to give power to her words and to the Tribunal tae let it strike home.  She then ran from Halas before anyone could stop her and has never been seen again."<br>
<br>
"Tae judge laughed off her words, for he commanded spirits of great power and she could nae conjure tae simplest spell.  The months passed by.  Tae judge continued dispensing harsh justice and none spoke a word against him; tae were too afraid."<br>
<br>
"One day, tae judge found a wart upon his hand – only a little thing, but he was troubled.  He was a vain man, despite his great age.  He went tae the potion-makers in Halas and asked them fer a cure – but tae could do nothing and were puzzled by tae blemish on tae judge."<br>
<br>
"Tae second day, he went tae the healers in Halas and asked them fer their aid.  Tae wart had spread to being a rash on his hand and arm and his flesh had started tae stink.  But, again, tae could do nothing."<br>
<br>
"On tae third day, even though it was cold winter, ye could smell tae stink of tae judge’s flesh half way down tae street and tae rot was spreading to his face.  Although he begged tae people of Halas to help him, none would even so much as look at tae man."<br>
<br>
"On tae fourth day, tae stopped listening tae his cries of pain.  Flesh dripped off his face."<br>
<br>
"On tae fifth day, he took shelter in a hovel on tae edge of Halas.  But tae ice goblins, who are ever there on tae fringes of tae town smelt his putrid flesh and cut through tae wooden walls and wounded him sure bad, slicing off bits of his flesh tae eat later."<br>
<br>
"On tae sixth day, tae folk of Halas decided tae burn tae evil out of their town.  They could be nae sure if tae judge was dead or not, but rather than drag him out tae be buried, tae set light tae the hovel and let him burn."<br>
<br>
"But on tae seventh day, tae judge’s burning body was seen stumbling away from tae town, racked in agony, with even tae cool waters of tae lake unable tae quench his paid."<br>
<br>
"My grandfather told me that he had seen tae judge, burning forever in agony – a fit fate for one who twisted tae letter of tae law over the spirit of justice."<br>
<br>
The wind redoubles it's efforts, scattering dead leaves around the open Pavilion.  Kobold snarls can be heard on the breeze, altthough they do not approach the people in the there.  The woman's story tails off, and others in the group tell their tales.<br>
