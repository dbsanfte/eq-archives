<br>
PoShin, you have got to be one of the best, if not the best RP'er this server has. While I my self am not too fond of the concept you portray Shintou, you put everything you have into him. Of course I am telling you something that you already know. But this to me makes dealing with someone like you such a joy. <br>
<br>
It will be a shame if you do quit, for FV will have lost one of the best people on the server. I hope you dont quit. If you are tired of Shin, make another charecter. And also if you feel burnt out, you should take that break you are talking about on the FV Boards. Sometimes a few days or weeks away clears out all the cobwebs.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I would love to see Shintou's reaction to a blind person(just a guess, he doesnt care, the blind druidess is dead meat anyway).<br>

<br>
Secondly, something for Shintou.<br>
<br>
I haven't been on the board for a few days, so I just caught up with all the mess.  Things sure sprout up fast, don't they?  You only met my character Sneaux twice.  I remember both times quite well.  The first time was at Nysa's birthing.  You showed up and caused a lot of hell.  In fact, I think Morgen defeated you in one of your many duels that night.<br>
<br>
The second time, and I don't really know if you remember this, was with Rowynia in Felwithe.  We ran into you quite by accident.  And our exchange was quick.  You looked me over, decided I wasn't worth the 2 seconds it would have taken for you to slaughter me in a duel (which you would have) and you threw a few insults at me and Rowy and faded into the shadows.<br>
<br>
I remember both these encounters because your roleplaying had a profound impact on my roleplaying EQ as well.  With longevity of character comes a bigger and bigger enemies list, as I'm sure you know.  And the end result of that tends to be situations like you've been having with other players, as already seen above.<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy the break from EQ that you're taking, but I sincerely hope that you continue to roleplay with us here, as I have done in my retirement, so that we may all enjoy your Roleplaying style.  <br>
<br>
It should be said that we all have the freedom to choose wether or not we play with someone.  I'd say that I would choose to play with you again someday.<br>
<br>
Respectively,<br>

<br>
Ah, Shintou.  The player I've heard nothing but good things about.  Until recently, that is.<br>
<br>
However, I have enjoyed every exchange we have had so far in the game.  That time when you were disillusioned with the world, Jaranna felt really sorry for Shintou (and I felt sorry for the player, as he was probably disillusioned with the removal of some rules, as well).<br>
<br>
Then there's the time when we met in the bank and you slapped me.  Then I just walked away.  Jaranna's not weak.  She just knows when she's unable to win, and she tries to avoid those situations.<br>
<br>
Jaranna is planning on fighting you again someday.  I want to get up to 59 and trade harm touches with you. *grins*<br>
<br>
But the problem is that Jaranna is involved with Vivienne.  And so, we walk a fine line here.  If you want to RP with me as a member of the Circle of Sisters, then that's great.  I'm all for it.<br>
<br>
But I ask that you do not bring up Vivienne in said RP.  Leave her out of it, as she has requested.  Hate me for being in the Lightbringer guild, and ignore the fact that Jaranna's married (or will be soon) to Vivienne.<br>
<br>
I've really enjoyed our interactions thus far, and I hope they can continue when you return.  I've had no problems with you--just the way your girlfriend stated her thoughts on the SoM board. *shrugs*<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fun so far.<br>

She gasped for the first breath of her new body as she always did, then sighed when she remembered what happened.<br>
<br>
That bastard harm touched her.  He just reached out and laid a finger on her shoulder, killing her as she tried to run away.<br>
<br>
Jaranna screamed in frustration.  Who the hell was this guy?  Was he evil incarnate, as he claimed to be?  No, Jaranna thought.  He's a good fighter, but he's not Evil itself.  But, evil he is, and he balances some good.  So, he is necessary to the balance of this world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it!&quot;  Jaranna looked around, but the only soul in the room with her was the cursed traveller, staring deep into the fire in the middle of the room.<br>
<br>
Jaranna tuned her thoughts to those of her comrades.  &quot;Um...so.  Is he violating my cold corpse yet?&quot;  The answer came back to her.  He had taken the bodies to Freeport and posted them in front of the guild hall the same way he displayed the broken body of Delmarahl.<br>
<br>
She looked around and found the firepot with Freeport's city insignia and touched it, instantly transporting to the docks.  People stared as she walked through the streets, and Jaranna looked around, wondering what they were looking at.<br>
<br>
Then she looked down, and she noticed that she was naked except for her body jewelry.  She started to cover herself, then thought better of it.  &quot;Might as well give these people a show.&quot;  She walked on to the guild hall.<br>
<br>
She looked up at the broken corpse, then pushed it over, pulling a robe from her bag and donning it.  Then she pulled all her clothing, jewelry and belongings from the carcass. But before she took the last item, she looked at the body.  She saw the pain--the surprise--in its eyes.  Then she took her sewing kit, and the body decomposed before her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Balance or not, I will kill him.  Just as he killed me.  Next time he faces me, he will find a stronger wizard.  One with more powerful spells, faster legs, and the wisdom one can only glean from defeat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaranna grabbed a passing citizen by the shoulders and looked him in the eyes.  &quot;He wants to harm touch me?!  We'll see how he likes to be harm touched!&quot;  Jaranna let the wide-eyed citizen go, then ran off toward the Desert of Ro.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;First things first.  I must become powerful enough to implement a Mana Burn.  So, I must learn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaranna spotted a spiroc running along the beach.  She casta spell, slowing it down to a crawl, and she ran in front of it, teasing it with her staff before casting her most powerful spell and watching its feathers burn in a beautiful orange and yellow conflagration.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes....  Learn.  And when the time comes, Shintou Shinai, you will feel the power of MY harm touch.&quot; <p><P>Jaranna<BR>

He wasn't into such endevors, he had sent his message, so he was finished with it. He expected retaliation, so naturally he continued his usual training. Fighting against his Sproc Warrior alone as he did usually, the 'Fear Kiting' Techinque beign his best ally in this battle. Not a clue that he by change slain the very one he was after from the very beginning.. but he had already achieved the goal of his assults. Nay, he didn't have the trouphy to place infront of all that dared to call his straight forward methods 'Weak' and 'Inneffective', but instead, he showed how weak and cowardly she really was.<br>
<br>
He had no more reason to waste time on her, all of her words. Calling him Lord Grays Dog. Calling him Child. Calling him Weak and lame.<br>
But she hides behind the Gods, when the battle is brought to her very doorstep.<br>
<br>
That'll teach her to mock him. That'll teach her to laugh behind his back. That'll teach her to try to weaken and kill his friends. Maybe now with her out of the way, he can reach the goal for which he trains.<br>
<br>
To fight Gore, Gore Bloodlust. Another Insult to the path of Evil that he lays out for himself. All those that oppose the his idea shall die, and Gore Bloodlust.. He allows Paladins within his ranks. <br>
<br>
Rivald. He remembers Rivald well.. he used blinding flash so many times on him... he was still blind twenty minutes after the Paladin laid his body down to waste. He had to find a way to resist magic such as this... then he'd have a better chance on fighting and slaying him, and the many Minions of Gore Bloodlust.<br>
