<br>
This does not require the gays to be &quot;married.&quot; Nor does adoption, or changing insurance laws.<br>
<br>
My sense is that, across the vast population, there would be general support for fixing inequalities such as the ICU example, and a substantial lack of general support for allowing same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot;<br>
<br>
As a general means of pointing out inequalities and garnering support for fixing some of them, advancing the concept of same-sex marriage is not a bad political tactic.  Many state legislators, after voting against same-sex marriage, will feel compelled to vote for the ICU Visitation Act of 2004. That's probably a good thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/03 5:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=102>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>37% of straight males and 13% of straight females have had a homoerotic experience with a same sex partner that led to orgasm.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Not so easy champ.  I want to see the article where THAT tidbit came from.  Also.. the first of the two articles you posted in your thread  had dates of 1995.  Hope you can find something a bit more recent than that to back all this stuff up.<br>
<br>
A 10 year old study of 100 people in California could net those kind of hard numbers.. but let's see the whole article.  IF it was a National Study with more than a couple thousand people from all walks, I'll go with you.  I worked for the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan for about 5 years.  I have some knowledge of what it takes to conduct a sucessful social survey, at least one accepted by todays standards.<br>
<br>
37% is a MONSTROUS number compared to the studies I've read, and I'm interested to see if they feel if you require a partner for this.  I know what you said, but I'm interested in looking at the survey specs.<br>

DON'T think gays should get special consideration for a goddamned thing, but do have issues with committed partners of any creed not getting recognized as a couple for purposes of all the breaks granted by a wedding certificate.  Some people don't WANT to get married.<br>

This is one area where &quot;more modern&quot; research isn't required.  It's not like a quote from 1984 saying &quot;98% of people don't even know how to turn on a computer, so we need more computer education!&quot; or something.  If the data were 100 years old, it'd be perfectly relevant.<br>
<br>
Kinsey's research in the 1930s and 1940s is still the basis of most of the information we have today, if I recall, and is still considered very relevant (although various groups that don't like the results of his work with names like &quot;traditional family values coalition&quot; are always calling his research methods into question, but all scientists accept that it was  a complete and comprehensive study with little margin for error).<br>
<br>
Interesting how scientific research is considered such a wonderful thing, unless it tells you what you don't want to hear.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aandaie>aandaie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/2/03 7:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/aandaie/aan_gu.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> Pedophiles also account for around 5 percent or more of the population, that doesn't make it &quot;ok.&quot;<br>
<br>
Something that isn't statistically normal, isn't statistically normal. Saying that because 5 percent of the population wants to have anal and oral sex with their same sex, doesn't make it normal. Even if you instead say 10, which is probably only true in California or New York (if even), that still doesn't make it the &quot;norm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saying that if they are legal age adults everything should be okay and supported by society is obviously not true, or we would not be writing about this. Society might accept that legal age consenting adults might lay with those of their own sex, not making laws which prohibit it (though in many states such sodomy laws still exist) but that doesn't mean that they are going to sanctify the union through legal marriage.<br>
<br>
A lot of people don't see it as normal. They don't see it as something you are &quot;born&quot; into, anymore than you are born into wanting to have sex with children. It is a preference. It is a perversion, like wanting to dress in women's clothing. It doesn't define the person but is rather who they'd rather mate with.<br>
<br>
The whole &quot;born that way&quot; thing is goofy because I sure wasn't born wanting to do it with the opposite sex. I didn't even know what &quot;it&quot; was so how could I be? By the time I had sexual thoughts, my parents had ingrained the correct choice into me so much that I saw no other action. I was raised watching old movies and media that showed a guy with his woman and the picket fence with the screaming kids. It wasn't until I was around 13 or 14 that I even know what homosexuality really was, at which point the die was certainly cast. <br>
<br>
I think any honest homosexual will tell you that their introduction to it came much earlier, they were never told that there was only one sexual choice (which was then reinforced via media) and so on. I bet in 99 percent of all homosexuals the complete opposite happened and they were introduced to it at an earlier age as well as having parents who said that either choice was perfectly normal at an early age. <br>
<br>
Surveys are always a bit dubious, I've never been interviewed about having same sex encounters nor has anyone I know. Yet they have these 37 percent and 13 percent figures. <br>
That tells you that they may have done the survey in what was a very liberal setting, possibly on college students, or that (as often happens) people lied in their responses.<br>
It has been shown that, especially amongst adolscent males, anonymous testing in junior high or high school will throw off statistics in a big way since they'll just pick the most bizzarre answer on the test. More often than not you'd kind of figure out that such a large percentage of young men have never &quot;<br>
&quot;jerked off on their cousins head while watching their parents do it through a peephole, while being dressed up like Farrah Fawcet.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is a very tiny amount, a very tiny tiny amount. It is a very small amount. It isn't normal behavior. It is not a statistical norm in the least. If you went back in time and asked people like Alan Turing who were actually imprisoned and seriously perscecuted, they'd probably think that as far as today's American society has gone towards tolerating it is really MORE than you could ever hope for. But when you go just a little farther in tolerance, they always want the next thing. They want to be able to adopt, once that happens they want to be able to marry. Some where in there they want the ability to have anyone persecuted who says that what they are doing ISN'T okay, not just people who are actually full out &quot;gay bashing&quot; but ANYONE who ever says that it isn't &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;normal.&quot;<br>
<br>
It had become ridiculous that such a small minority, fully based upon preference, should have such power. The comparisons to race or being albino just don't work, those people are born into that and certainly can't change (unless you are talking about Michael Jackson, the faceless monster)<br>
It isn't a race, it isn't a disability, it is more like a religion because it is a preference. Saying you are born that way is as ridiculous as saying I was born a Christian. I was presented the information and eventually saw it as a choice.<br>
<br>
Due to my own upbringing and being sheltered from even seeing it as a valid choice, or really a choice at all, I am convinced that same sex couples should not be able to adopt. There is just no way in hell that the child is NOT going to be raised with their same sex parents saying that whichever way they go is okay and one way is just as normal as the other. It isn't. Any kiddy book that says that &quot;Betty has two daddys!&quot;, should also say that her two daddy's are definately not normal and many people don't see this as a valid choice. The day might even come when Betty doesn't see her two daddys as being the normal way to go, that is okay. I've never read one of those books but I'm pretty sure they don't say stuff like that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
<br>
Should homosexuals who are part of traditional families with children lose their parental rights after they expose themselves as being homosexual?  Say if a gay man with two small children tells his wife he's homosexual and wants a divorce after 15 years of marriage.<br>
<br>
Should gay women be allowed to bear and raise children via artificial insemination? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aandaie>aandaie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/3/03 1:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/aandaie/aan_gu.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lawmakers aim at denying prospect of gay marriages</span><hr size=1> The problem with so called &quot;research&quot;, is that it is always slanted in some way due to the bias of the researchers. It is sort of like the so called &quot;study&quot; on the hypothalamus of a small number of corpses which was out to say that in gay men they were more similar in size to that of a woman (trying to state there was some biological reason that people are gay.) There were several scientific method errors in the study, such as the very small number of bodies to &quot;research&quot; as well as the fact that the person doing the research was a gay man who had lost his male partner to aids (giving him a moderately good reason to wish to prove that homosexuality is totally biological.) Of course you also have the fact that the difference in size of the hypothalumus would be an incredibly small margin anyway. <br>
<br>
The liklihood of repeat studies being done, when they are so weird and would have to be such a small sample in the first place, is also fairly small (in that case it would be men known to be homosexuals who had died and happened to be corpses at the time of the study... even over the course of several years the sample would be quite small.)<br>
<br>
Raising a biological, half even, child of your own through artificial insemination is very different from being allowed to adopt someone elses child. Adoption is very strict anyway, even for straight couples. They have to go through a lot of screening. It is the highest priority that the child be raised in as normal a setting as possible, with two very capable parents. <br>
<br>
Is there any reason why a male homosexual couple would not be &quot;capable?&quot; No, of course not. Yet to me the better question is would it be &quot;normal?&quot; The obvious statistical answer is no, not in the least. Does this mean that the adopted child would have a harder life? Very likely the answer could be yes. It is going to be hard enough anyway. <br>
So is that something that we should allow to happen? The reason adoptive parents are screened so well is to guaruntee that the child has the best possible chance. Adopting a healthy white baby is in fact so competitive that more and more couples are popping up with asian babies adopted outside of the USA and what not.<br>
<br>
None of that has to do with state sanctioned legal marriage, though. Moreover in the case of a child adopted by two homosexual males, whether or not the two are legally married is going to be pretty much the least of that kid's worries growing up. It won't even be a factor in what he has to deal with in school when people find out. &quot;Oh.. are they married? Never mind then!&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know about losing parental rights, but my guess is a guy who lived a lie for 15 years with his wife and kids would probably not gain custody. He'd likely have visitation but you can bet the kids would probably stay with the wife.<br>
<br>
In the overly political correct times we live in, it just seems that no matter what someone wants to do that the rest of us are just supposed to put up with it. We are going to go over here and do this thing which really might not be the best for society and you have to put up with it. We should be able to adopt a child, though this really might not be the best thing for the child, and you have to put up with it because you already said what we were doing was a valid legal choice when you said we could have a legal marriage and all that entails. It seems we have forgotten what the &quot;greater good&quot; is.<br>

<br>
The degree to which Kinsey's statistics were in error was made quite clear by J. Gordon Muir, M.D. In an article published in the Wall Street Journal (March 31, 1993) entitled &quot;Homosexuals and the 10 Percent Fallacy,&quot; Muir stated: &quot;For years, conventional wisdom has said that 10 percent or more of the population is gay. Derived from surveys in the 1940s by pioneer sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey, the one-in-10 figure is routinely cited.... But there long has been much evidence that the 10 percent estimate is far too high. Surveys with large samples from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Norway, Denmark and other nations give a picture of homosexuality experience rates of 6 percent or less, with an exclusive homosexuality prevalence of 1 percent or less.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The only pure and objective way to do something like this is through cold sampling.  That more or less means calling on addresses sampled randomly throughout the US.
