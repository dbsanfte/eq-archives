Kael zone crashes right as Transcended drops SoRZ and is about to engage the Idol.  This happens as Transcended beats Legendary to the spawn (sorz)(nothing that I am boasting about, its just coincidence really and actually legendary beat trans to vindi).  What is strange is that this has occurred once before (kael crashing on Transcended and ONLY Transcended right as we get ready for attempting AoW).  Of course, a bunch of flaming goes on in /gu about whether or not its someone from Legendary who has found a bug in the game that allows them to crash the zone whenever they please.  None of them with any evidence of course, but still definitely being pondered.  Then a little something occurs in the chat channels...thats right.  A GM accuses another GM of crashing the zone.  Why?  Because Transcended was going to steal a spawn is his reasoning.  The Idol was trained by some newb not paying attention into Transcended's camp when we weren't ready.  A paladin manages to pull it out of camp, and thats when it goes into Legendary's camp and the zone crashes.  A GM does NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to do such a thing first of all.  Second of all, no where in the handbook does it say that beating another guild to a spawn is stealing it.  If legendary had actually pulled idol before Transcended then a GM might *almost* have some grounds, but only grounds to suspend the guild-NOT to crash the zone.  Funny how the GMs aren't there when anyone needs to resolve an issue but are ready and jumping for joy to screw someone over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tudamil715>Tudamil715</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/24/02 8:19:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1381.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yep I got some more beef</span><hr size=1> You forgot the part where you gimps got your asses handed by Vindi.But then again i might have missed it with all that fucking mumbo jumbo shit u typed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=count16>count16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/24/02 8:33:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1381.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yep I got some more beef</span><hr size=1> Yea in a last minute attempt to get him before Legendary since our time before that point had been a complete waste since we got NO loot from sorz (rollback) and we had his pets with him and a cleric who forgot to mention in /gu that he was afk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tarlor>tarlor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/24/02 8:46:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1381.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yep I got some more beef</span><hr size=1> dont forget the part about almost wiping without 20 phalanx to assist <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laotzuqigong>LaotzuQigong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/24/02 9:22:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1381.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yep I got some more beef</span><hr size=1> Heh, this would be really funny if it wasn't so sad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&quot;A GM accuses another GM of crashing the zone&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, guess it wasn't Legendary then.  Feel free to apologize.<br>
<br>
&quot;legendary beat trans to vindi&quot;<br>
<br>
Yup, sounds like Legendary was there first.<br>
<br>
&quot;Transcended beats Legendary to the spawn (sorz)&quot;<br>
<br>
I swear, I really think that Transcended is the only guild I've ever heard of on any server that thinks Statue is FFA when another guild has engaged and killed Vindicator.<br>
<br>
Of course, Transcended has done this before.  Iirc, Transcended also pulled Statue out from another guild who had just killed Vindicator, then claimed that Statue was FFA as it they didn't consider it a linked or gateway type encounter.<br>
<br>
&quot;If legendary had actually pulled idol before Transcended then a GM might *almost* have some grounds, but only grounds to suspend the guild-NOT to crash the zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Transcended was going to steal a spawn is his reasoning&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess the GM on-line disagreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;dont forget the part about almost wiping without 20 phalanx to assist&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh, that is funny.  I would assume, don't get me wrong as I wasn't there, that the presence of Phalanx was most likely an accomodation between the two guilds.  Phalanx was most likely interested in Vindi/Statue and there at the same time, so some deal was probably struck.<br>
<br>
As for needing them there, you must be on a different planet than we are, or a different Tier.  Vindi at best is an 18 man encounter.  Any more than that is just people showing up.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, you wiped to Vindicator with 37 after the zone came back up?  Maybe you just had a different point of view.<br>
<br>
&quot;A GM does NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to do such a thing first of all.&quot;<br>
<br>
You must not have read the same EULA that I did.  GM's can do anything they dam well please, including ban people at random, roll back items, kill you on sight, change your name, or anything else they deem necessary, interesting, or fun at the time.<br>
<br>
Maybe you don't consider killing Statue after someone else (insert any guild here) kills Vindicator kill-stealing, but I guess the GM in question did.  And that's all that really matters in the end doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Of course, I expect a long diatribe to follow, though why you would get so worked up over a pair of mobs that drop sub-par loot, completely baffles me.  *shrug*<br>

Statue and Vindi are on independent spawn timers and aren't linked to each other in any way.  I dont have to kill Vindi to kill statue.  I can just as easily train Vindi to one of the ramps while someone else pulls statue.<br>

<br>
also, somone said somthing about needing phalanx and lego to kill vindi...well this is how it is, maybe u guys arnt in this situation...but we have friends outside of guild /gasp and phalanx wanted to help, in the end im very sorry that trans doesnt have enough force to take down vindi. <br>

one more thing, i apoligize for lego having alot of members, it happens when people like our guild. hey maybe someday people will like u to.<br>

Feel free to apologize.*<br>
<br>
Is this kind of like the &quot;trying to make friends with another guild by asking them what their strategies are&quot; concept?  I do believe I never claimed it was Legendary did I?<br>
<br>
*&quot;Transcended beats Legendary to the spawn (sorz)&quot;<br>
<br>
*I swear, I really think that Transcended is the only guild I've ever heard of on any server that thinks Statue is FFA when another guild has engaged and killed Vindicator.*<br>
<br>
Actually, I have yet to see a tier 1/2 guild follow this policy.  RNG, E/V, and Legendary all do the same.  If the mobs aren't a sequence mob then they aren't related and you get what you pull.  And, in case you feel like trying to claim vindi and sorz are a sequence, they aren't.  They are two seperate mobs.<br>
<br>
*&quot;If legendary had actually pulled idol before Transcended then a GM might *almost* have some grounds, but only grounds to suspend the guild-NOT to crash the zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Transcended was going to steal a spawn is his reasoning&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess the GM on-line disagreed.*<br>
<br>
He surely did disagree, but he was in the wrong.  I already reported his actions and I am sure he will get some sort of &quot;talk&quot; about what he did.<br>
<br>
*As for needing them there, you must be on a different planet than we are, or a different Tier. Vindi at best is an 18 man encounter. Any more than that is just people showing up.*<br>
<br>
If by &quot;at best&quot; you mean &quot;bare minimum for any guild of our (Legendary/Transcended) strength&quot; then sure.  But, having people above 18 is not &quot;just extra bodies&quot; and infact useful up until about 35ish.  The fact that you can't clearly state this suggest you can't state your opinion clearly.<br>
<br>
*&quot;A GM does NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to do such a thing first of all.&quot;<br>
<br>
You must not have read the same EULA that I did. GM's can do anything they dam well please, including ban people at random, roll back items, kill you on sight, change your name, or anything else they deem necessary, interesting, or fun at the time.*<br>
<br>
Actually, they can't.  It states that if they are justified in their actions then they can.  They can't simply waltz around like gods without being subject to their own bosses (the company).<br>
<br>
*Maybe you don't consider killing Statue after someone else (insert any guild here) kills Vindicator kill-stealing, but I guess the GM in question did. And that's all that really matters in the end doesn't it?*<br>
<br>
Actually, no, neither of the two things matter in the end.  What matters in the end is how the guilds in question act in accordance to the rulebook.  Neither guild in this situation violated any rule that Verant has established.  However, the GM did.<br>
<br>
*Of course, I expect a long diatribe to follow, though why you would get so worked up over a pair of mobs that drop sub-par loot, completely baffles me. *shrug**<br>
<br>
Considering that Kael is just about the only higher-end mobs that Legendary can kill besides Tunare you might want to watch how you belittle yourself.  Regardless, its obvious that you completely missed the point because the whole reason this is brought up is for claims over AoW which is not sub-par loot.  Whoever kills the Idol gets AoW since HE is a sequential mob for AoW.  The whole entire point was not &quot;who has claim over AoW&quot; but instead that a GM completely gimped both guilds of the attempt at the mob.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps you might want to get your head out of your ass for once and instead of instantly bickering with the enemy just because they are your enemy you would read the article and place a statement that fits it (or just not post at all).<br>

<br>
I can't say I disagree with you Merton.  Yes, Statue is not actually linked, they are on seperate timers.<br>
<br>
And yes, Trujabi, you can pull Statue through Vindicator if you really want to, though it's generally not worth the bother.<br>
<br>
However, if you really want to extend that analogy further, then you could say it's justifiable to pull Tormax + guards when another guild that is clearly aiming for Tormax has cleared the guard room.<br>
<br>
You could use that same analogy to run past another guild who just killed Aaryanoar into NToV.  And don't talk about linked in NToV, you can kite him just like Vindi if you really want to.<br>
<br>
You could zone into PoF and kill CT after another guild has cleared the plane and is buffing up.<br>
<br>
You could use that logic to engage any mob in any zone that isn't actually linked as a pet or triggered directly.<br>
<br>
The fact that you can do something isn't the same as whether you should do something.  There's a big difference between bypassing content (IE kiting Vindicator) and jumping ahead of another guild who has already done considerable work and is about to engage.<br>
<br>
Now maybe you don't subscribe to that philosophy, and that's everyone's right.  However, as stated in the original post, the GM apparently didn't agree with that logic, and in that particular instance that's all that counted.<br>
<br>
As for whether Verant's view on that will remain consistent is anyone's guess.  GM's are notoriously inconsistent in terms of what they view as kill-stealing and most anything else you can think of.  All you need to do is take a look at the numerous rulings that took place over Ragefire when it spawned in SolB.<br>
<br>
Either way, play how you want to play.<br>
