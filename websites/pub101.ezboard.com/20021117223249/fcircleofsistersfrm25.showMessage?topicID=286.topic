He had spent most fo the day alone, hunting large mushrooms and the occasionaly small Zelniak. His days had been rather peaceful lately, Vivienne had given up it seemed, he talked with Breya occasionally, his family was well, life was normal.<br>
 <br>
He stopped to bathe in a small lake he found, scrubbing himself clean of the spores that the mushrooms released upon death. After giving his armor a good cleaing he dressed himself, slung his bow over his back and continued his steady trot back to the Nexus and and his final destination, the Paludal Caverns. <br>
 <br>
He was going to see Breya...he was not sure if he was interested in her, oh there was no doubting the attraction he felt towards her. She was as beautiful as Vlarina had been when in her wood elf form, and in her dark elf form was a mysterious and alluring image. Yet he found her to be more of a friend now than anything. He spoke to Vlarina through her sometimes, yet to him, Vlarina he died on the steps of Felwithe. He did not have the connection with Breya, the love he had felt with Vlarina.<br>
 <br>
Regardless, he tired of the lonely hunt and had decided to go aid the young Rogue. No Netherbien's bothered him on his way through the dark lair, and the streets of Shadowhaven were not as crowded as usual and he soon found himself at the entrence to the Paludal Caverns.<br>
 <br>
He made his way down to where the first camp of the Recondite Bandits lay, soon enough there he spied the young Rogue. She was in her wood elf form ,looking very much like Vlarina with her smirk and twirling a dagger in one hand. A short sword of Centi make rested low on her hip. He greeted her and gazed about at the adventurers that hunted with her.<br>
 <br>
He quickly prepared his protective spells and counter offensive spells and stood to cast them, begining first by strengthing the group's skin wit hteh toughness of stone ,then entwining them in defensive thorns. He was preparing to cast another shielding spell when a melodious voice behind him made hi mstutter in his incantation.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Wow! You are cute!&quot;<br>
 <br>
He turned around with a smirk (which soon degraded into openmouthed gawking) to see the most beautiful human he had ever layed eyes upon.<br>
 <br>
She was priestess from the looks of it, holy symbols adorned her armor and she wielded a mace and shield. She had a short mane of auborn hair and a soft cheerful look on her face. Her lips were full and alluring, and her smile was like magic...oh Tunare her smile.<br>
 <br>
He quickly tried to place a name to the face of the girl...&quot;Krystarn..initiate of the Sisters.&quot; He nodded and resumed his casting, a smile on his face.<br>
 <br>
Throughout the ensuing battles he tried all he could to keep from staring at the beautiful priestess. She conducted herslelf well in battle, protecting and healing her warriors and singing her prayers with beauty and prefection. He had all but forgotten the dark elf female swaggering around him in low cut chain leggings and a revealing tabard.<br>
<br>
He resumed his spellcasting and a bit of his haughtiness came through; &quot;Bah she probably cannot even wield that mace she carries, as most humans are inferior... I doubt it has even seen a scra-&quot; Solufein's thoughts were suddenly interupted as he heard a loud wet crack right behind him.<br>
<br>
He looked behind him to a most curious sight, a human bandit stood before him, eyes rolled back and bulging. His mouth was gaping open and a small stream of blood began to trickle out from his lips. He then looked beyond to see the true cause fo the man's strange appearence.<br>
<br>
Krystarn's shining, unscratched mace now occupied the entire back side of his skull.<br>
<br>
Tousche.<br>
<br>
Krystarn removed the mace and let the body drop to the ground. &quot;You need to watch your back more elf!&quot;, she sang at him with a jovial smile.<br>
<br>
Solufein couldn't help but laugh as he cut down another bandit that got to close to him. He remained with the party a while, Breya's enticing smirks and looks not catching his attention in the least...not as much as this human girl.<br>
<br>
At some point he heard the call of his Brothers and prepared to go join the hunt once more, then stopped before leaving and looked to Krystarn, &quot;If ye be needing a hunting partner, I could always use a cleric by my side.&quot; He nodded, smiled at the party once more, lingering on Krystarn, and said his fairwells.<br>
<br>
He was determined to see that magical smile again.<br>

Father never taught me about dealing with men... with boys as he called them.  He only taught me war and battle.  The only boys I ever dealt with were other squires of the Knights of Marr and that was usually as an opponent.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I find myself by the bank of Fordel.  I go inside and check some of my gear, changing out a few pieces of new armor I have aquired in my recent journeys.  I gather some coins and head to my room at the Inn.<br>
<br>
I remember back to my days in Freeport... to the days I still had with my father.  He pushed so hard to make me like him, to be hard and unyielding to others.  He would wake me early along with his squires and have us out working with a variety of different weapons and armor.  Later I would be allowed to go work in the jewelry shop with Amber but that was only after I finished my mid morning sparring.<br>
<br>
But no where in all that training did he teach me about how to deal with boys... without trying to bash them in the head.  Amber tried so hard to help me but she was as young as I and... well she didn't know much herself.  She always seemed to have better luck then I but I think alot of that was due to all the boys being afraid of my father.  <br>
<br>
I sigh and wonder how I am supposed to make my way across this gap of knowledge when I don't even know where the damn bridge is to begin with.  Later that evening after my prayers to Mithaniel Marr, I stand in the arena remembering my father. <p><B>Krystarn</B><BR>

He had spent much time with Krystarn as of late. He loved to be with the young human, she was always cheerful, even in battle.<br>
<br>
He had told her how he felt, though he suspected that she had known, Solufein was about as subtle as an enraged Orc when it came to these things. She had asked him to take things slow, though Solufein had been in nothing but very fast and passionate reltionships thus far. But, for her he would take things slow, he realized soon that he enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
The calm that he felt simply being around her was wonderful. Though &lt;chuckle&gt; she was a head taller than him, Solufein would take her into his strong arms and simply hold her, at times he would be want for nothing else. He would softly brush his lips across hers, kissing her face, her hands, her hair...and she would smile, the smile that had enraptured him so.<br>
<br>
Humans it seemed, where much different lovers than elves. Though he did not know enough yet about humans, he wanted to , he wanted to know everything about Krystarn. She had brought a measure of peace to his life by simply clasping his hand and gazing into his eyes.<br>
<br>
He looked up through the high canopy of trees and looked upon the stars. His thoughts longing for her touch once more, her laugh, her smile... <p><left>

Fangs... blood... eyes no longer red, but clear, calculating and cruel blue... still dance across his dream-vision. He is alone, just his breathing and the patting of the rain on his window... slightly ajar with a puddle beneath.<br>
<br>
He reaches to feel his neck, but finds no wound. Looking around his bedchamber, he confirms that he is alone. Strange, sitting on his night table is a small note, with a key on top. The note is written with elegant calligraphy on delicate vellum.<br>
<br>
“Jaranna has given me strength, more than I could have imagined. My mother no longer rules my soul, and I look upon this world for the first time with clear eyes, unclouded by the war of my mother and father. I have turned my attention from you to focus on my love for Jaranna and to rebuild my damaged marriage.”<br>
<br>
“Do not make the error in assuming I have become a nice person. And do not make the error of bringing yourself to my attention again, for I am giving you this one chance to keep your soul free, but only for Jaranna’s sake.”<br>
<br>
The note ends with a flourished V.L. and a quickly sketched thorned rose.<br>
<br>
<br>
(( &lt;smiles&gt; do not take this as me no longer wishing to RP with you, Solufein, or any of the Brothers and Sisters, just some things have happened to Vivienne over the past couple nights to force a change in her basic outlook. She is still just as evil, moody and quick to anger, just her desires of her heritage to corrupt and destroy have been squashed, for the time being, at least. ))<br>

<br>
 <p>Blackest of the black, darker than night, come to me my bleeding light<BR>
See she comes, she comes now, enter oblivion<BR>
Here she is, harder than life, in my arms<BR>
See she here, entwined with love, unclean she is<BR>
And she comes down to me, and she offers me sleep, under her black wings<BR>

He walked over and closed the open window, cleaning the puddle of water with a dry towel nearby. He looked over to his bed and considered returning to a more peaceful slumber, but instead decided to head out into the common room.<br>
<br>
He walked over to the bar and poured himself a glass of wine. He truely wished that Vivienne had no more tricks up her sleeve, not so much for his sake as Jaranna's. He never wanted to see the anguish he had seen on Jaranna's face that night in the dungeons of Solusek's Eye.<br>
<br>
His thougths strayed away from Vivienne though and he considered for a moment finding Krystarn. The Brothers were still asleep in their beds, it would be a while yet before they stirred. It had been a while since he had felt the warmth of another in his bed...<br>
<br>
Nay...he would wait because she had asked him to, wether they shared a bed or not was ultimately the young Priestess' choice. He lit a fire in the hearth and sat down on a bench laiden with cushions, sipping his wine occasionally and watching the rain tap against the windows.<br>
<br>
He soon fell asleep on the bench in the common room, his dreams filled with images of red hair and scents of the ocean breeze. <p><left>

Wardenn, Eviah and the others had brought him to the Heartwood Tavern in Kelethin for a drink and he had hoped to see Krystarn. He had instead ended up drinking himself into a stupor and promptly fell asleep on top of the bar counter.<br>
<br>
Solufein awoke groggily, looking around at the emtpy bar, it appeared to be morning the next day and it was raining outside. Solufein sighed and laid his head back down, thinking of the human girl he was in love with. He took a few bites of some mushrooms in his pack then curled up on a more comfortable bench in the tavern to sleep the rest of the morning off until Krystarn came back.<br>
<br>
He fell asleep completely oblivious to the cat wiskers Nullo had drawn on his face while he slept last night.<br>
