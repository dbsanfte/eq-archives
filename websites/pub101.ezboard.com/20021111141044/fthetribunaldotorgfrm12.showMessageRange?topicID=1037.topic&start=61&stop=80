Gimps pulling to the portal actually doesn't impact me.  As far as it relates to me personally, I could really give a fuck.  It's not about a threat to me, it's about a threat to your servermates in general.  There's only two reasons to hunt there:<br>
<br>
1.  You aren't strong enough to wander around killing the maze like everyone else does, in which case you shouldn't be there anyway.<br>
<br>
2.  You are strong enough but choose not to because you don't give a fuck about anybody else.<br>
<br>
I don't care which logic applies to whomever, both types deserve flameage.<br>

And you're right.. Wolvar does know more about EQ then you.  You've been around since 99 right?  Hmmm.. let me guess.. you've had at least one of every class/race combo, which is your excuse for not having a char high enough level to see the fabled plane of hate right?  Or was it one of those &quot;Well I don't play for levels or anything like that.  I just take my time and have fun.&quot;  Whatever it is, you obviously suck if you don't know that a mob that is being tanked and beat on by a group won't say &quot;Hey!  Screw these guys that are killing me, this guy just ported in!  He's a dead man!&quot;  Unless you specifically mean to tell me that a group that has been fighting there for a while already will happen to wipe out while you're porting in.  Well whatever you mean, it doesn't change the fact that you're a moron.  By the way..  How'd you do in that race anyway?  Well actually it doesn't really matter.  I'm proud of you just for trying.  You do need a haircut though.  Maybe mommy can take better care of you for your next photo oppertunity.<br>
<br>
And Krickett, I don't whine so if you're gonna make a half-attempt at a flame, try using something relevant instead of the cliche stuff.<br>
<br>
Finally Wolvar, I didn't say you don't know anything about todays game.  I'm telling you you don't know about yesterdays game and the balance changes made then.  So while your little buddies Krickett Buttsniffer and Octracula PinkSkirtOn come to your defense about todays game, do you now understand that I'm talking about yesterdays?  (Which is totally relevant because this whole thing started when I stated the fact that way back when, it was made safer for class balance)<br>
<br>
I feel that the more recent change of making the portal even more safe was just a tweak to the original change for balance, and you feel the more recent change was solely because of whining wizards.  I think I have more then enough reasoning behind my opinion to prove it, but if I can't get that across, oh well.  Not like its an important matter anyway.<br>
<br>
And finally, wandering around in the maze killing stuff is stupid.  Name me one zone that wandering while killing is more effecient.  You find a safe spot to pull to, and you pull the kills there.  Thats just the way it works.  I don't see why this is such a problem, when pulling has been around since the beginning and this is no different. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

For the record, Wolvar was created in August of '99, Ravlow in Aprill of 2000.  Not like it matters to this topic.<br>
<br>
As for why fighting there is dangerous, do you not understand AE?  Have you ever fought there?  Do you not understand gimp fuck groups pulling more than they can handle?  Do you realize that a naked caster getting hit by 2 waves of AE will cause a low health aggro that nobody is gonna be able to remove?<br>

Wandering around killing stuff is the absolute best way to experience a dungeon.  Try it sometime.

Why did they change the portal?  Because in yesterdays game, the wizards were given harder portals because the class had damage as its primary focus, while the druids were given ease of travel and healing etc.  Todays game, the wizard doesn't need the disadvantage of having extremely dangerous portals, so they made them easier and more accessible.  If you're stupid enough to port in and be mezzed by a group fighting, you deserve to die.  Stop porting in and socializing for 10 minutes and you'll be fine.  And I'm sooo sure that you're gonna port in JUST as a group overpulls.  If you weren't such a newbie you'd know that if a group is constantly moving, they're not medding, therefore they're not regaining mana as fast as they could be, therefore they're not making exp as fast as they should be, and its more dangerous to advance then to pull to you in a safe spot.  Damn Wolvar.. you're like that moron in StarCraft that after he's defeated, he brings his probe around making pylons all over the map refusing to just accept defeat, wasting the time of his opponent.  Just say gg and click on menu, end game, surrender.  You'll win another argument someday.. you get in enough for probability to be on your side. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Being that I was talking about the most effecient way to gain experience in a dungeon, your sentance meaning takes on the form of experience being the verb.<br>

I was speaking of the recent change to make it totally safe.  This WAS done in response to wizard complaints.  Think whatever the fuck you like, but bringing up a change from 2 years ago that made it safER has nothing to do with the recent changes which made it COMPLETELY safe.  <br>
<br>
Before the revamp, nobody cared that a single lizard would aggro on portal because most highlevels weren't threatened.  AFTER the revamp, people wouldn't use the portal and complained because that single lizard WAS a definite thread.  <br>
<br>
Enough known and respected people in this thread have agreed with the above.  In fact, I believe that you are the only one that doesn't, so believe what you like.  Some unknown server transfer that shows up and shoots off his mouth hasn't a chance in hell of convincing people of anything in the face of some of the well known and long respected people that have posted in this thread.  <br>

That's kinda funny, clueless moron leading the clueless morons on veeshan was it? <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujaeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/3/02 7:27:05 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> The only non FoH people I spent all my time with went into FoH after I left.

<br>
Like I said earlier Mr. Dense.. it has everything to do with it.  It was a TWEAK to a balance change.  If a warrior and a ranger have 1000 hp, and it's decided that a warrior should have more hp naturally, and they're boosted to 1500, any changes from there forward to the base hp of either class is still a balance change.  If later, equipment made warriors have too many hp, and all the rangers in the world started complaining, and they were raised to 1250 base natural hp, they were raised because of tweaks to the original balancing.  NOT because they whined.  But you go ahead and keep telling yourself that if you whine for something you'll get it.  I personally think rogues should be able to assassinate 99% of the time in pvp, including from the front once you have chaotic stab.  If I whine hard enough, according to you, I'll get it.  Oh and I don't see many people saying you're right.. I just see people doing the normal for the Flameboard.. seeing an oppertunity to throw out a useless and pointless flame, and doing so in a very unskilled way.  So if someone wants to say I'm wrong, lets hear it.  Lets hear &quot;You're wrong in this fact that you're stating.&quot;  And then tell me what you think happened.  I'm not asking for people to back me up because I know they don't need to.  So do they. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Wrong.  The initial change to the portal was made for class balance, long before any wizards even thought about it being an issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;When CT was first revamped, the port in was not safe to port in, dressed or undressed. Wizards all over the net, complained about this, cause though that portal has always been kinda shitty, it was made completely useless with the revamp. In answer to the wizard's concerns, Verant changed the mob locations in the maze, so that wizards could again port into CT.&quot;<br>
Right.  I never disputed that it was made easier after the revamp.  I said it was originally made easier for class balance, then tweaked later to further that progression.<br>
<br>
&quot;prior to the upgrade of CT the wizard portal was not safe for mid level players.&quot;<br>
Right.  See above, I never disputed that.<br>
<br>
&quot;The wizard portal was not safe when CT was a mid level zone. The wizard portal was not safe when CT was first revamped. The wizard portal was made safe in response to the concerns of wizards.&quot;<br>
Right and wrong.  Right in the fact that I never disputed that the portal was never 100% safe.  Right in the fact that in response to the concerns of wizards it was changed to be safe again, but wrong in the fact that the reason the changed it is not because the wizards whined about it.. its because they were still tweaking it balance wise.  The &quot;whining&quot; was merely feedback on a balance change from the time it was originally changed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jaeron, AFTER the revamp, the portal was not safe, hell Abscond wasnt even safe (succor, whatever). After about a week or so of wizards bitching (and rightfully so) they changed two things about CT. The portal area, and the abscond/succor point.&quot;<br>
Right and wrong.  Again, see directly above.<br>
<br>
&quot;The wizard portal was never safe to the levels that were meant to hunt in CT.&quot;<br>
Right.  Never disputed it.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, although Jaeron is right in that they made the portal SAFER by removing the added lizards that were in that area, he is WRONG in that it was completely safe at any point prior to the moving of the abscond point and removal of all mobs in the area of the spire. Which was done about a week after the upgrade to the zone.&quot;<br>
Again, just see all of the others above.<br>
<br>
Bottom line here is, people took what YOU said and assumed what I was saying was the incorrect aspects you were arguing.<br>
<br>
This is what I'm saying.  Wizards had a more dangerous port line of spells then druids in the beginning due to the way the classes were balanced.  This is why you don't see a druid port in the middle of a nasty aggro zone in the original EQ, but wizards do.  Later on, after balancing the class on other aspects, the dangerous aspect of the CT portal was made to be a little more friendly.  After the revamp, the more friendly portal was hard again because the lizards were much higher level.  Wizards said &quot;Hey if you balanced this class to include ease of porting, make it easier.&quot;  Yes some said &quot;WAAH I NEED THAT PORT BACK WAAH!&quot; but they made the change based on a tweak to that balance aspect.  Now that its completely &quot;safe&quot;, its still not as safe as a druids port, its in the middle of a maze of hard hitting, high level mobs.  Porting to CT is dangerous no matter what.  Now.. if you find me people who can say I'm wrong on THOSE points that I've been arguing the entire time, I'll accept &quot;Others agree with me.&quot; as a valid response.  Till then, to quote the apparently cliche phrase, STFUW. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.
