If I time traveled to Wednesday and wrote down everything you did in a book, sealed the book, and then gave it to you today with explicit instructions not to open it until Thursday, does that mean that I caused everything you did on Wednesday?  No, of course not.<br>
<br>
However, I did not create the Universe.  I did not set all things into motion that would come to be, and I did not know what would come to be before I set them into motion.<br>
<br>
If at or before the very instance that God created the Universe He knew all things that would come to be, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  He</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is responsible for all actions, including your &quot;choices&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wrong, and built a robot, and before you even drew up the blueprints you knew the robot was going to murder 10 people, who is responsible?  You obviously are.  The robot could not have killed those 10 people if you didn't create it.  It can not avoid killing them because you are it's creator, and your posses the infallible foreknowledge of all of it's actions.  If it could have avoided killing the 10 people then you would have been wrong, and thus not infallible in your knowledge.<br>
<br>
Please explain to me in a logical manner how it could be any other way?  Please explain to me in a logical manner how the outcome seen by an infallible, omniscient creator could be avoided. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A> at: 9/30/02 11:04:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwolvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1287<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/30/02 12:55:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=228.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will</span><hr size=1> Ah, so it's not the omniscience that's got you bugging, it's the creator.

You have to consider the question &quot;What is reality?&quot; though. All we have is our senses from which create perceptions of our world, and that perception is our reality.

There's only one way to find out Universal Truth and that involves firearms, overdoses, fiery car crashes, and nasty stuff like that. I'll just be happy with my little perception :P<br>

This i agree with completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
reality is whatever your senses present you with and you are capable of no more than this<br>
<br>
if you do not have knowledge of an outcome before your decision then you have freewill<br>
<br>
and just because "god" does have this knowledge does not negate your free will<br>

It doesn't matter if you personally have foreknowledge of events or not.  You are a single dominoe in the line of dominoes, not the person who tipped them and caused them to fall.<br>

Ignorance of reality does not revoke the nature of reality.  If it did this would mean Santa Clause or the Easter bunny are real because there are children who believe they are real.

(free will) b) a singular future that could be known by some higher power? (no free will) or c) an infinite number of possible futures that exist simultaneously and which could be all known by a higher power, but are decided between by the actions of temporal beings? (schrodinger's free will). You have to know which of those possible methods of future is reality before you can make any headway at all on whether there's free will, even in relationship to an omniscient creator.<br>

I think there is a god. Whether it's the judeo-christian god or whatever I don't know and it doesn't really make a difference to me. I think in a way that it is in that I think all religions worship the same god or their roots started out that way, but that religion has become so bastardized by man steering it this way and that to conform to his own desires that we've made organized religion basically irrelevant at this point. It's a social gathering of people with common beliefs. I don't think god is omniscient in the sense that religion does, but I think he/she/it is nearly so, and for all practical purposes is omniscient to a temporal being. I also think the question of free will on a universal scale is pretty much irrelevant because I believe perception is reality. Just my 2c on the whole matter.<br>

Fun fun!<br>
<br>
So I'd divide this discussion up into the &quot;does god prevent free will&quot; topic and the &quot;in the absence of god, is there free will.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think the concept of God prevents free will.  It's the assumption that god &quot;built a clock&quot; that causes us to think this way.  He (he for tradition's sake) could have just as easily decided to first create a perfectly random die and then thrown it.  If it came up 6, he'd create the world in 7 days.  But if it came up 3, he'd do it in 5...  He could have defined parameters that he would &quot;not touch&quot;.  It goes back to the old argument if god is good, all powerful, and all knowing why does he let suffering happen.  It's possible for god to limit his own powers, no?  I mean.. he is god afterall.<br>
<br>
And even if he's all knowing and created a perfect clock, we know that there is true randomness at the quantum level.  Maybe that's where god decided to throw the dice.<br>
<br>
Speaking of quantum, book I liked quite a bit called Shadows of the Mind by Roger Penrose poses the theory that conciousness is a super position of quantum particles in the microtubular structure of the brain.  Since quantum is at its core random and TRULY random, not just seemingly random (at least that's the current take) free will is a very real possibility if you believe Penrose.<br>
<br>
The other problem is our language for describing these things.  Given that paradox does exist in our language, it's possible the concept of god is riddled with paradox which gives a concept like free will quite a bit of wiggle room.  It doesn't make the concept wrong, however.  Just unknowable.  For example, &quot;This sentence is false&quot;.  Great paradox.  It's unknowable.  Same as &quot;Can god make a rock he cannot move.&quot;   Unknowable.  <br>
<br>
A Christian would tell you we can know god and his goodness, and the nature of god, but we cannot understand him completely (hence suffering in the world).  Traditional Christianity also believes strongly in the concept of free will.  It's the basis for determination of fate (the free will to choose Christ as savior).<br>
<br>
Speaking of free will.  I'm going to stop typing now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
God is neutral.   Suffering is a part of life, it causes change, change can be growth.  Man learns the most when he makes mistakes.  Mistakes lead to suffering, suffering is not ideal, therefor we try to avoid suffering.<br>
<br>
I also don't believe that God sees any "evil" in the world.  <br>
<br>
I also lean towards there being no Satan, that man created Satan to explain away what "man" "preceives" as evil in the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
But I guess this is all off topic. =) <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umulberry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mulberry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/4/02 7:40:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=228.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/raspberrypies/McBunz1.jpg width=120 height=196></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will</span><hr size=1> There is no such thing as 'free will'.

As humans, we perform actions. That's all that matters. Other humans around us judge our actions as good, neutral or bad.  Whether they are random, behavioral or predetermined by some Creator is inconsequential and unprovable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=228.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=228.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=228.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=228.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=228.topic&index=58><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=228.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=228.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=228.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=228.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
