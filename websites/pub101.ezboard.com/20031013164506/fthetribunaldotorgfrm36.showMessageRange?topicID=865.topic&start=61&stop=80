Hayzen, if you don't agree with the law, by all means write your Congressman, start a lobby group, find those who agree with you and try to get the law changed.  Flagrantly flouting the law isn't an acceptable response, especially in the sort of open democratic society we live in.  You don't have the right to pirate software based on your personal ethos any more than I have the right to restrain a medical practicioner in order to keep him from performing an abortion.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't see a problem at all with the copyright laws we have.  The problem is that the RIAA etc. are using <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>negative</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rather than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>positive</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> methods to get pirates to behave properly - while these methods are certainly legal, they're not going to be good business.  They're not even going to get the really big fish - they know how to cover their asses far too well for that.  So they'll have to bust the 12 year old girls and careless college kids in their dorms and huff and puff, while further alienating the music-buying population in general, when they could be spending the time and effort on, say, a new online music distribution system...<br>
<br>
As for the metaphysical fun with intellectual property, well, my wife's a software programmer, and fun philosophizing about whether neurons firing in the brain is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> copyrightable or not doesn't put food on our table.  Code does, though... at least when it's not copied out for free to the rest of the world based on some geek's notion of &quot;fairness&quot; or an &quot;open-source utopia&quot;. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 9/10/03 3:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maraclaire>maraclaire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I want to marry Matan</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 3:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You can thwart the intention of a law by using loopholes and technicalities, but in the end you have to admit, even if only to yourself, that you know it is stealing... at least if you agree that artists should be paid for performance.

Hayzen, If you were downloaoding  and listening to music you have never purchased the rights to listen to would you feel better about yourself and actualy think what you were doing is just fine simply because you managed to argue enough technicalities and loopholes that the &quot;law&quot; said you were not stealing.<br>

<br>
Let me try to remember some of the points floating around.<br>
<br>
The &quot;what is Intellectual Property&quot; question.  Intellectual Property is a term typically used to refer to property that (1) is the product of human intellect and (2) is intangible.  Real property is land, personal property is items, and intellectual property is intangible -- you can't hold it in your hand, but it is nonetheless property.  Patents, copyrights and trademarks are commonly collectively referred to as intellectual property.<br>
<br>
Rigadoon's arguments about 1's and 0's.  The point is that they encode copyrighted subject matter. Copyright applies to any form of the subject matter &quot;fixed in a tangible medium of expression.&quot;  The 1's and 0's are just as much the copyrighted song as is a CD, a vinyl record, a cassette tape or the sheet music.  Reproducing (copying) the copyrighted music in ANY form violates the owners right.  Copying the 1's and 0's is the same as making an analog tape or copying the sheet music.<br>
<br>
The &quot;archival copy for home use&quot; argument.  That particular reason for copying *is* legal.  That was the Sony Betamax case from the Supreme Court.  Consumers may do that, legally.  But the copy has to be for that use.  Selling or giving away the copy is copyright infringement.<br>
<br>
The &quot;what's the difference between putting the song on my hard drive vs. in my head&quot; issue.  When the song is just in your head, it is not a &quot;copy&quot; within the meaning of the Copyright Act.  The law hardly ever controls or governs what anyone thinks, and this is one of those cases.  But when the song is on a hard drive, that is a copy. Hard drive = tape = cd = sheet music.<br>
<br>
The &quot;I own the copy so I can do what I want with it&quot; argument.  Copyright law is very clear on this.  Owning a copy does not mean that you own the underlying subject matter.  Purchasing a CD means that you lawfully own that CD.  You may re-sell it.  You may not make and sell, or give away, copies of it.  That right does not pass to you as the purchaser.  Patent laws are analogous.  When you purchase a prescription drug, you are not legally authorized to make and sell the drug.  Buying the item does not exhaust all rights to it, be them patent rights, copyrights or trademark rights.<br>
<br>
Other than taking some hits via &quot;bad press,&quot; the RIAA is dead on, legally, with this issue.  The law is very clear that downloading or uploading or passing around or whatever you call it is copyright infringement.  Whether RIAA can solve its problem this way, make more enemies than friends, help or hurt the business, etc etc etc, is a pure business issue, not a legal one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 728<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/10/03 6:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/shippou.jpg height=43 width=59></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It wasn't a personal attack Hayzen, ignorance is not a slur... and it was hilarious.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I do not consider copying a music file for my own personal consumption, not for use to gain profit, to be stealing anymore than I consider photocopying pages out of a book to be stealing.

<br>
then you need to start reading the fine prints in books : you are legally entitled to photocopy small sections of a book - the same way as you are entitled to &quot;fair duplication&quot;, ie for your own personal use, (actually another right that the RIAA would very much like to see go away) of any copyrighted material that you have legally aquired. P2P style file swapping of copyrighted content however -is- illegal and you -are- stealing from the industry, no matter how small the theft.<br>
<br>
I work in the movie industry so i am not as directly concerned, but if the majority were to P2P download the latest movie i spent 3 years of my life laboring on with the tender love and care we are capable of... i would be pissed too. I may not be happy with the blind stupid tactics of the RIAA, but i certainly won't starve either because people &quot;don't want to understand intellectual property&quot;.<br>

<br>
But what makes it ok to copy a small section of a book, over copying a small sectoion of a cd?<br>
<br>
Both are owned by (library, author, lable, ect) and both are being copied. You can't say one thing is ok, but not the other. The only reason I could see copying a few pages from a book is that the library owns that print, and you are paying to use their copier. But then you could get into the arguement that now that you own that copy, you can recopy it if you want to. <br>
<br>
Shrug...I just don't get it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=73322">Mavrrik Magus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Perhaps that is because you are trying to see it as stealing from the individual who owns the original.  That isn't the case.  You are &quot;stealing&quot; from the originator or license holder of the intellectual property.  You are benefitting from someone hard work, sweat and tears and not giving them a penny.  That is the theft.<br>

I guess you don't think that sneaking in a stadium to watch a game for free is theft either? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigadoondemortis>Rigadoon deMortis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 430<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/03 2:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> Copyright law was never intended to be extended as long as it has been.  By now, all of those 60s and 70s songs were supposed to be free as seen by our founding fathers.  In our own lifetimes we were supposed to be allowed to derive original works from the influences around us.  You can thank the Disney lobby for the unending copyright tenure.<br>
<br>
It is the law, and by definition, if you downloaded a song, you are stealing.  I'm not debating the reality of the law.  However, I will debate whether it's right or wrong.  I think the copyright period has extended way beyond the initial intentions of the founding fathers, and so we get Episode I instead of some original good Star Wars stuff from new brains.<br>
<br>
A brief timeline.<br>
<br>
Originally signed by Washington, copyright was for 14 years with the option to renew for another 14 years.<br>
<br>
1831 -copyrighted works was extended to twenty-eight years with the possibility of a fourteen-year extension<br>
<br>
1909 - extended the term of protection to twenty-eight years with a possible renewal of twenty-eight<br>
<br>
1976 - extended the term of protection to life of the author plus 50 years<br>
<br>
1998 - CTEA.  The law extended protection from life of the author plus fifty years to life of the author plus seventy years.<br>

<br>
Yes, you are correct that the term of the copyright has been extended recently.  There was a legal challenge to that and the Supreme Court said that it was fully within Congress's authority to set a longer term.<br>
<br>
The &quot;copyright lasts too long&quot; argument is irrelevant to at least 90% of the Napster-type issues being discussed in this thread, as the actual files being shared would still have had plenty of copyright term left even before the recent changes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2387<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/03 3:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=70>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> I certainly agree with the term being too long... and what's up with allowing people to PURCHASE extended copyrights on shit that they didn't author?? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 729<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/03 8:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/shippou.jpg height=43 width=59></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess you don't think that sneaking in a stadium to watch a game for free is theft either? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Stadium seating is a tangible thing, Wolvar.  If I go into a stadium and take up a seat, that is one less seat a paying customer could have been using.

Why did you put the word &quot;stealing&quot; in quotes?  Who is it this &quot;ability&quot; is being stolen from?<br>
<br>
The seating is what is sold in stadium's Wolvar.  Do you think the security guards in the stadium, and anyone else present who has not paid for a ticket are stealing?<br>
<br>
Last year I was at the state fair and that day Nickleback was playing in the amphitheater.  I did not pay for tickets to go enjoy their concert, however I was in the vicinity a lot of the time they were playing and did hear much of their concert.<br>
<br>
Are you claiming that this was stealing?<br>

I believe I answered this already.   Stealing is by definition a unlawful acquisition of another entity's property.  This definition does not fit the scenario of you having something, and I take it, but you still have it or me taking something you never had in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2401<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/03 9:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=74>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RIAA files hundreds of cases against Music Swappers. </span><hr size=1> You didn't answer my question.

<br>
Your example of the concert was not stealing, but had you snuck into the ampitheater, hid in the bathroom or something, and overheard the concert on premises for which you did not pay to occupy... then you would be stealing.<br>
<br>
Your definition of stealing is quite limited I think.  You can steal a lot more than just physical items.  Here are some broader definitions for you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

To gain by insinuating arts or covert means. (This is my favorite definition, as it all boils down to &quot;gaining&quot; without a price imo.)<br>

I did answer this question.  You need to define what it is you think is being stolen.  First you say it is the &quot;ability to see the game&quot; and below you say it is physical space on the premise.<br>

What you are waffling on is your earlier statement that theft requires you to tangibly take something.  So I'll ask yet again.<br>
<br>
Is it stealing to sneak into a stadium without taking a seat and view the game without paying?<br>
<br>
Is it stealing to sneak into a bathroom of a concert and not take up any space that would be used by others and listen to the concert?<br>

Get a grip.  I thought it was an interesting point.<br>
<br>
At this point the argument is Hayzen vs. everyone trying to convince people he's not stealing.  /yawn<br>
<br>
I know he's stealing and anyone else who downloads music / videos / software illegally is stealing.  I'll debate the right or wrong of it, but not the legality of it.  It's obviously illegal. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://kot.jellopit.com/rowe/rigerprance2.jpg" style="height:211;width:117;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
