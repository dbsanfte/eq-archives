You were but a speck in Etheios history.  An annoying one but a speck nonetheless.  And please don't take credit for my continued existence in the EQ world.  It was the people who I call friends to this day that are responsible for that.  Not someone that I cut ties with because I didn't wish to be associated with them anymore.  Does that make me two-faced?  You turned into something I no longer wished to deal with.  Up to now I have kept my mouth shut about it.  And I think I will no longer speak on the matter anymore. You aren't important enough to me.<br>
<br>
As for Faythen, you are a good person even if your vision is a little skewed.  But at least you stick up for your family and that is a good thing. Faythen and Krickett are cousins I believe.<br>
<br>
You should be thanking me Krickett, now you have a new target to smear.  Flame on...<br>

No the Break up  of Eheios could only be attributed to four main factors.<br>
WillieSB the doofus(too many alts to remember or care about)<br>
The brother/brother-in-law or gay lover of WillieSB (sorry can remember the name) <br>
Teadain the Spastic Ass who couldnt lead a raid but could cuss at the top of his lungs.<br>
Layn the little bitch/whore for the inner clique.<br>
<br>
Here is just a few factual facts for you wonderful people to remember.<br>
<br>
Fact #1. I didnt bring up Etheios  in this thread so obviously I am not the one that needs to get over it.<br>
Fact #2. Sol Invictus is one of the Major Players in the fact that Planes sceduling was finally abandoned<br>
Fact #3. I was the one from the beginning who said Etheios was doomed from the start and would never ever work. (I was 100% correct BTW)<br>
Fact #4. Layn pulls her stupid immature guild remove bullshit that makes her look like a laughing stock IN THE GAME.<br>
Fact #5. Krickett got his laughing stock status  on the Flameboard which is totally seperate from IN THE GAME.<br>
Fact #6. There is no one that can legitimately flame me for ANYTHING I have done wrong in game.<br>
Fact #7. I removed Krickett from Etheios and was forced to remove my alts the next day. 5 months later I publicly flamed Etheios( for the first time) because my request to be unbanned from their message board was denied.<br>
Fact #8. Who said anything about board nazis??????????? Someone having some repressed feelings they wish to share?<br>
Fact #9. Most of you cannot handle facts because the truth shows you to be the asanine,  two-faced, self serving people that you are.<br>
<br>
Serpento.............................................................. ROFL I already said my piece to you. Nothing more to say to you. <br>
Mebad's word of wisdom...<br>
***snip***We're not the ones jumping camps or stealing spawns from other guilds. Being the good guy can wear on you but it's worth it.<br>
<br>
Having respect &gt; Having phat lewts.<br>
Having fun &gt; Being uber.<br>
***snip***<br>
<br>
I refer you to FACT #2 above. You wanna talk about phat lewts and being uber. Look at the equipment on Krickett and any of my other alts. Yes being the good guy in game wears on my ass roughly sometimes but its worth it. It makes me feel good when I get tells from several areas away asking me if I want in a  group. It makes me feel good when I travel halfway around Norrath to help with a nasty CR or a camp of somekind. <br>
Thank God there is a flame board so I can tell some of you bottomfeeders how i really feel.<br>

<br>
If you think ANY of us thought it was going to be easy to pull off you really are an idiot.  We all knew what we were in for.  But the guilds involved had little choice.  All 4 were starting to suffer from an exodus of thier high levels.  The collapse of the scheduling system made the pressure worse because none of the 4 guilds alone had enough manpower to work in a FCFS enviroment.(and before you get lost on another SI rant, it fell apart for far more reasons than that one particular incident)<br>
<br>
This was never going to be an easy task.  In the end the problems were too much to overcome, but you fail to realize that the guilds would not have survived on thier own either, reduced to feeder guilds for the larger ones at best.  At least the leaders of those guilds were willing to take action to try and do something.   So what if it failed, a lot of people worked thier ass off trying to get it to work and though I had strong disagreements with a lot of them, I respect them for the work and effort they put in.  All you ever did was whine, cry and throw temper tantrums. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

WOOT!<br>
<br>
Who here would like to go back to scheduling the planes?<br>
<br>
Who here would like to have a scheduling board with 20 guilds fighting for 30 slots and board camping to get a shot at the next date the minute it pops up?<br>
<br>
Who here would like to have a scheduling board where guilds claim dates and then do not go, but nobody can enter cuz &quot; it was planned &quot; ?<br>
<br>
Who here would like to have a scheduling board where guilds can claim dates that are unable to break the plane?<br>
<br>
Who here would like to have a scheduling board where guilds can claim dates but cannot kill the mini bosses or the gods of the zone?<br>
<br>
Anyone?....<br>
<br>
I'm waiiiiiitttttiiinnnnngggggg........<br>
<br>
The thing was fucked up and it took months for the guildleaders present and working on it to acknowledge problems and act on them.  Once one problem was ironed out, another resurfaced and again took months to iron out.  Some guilds would sidestep the &quot;rules&quot;  then we had shadowbooking, then weekly bookings, gods not being killed, guilds not liking the shadowbooking concept and refusing the shadowbooked guild's entry, blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
It became obsolete as soon as the rate of change and adaptation of the board ceased to keep up with the rate of change of the game.<br>

I can't blame any one individual for the fall of Etheios, it was a very difficult task to merge the different cultures together but we tried and it failed so people moved on.

<br>
That said, I can't resist becoming a quote whore here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Hell just because a few people in the Al'Queda (guild) decided to crash a few plane into some buildings is no reason for us to keep carrying on the way we do. Hell its in the past forget about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Al Queda (guild or not) is bent on the destruction of our nation and our way of life.  This is untenable, and cannot go unanswered.  Notwithstanding the bad taste of comparing them to a fucking game, the situation is entirely different.  When SI turned you into Norman Bates by jumping your hate raid (stipulating for the sake of argument that that is what happened, I wasn't there), they did it cause they wanted to get hate lewt.  They were not out to destroy you or your people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Just because a few white people decided to wear their bed clothes and burn crosses is nothing to worry about. Its in the past forget about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, the situation is entirely different.  The people and organizations that committed hate crimes like burning crosses on people's lawns are certainly to be held responsible, even if it happened in the past.  However, all white people are not responsible, regardless of your twisted views.  Again ignoring for the moment how inappropriate your comparison is, the comparison is entirely irrelevant except as further evidence of your...fucktardedness.  (yeah, I couldn't resist bustin out fucktard, sorry to be so repetitive but I love it so)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Just because some guy named Hitler and his 3rh riech (guild) decided to gas a bunch of Jews forget about it. Its in the past.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
One more time, completely different situation.  See the Al Queda response for why.  One more time, completely inappropriate comparison, as EQ is a  game and should not be compared with real life tragedy.  You can score yourself some extra points here for making a reference to hitler and/or nazis tho, VERY original of you!<br>
<br>
Now, some might wonder why Krickett would choose 3 examples that make no sense and are offensive.  Is it because Krickett is an idiot, and coincidentally picked 3 bad examples that do nothing to prove his point?  Is it because Krickett's point is total bullshit and as such there are no examples that he can quote that fit the facts?  Or is it because Krickett get's some kind of thrill from posting what he thinks is shocking material, despite the fact that his flames are weak to the point of absurdity?  One of life's great mysteries I guess.<br>
<br>
Damn, I'm like fascinated with krickett now.  Post more so I can try to understand what turned you into such a pathetically twisted little troll.<br>

Ya know, the flameboard is seperate from the game but it is symbiotic with the game.  Well, a one way symbios anyway.  Sooo, yeah I can say &quot;Fuck you Elche&quot; and likely no one will hold it against me ingame. However, you reach a point (and you reached it LONG ago IMO) where people stop giving you the benefit of the doubt ingame.  It is at this point that your messageboard persona supplants whatever ingame persona you may have.  At least for those that know your messageboard persona.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure you can still make friends with newbies, at least until they find the flameboard. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a>
