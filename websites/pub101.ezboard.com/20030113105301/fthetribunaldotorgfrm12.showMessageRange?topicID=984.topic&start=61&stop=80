<br>
You made mention; &quot;you and your guild's&quot; when referencing the franchise.  You put the &quot;franchise&quot; as you call it, in the posession of myself and my guild.<br>
<br>
As such the guild would be as responsible as myself.<br>
<br>
This is not the case.  &quot;The guild&quot; had nothing to do with it, as the individual which took over towards the end was not within the guild nor did they even have a play character on the Tribunal, and this individual was the only character to assist in the &quot;franchise.&quot;  As such your accusations were unfounded.  You posted conjecture and attempted to represent it as fact.<br>
<br>
Anyways, post up some proof of ... well, anything you accuse me of.<br>
<br>
Get some proof of the Serone / Vanilia thing.<br>
<br>
Get some proof of this &quot;franchise&quot; which you claim my guild was invested in.<br>
<br>
Show me where I posted up any information beyond Darkvenom's Name and Ebay name (which, his RL name was the same as his e-mail address so it was really a no-brainer).<br>
<br>
Show me where I posted up ANY customer information other than stated above.<br>
<br>
Show me where the ebay clause in SI guild rules was made for or because of me.  Get a founding member to post that up.  If indeed it was made because of me, I encourage them to do so.<br>
<br>
None of the above is going to happen.  You have no proof.  Mixing the truth with guesses and sprinkling in a few lies for good measure will make it all look pretty solid to someone who only knows a few things about the matter.  The difference is that you understand and know where your lies and where your guesses are.  That's slander : P  My comments on your artwork have been personal opinion and always represented as such.  That's not slander.  Me saying that you draw breasts way too big for your female characters is just a personal opinion of mine.  (And please don't say again how I asked you to draw me one... LOL.  Learn to take criticism a bit better, rather than taking the &quot;you're just jealous&quot; approach.  That's ignorant.)<br>
<br>
As is calling Razzine &quot;500lbs&quot; unless she actually is.  Be careful with specifics when they are just guesses.  And you did say you had a relationship with her.  Why was her weight not such an issue then?  Why is it something you use to poke fun at her now?  Isn't that being kinda two faced?  Kinda like when ya sent me that email all apologetic about flaming SI and flaming me etc.   Apologize in private but not in public so you &quot;look cool&quot; to all your little videogame buddies.

Did I quote you? No, so I didnt misquote you. Did I misinterpret what you said? I dont know, I tried to find out why you defending the actions of the terrorists as a desperate statement which they needed to make because of the unfair treatment they get at the hands of America. I am sorry I didnt understand you wanting to try to justify such an event right after it happened when people were still missing, and people were worried and scared and you swooped in and tried to explain that if this did happen, that we should of seen it coming because of America's treatment of the Palenstine people. I am sorry but I didnt see why you want to justify terrorism.<br>

<br>
You should read the board, I tried to see where you were coming from, I posted on that post, and another about that, so I did, nice try though. I also figured if you didnt want to be friends we could both move past it, you were irate because you felt your family was attacked because of their race, and someone metioned &quot;sand nigger&quot; which you wanted to pin on me, but if you look back, I never said that, and I didnt condone the use of words like that, I said it was rude and uncalled for, but the anger you felt over this racism and attacks on the on people of middle eastern decent you took out on me. It was very apparent, but then again I think you didnt read any of the posts, just glanced over them trying to build up some rhetoric to defend your family history. I can understand that, you felt under attack and lashed out and told people not to jump to conclusions about middle eastern people, that I agreed with you about, but you then went to explain that the unfair hand of America has made this possible and that is the reason that people would do this. You tried to justify the attack, that I didnt respect, especially when the bodies werent even cold. It was cold and unfeeling on your part. <br>

I flamed someone for a stupid opinion. I am sorry you are so sensitive that you couldnt handle it. You tried to justify a tragedy which really has no justification, and I found that offensive as you probably found others making racist remarks about middle eastern men. You dont make that connection though, and the sad part is you are going to be a teacher like I said, and you are teaching children that there is a reason for senseless murder by trying to justify the actions of the terrorists as oppressed people who used this as act of terrorism as a message.<br>

Yep, if someone is a moron, I will call them on it. You made such a stupid statement trying to justify it, I felt it was wrong for you to try to justify these murders and I told you that, I felt that trying to justify these acts of terrorism was unamerican and made you just as bad the terrorists in my mind. Sorry, but you trying to explain why these people did what they did when it is really unexplainable and unjustifiable just means you are very dense, or very stupid.

Its not my head up my ass, I wasnt the one defending acts of barbarism as a way to send a message for unfair treatment. You may to say I twisted your words, but like I did then and do now, I am quoting you and responding. I tried to see your side, like I said, I tried to work things out or bury them and let it go, but you didnt respond to the posts other to say how mean and crazy I was. You didnt respond to clarify what you were saying other then the people in the middle-east shouldnt be blamed and if they did do it, its understandable for the treatment they have received at America's hands. I explained to you, I didnt think it was right for you to try to justify these acts, and especially not so soon after the attack.<br>

Yes, I draw pics, but does that make me a saint? Um No, have I ever claimed so? I am sure people disagreed with artists throughout the ages but liked their artwork. My artwork has nothing to do with how I feel about things, and more so has nothing to do with how I feel about this, so why even bring it up? I dont understand the corrlelation, I never made a claim that the fact that I draw pics makes everything all right. It sounds like you feel guilty for enjoying my artwork and not liking me. Let me save you some grief, you dont have to like me to like my artwork and you dont have to like my artwork to like me. <br>
<br>
If I do make miscontructions, I would like you to call me on it, debate it with me, show me your side so I can come to a better understanding of where you are coming from. See I tried to do that with you and you didnt respond, so you left me with what was on the table and not clarifying your opinions. I dont understand exactly why you felt you had to defend middle eastern people after an attack on America, from what I gathered it is because you are of middle eastern decent and felt attacked by all the anger about 9/11 and wanted to stand up for yourself and your people. I applaud that, but I dont understand how you tried to justify the actions of the terrorists. <br>

I actually did do this, over and over again.  But there is no debate with you.  You repeat the same lies over and over again.  You still insisted (as you do now) that I was &quot;justifying&quot; the attacks.  Which I NEVER did.  I NEVER DID.  Did you get that?  I NEVER JUSTIFIED A FUCKING THING.<br>

Rereading it, I see where you are coming from. I take back my statement of you and your guild's franchise, and wish to apologize to the members of AoK who by my bad writing skills were invertendly added to Rynnia and company who were responsible for their ebaying. I didnt mean it like, only to say that you had a clique, or a group, or a franchise within AoK, but if you are of a 4th grade education, you might take it as I was implicating AoK, which I was not. So to clarify, I am not implicating AoK, but your clique'. This friend who made deliveries for you, didnt even have a play character, then how is it you made promises to meet them, how did that character get around, or did you as Rynnia port the items to the mule character and drop them off. I am not exactly sure how that worked, I know you used to claim to deliver the items.<br>
<br>
More so, to claim you had only one person aiding you is a false statement. You farmed items with friends who did in fact know where the items were going and were helping you. Did they make any money? I dont know if they did, nor do I obess over hunting down these things like you. <br>
<br>
If you remember when EV got Rhag2, you claimed we all stole it from you. According to your defination, only the person getting the killing blow stole the mob from SI right? Or did you not try to blanket all of EV under it, saying how we helped kill it. Alot of us didnt know we were taking the mob from you, but does that make us less guilty in your eyes? No. <br>
<br>
You had people who helped you, aware or unaware, they came with you, often they knew what you were doing. I mean seriously, did they really not understand why you farmed this item over and over, and they never saw you selling it in game....<br>

My proof is your own words that you did ebay, that you did have a friend helping you deliver the items, more so, evidence suggests you didnt farm the items alone all the time and the people helping you are as guilty.<br>

I claim you posted personal information of two people. Someone's real life name can be construed as personal information. When you log in many sites, they take your names, but they call it personal information. I dont see Verant giving out personal information like names on their websites, in fact on ezboard, you email and name is considered personal information and confidential if you so wish. You posted his real life name which is personal information, you posted Jayson's real life name, so thats personal information. Um ya gotta help me out, where did I say you posted more?<br>

Of course my inquiry into the records about said cooperation between verant and yourself resulted with them telling me that they cannot reveal any names of people, because wow, this is a shocker, that is personal and confidential.

We are just gonna have to pretend you are either stupid, or a moron to not understand this. You had a reputation involving ebay, and publically encouraged people to do it as long as they could get away with it. Do you really think they just added that in their because it sounded good, or are you suggesting that people cannot put 2 and 2 together and get 4. You brought a reputation with you, one they didnt want clouding their new alliance/guild. So to really act like they didnt make the clause for you is to say I ruined your rep by saying you ebayed just now. <br>

When you say Ebay on this server, one of the first names that comes up is yours, if not the first. So please dont try to act like this is something new and out of left field.

Wow you keep trying to redefine slander, or maybe I need to look up slander with a emoticon happy face behind it to understand. You keep tossing that word out there hoping it has some meaning, sorry you lost the slander arguement, you lost the libel arguement, more so it makes you look like a whining bitch to use it on a flame board. Its typical of your behavior to flame others but to recieve flames you claim foul. You push others buttons behind the computer screens but beg for understanding for your friend who cannot deal with people pushing his/her buttons. How does that make any sense, you do it, but you tell others not to? <br>

My comments on your artwork have been personal opinion and always represented as such. That's not slander.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Okay this is a prime example of you pushing someone's buttons but crying foul when it happens to you. You came after me and my artwork, opinion or not, you persued and included your opinion about my artwork in posts that didnt involve me to get a rise or attention. When you are called on it, you say how its just your opinion and you can say what you want. Fine, but make sure if you want this freedom to harrass me over my artwork, then I should have equal freedom to harrass you over your ebay past.<br>
<br>
1) You did ask for one, stop acting like you didnt want one now because I flamed you. Much like I told Arsi, you dont have to like me to like my artwork and vice versa. You went after my artwork not as crictism, but as your button pushing. If you say it once, fine, its criticism, but to post in a post I am not involved so you could toss a zing at my artwork isnt criticim, its a zing, its your button pushing. <br>
<br>
2) I didnt say you were jealous. I said you really had no place to speak about me misplacing my fantasies as you choose a female avatar in order to drool over it. I have drawn big chested women, and small chested women, and medium chested women, sorry if you havent been out in such a long time and seen women to know that breasts are getting bigger. Maybe if you looked a breast other then that of your mom or your dad's manboob you might know that some breasts are bigger then women's heads. Some people enjoy that look and its a personal preference. You say you dont like it, fine, I got that the first time you said it, but you harped on it and started to post zingers about my artwork in posts that didnt involve me. That is the problem, your incessant need for positive attention. You felt your joke about my artwork didnt get enough of response, so repeated yourself over and over to get a response.<br>
<br>
You are like the stupid kid who tells a joke, no one laughs, so you say it again louder to get people to listen, still no one laughs, so you keep repeating it. You really wanted someone to think what you had to say about my artwork was funny.<br>

The pics she sent me were of another woman with her head which I found out later, the woman was rather fit and trim and attractive looking, and get this, her boobs were bigger then her head...eventually more and more her weight kept changing from 130 to 230 to 330 in a matter of days. I am not expert, but I dont know anyone who could gain 200lbs in a few days. It was nt her weight that was the issue, it was the lying about her weight, along with her accusations that some of her friends where heavier then her when in fact they were lighter. Her weight was an issue then and now. She doesnt use a wheelchair because of her leg, she uses because she is unable to walk for long periods of time without getting winded, but that is understandable because of the heart surgeries and lung replacements she had, along with her breast cancer, but she did run everyday....see the issue was she never told me. If she had been honest up front, I could of dealt with it, but she lied about her weight and many other issues throughtout the time I knew her. So yes it was an issue.<br>

You cry mercy when attacked, but you love to attack people, you brag about how much money you made off ebay, but when someone calls you on it, you say you are being attacked, you cry that your friends are getting harassed but you feel the need to insult my artwork in a post I am not even involved and really has nothing to do with artwork at all, you see your friends as commodities, how can you use them for gains, how can they help you and fluff your ego, you try to point out how I try to make myself look &quot;cool&quot; for my friend, when in fact that is the very reason you post so that you can get that slap on your ass from someone like Dumai or Wolvar. <br>

Okay one, you never did, you got mad and upset and irrational. You saw no debated because you hate to be told you are wrong. And quoting you isnt a lie.<br>
<br>
So you saying that Israsel has gotten more money and protection from the US then Palenstine people was a reason that the people of Palenstine would attack the US isnt justification? You told us in your posts that we didnt understand what it was like to be from that way of life and to that you saw that the US favored Israsel in peace negotions. It sounded like you were saying their is reason for the terrorists to do what they did. That it was understandable because they felt slighted.<br>
<br>
You went on to defend your parents and family because of their background, which is understandable, but their is defending your family from bigotry which I agreed with you on, and then there is defending the actions of terrorists whom happen to be of the same race or country of your ancestory. You tried to justify, rationalize if you want a softer word their plight, which is noble, but no matter how bad it was, I dont condone the taking of innocent lives, that I think we can agree on, that is what I am saying. You were saying there is a cause for this, I say there truely is no cause for taking innocent lives. That is where we differ. I might be stubborn to not see the cause, but like I said, I cannot justify the outcome of the problem in the middle east by looking at attack on 9/11 as a possible solution. My arguement is I dont think you trying to propose a why to how this happened was appropriate at the time, and more so it seemed like you were trying to communicate that conditions in the middle east made this possible. I am trying to tell you, I dont understand how mass murder of innocents can be thought of as a good idea or a solution for the problems you pointed out.<br>
<br>
I am not saying you had the soultion of attacking the US, or that you agreed with the terrorists, but to me it seemed like you tried to justify their attack a little too soon and I couldnt understand where you were coming from trying to explain to me the reasons which caused this. I dont accept reasons for mass murder of innocents. Its not about you are bad and I am good, its that I dont see what you see, and you dont see what I see. <br>

Listen, I only worry about the children you teach and the lessons that mass murder of innocents is justified in sense. Unless you want to explain to me how didnt say that middle eastern people are given the short end of the stick by the US and treated unfairly during negotations. You made that arguement, which is indeed a very good one now that we are looking back, if we want to debate the whos and hows of this attack, but no matter what, I still say there is no justification for taking of innocent life. I dont care how bad it is over there, to feel that mass murder of innocents will get you the reaction or outcome you want is wrong. I feel we as human beings have moved beyond taking of innocent life to send a message.<br>
<br>
You dont want to email me, fine, we can debate it here, tell everyone what you said, maybe they will see it differently then me and tell me how blind I am being to what you are saying, or are you afraid that you might be told you are wrong and someone might actually back me up, I always wonder about those who are so sure they are right, but so unwilling to commit to it.

There's a quote from your e-mail Darkmask.  You said your e-mail was an apology to me and not to SI.  We'll, there's the apology to SI part.<br>
<br>
You posted up some flames and such and then spun around and sent off an e-mail apology.  It's cowardly.  But you had just moved guilds at the time and probably felt you had to do that to fit in with the crowd.  And posting a public apology would make no sense, as all the work flaming someone that, well, you really didn't know, would have been wasted at that point, and you would have been ridiculed for &quot;apologizing to Rynnia.&quot;  I'm sure you'll say &quot;nono that's not the case&quot; but of course you also said above that you did not apologize for flaming SI in the e-mail, and, well, you did.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I have the e-mail.  You started it off with &quot;Hidely Ho.&quot;  Yeah I have every single e-mail ever sent to me since September 1995.  They take up hardly any space so there's no reason to delete them, and I don't hide behind disposable hotmail or yahoo or AOL address so I do not have to go through any extra effort to back them up.  It's come in handy a few times.<br>

So you say you contacted Verant and asked them to provide you with names of people I allegedy turned in to Verant to save my own ass... and that you were told they could not provide you with that information.   I'm sure if you asked them &quot;if&quot; I did the actions above that they would tell you they could not provide you with that information.  Doesn't mean I did do it, just means they can't tell you yes or no or anything definative.<br>
<br>
I didn't turn in any &quot;customers.&quot;  I respected their privacy as much as they respected mine.  Even moreso, in fact, as illustrated by the one instance where a customer posted all of my RL info they had; name, address, ebay name, and e-mail address, and my response contained only the necessary information to prove that the individual did the same thing they accused me of.  So, who told you I turned in customer(s) names to verant in return for my own safety?  Cuz that's not something I'd do.<br>
<br>
I'll say again, in no uncertain terms, I did not work with Verant at any point in time on anything whatsoever.<br>
<br>
You also seem to have a problem understanding when I actually did quit selling items.   It was before Kunark.  Before Kunark I rarely grouped with others, and when I did it was on raids, or it was at the Efreeti Lord for GEBs with about 11 other people +.   I only ever received one pair of GEBs before Kunark, and I still have them.   I was never guild treasurer or recipient of guild funds or items.  No items received on plane raids were not &quot;no drop.&quot;   Explain to me, then, how I grouped with people who knew &quot;where the items were going&quot; etc etc.  Now, I did say some time ago that if I were to group with someone and I had intentions of selling the items acquired that I would inform the group as such, but I avoided that whole mess by just not grouping.<br>
<br>
As far as the &quot;friend&quot; who made deliveries, they had a druid  that they had acquired.   I did not provide them with this character, and they did not level it on their own, so, it was not a play character while in their posession.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you remember when EV got Rhag2, you claimed we all stole it from you. According to your defination, only the person getting the killing blow stole the mob from SI right? Or did you not try to blanket all of EV under it, saying how we helped kill it. Alot of us didnt know we were taking the mob from you, but does that make us less guilty in your eyes? No&quot;<br>
<br>
Different circumstance.  And I did not claim all of EV was responsible.  I claimed that the individual in charge was responsible, and those aware of what was going on I had less respect for than previously becuase they would support it.  I'm careful to not lump large masses of people together, either implicitly or directly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You had people who helped you, aware or unaware, they came with you, often they knew what you were doing. I mean seriously, did they really not understand why you farmed this item over and over, and they never saw you selling it in game....&quot;<br>
<br>
Items sold were from Lower Guk.  Farmed with 2 characters.  Done when the only other individuals in the zone were necros and other small teams (serone etc.) doing the exact same thing.  Some items came from Mistmoore.   All others were traded for.<br>
<br>
No items were sold that were acquired with outside help.  If you wish to disprove this, name one item and who was there to help acquire it.   You do much talking out of your ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its simply my word against yours like I said. I will point out to the posts about Serone and Vanilla where you with great eagerness jump right in on the argument with glee. Almost like you wanted a gold star for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Great... point them out.  You seem to have forgotten to do this.<br>
<br>
&quot;evidence suggests you didnt farm the items alone all the time and the people helping you are as guilty&quot;<br>
<br>
You say people.  I say person.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course my inquiry into the records about said cooperation between verant and yourself resulted with them telling me that they cannot reveal any names of people, because wow, this is a shocker, that is personal and confidential.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm surprised you actually did this.  You got a canned response, if you did, and it doesnt prove anything either way.  Come up with some proof.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its your guild, are we really going to expect them to say pubically they made the rule for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, lol.  They could post up here they made the rule specifically for or because of me and I wouldn't care.  It's not going to happen, though, cuz they didn't.  I was part of creating and implementing said rules.  I was completely for that rule, and I remember quite well that it was not made because of, or for me, but rather because of the EULA.  We do not tolerate the ebaying of guild items.  It's simple.  I think any guild would not tolerate that.  Well, except in the case of Dredd.<br>
<br>
And I did not lose any Libel or Slander arguments.  Just because the is the flameboard does not make Slander &quot;not slander&quot; and libel &quot;not libel.&quot;  That argument is weak.<br>
<br>
&quot;You did ask for one, stop acting like you didnt want one now because I flamed you.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I didn't ask for one.  Aelianna may have asked for one, but Aelianna is not me.  I've never asked anyone to draw any of my chracters.  So, I didn't ask for one, stop acting like I did want one now to brush off my criticism.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have seen her picture, and it looks to be about 450 to 500lbs wheelchair included&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahhhh, wheelchair included now.  I see  : )<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow you really like trying to say I flamed SI. You really hold on to that hoping SI members will rush to your aid? God I hope they are smarter to fall for your bullshit. I flamed you, and I told I was wrong, I wasnt, you are a bitch.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
Check the top of this post, dumbass.<br>
<br>
&quot;when in fact that is the very reason you post so that you can get that slap on your ass from someone like Dumai or Wolvar&quot;<br>
<br>
What can I say... it gets me all worked up!<br>
<br>
&quot;You dont trust anyone who you didnt buy. You like holding things over people's heads, it gives you power, it makes you feel big in your small life, that is why you kept my email, that is why you kept your customer lists, you see it as a way to garner power in this online world, because in your real life you are some skinny little boy too afraid to go outside.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I'm so afraid... why would I post up my name, address, phone number...   Doesn't make much sense, does it?  Again, I keep all e-mails and have done so even before I started playing EQ.  I'm not &quot;afraid&quot; of anything.  I've been up front and honest about these things that others have hidden.  My story has always stayed the same.  I say *you* are afraid, hiding behind the anonymity of your computer, flaming in public and apologizing in private. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 771<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/5/02 11:08:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In deference to the wheelchair bandit</span><hr size=1> Krickett posted:<br>
