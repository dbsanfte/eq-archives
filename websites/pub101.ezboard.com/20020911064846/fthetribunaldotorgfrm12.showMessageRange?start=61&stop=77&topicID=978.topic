And to tell the truth, I really couldn't give a damn about whether I hurt her feelings or not.  As many people (myself not included) as she's INTENTIONALLY hurt along the way?  Life's a bitch.  <br>
<br>
Besides, I've been turned on by everyone I had once considered a friend in RNG anyway.  Why should I care now if they think I'm an asshole?  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately Aea, I think you're the only person that would give a damn about my image, and I thank you for that.  I'm just sorry you've been so blinded by the Innocent One.<br>
<br>
Revenge, do you actually know how to read, or do you just fake your way through life and the game?  If you'd actually read my earlier post, you'd know that I don't have an ex wife.  I also don't currently have a wife.  That's right.  Never been married.  <br>
<br>
I was engaged, and yes, this stuff happened while I was going out with her (MY biggest mistake and regret).  Guess what?  I came clean with her, hence the reason we're no longer together.  Although the letter that my ex received the day after I came clean would have let her in on it anyway.  Oh, did I forget to mention that part? The part where Talvi had a friend of hers mail out a printed out copy of the emails Talvi and I sent to one another and details of the relationship she and I had?  And to top it off, she had her friend send it while on her trip to Florida so I wouldn't realize it came from Talvi.  She got me pretty good on that one.<br>
<br>
And ummm....it's hard to take responsibility for getting Talvi pregnant when I didn't even know about it til after she purposely lost it to spite me.  But I'm sure you knew all about that too.  And I'm sure things like that don't matter, cause Talvi is so innocent, and I'm such a monster.    My real point here though...get some real info before opening your mouth and try again.<br>
<br>
And to one of the above posters?  Don't worry about a pic.  There's no school girl look there. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.jsp?num=951" target=_blank>Reverance Echoblade</a><BR>

No, I am not married, so I could care less if someone posted I had sex with her. Just thought I would clarify that for you guys, since if that little tidbit of your amazing information is wrong, it just boggles the mind what else might be wrong. <p>

There is more worth in cum drying up in a dirty towel. Look at you now. You think its just ironic that you've lost anyone whatsoever that you thought were youre friends? Course not, you a dumb piece of shit. I mean come on, could u really lead a bard class or even anyone else to win a fight with a fire beetle? As much as a piece of shit bard you were, its now obvious youre even more of a fuck up in RL. Oh, what that...you were wrong about Lilwee gettn it on with Talvi. Damn and you circle jerk twins were so sure bout that. Sounds like maybe your stories are falling a part. But, honestly get a shrink. You already owe me 2 grand for the therapy ive been giving you. I dont have time to listen to real life complaints about your dumb fuckn life. So pull you lips off of Vesperr's cock for two seconds and realize no one ever really gave a fuck about you in game or out of it. <br>

I don't give a shit where this came up. I don't give a shit who did what with who in RL. I don't give a shit who has &quot;come clean&quot; and who hasn't. <br>

Keep RL issues in RL. <br>
<br>
I don't care who started it, or why: bringing it to this board (and especially continuing it) sounds mighty like being 10 years old and tattle-taling that Jimmy threw mud on your pants. <br>
<br>
If you're a real man, drop the fucking issue. You wanna make threats? Fine. Go back them up. Go try to kill something. Fire a gun. Whatever. Just STFU, deal with it in real life. This is just getting fucking pathetic that you feel this forum is for your vindication somehow.<br>
