<br>
Now that that's out of the way...<br>
<br>
No system is perfect really, the best systems minimize their imperfections.  DKP systems can face the problems Mrye and Sscaley mentioned.  Awarding the loot faces the problem mentioned by Draelon.  There are other problems with awarding loot as opposed to using points.  The GL could be biased for or against someone.  Or while not being biased, decisions could still APPEAR to be biased.  Or the GL could go so far out of his way to not be biased that he's biased in the other direction.  And yes, the larger the guild is, the more likely that is to happen.<br>
<br>
My own feeling is this: Guilds at the top of the food chain are better served with a point system, while guilds that are playing &quot;catch up&quot; are better served with a system that awards loot based on benefit to the guild. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/sapphirez/images/poda-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naeamian>Naeamian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 753<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/4/03 2:44:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How does your guild handle points? and do U agree?</span><hr size=1> typically with a point system, you trust in your guildmates ability to make rational decisions.. i myself pay a reasonably close amount of attention to the gear my guildmates wear.. it helps me make decisions.. will i bid on, say, a mask of piety (FT3 mask..

<br>
being in a point system guild now, the amount of looting i do has decreased significantly.. it's amazing how, to some people (myself included), putting a value on loot puts things into perpective.. when an item drops that i am interested in, i ask myself first, who else needs it? the next question is, how many hours of my time am i willing to give for this item.<br>
<br>
now.. i've been in a guild that awarded loot... i've been on a couple of raids where loot was /rand.. awarding loot works, assuming your officers and leaders arent the &quot;loot whores&quot; myre pointed out.. you would think a guild officer would be above it, but that is not always the case.. /rand loot, well, we could all probably give a laundry list of flaws on this one, so i'll skip it.  point systems, imho, are the most fair.. the prime example of getting what you put in.. dont think i could have it any other way <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109755" target="top">Naeamian Sweetlyric</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

What does DKP stand for? I'm guessing the P probably means 'points' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My guild recently switched from a point system to a rolling system. The point system had been set up a while ago, and we really hadn't used it ever to my knowledge. There was a list of who had accumulated points, but I don't believe anyone ever bid on anything. You mostly earned points for participation in raids/events, not for hourly attendance. And wow I thought there was a lot of work involved in keeping track of our points, I can't imagine what kind of effort some of these other systems you've described take! Ours was a silent-bid type auction, and you could only bid for the character you had on the raid. If no one wanted it, it would be open to the guild at large (including alts of those at the raid) for a certain period of time.<br>
<br>
The system we have now is detailed <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/dun_tyr/raidloot.html" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on our web site if anyone cares. The basics of it are that you can only roll if your current character can use the item and it is an upgrade. Once you win something, you cannot roll again until everyone else who is eligible has won something. If you request a raid for a certain item, or request an item ahead of time, you can be awarded that item without rolling.<br>
<br>
I can see the merits of a points system, but also many of the flaws that a lot of you have listed. The officers and I discussed the system we had and decided to switch to the rolling system, partly because we could not easily see a way to correct some of the flaws we saw. As we are a small guild and still growing/evolving, we may find it necessary to change our loot system again, but we will see what happens as time goes on. The person who developed the points system said that it was designed for a guild of 100+, which ours has never yet been.<br>

When AL first started using it, a large majority of all the (then)uber mobs in EQ were dragons (old world + Kunark), thus the name. I don't know if AL was the first guild to formally use a point system, but as far as I know they were the first top tier guild to use it - alot of other high end guilds have since followed suit.<br>
<br>
Afterlife's point system is pretty complex compared to many other point systems - along with points awarded for a raid, they have an &quot;Incentive DKP&quot; system which awards points for, among other things, individual or groups efforts that help the guild beat uber mobs (eg. someone who put in extra time helping guildmates getting Emp keys, or bane weapons, etc), which adds a fair bit of extra complexity to their system. They use a fixed item price system, instead of bidding (using seniority/tiers or as a last resort /random to resolve ties, I believe). They also have buy-back schemes, negative DKP buying, and other things. There website (www.afterlifeguild.org) has all their DKP stuff visible by the public last time I checked - they have a pretty cool automated tracking system for the whole process as well. Regarldess of whether you personally agree with a point system or not, AL's system has been running for over 3 years now and has helped keep them as one of the top two guilds in EQ for most of that time - they've had alot of time to iron out the bugs and find a system that works best for them.<br>
<br>
On the opposite side of the coin, FoH uses an award system, where Furor (and, I presume, the officers) award loot to where the feel is the best of the guild. Since they are the other of the top two guilds in the game, either system can clearly be made to work =). One thing I will say, however, is that for an award system to work in a top end guild, the loot awarder (preferably the guild leader) *must* be a totally trusted person who clearly has the best interests of the guild as his or her number 1 concern - and even with a guild leader as capable as Furor, im 100% sure that he has to deal with some truly stupendous loot arguments =).<br>
<br>
Aeaolena, a question for you: You mentioned that your guild works via silent bidding and the winner gets the item for what the runner up paid +1 point. How do you handle the situation where someone bids alot more than he knows anyone is likely to bid just to make sure he wins, but knowing he is unlikely to have to pay anywhere near that amount? For example, a really an item drops that, compared to other items that have dropped before, is likely to go for 25 points (numbers are purely hypothetical). Someone puts in a bid of say 75 points, thereby ensuring they will get it, but knowing the next highest bid is only going to be in the 25-30 range, so they won't have to actually pay 75 points.<br>

<br>
Hrmm.. I dont really see a problem, hehe.  Perhaps I misunderstood the question, but ill try to answer it.<br>
<br>
Say for instance two people bid on a junk item. One person bids 25, and the other 75.  The person who bid 75 would get the item for 26 points.  However, like in Sarta's example - there is always that fear that someone else could be doing the same thing and bid 70 points for it.   In reasoning, people bid how much they think the item is worth to them at the time - and its a risk you take of knowing that you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>could</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> spend every single point you bid for.<br>
<br>
If though, in this case the person who bid 75 points <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>didnt have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> all 75 points to begin with, there is something like a -50 point penalty issued for a false bid.   I do not believe anything like this has ever happend though, and the average of points for all guild members - even casual ones - are way above 75 points to begin with.   Also, the current point totals are updated each night, (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you can only spend the MP shown on the board, you cant count the ones you made that day in your purchase btw</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) and every members complete total is visable to see by any member.  Usually theres always at least one member staring at the point page, telling poeple their totals who ask via tells.  Its also now very easy for most poeple to check their totals themselfs via SHIFT + ALT + R.<br>
<br>
Usually in cases where the item is highly desired or &quot;uber&quot;, people don't mind spending every point they have (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and usually bid every point they have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) - they are just glad they won!! - and got the item they wanted.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am a full proponent of the points system, I believe it really is much more fair to even the casual raider. yet I have to wonder if the posts about the award system are not quite acurate for a guild moving up in the raid chain. now granted my view is stilted as I am the MT for my guild ( no-one else even really close at this point ) but every time I die on a raid, it always seems it is because the heal came in 1 second to late, and if I would have had a few more hpts.. or our primary cleric would have had just a tad more mana and not gone oom, then We both would have survived, thus alllowing quite often the rest of the raid to survive. ( remember we don't have a wealth of tanks to slip in and take my spot ). From the perspective of one who &quot;desperately&quot; wants to get into the high end game, but doesn't want to leavetheir guild family, it would seem the swiftest way to improve the guild just might be the award system. imho <p>Baeaan<br>

In the natural progression at first you want everyone to come to your events, have fun, and if possible everyone have a shot at some new goodies.  This system seems good but the ensuing loot complaints make it a lot of work and stress.<br>
<br>
From there you feel the people that put in hours at every raid are getting shorted by the lucky newcomer high rollers and their great random skills.  So a point system is built and you reward time with points.  Unfortunately a druid with more points than any cleric can out bid the clerics on the FT hardware.  This is not a good application of the gear, but it does promote fairness to the players in terms of immediate gratification.  This system is also, if you use some form of automated process, less work and stress on the officers.<br>
<br>
From there you head towards some form of award system, or hybrid points/award system.  This system ensures, under proper leadership, that the equipment is applied where it will benefit the guild the most making your rise to power more efficient.  FT items make it to the clerics, AC HP STA makes it to main tanks, improved damage to the nukers, etc.  But this system requires absolute faith by the guild in the leadership making those calls.<br>
<br>
If the guild is formed using high level players aimed at immediately raiding, and the players already have a friendship going, awarding may be the first stage, but this is not natural evolution.<br>
<br>
I dunno, they all have their perks and pitfalls, for now we use a point system of 1 hour = 10 points.  Officers, Classleaders and Guildleaders get more per hour, but that may change shortly.  What we found is the bonus doesnt change anything frankly.  We raid the most steadily anyway, so the bonus only enlarges the gap.  Typically My bids will be 300 to 400 whereas a normal guildie will pay 50 to 75 for the same item.  So it all works out in the end anyway. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76272" target="top">Yvil</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
You have hit the nail on the head in terms of problems that up and coming guilds and guilds on the cutting edge of releases run into.<br>
<br>
For your guild to move into a higher level of raiding, you will need to start targetting specific gear aimed at getting that targetted gear onto your key raiders.  If other stuff drops use points, /random, gnome-ball, or whatever other method you guys decide is fair to pass it out.<br>
<br>
As MT for your guild's raids, it is critical that you be equipped as well as possible in order to handle the raids that you are attempting.  The same goes for other core members of your guild's raids.<br>
<br>
I would recommend that your guild identify the core members of your raids and have access to everyone's magelo.  Make sure people keep their magelos up to date.  Your guild should also know the level of raids that they are capable of in terms of identifying the sources of high end goods that you can get.  Then start targetting these for specific drops that will help your core raiders.<br>
<br>
If MT is dying too quickly -- getting you HP gear is highest priority.  If clerics can't keep up with mana, FT is needed.<br>
<br>
Once you guys get comfortable, it is much easier to settle into a points system.  However, at this point, it sounds as if a points system would only slow you guys down.<br>
<br>
Fair or not, allowing random_paladin_027 spend points to buy a bp that the MT could use for hp will only hold your entire guild back -- that paladin as well. <br>

Also, through targetting the mob which drops the ideal bp for the warrior, the guild wouldn't run into the situation where he feels the need to upgrade it until they are prepared for the next level of the game.  Thus eliminating the common situation of multiple BP's rotting in his bank while the pallys and sk's are left out in the cold.<br>

<br>
Welcome to the life of a warrior. A lot of people buy into the fallicy of this notion because common sense seems to support it. &quot;If I only had a few more hp, I would have lived and the raid would have been successful&quot;. The reality of the situation is that if you had a few more hp, then the heal chain would have been on a slightly higher delay so they could conserve mana and you would have died anyway. <br>
<br>
Main tanks in my guild run somewhere between 8k and 9k hp fully buffed, yet they die every single day because a heal came a fraction of a second too late. It ain't going away, so get used to it. Yes, those extra few hp will help you and your guild. They may even make the difference of on a raid sometimes. But in the long term, for a guild that is starting to gear up for higher end encounters, I think it makes more sense to give items to the people that use them for the biggest upgrade. If you look at a raid with 60 people, adding 150 hp to each person equates to 9000 extra hp on the raid. That's a whole extra tank. (for some guilds two) 9k extra hp for the raid will benefit your guild a lot more than 200 hp on your main tank. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3893">Draelon Stormsong</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

i know as an officer in dv, when im thinking of who to suggest for an item.. its an equal mix between most active/biggest upgrade. its when you get into the more casual/quiet members you can find problems. you never know if they're upset or feel used or underappreciated.<br>
<br>
i dont mind dkp tho. as long as officers/leader can stick a hand in and say, hey, this 125hp item should NOT goto a rogue/ranger.. lets give that to the MT or something. but i would never run a dkp system... too much damn work. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
In Velious / Luclin you really needed that extra HP on the main tank, and the extra mana on the clerics.<br>
<br>
Now, with the level cap of 65 (trivializing Luclin / Velious encounters due to increased innate HP / mitigation / mana due to the new level and included AA + new buffs... some of those 50+ man encounters from 6 months ago can now be done with 18 people) those &quot;long&quot; fights don't really need the few main tanks with the high HP, or max FT on the clerics, or the highest mana pools on the wizards for bane.<br>
<br>
With POP, what I have seen is the need for a balanced guild.  A need for everyone to be upgraded, and no classes really favored over others.  Sure, you want those backstab mod weapons going to rogues... and you want those enraging blow weapons on the warriors, and the best DPS bows on the rangers.... but those are very specific cases.   You'll get just as much effectiveness with a 100 or 125 HP breastplate on a paladin or SK as you will a warrior.  Don't brush these classes aside and go with a &quot;Warrior first&quot; mentality, as the ability of these other classes to offtank, and their versatility, make them just as important as everyone else.<br>
<br>
I really think that it is a common misconception that you need all the HP on the main tanks and all the FT on the clerics, etc., as I see people mention this all the time.

If you are dying because a heal came 1 second too late, you don't need more hitpoints.<br>
<br>
<br>
You need to tighten up that CH circle.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
You need better clerics / clerics with a more reliable connection.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
You should have druids healing you in unison with clerics.<br>
<br>
<br>
You need to over-heal.  I'm a strong supporter of this.  Drown that MT in healing.  The number one thing that will lower DPS / introduce confusion for a raid is a MT death, especially if you are so far above other MT's in your guild as you say you are, if you die, it's gonna hurt.  Whatever chain was setup for you won't work on the next guy to step up.<br>
<br>
Don't go for the longest CH pause you can.  At least half your heals should be hitting for 70% or less of your HP.  If you are dropping below 30% hp often while defensive, tighten up that healing / introduce more healers.  If you think you need a /pause 30 chain, use /pause 20, especially if you can afford it.<br>
<br>
Also... that druid nuking his ass off for a couple hundred DPS just cost you the raid if you died because of a damage spike, and he coulda healed you and saved the MT from death.  Get on them about healing and make sure they heal instead of nuke on anything challenging.  Don't just rely on the cleric chain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moontaylesilverleaf>Moontayle Silverleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/7/03 5:53:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Requiem moved to  a Point system a few months ago and the hardest part was implementation. We had to take it in stages, so as not to overwhelm people. We spent a month and a half building up points, then on the 1st of the year we started allowing people to use those points. It basically runs like AL's DKP system, but the points come in a bit faster, and the items cost a bit more. We added some special clauses in there that allow people to bid up to twice the base amount for an item if they really want to, and doing this actually helps people as they feel their time raided was well spent. There are some limitations, and we fall back on /random if no one bids at all.<br>
<br>
That said, we're still working out some bugs and it's not perfect. Some of the problems we have run across are different interpretations of the system by the Officers and Raid Leaders, as well as not having an assigned point value for an item that dropped. These are getting worked out though, and like Rynnia said, the good systems adjust as problems arrive, and change over time as the guild moves forward.<br>
<br>
All in all, the Officers of Requiem felt this was a necesary move for the guild. The old system of /random wasn't putting loot into the hands of people who could help the guild. And a system where Officers decided where loot was going would have generated whispers of favortism, and that's a headache no one wants to deal with. So we went points, and it's working out well. Loot gets done quickly, and everyone walks away happy that the items went to the right place.<br>

A sophisticated award system can be MUCH more complicated than a DKP system.  DKP tends to only reward attendance with some bonus points occassionally chucked on top for non raid activity.<br>
<br>
A good award system will consider, IMHO, raid attendance, date of most recent loot, size of upgrade, utility, non raid activity, time in guild, number of first tier loots held by that person, relative value of the item based on stats and effects, distribution to non-seniors/infrequent raiders, concentration of loot within specified classes and more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=felagund>Felagund</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/9/03 4:18:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2437.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> <br>
The main problem with an awards system is that favoritism can &amp; ALWAYS does happen.  It also relies on the dubious principal that the people in charge of the decisions are all seeing/knowing.  Even if the officer DOES keep a spreadsheets on their people &amp; equip, there is going to be times when they aren't on &amp; loot crimes will occur. <br>
