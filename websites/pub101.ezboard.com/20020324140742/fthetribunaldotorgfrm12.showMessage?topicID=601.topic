Claims of camp stealing, zerging, training, spawning early to keep spawn, endless cyring over ooc, etc etc.  We are used to it but for the most part you are first there and you have the numbers to hand in the pearl, you get the spawn.  True FCFS fashion that is the standad on Tribunal.<br><br>Not anymore.  There is a new gimp approach to this.  The pre-camp /petition.  <br><br>Happened this weekend when we had a single cleric camping ragefire.  Cleared the giants (which to mean does not mean anything other than the camper not dying) and the cleric parked himself in Naggy's lair.  A fair amount of Shining Path came into the camp (about 15ish) and then later on a group of Legendary decided to join the fun.  No rage up just an empty camp.  I thought it would be a fun race.  We had four there and they had fifteen and Shining Path probably had the camp anyway.<br><br>Instead some guild (not RNG) /petitioned for the camp, the clerics in question had to roll off and the winner got to camp Ragefire.  Keep in mind Ragefire has not even spawned yet, just the privledge of camping an empty room.<br><br>I am almost positive Shining Path petitioned.  I do know the cleric camping Ragefire for Legendary was Herbal and made a comment how it was lame to lose a camp to /random.  Since I dont know for sure, I offer the guild in question a chance to defend themselves up front.<br><br>I look forward to hearing a response from anyone that could provide some more information. <br><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Pentagarn Manastorm<br>Baron Sorcerer/Overburner<br>Royal Norrathian Guard <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelcheproudfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 410<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/02 11:06:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=601.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weak Ragefire Practice</span><hr size=1> If you wish to discuss anything of this nature with Shining Path the only proper channel to do so is via /tells to our leader Zyerne.

I decided to tag along.<br><br>Shining Path to my knowledge, buffed and assisted Mithril Heart Brigade in bringing down Naggy so as to get Einye and her forces there right from the start of the camp.  Einye had been up for nearly 60 straight hours from the death of Nagy, staring at a blank wall waiting for her spawn.<br><br>A petition had gone up and a /random had been called for, Einye won this roll.  Later, a second petition went up and the final ruling was that whomever turned their pearl in first got the spawn, again Einye got the turn in.<br><br>While waiting for this spawn, members of Legendary who were waiting to assist Herbal became very bored and decided to xp by pulling from EL to Nagy's room through Stone Spiders (repeatedly training Walkabout who was xp'ing there while  waiting to assist Einye).  Several members repeatedly attempted to train people who were AFK or not involved in this xp'ing.<br><br>We decided to take matters into our own hands.  Three of us in our group, a rogue, a ranger, and myself (none of us level 60 and all only self-buffed) decided to begin kill-stealing (err breaking the trains) on all of their pulls.  After the three of us successfully kill-stole 3 out of 4 nameds from over 18 different members of Legendary they began deciding to pull to a different room, leaving those of us waiting for Rage to do so unmolested.<br><br>When Einye got the turn in, our group of 5 brought down Rage 1 and retreated to the outer room to wait for those who said they would assist.  Several members of the Companions showed up, but after much whining and blatant lies from members of Legendary, they decided to take the high road and not get involved in a potential guild war.  Chatja, however, decided that he was not going to allow a pearl to go to waste regardless of which cleric got it and was incredible -- dragging corpses and serving as uber-main tank.  Also assisting were several Mithril Heart Brigade members, a few freelancers, a dozen SP's, and a couple of remaining members of Legendary.<br><br>Korssis (sp?) of Shining Path kept Rage agroed for well over 20 minutes solo while the forces gathered and he performed several corpse retrievals from all over Sol B.  Grats to him on picking up gauntlets of fiery might, he truly earned them.  Rage was brought down and Einye got her heart.<br><br>With due respect, not every member of Legendary were acting like jack-asses.  Herbal, for example, put in one hell of a long wait and from talking to him, seems to be far more upset at VI for this fucked up camp.

This is typical of the sort of shite and bold faced lies that was being spread that day.<br><br>As I stated, a group of 5 of us brought down Rage 1 while the call was put out.  People were phoned at home, waking them up to log on characters camped out in Sol B, tells to SP that needed to get to Sol B, and requests from members of the Companions to the rest of their guild -- at the very moment that we were fighting Rage 1.<br><br>We engaged Rage 1 at 6:50 am PST.  Sometime around 7:15 am people including Companions began showing up.  By then Rage 2 had begun summoning people to their deaths (myself included once).  Rage 2 killed a number of people before everyone was gathered, buffed, and ready to go.   All of the Companions, but Chatja had left before 8 am PST due to whining and lies about the contested spawn.<br><br>Members of Legendary were hanging outside in the hallways like vultures, simply waiting an opportunity to take on Rage 2 the second we wiped.  The Comps happened to show up before the majority of SP did, so Legendary began crying about how it wasn't fair for the Comps to help SP being that it was a contested spawn (regardless that the SP cleric had won the roll and been the first to turn in her pearl).  Plain and simple they wanted to walk in and finish Rage 2 off after a failed attempt and they were very pleased when the Comps decided to leave.  However, by the time that it appeared that SP might actually have the numbers to finish Rage 2 on their own, all but two members of Legendary had left the zone.<br><br>As a result of stragglers, Rage 2 summoning misc. people to their deaths, and buffing, we didn't even attempt to engage Rage 2 until aproximately 8:30 am.  I know this for a fact, being that I was to be at work at 8:00 am and had already called in with a lame-ass excuse for being late.<br><br>Rage 2 was dead, loot was sorted, and I was TL'ing people out well before 9:00 am.  There was only one serious attempt on Rage 2 and it was a definite success  I know this, because as a wizard TL'ing, I'm usually the last to leave a raid and I was showered, shaved, dressed, and at work before 9:30 am.<br><br>Next time check your facts with someone who was actually there Tarjman.<br><br>Sarta Intoxicaster,<br>Drunken Port-bitch of the 55th Level<br>Freelance Killstealer <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uperacles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peracles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/02 3:38:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=601.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weak Ragefire Practice</span><hr size=1> Tarjman, sounds like u missed your afternoon nap.<br><br>Peracles Faile<br>54th Ranger of Tunare <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utarjman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarjman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/02 4:15:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=601.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weak Ragefire Practice</span><hr size=1> I did Sarta.

So I headed over.<br><br>As to anything before or after, I really can't say what went on - but it became glaringly apparant that basically this was a huge guild conflict between Shining Path and Legendary.  Once this was made pretty clear, The Companions as a guild decided to not help either group as we didn't want to get involved, though I have heard that one or two companions helped with it as individuals.  So to say that The Companions came and helped Shining Path kill Rage is incorrect.<br><br>Also, as to the requirements on EQ Clerics or whatever -<br><br>I keeled the first rage.  The group was sorta arguing over whether or not to kill him, and when I saw his HP going down I decided to kill his arse because I figured that would get the cleric the epic.  When he respawned as a giant dragon I was sorta confused and half dead, so I ran away.  Shining Path keeping agro on him to keep him spawned was because of my error in killing the first ragefire instead of just leaving him.  Not their fault, mine.<br><br>As to the whole who was there first and whose camp it was or whatnot, when I got there Herbal and Eienye were there.  I tried to talk to a legendary person or two, none responded, so I couldn't get their side of any story.  But when it became clear that this was going to be a choosing a guild to support thing, the Companions decided not to get involved.  I myself had to camp as I was late for work.<br><br>Anyhow, I find it interesting that the people making a big deal out of this were not there.  I have spoken with Herbal about the entire situation, and he doesn't feel the fury that some of you are painting this out to be.  He seems to think that the camp is fucked by design.  So if the cleric who was wronged isn't upset, why is everyone getting their panties in a bind?<br><br>This message has been too informative and friendly for a flame board, so I am forced to end it
