the doors of the Circle’s halls. Moving into the light of the interior, the cloaking darkness retreats from Vivienne’s face like a living entity, forming around her slim body  like a clinging robe. In her arms, she cradles her Harvester as a mother would a child. As she steps into the center of the hall, the ghostly whispers of the dead can be heard surrounding her like an aura of the netherworlds.<br>
<br>
“Vendui again, my dears,” she whispers to those sisters assembled in the hall at this late hour, a wry smile coming to her painted lips.<br>
<br>
“I have come here at the request of Lady Nullo, as a result of our lovely meeting just a couple days back. Since my first journey here, several of your sisters have taken an interest in my sisterhood, and my interest has also been piqued in yours. I have hunted with some of you on several occasions, aided a couple through some troubling times, and started to form bonds, of a sort.”<br>
<br>
“Your Lady Nullo and I spoke of a potential gathering of our two sisterhoods, a meeting, if you will. That is why I have returned here at her request, to speak of such an event to perhaps learn from each other.”<br>
<br>
Lady Vivienne shifts and places her scythe at her feet, then locks her hands behind her. “I have come to you without my entourage, and stand before you weaponless as a sign of my intention.”<br>
<br>
Vivienne giggles, her crisp blue eyes becoming shiny, “of course, I still have my spells...” <p>What's the point of living if life is not spent dancing on the edge of the razor-blade?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bcircleofsisters.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalnin>Dalnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder<br>Paddle Mistress</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#660000>(7/15/02 12:30:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> *Dalnin turns looking at the dark elf her face twist in hatred,<br>

<br>
As she just settle down painfully into the chair, a vaguely familiar tier'dal appeared in the doorway. As the dark elf spoke, Zindella wrapped bandages around her wounds, listening intently upon any malcontent that may come from the speaker. Zindella stood up when the tier'dal spoke, ready to question on to why the dark one had taken a fancy unto the circle. But before she could speak, Dalnin leaped into action pouncing upon the tier'dal with a ferocity she had never seen from her sister before.<br>
<br>
Zindella drew her sword. She didnt like the idea of fighting in the guild hall. And she knew she was no match for either her sister or the tier'dal. But she was bound not to have another door broken while she was around again. She whistled her sharpest most ear splitting whistle she could muster, then yelled, &quot;What be th' meaning of this?&quot; She looked fiercly at her sister and Vivienne, awaiting a reply, and ready to step in between them if necessary.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
As Dalnin springs towards Vivienne, a murmur of a chant interrupts the tense-quiet atmosphere of the room.  The green sparkling magic of a holding spell snakes itself around the monk's feet and dives into the floor.  It's not really enough to keep the much more experienced monk in one place, but it affords enough of a grip to at least give her pause for a moment.<br>
<br>
Startled, Dalnin turns around to see the originator of the magics.  One palm still outstretched, the other propped against her hip clutching onto a half-eaten cookie and a tightlipped frown set upon her face, Nullo looks anything but amused.  <br>
<br>
&quot;There will be no blood shed in these halls.  Is that clear?&quot; the Chieftess says evenly.  She looks around the room, her eyes darting from maiden to maiden.  A sigh and a curt nod from Dalnin signals her agreement, though the scowl covering her face still indicates her displeasure.<br>
<br>
Looking towards the Dark Elf, Nullo raises an eyebrow in a sheepish manner and then smirks a little.  &quot;Hello Vivienne.  I gave you my word that you wouldn't be attacked here.&quot;  Her head tilts towards Dalnin and her smirk widens.  &quot;I hope I won't be accused of lying now.&quot;    <br>
<br>
She laughs lightly, the sort of nervous chuckle meant to dismiss away a particularly bad situation.  Noticing that she's still gripping onto a cookie, she raises it to her lips and takes a bite.  Swallowing, she looks at Vivienne again.  &quot;Would you care for a drink or anything? Perhaps, you'd like to sit down?  You are a *guest* in our halls after all.&quot;  She places a bit of an emphasis on the word guest for the benefit of the maidens surrounding her. <p><br><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#990099"><a href="mailto:nullo@hotmail.com">Nullo Kida'Wen</a></b></font>

She tilts her head in Vivienne's direction, &quot;She will not be harmed while she is within this home under civil terms.  We are not in the business of being the aggressor.  And you will not destroy the sanctity and peace that we have constructed here.&quot;<br>
<br>
She steps towards Dalnin and offers out a hand, &quot;Please hand me your weapon, dear, or stow it back away.&quot;  Nullo, of course, realizes how futile such a gesture is really, considering that a monk's entire body is a readily available weapon...but the mere action is symbolic of her feelings anyhow.  Her eyes travel over the other members in the hall, &quot;I do not wish to see any weapons drawn in here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Upon hearing Dalninil enter the hall, she utters a sigh.  These incredibly rash actions of her guildmates return her own quiet suspicions regarding the other sisterhood to the forefront of her mind. <p><br><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#990099"><a href="mailto:nullo@hotmail.com">Nullo Kida'Wen</a></b></font>

If you're not, let me know and I'll adjust it.<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Feeling Dalnin's strong hands grip fiercely onto the red cloth of her shirt, Nullo flinches and screws her eyes tight, waiting and praying silently to the Mother of All to grant her some strength in all of this madness.  When the expected blow never comes, the fair-haired elf opens her eyes slowly, to look into the desperate face of her assailant.  Her 'last resort' spell, the one prayer always kept floating about her mind during trying situations and nasty battles, is pushed away by another prevailing thought. 'What madness has consumed this girl?'  <br>
<br>
Slowly, cautiously, she lifts a hand to Dalnin's face and strokes her cheek, trying in some way to sooth the troubled woman.   Looking directly into her eyes, Nullo quietly answers her, &quot;You know I can't do such a thing, even if she is what should be my enemy...&quot;  She scoffs inwardly but continues on, &quot;...a Dark Elf.  I have always placed my faith in you, but lately, you worry me greatly dear.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Her hand drops lightly from the monk's face.  Taking a deep renewing breath, she places both hands atop Dalnin's in a swift but gentle motion.   But instead of making an attempt to rip them away from her tunic, she lets them rest there as she cranes her head to look around the larger human and at the Dark Elf standing near the doorway.  Raising an eyebrow, she levels her gaze upon her guest, &quot;What say you to all this that Dalnin has claimed, Vivienne?&quot;  As keen as her own ears are, she knows the Tier'Dal should be capable of overhearing the not-so-hushed accusations.    <p><br><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#990099"><a href="mailto:nullo@hotmail.com">Nullo Kida'Wen</a></b></font>

Jaranna looks around at all the faces in the room, seeing the tension, then realizes what must be happening.  &quot;What is going on here?  Someone spill it now!&quot;<br>

<br>
Vivienne shrugs slightly at Lady Nullo's query, her smile returning, though cautious. &quot;As I have stated before, I do not know of the man she speaks. Without knowing his name, I cannot defend myself from Lady Dalnin's accusations accordingly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;However, I will state this, of the few men I have actually been with, despite my &quot;reputation&quot;, they have all been adults fully capable of making their own decisions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vivienne's smiles shifts, becoming softer and sadder. &quot;I am greatly desired by both men and women. While in my youth, I delighted in the attention that it brought me, but I made some unwise choices. Since becoming an Ilharess, I have been forced to grow up as I have over forty daughters depending on me for their safety and security. I have found my desirability less of a joy, and more of burden.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vivienne starts as Jaranna suddenly grabs hold of her in a hug, scattering the spectres like smoke in a breeze. Regaining her composure, Vivienne gives Jaranna a quick, friendly kiss on the cheek.<br>

You must pardon me with just popping up like this. I know some of you in this hall knows me by now and some of you I just simple have not had the pleasure of meeting yet. I seldom leave Vivienne side you could say we are as one and today that wasn’t going to change. Many of you should take a lesson in courtly manners. Having people burst up ready to slice down company very bad form. That’s not discrediting you of course Nullo. Some people act in pure emotion and forgot there duties at times. I would of popped up sooner but I knew if a attack happened by one Vivienne would of had it well in control and if others would of tried anything I would of gladly helped take care of such actions. But I must say I am really rather shocked. All the Circle of Sisters members I have met have with just a few exceptions have acted rather polite and a good show of your leadership. But pardon such thoughts,  I just thought with Vivienne here proposing a nice friendly meeting of the Circle of Sisters and her Sisters of Myth. That maybe calmer heads would prevail. After all I would think many would see this as a time to meet with those they very rarely get to see with no weapons no harsh words just a gathering of people a party if you wish. Is such a notion too horrible for some?<br>
<br>
*Stands there sighing for a moment.*<br>
<br>
But really I am sorry just standing there seeing such fire build up inside of some here bothered me. Let me introduce myself for those of this hall that have not had the pleasure to meet me yet. My name is Dawninglight Spulzeer. I work in the arts of wizardry and must say I do enjoy doing such. Vivienne’s well being and safety is always on my mind that is why I am here. <br>

*Gives a light bow before Nullo and just stand beside Vivienne a soft smile on my face.*<br>

She looks up suddenly, her eyes now shiny with moisture, a pained look upon her face.<br>
<br>
“Oh, my dear... if you only talked to me sooner... so much of this could have been averted. I never tossed Braellar aside, I was to be married to him. He... he made a choice, political power as the patron of Sel’Quar, or me as his wife. He felt the two could never blend together.”<br>
<br>
Vivienne’s voice drops to a barely audible pained whisper, “he chose his position over me. I left Sel’Quar because I could never bear to see him everyday, but never be able to touch him, to never kiss him again, to never lie in his arms. I loved him so very dearly, and I still do.”<br>
<br>
Vivienne looks up pleadingly at Dalnin, “I never knew about your love for him...”<br>
<br>
As Llylewen strikes out at the wraith, Vivienne’s eyes suddenly clear, focusing on her, “please, do not try to harm them, they are not a threat to you. My companions are not undead, but merely the dead, shadows of those that once lived. They speak to me, tell me their secrets, and I listen to their whispers and songs.”<br>
<br>
Vivienne looks around the chamber, at all the faces glaring at her, “I am sorry, it seems that the more I try to escape my past, the more it returns to haunt me.”<br>
<br>
As Dawninglight reveals her presence beside her, Vivienne seems to take some comfort in her closeness, her pained look softening somewhat. She leans against the koada’dal and takes Dawninglight’s hand in hers, grippig it tightly.<br>
<br>
“Do not be too harsh with them, my love,” Vivienne whispers to her companion. “Hell hath no fury, after all...” she adds, leaving the age old saying incomplete. <p>What's the point of living if life is not spent dancing on the edge of the razor-blade?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ullylewen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llylewen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sister</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#660000>(7/16/02 8:19:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My My</span><hr size=1> Llylewen pants a little and stops trying to demolish the spectors.  &quot;Remove them.

Her gaze turns to Dawnlight, giving her a look of disgust.  &quot;Those that consort with the filth of Norrath have little room to speak of courtly manners.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her sword stays unsheathed, but the blue aura around it and herself fades until it is only visible to those of keen eye.  Llylewen shoots a disgusted glare at Jaranna as well, then storms from the hall up to her room.  <br>
<br>
Once in her own private space, she pulls out one of her backpacks and throws provisions into it.  She pulls her armor out of the closet and puts it on, being a bit less careful than she usually is.  Her shield and swords disappear into the bag as well and she slings it across her shoulder.  <br>
<br>
Making as much noise as she possibly can, Llylewen storms out the back entrance, muttering about the guildhall needing a good cleaning before she'll return. <p><p><font face="Calisto MT"><img border="0" src="http://www.hyperjump.net/lunap2000/llylewen2.jpg" align="left" width="104" height="104"></font><font face="Invitation" size="4">Llylewen
