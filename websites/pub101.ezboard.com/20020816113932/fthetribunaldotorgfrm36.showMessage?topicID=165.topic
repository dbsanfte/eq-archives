But when i read a journalist praising the &quot;The Sun&quot; as a quality information piece, i chuckle politely. The Sun is a populist paper that owes it's high sales probably more for its &quot;page 3 girls&quot; (yes that's right : a naked chick in colors on full page 3...) than it's extremely politically biased and uninformed editorials. The Sun was also one of those papers fronting &quot;British Beef is Safe&quot; when the Mad Cow scandal started spreading...<br>
<br>
I glanced over the articles quickly... They seem to ignore and sweep under the rug with forceful melodrama (&quot;savage murder of jews....&quot;) a couple of rather important factors. The first one is the single most racist current that is currently sweeping across europe is not anti-semitic but a huge integration problem of middle east / north african islamist populations in fact.<br>
<br>
I'll drop the Le Pen french chapter : that would take more time than I have right now to expose. But the story is surprisingly similar to the &quot;electoral success&quot; of Bush...  just a different layer of paint on the same capital interests with an added twist at the end.<br>

Where is that written? <br>
<br>
The quote from the article is: <br>
&quot;In Britain the climate created by much of the intelligentsia, including the elite press, is so toxic that the Sun, a tabloid with more readers than any other British newspaper, recently was moved to offer a contrapuntal editorial headlined &quot;The Jewish faith is not an evil religion.&quot; Contrary to what Europeans are encouraged to think.&quot;<br>
<br>
He clearly calls the Sun a tabloid. <br>
<br>
&quot;I glanced over the articles quickly... &quot;<br>
<br>
Obvious, since your false statements about it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tabloid at it's best : uninformed blanket criticism... promoting rather obvious agendas. Oh well... &quot;<br>
<br>
The only obvious agenda I see here is yours. You make a statement like that above, and when asked to defend your comments with facts, you give more opinions, and even go as far as to falsely portray what the article said about the Sun. <br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, what does this mean:<br>
&quot;But the story is surprisingly similar to the &quot;electoral success&quot; of Bush... just a different layer of paint on the same capital interests with an added twist at the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't get it? Neither the relevance or the meaning.<br>

In other words : &quot;Mainstream press in the UK is so anti-semitic that a rag that has more readers than said mainstream press is outraged and publishes a counter point article&quot;. On the second level : &quot;A tabloid that somehow manages to sell more than the Times is coming to the defense of slandered minorities&quot;.<br>
<br>
This statement is :<br>
a) accusing &quot;establishment&quot; press from anti-semitic propaganda (hard facts ?)<br>
b) backing said accusation by a tabloid &quot;countrapuntal editorial&quot; for all facts<br>
c) tries to further the backing of his argument by quoting the readership of said tabloid<br>
<br>
I am not backing my opinion, I am providing you with more arguments to raise your critical opinion about the professionalism of the author of the first editorial (ie. not the Sun's one) and his total lack of grasp on british culture. When you quote a source, you try to at least find a reliable one for your arguments. <br>
<br>
As for facts : i have provided with a couple in the paragraphs of my reply that you have conveniently decided to ignore (namely that the anti-semitism is nothing compared to the problems caused by the integration of a 'big' islamist immigrant minority - and that said anti-semitism acts is also coming for a good part from said islamist minority... not main-stream media or neo-nazis).<br>
<br>
What does happen though in Europe is a critical questioning of US interests and support of Israel's aggressive actions when the US is supposed to promote &quot;reconciliation&quot; negociations. This becomes all the more questionable when looking at the financial interests of the US in the middle east and the fact a peace agreement would actually be detrimental to current economic policies by driving oil prices up... Do you start seeing a logical pattern emerging now ?<br>
<br>
It's lunch break, so i will try to enlighten you a little bit (again, this is opinions... so feel free to debate...) on the ins and outs of the last french election. The story in short : Chirac (on his second 7 years mandate) is backed by the militaro-industrial french lobbies. That's where both his campaign funding and media PR come from. Unfortunately, the pre-election polls and focus groups were giving him as a certain loss on the first round because of the large number of candidates. That's where LePen enters the picture : provide a &quot;common ennemy&quot; for all parties to unite against and pool all the votes behind one, known in advance, convenient candidate. You have now secured France policies in the economical european landscape (yes the unique currency is a particularly strategic point) with a pro-business government. In the same move you have also ensured that your main policy making opposition is now faced by a united front and will effectively be silenced. The extreme right (not that I agree with their lunatic policies by a long shot...) has been played as a scarecrow again and again for the last 20 years at least, and the same PR trick has been used every time (&quot;fascists - we must not repeat the WW2 mistake&quot;). There is no politics anymore - there is only media.<br>
<br>
I'll let you draw your own parallels with the oil-military support that put an unpopular president on his current seat in the US by even less subtle means.<br>

<br>
Yea, when Palestineans come and suicide bomb your kids everyday on school buses, its real aggresive to fight back. There is no justification for this. Ever. I don't call this aggression, I call it defense.<br>

<br>
So, peace in the middle east would drive up oil prices and that is why, what? The US supports Israel defending itself against the terrorists? Do I see logic in any of this? Absolutely not. <br>

I still have no idea what you are alluding to here. FYI, Clinton never won a majority either. Electoral votes are how we do Presidental Elections in this country.  Are you saying the media supported Bush?

<br>
Have you ever set foot in Palestin ? The violence cycle that you are looking at today is the result of about 2500 years of conflicts. But more precisely, the political dynamics are mostly fueled by the outcome of WW2 and the creation out of thin air of the state of Israel. In the eye of the bombers, it's reprisal for the unjust killing of civilians by IsraelI soldiers and illegal population settlements. Violence is now burnt for generations in both the muslim and the israeli population cultures. <br>
<br>
What kind of impact a compulsory 3 years military service has on teenagers ? The territories contested and &quot;invaded&quot; (loose use of the word...) by israeli are populated by an ethny that has no &quot;national army&quot; to defend them (and no real national identity beyond a local culture either). What do you expect ? They reacted to what they (very rightfully) perceived as oppression and infringement on their native soil. And the &quot;intifada&quot; was born. The situation has now festered and degenerated for over 50 years. Does it come as a surprise that you now see &quot;suicide bombers&quot; fight against a nation that in their eyes is the &quot;oppressor&quot; ? <br>
<br>
Take this one step further and what do you think happens when those people look at the planes that are bombing them and see the stars &amp; stripes all over the bomb shells ? Does it shock you now that most of the Middle East sides with them and revolts against the US &quot;freedom promoter&quot; in the world ?<br>
<br>
&gt;I still have no idea what you are alluding to here. <br>
<br>
The Bush family has its roots in the Texas mighty oil industry and the &quot;family&quot; company has huge interests in Saudi Arabia. More precisely, the royal family (the Bin Laden... as they just happen to be not only named but also related to...) and their opening grant of a national oil-field in a nice big $$$ contract. And that's just the tip of the iceberg... but the same conglomerate has just started this very month the digging of a new multi-billion pipeline in... Afghanistan. Hmm... what a coincidence... There are a few more juicy bits but I cant spend all day here.<br>
<br>
8&lt;snip&gt;8<br>
<br>
The legitimacy of Bush accessing presidency is certainly a lot more contestable than Clinton's although both were probably just as crooked as public servants (Enron anyone ?). The bottom line of the cynical story is pretty much the same though : greedy fat cats get fatter and our planet usually gets more polluted by big business. The old communist threat is now burried but what will burry capitalism ?<br>

Actually there IS a nasty undercurrent of anti-semitism in Europe, but it also exists in the US as well.  It just is not as big a force as the editorials in the first post make it out to be.  Its just more likely to surface in Europe.<br>
<br>
The European right-wing makes Pat Buchanan look like  a liberal, and the European left wing makes Hillary Clinton look like Attila the Hun.  The extremes are more visible in Europe than in the US.  Part of that being the nature of a parlimentary system vs. our version of demacracy, which tends to mute the extremes.<br>
<br>
Isreal has everyright to take action to stop the terrorist attacks, but they should also continue political moves to end the tensions. A HUGE good first move would be not only stopping but dismantaling the settlements in the West Bank, they were a bad idea to begin with, and just like there will never be peace as long as terrorist kill Isreali's with impunity, there will never be peace as long as the Settlements exist.  Your NEVER gonna stop terrorism with JUST military force, does not work.  Ask the British about N. Ireland for a lesson on that. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Try looking some stuff up before you state your so called facts.<br>
<br>
In 1992, Bill Clinton recieved 43.3% of the popular vote.<br>
In 1996, Bill Clinton received 49.17% of the popular vote.<br>
<br>
Of course he won the electoral college, lol, otherwise he would not be president. I never said that.<br>

YEA, he won with a majority if majority is now considered less than 50%. <br>

The consipiracy theory on Bush is quite entertaining though. I guess it's possible, as anything is. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

I may have been hearing wrong, but I was fairly certain they were making a big deal about that fact, cause it is so rare of an occurance.<br>

Our system is set up, though, that one only need to win a majority of the electoral college to be president. This is the way it stands now, whether you agree with it or not. I was refuting the fact that Clinton won with a large majority of the popular vote, when in fact, he did not. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

<br>
The electoral college members do not have to cast a vote for their party member, nor do they have to cast a vote at all (which a Washington DC college member actualy did last election). Kind of a fucked up system where the person the people elect to vote for them aren't even required to vote for the person they were elected for. Granted, any college member who didn't vote for the person they were elected for would be committing political suicide.<br>
<br>
Every thinks of Clinton as being this amazingly popular figure who rolled into the white house on a easy vote, but the fact is that Ross Perot took approximately 20 million potential republican votes from the Bush camp. If he hadn't have run the most popular third party race in history most of those 20 million votes would have gone to Bush pushing his popular vote to almost 60 million. Much more then Clinton's 45 Million votes. Most of the electoral votes Clinton recieved were because he barely edged out Bush in many key states. Without Ross Perot splitting the Republican camp back in 1992, people would be asking, &quot;Bill who?&quot; <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

It was a vote against the overall establishment.<br>
<br>
If you REALLY want to split hairs, NO modern president has gotten the majority of Americans to vote for him.  All they mange to do is get the most votes out of the 50% or so who actually vote.<br>
<br>
And the last modern president to win a presidential election without a majority of the popular vote was Kennedy.  It happend a handfull of times in the 1800's (Lincoln was voted in with less than 50% of the vote in a 4 way race, though bhe had a clear Electoral Collage majority) <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

It really baffles my mind that people are not intrested in politics, because, after all, it is these people that basically control our lives. But, an uninformed vote is worse than no vote at all, imho. That said, you can only take into account the people who do vote, and consider it a valid sample of the American people. <br>
<br>
Also, I did say that Bush didn't win a majority of the popular <br>
vote. Dole and Gore were never presidents (although, I don't think that is what you meant). <br>
<br>
Who knows where the Ross Perot vote would have went. I guess you can sepcualte evenly, but you can also speculate that these people would never have even voted. Again, as with the non-vote thing, you can only go by what you have. Specualtion is just that, speculation.<br>
<br>
So, I do not think it is misleading at all to say that the majority of Americans did not want Clinton, or GW for that matter, to be president. They both received less than 50% of the popular vote (and in Bush's case, he even lost the popular vote, which, by this logic, would say that more people wanted Gore than Bush to be president). It is what the numbers say.
