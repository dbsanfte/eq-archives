Actually i'm pretty sure the other died because the Admin got sick of dealing with twats like you, me, dorfs, niggahs wit additudes, and illegible dips like Ladmo.<br>

<br>
This made me smile, From day ONE fo this board you all were told we, the FB mods, would be biased. We would edit posts, and in general fuck with anything we wanted to. You dont want to be &quot;mommied?&quot; Well Kudos for you, go find somewhere else to enact your GOD givin rights to do whatever the fuck you want. When that goes wrong make sure to come back here, and remember to tell us all how you hate it when Ladida and i have been the ones to defend the right to get away with whatever the fuck goes on here. GOD FORBID there might be a few rules for newbs to cope with, and older players that are disenfranchised(sp)<br>

<br>
U want to be treated equally? Go post in the Gen forum, or all the other forums we have here at Trib.org cause we dont give a fuck how much you complain like a bitch, we made it easy, and now you want it easier. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have said it before and i'll say it again, if you dont like it, pick another fucking link to click. Or make your own god damn board to goto. Stop acting like you are so fucking mistreated you will just DIE if you dont get your way here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: Ladmo, notice i dont respond to your bullshit anymore? its because your purposefull misspelling of my name got old about 8 months ago after i made one comment about it. The rest of your shit is about as old as that, and not worth bothering with.<br>

I am posting this because I do feel the need to clarify something more than a little obvious and am interested in defending my friends.<br>
<br>
There are two issues<br>
<br>
Tanje made a mistake <br>
<br>
Loegan is stamping his feet like a child because someone took his ball away and instead of talking to an admin decides that all of a sudden Tanjes one mistake is so horrendous that he needs to create a huge fuss about it and do the primadonna routine, I quit!.<br>
<br>
Loegan if you wanted something done you could have simply said to an admin, &quot;a thread was moved and I don't really think it was appropriate.&quot;. Amazingly, the admins do respond to sensible requests.<br>
<br>
You aren't going to stop posting here and because of your actions that thread is not being moved back.

Anarachy reigns sumpreme, does that not also mean the mods can fuck with what you say, fuck with what you post, move your posts??? Seriously if want total freedom that way, ya gotta realize they can fuck ya three ways to Sunday.<br>
<br>
Also Loegan, stop trying to come off as some sort of Posting Guru God, ( People like me damit, I get alot of views and responses....well so does Loveseeker but that doesnt make her the flameboard queen ). Your posts illicit responses because your topics are often pretty lame which leads to lots of people trying to tell you how dumb you are for ten to 15 pages and you ducking out and changing yourself to avoid a burn.<br>
<br>
You said you quit, now fuck off you liberal cunt, you sound like Bowynn when he spammed the flameboard ( the orignal ) with threats of BAN ME BAN ME, I bet you wont do it BAN ME. Your whinings on things are just fucking lame and how you must fight the fucking opression that is &quot;the Man&quot;.<br>
<br>
HELP I AM BEING OPRESSED!!! <br>

Oh and Jas didnt try to pull a fast one, all ya had to do was look up the posts moron, but apparently like most fucking bleeding heart liberals ya want the shit handed to you and refuse to do any work of your own.<br>

No, I had a talk with a friend who convinced me I was pussing out. You want to beat up on me for making a wrong move, go ahead. This BS of making the rules up as you go along keeps up and you'll get your wish anyway.<br>
<br>
My life does not reveolve around this board, but community does not happen over night. It took a long time to recover from the last board being taken and we still lost some posters that never came back.<br>
<br>
I don't want to start over from scratch trying to build another community. I just want the fuckin mods to get their head out of their ass and carry on like they have for the past year. But of course we get people using the whiner, flip flop and any other number of arguments that make about as much sense as a penny.<br>

It was to make the point that people don't hate the posts, it doesn't bother anyone , so why fuck with them. But I guess you just have to play the asshole about everything these days, don't ya DM?<br>

You seem to beleive that the mods give a fuck how many posts are made to the general section and every other section on the board. Guess what? We don't give a shit, Loegan. Doesn't that throw a monkey wrench into your whole theory? I read the Flameboard, I enjoy it occasionally, and I couldn't care less if it has more posts than the general forum.<br>
<br>
We don't move threads to increase one section or another, we move it so that people who are looking to actually discuss the subject matter of a certain post will be able to find those kind of posts. You're right though, we do need to be more consistant about it. <p><center><b><a href="http://darkmask.windsofstorm.net/images/ladies/fullsize/muse.jpg" target="_blank">Muse Mischiefmaker</a><br>Virtuoso of <a href="http://www.eqcompanions.com" target="_blank">The Companions</a><br><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org" target="_blank">The Tribunal Server</a><br><font size="1"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2399" target="_blank">My Magelo Profile</a></font></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubarrandaam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BarrandAam</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.midsouth.rr.com/yamahaman/lostboy/ff8gifs/Squall.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 391<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/13/02 10:11 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.health-tracker.com/pics/barr_new.jpg height=186 width=124 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goodbye</span><hr size=1> I want a million dollars, phat rl lewtz, and people to find a real topic worth getting pissy about <p><BR><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=77387">Baron Barraind Faylestar of the Highkeeps</a>

I just mostly read the flameboard.  Because I don't give a frog's fat ass what you dorks think about the world issues.  I should not have to sift through crap to get to what I came to read about.  THAT'S WHY THERE ARE SEPARATE FORUMS YOU FUCKING FOOLS!  It's just the same reason why I can't go into the 'Good Times' and start blasting people for fun, etc.  <br>
<br>
Loegan, for one time in your life, think before you speak and realize that thread was in-appropriate here.  Admit that you were wrong like an adult and get back to business.  It's human to make mistakes, and push issues for motives of foolish pride. But for fuck's sake, stop kicking and screaming like a little fucking bitch. <p><br>

It hasn't been done before. This is the first time and I am trying to express the reasons why it shouldn't be done and point out the BS being used to justify it.<br>
<br>
You keep trying to make this about me, but it is NOT ABOUT ME. It is about the issue. I just happened to be the one that made the thread. If it had been your thread I would have been just as steadfast in defense of it.<br>
<br>
It hasn't been done for a year and hasn't been done for the most recent threads and it shouldn't be done now.<br>
