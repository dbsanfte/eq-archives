<br>
Nope..  It wont hurt everyone..  It will hurt the guilds who have already done it several times.. and who's &quot;core&quot; members have already gotten what they need there..  The guilds who lack the DESIRE to go and clear it just for one or two mobs..    It will INCREASE the chances for a first time guild.. or even a 5th or 6th time guild.  and DECREASE the chances for a 20th or 30th time guild to get in there..   <br>
<br>
Again.. thats the beauty of a free market system..  The only thing that has any control over your ability to go there. is your DESIRE ..  <br>
<br>
This was a waste of time.. and the argument was completely lost in a sea of ego and rage back when I had this EXACT same argument a year ago about that rediculous Tier System.. <br>
<br>
The guilds who have been a hundred times before,  and are just equipping ALTS or filling out the odd piece here and there,  are  LESS likely to go..  The guilds who have not been much,  and stand to gain from ANY amount of  named mobs being up are MORE likely to go..  <br>
<br>
Its a pretty simple concept..   The only thing keeping you from going to NTOV.. is  YOUR DESIRE ..   Those who want it the most.. will go .. Those who are doing it as a rote farming trip to get yet another piece of equipment for somebody's alt .. wont go..  <br>
<br>
<br>
If you read what I said.. and you think its just flat out WRONG.. and you think that someone should step in and regulate things,  to ensure that everyone has equal access to NTOV.. Regardless of their desire or aptitude or even ability.  Write a letter to Tom Dashel .. Im certain he will propose some kind of legislature that will regulate who gets to go there ..<br>
<br>
Its a shame the way the good old american values like.  He who WANTS it the most,  will get it..  Have been washed away by a bunch of liberal feel good pussies..  God forbid someone have to put forth some effort and show a little initiative ..   <br>
<br>
Buncha friggin commie utopia freaks.. <br>

I didnt even come at you with an additude, go ahead and make shit up if you think it makes you look better, its all youve been able to do since you came here anyway.<br>

I didnt see that post, someone showed it to me, i said ok. Where in my post was the flag waving and chest thumping? It didnt happen, but you go ahead and see it that way, just proves you are fucking cluless.<br>
<br>
You really are the most bullheaded ignorant motherfucker ive ever seen. You constantly try to rally people behind empty points and facts that done exist. Like i said before it is pretty damn sad. Thats why most people in EV dont bother to respond to your posts. Why tell a child they cant do anything, or might be wrong, when its not your child? You just come off looking like a big meenie. And god knows we dont wanna look like that.....<br>
<br>
I rarely talk shit about other guilds, and usually aim my shit for morons like you. But i have to say even with all the cool people ive met that happen to wear the same tag as you, i really just feel bad for your guild to allow themselves to be lead by someone with your obvious lack of intellegence. <br>
<br>
GO ahead and make another 5 paragraph post making up things ive said and crying wolf. If it makes you feel good.<br>

<br>
but I have never seen anyone so completely miss the point of something before..   <br>
<br>
thats hilarious.. <br>
<br>
Xavre even called me a VEGAN and a Hippy after reading my post..  thats a classic..  that has to be the absolute best example of someone being so overwhelmed by things above their head.. that they came up with the exact OPPOSITE meaning..   I hope you guys dont mind if I capture this thread and use it in one of my management training seminars..  this is by far the best way to illustrate that when you get lost and dont understand something.. DONT respond to it..   <br>

How the fuck did you get the  job here as moderator..  who did you sleep with ?  ..    <br>
<br>
Its not cause you are such a wordsmith..  haha..  and it cant be that you are such a good listener.. Since you are unable to even gleen the GENERAL meaning from what someone says as soon as they start using polysyllabolic words  ..  <br>
<br>
Arleanna..   is fairly intillegent.   Overeducated,  undermedicated,  and  delusional.. IMO..  but fairly intillegent.. so I understand why she is moderator.. <br>
<br>
Ladida..  may not be moderator anymore..  but he is at least witty and able to cipher enough of the meaning out of a post over his head so as not to look like a complete fool..  unlike you..  So I understand why he was one.. <br>
<br>
What exactly do you have to offer..  Did you score some dope for the Board admin ?  Or maybe offer up some Hepatitis treatment info ?  ( you can get that from Tatoo's.. since I obviously have to explain everything in parentheses for you ) ..  or maybe you had a dare that if you got pierced somewhere really painful you would get to be moderator..  <br>
<br>
Other than being an asshole..  I really dont see what you have to offer as a moderator..    <br>
<br>
Here's a tip.. <br>
<br>
Go and edit someone's post.. and wait till Xavre starts a thread about FAGGOTS or RETARDS..   Then you can chime in and be on equal intillectual footing with the people having the discussion..  <br>

It meant one of two things.. <br>
<br>
A.  She understood my post,  but felt that I had no business even being in that discussion.. Due to the fact that Im not in a NTOV rotation guild.<br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
B.  She was as lost as Xavre or Aatlaar.. But knows that responding to something you didn't understand will most likely make you look like a moron.  So she stuck with something she did understand.  The fact that Im not in a NTOV rotation guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Whichever of those two are the case..   Both of them show far more restraint,  and common sense..  Than I would have EVER given her credit for..   <br>

Pretty much everything that drops loot would drop an upgrade for me, but if the choice was between naked olympic time trials on the moon (bind to ssra after a death) or clear flurries for one dragon, then port out and do it all over again when the next popped, you can bet my choice would be working on improving my time in the modified triathlon of twilight.<br>

<br>
Take out NTOV.. and plug in the Planes ..  a year ago..<br>
<br>
<br>
the fact is that Lists in general suck.  they  enable guilds to continue to do things after they have lost the desire to actually continue to do them..   This was the belief that got me villified a year ago.. When Revo proclaimed the tier system a piece of shit..   Funny it turned out to be a piece of shit and things have been much nicer FCFS ..   <br>
<br>
<br>
..........<br>
<br>
<br>
Having someone who handles new recruits.. is not a sign of desperation. But having someone who's job is  sending a tell to every lvl 60 mage and wizard on the server.  Is ..    I guess I could say that it was just Revo mages and wizzies ..  But that would look like bragging.. and might induce Xavre into calling me a buttmunch .. or whatever the latest putdown is on Beavis and Butthead ..  <br>

I'm not a recruiter. EV doesn't have recruiters.  That is another guild.  I cant think of the name right now but it sounds like tampon or something like that.<br>
<br>
I'm a class captain. If your rogues are telling you that I am approaching them, then they are not telling you the truth.  I don't believe I even know any revolution rogues, and if they are anything like you, I doubt I want to, but that is beside the point. :)<br>
<br>
I posted on the tribunal board because I got complaints from some people that I was not very fair in the way I limited my considerations, so I opened my mind a tinsy bit.  It is sadly true that I no longer know every qualified rogue on the server :(  So I have published the requirements on our guild website and have provided the means to contact me if they wish to.<br>
<br>
I must say that after posting on the tribunal rogue board, I received many more applicants but only a few who were actually qualified and even fewer slots available.  =/  Unfortunately I have had to turn away several which makes me sad since I know I have broken their hearts :(<br>
<br>
To be clear, my posting on the Tribunal board for 1 (ONE) open position after the rogue class being CLOSED for 11 (ELEVEN) months was simply a way of getting word out to potential qualified rogues with whom I was unfamiliar who might want to be considered for the open position.<br>
<br>
Your jealousy is mildly irritating, but is still somewhat amusing...<br>
