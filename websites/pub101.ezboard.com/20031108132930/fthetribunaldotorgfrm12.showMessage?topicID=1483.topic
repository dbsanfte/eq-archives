&quot;Suicide isn't so bad, give it a chance. <br>
<br>
Thinking about suicide but you're not sure if it's the right thing to do? Here are some tips to help you decide whether or not killing yourself is a good choice: <br>
<br>
1. Do you live at home but your parents are always making you clean your room and do your homework? It's a sure sign that they don't love you and that they want you to kill yourself. Why else would they make you clean your room? What are they going to do next, ground you? Make you wear braces? Don't kid yourself, the message is clear. <br>
<br>
2. If you just got out of a bad relationship and you feel like things are never going to get better; you're right. Everyone knows that suicide is the only option, stop procrastinating. Look on the bright side, at least your ex will feel guilty for a couple of minutes--but don't count on it. <br>
<br>
3. Depressed? Don't have any friends? I guess nobody told you, but being depressed and feeling lonely isn't normal. Everyone else is happy, and has lots of friends so there must be something wrong with you. Put the prozac away, what you need is rat poison. <br>
<br>
4. Spill a drink at a party? Drop a plate of food in a restaurant? Nobody else has to live with that kind of embarrassment; you know what you have to do. <br>
<br>
5. Flunked out of college? Don't know algebra? Here's a question you should know the answer to: Flunked out of college + Don't know algebra = Time for _____. Chances are you still don't know the answer, so here's a hint: it starts with an 's' and ends in 'uicide'. <br>
<br>
6. Traffic jam? Sometimes bad luck isn't a coincidence. Do you really want to sit in traffic for another half hour? Look on the bright side, if you're a viking you'll be going to Valhalla. Then again, you're probably not, but eternal damnation in hell is probably the next best thing. <br>
<br>
7. Telemarketers keep calling? It's easier to hang yourself than to get rid of a telemarketer, am I wrong? If you're lucky, Home Depot might be having a sale on rope. After all, you don't want to die letting people think you weren't frugal. <br>
<br>
8. Flu? You realize that there's no cure for the flu, right? Well, no cure that doesn't involve painting the wall with your brains. <br>
<br>
9. Flat tire? Do I have to spell it out for you? <br>
<br>
10. College application get rejected? Take the hint. <br>
<br>
Hope you found this guide helpful, mention it in your suicide note. On second thought, why bother? Nobody will read it.   &quot;<br>

I imagine this particular article was my inspiration for encouraging Ish to fucking do it. If Ish had really comitted suicide, I think that might have been bad. For me that is. What I really wanted was to get someone to start talking about how I was a monster for actually wanting someone to kill themselves. I imagine a few had to have thought it.

Finally he comes up to me at one point and says 'There's a train coming snippy, a train!'  So I merely suggested he try to stop it with his hands and climb on board.  We ended up leaving 10 minutes after that.<br>

Wasn't until the next day I found out all future river parties had been ruined cause wouldn't you know that dumbass all flipped out on acid actually tried to stop that train and got hisself run over?  Shh, don't tell anyone.<br>

Holy fuck man. That has got to feel fucking wierd. Knowing you inadvertantly got a guy killed. Through the power of suggestion. And of course his drugs.<br>
<br>
I don't think I would feel to guilty about that myself. Cause you know, he was the dumbass who fucking was high, talking about a train and out of his goddamn mind. But still, telling someone to jump off a bridge and them actually doing it would make me feel a little wierd.<br>
<br>
When I was hoping that Ish would do himself in and leave us all alone, I was wondering what the fuck would actually happen if he did do it. Would his mom be able to file a wrongful death suit against me? I mean obviously he is a minor. And I am not. And I am encouraging the little radio shack boy to fucking kill himself. Then I saw my defense team trying to explain how that sort of thing was commonplace on the flameboard. But then the jury had this look of disgust when the prosecution showed all the trash on the flameboard and all the ugly shit I have said on it in the past couple of years. And then the jury would be all like, GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY! And I would have to pay eleventy bajillion to Ish's mom even though she is secretly happy that her little loser child is dead. And my defense team would be like, sorry buddy, we did our best, and I would fucking yell at them for never calling into question Ish's apparent lameness. And the judge would overhear it and yell at me and I would yell back that Ish was a worthless human being. And the judge would go what? And I would repeat, Worthless your honor! The world is a better place without him. And the judge would say, Mr. Hohum, it is not your place to determine who is worthless and who is not. And then the damn audience panel, which would be totally full, would cheer their asses off. And a Lifetime representative would be there to buy the fucking movie rights.<br>
<br>
I think a lot about hypothetical situations. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.verizon.net/~vze4zjqg/EQ/DLadida.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

Anyone who wants to be a CRoN member should come to Vegas. I will get us a special room to talk about our nonsensical plans. And we will have a secret handshake of course. I think I will also give everyone numbers like the badguy in James Bond movies.<br>

<br>
That being said, I'm not coming to Vegas for one of the following reasons, choose one:<br>
<br>
A)  I'm too cool for EQ players now.  Hmm, scratch that one.<br>
<br>
B)  I don't have money.  Uhh, yeah that one too.<br>
<br>
C)  I take my schoolwork seriously and therefore cannot take such a trip during my 2nd semester of college.  Hahaha.<br>
<br>
D)  I'm too young to drink, but not too young to get arrested.<br>
Perfect.<br>

Wrong.  And I'll actually be in Vegas the same week of Fan Faire, but I highly doubt that I'm going to show up for it.

I can see the headlines now:<br>
&quot;Man Beaten at Video Game Fan Fair, adds to everquest's history of violence&quot;<br>
<br>
the article would jammer on about ishy being rushed to the emergency room in critical condition, and how he didn't make it, due to an &quot;unknown midget&quot; shoving a broken off table lag up his ass, and then it would continue the tear jerking article (that we would all be laughing at here on the flameboard) about the kid who shot himself over this game.  There might even be an interview with ladmovonwallace where he is holding back laughter to tell about how we all will miss ishy.<br>

<br>
NEW YORK - &quot;In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil,&quot; Sasner told bemused doctors in the Severe Burns Unit of New York Hospital. Sasner, and homosexual partner &quot;Kiki&quot;, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong. &quot;I pushed a cardboard tube up the rectum and slipped Ragnar , our gerbil, in,&quot; explained. &quot;As usual, Kiki shouted out &quot;Armageddon&quot;, my cue that Kiki had enough. I tried to retrieve Ragnar but he wouldn't come out again, so I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.&quot; <br>
<br>
At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next. &quot;The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the tube, igniting Sasner's hair and severely burning Sasner's face. It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sasner suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil, while Kiki suffered first and second degree burns to the anus and lower intestinal tract.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">You know who the fuck I am</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1483.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1483.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1483.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12>Flameboard</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
