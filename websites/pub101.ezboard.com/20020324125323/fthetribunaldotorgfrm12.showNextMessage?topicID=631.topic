We need a competition! But what kind of competition will this be? <br><br>Will it be an Academy Awards type presentation where entries will be submitted and voted on by your peers? The losers will sneer while the winners thank thier parents. Everyone else will golf clap and generaly looks disinterested.<br><br>Or maybe it could be like the superbowl! A select few flamers who have recieved notoriety will go to a flaming &quot;playoffs&quot;. Players will accumulate points by bashing thier opponents repeatedly in the head in a vain attempt to make them understand thier point of view. Losers will be eliminated until only one person is conscious! The winner will then praise Jesus for thier ability to call someone's mother a crackwhore on a public forum! I like this one!<br><br>Or maybe a Tribunal Flaming Thunderdome!?! A cerebral two man enter, one man leave flamewar to the death! We could have all kinds of sharp objects hovering around in the arena like &quot;Comps vs EV&quot; or &quot;Fuck Off Bowynn&quot; thread remarks. Every page either Octracula or Kricket will be required to say something assinine just to keep the contestants on thier intelectual toes! And of course, anything goes. Even killing the spectators!<br><br>Or my favorite! Beauty competition style! Obvious candidates will be selected by the majority based on thier creative and emotional (CAN'T LEAVE OUT LOVESEEKER!) proficiency at making sense (or lack of sense CAN'T LEAVE OUT LOVESEEKER!) while calling eachother's mothers crackwhores. These contestants will go through a series of events designed to test their ability to correctly use words like Lugubrious or Matriculate in a flame. Of course the whole show will be judged by our highly intellectual and omni-powerful moderators who will know the outcome beforehand based solely on each contestant's ability to kiss our asses.<br><br>I like it! <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR><a href="http://www.The-Elitists.com">The Elitists and Vagrants</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaatlaarsolthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aatlaar Sol Thule</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Bitch and BTOSP</span><br>  Posts: 591<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/17/02 1:40:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=630.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/daemon5/Aatlaars2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: And the winner is...</span><hr size=1> Actually, we are gonna start with a thing called Flame of the week.
