Again, this is my opinion so take it how you want. Im good at writing long posts btw so feel free to skip some parts that you dont really give a shit about.. Blame Rynnia  .<br>
<br>
EX<br>
----<br>
First lets talk about the pair of yap yap puppies everyone is so fond of here on the flameboard. Sure I can join in on their horrible rep here and talk about how much they suck and how horrible it is to be around them, but come on. People come to the FB for all kinds of reasons and if you don't know Estevan's and Xavre's intentions here, you are pretty stupid. They only make it oh so obvious in so many posts. Lots of you guys take them so serious that it makes me crack up and laugh. Maybe this is because I know them in game and actually socialize with them unlike some others who just spend their time here taking them serious and whining and getting owned by them. Whether what they say to you or about you, it still gets you pissed off to the point you want to post something back. Whats funny is you take it so serious you reply back with a serious post showing how much what they said effected you and thats what they want. They come here to stir shit up and will say or do anything on here to do so. I don't come here often, but I even know when they first made their appearance here on the FB that they talked about how much this FB sucked because it was filled with stupid shit and no real flames. They want to get flamed back and they want a good challenge here. Its basically fun for them to see you get all pissed and shit and it sure gives them attention. Again that is why they come so doesnt mean everyone else comes for the same reasons. I do get along with the two, but at times its hard on me because a lot of you guys take them so serious it leads to complaints I have to deal with, but im used to it by now =p.<br>
<br>
I honestly got a laugh about the dental floss joke from Xavre.. I didn't really notice it until everyone else made such a big deal about it. Oh no, I must be such a horrible and racist person for thinking that Xavre's dental floss joke was funny. Well news flash to you people is im Asian. I'm actually Cambodian, Thai and Chinese. Oh no, they're guildleader is Asian and I must watch out for estevan and xavre now since they are so racist. Maybe they will leave because their guildleader is asian.<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong<br>
------------<br>
Hiya Sorrowsong. How are you doing? (As if i really give a shit anymore. Lol go figure I actually used to care.) Its nice to keep hearing all these new reasons for your departure from trans. I heard the guild was moving in a different direction that you wanted. I also heard about how our GC is unpleasant too often for your conservative style. Oh and another reason was the calousness Kaldun showed you. Oh, let's not forget about your personal differences you had with Loot focused Thinkness. Oh yea, now its because Estevan screwed you over for his epic. I wasn't gonna say anything to you, but shoot im bored. <br>
<br>
I was never against you sorrowsong and I have supported and backed you up LOTS of times when others thought differently about you. I actually care about my guildmates. Due to your crazy assumptions about me only led to you thinking I was an evil incarnate or something who was out to get you. Do you remember a few months back when you had a sick family member and you sent me a serious tell having to do with one of your &quot;Valid points or concern&quot;? Well, I was there for you and spent more than a hour hearing you out. Even though throughout the first 40 minutes or so you made no freaking Valid point. You were just blabbering on and on about random shit. Then you started to bring up something about Casters and telling me I should do something for them to show my appreciation for all their help. You went on about how all the casters would go on all the raids that benefitted the MELEE. Wtf , don't blame that shit on me. Blame it on verant for their lack of caster loots at the given time on the mobs we were capable of doing. <br>
<br>
OH NO, guess what happened next? You brought up your epic. After the first 40ish minutes of talking about random bs, you finally got down to the topic you were really after. When I asked you &quot;So after all this, this is mainly about your epic?&quot; You said yes it was. You then sadfully talked about how POA was the last piece you needed to complete your epic for like 8 months blah blah blah. I heard you out Sorrowsong and I told you that POA wasnt something everyone looked forward to and I couldnt just jump there.. It was something I had to plan. I was feeling sympathy for you sorrow knowing RL was going tough for you. I told you I would try my best to fit a POA raid in for you. Guess what? THAT same weekend POA was scheduled. It was a two day event that time I think and something bad happened when we got to the bee isle and no cleric or necro had their keys for reason so that POA was a failure. I wasnt happy either Sorrow that we couldnt get up there after the work we did do. I wanted to make it up to the mages soon though. I dont want to feel any sympathy here, but those in game who know me , know that I have a fucked up sleeping schedule and often times I dont even sleep. Well fast forward a little and I was planning on doing a POA raid for my mages again. It was getting Late and I planned on doing POA the next day so I stayed up ALL night long just to know I would be able to make it there for the mages and Lead that raid. For some reason I felt like if I wasnt there early the raid wouldnt get started until a long long time. POA isnt really fun and I had no sleep and stayed up there for 13 or so more hours just to be able to make this happen. BTW you also didnt show up to the raid until we were basically done with the raid. So fuck you for not thinking I actually gave a shit about casters or you.<br>
<br>
Want to know something else? Even after you got that piece you still had to get that BW piece. I know of LOTS of guildies who always went to go help you out there to get that piece. You were having bad luck with it and people went back to help you with that. I hear about a lot of shit that happens Sorrowsong. I cared about you and wanted you to get your epic. When I heard about Anhur MQing the staff with Estevan, I got into that situation. You want to know something else? I sent Anhur a tell out of no where asking about the Phinny Mage staff. Whats the big deal about that? Well you see, I had stopped talking to Anhur ever since he left the guild for some reason. I had never talked to him since he left and this was the FIRST time ever talking to him. It was in concern for you. I asked him about what happened and I told him what happened. I was the FIRST person to inform him that you didn't have that phinny mage staff. I talked to him asking what we should do and we found out Pinston had an extra staff and we solved the deal by having him MQ that with you. Bet you didnt know that huh. You're Welcome.<br>
<br>
Well that was the first Valid point or concern tell we had with each other. Again on Friday March 15th, you sent me another tell in regards with one of your &quot;Valid points or concern.&quot; Omg you pissed me off that day. I have a log of that day, but it's not worth posting. You were basically asking when we would be doing Ntov and I basically said we had a few things we needed to do before going there. You then asked How long that would be and we told you when we got XXXX done with. You made a smart remark saying that didn't tell you how long it would be. I then told you I didn't know how long it would take to get XXXX done with. The guild was conversating about things and I made a remark to everyone basically saying &quot;If you want more loot, raid more.&quot; Again that was NOT directed to you sorrowsong. I was just saying it as a statement for everyone. They KNEW that, but for some reason you had to feel I was ATTACKING you.. WTF. This is where you sent me a tell. You said &quot;'Hey bro, you may want to quit jumping on me everytime i make comments in guildchat. You keep assuming im complaining if i say ANYTHING at all about casters and drops, even if it's in the same context that you do with melee's and drops.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol shuddap. I DIDNT attack you. You are assuming that I was directing my &quot;if you want more loot, raid more&quot; to you, which i wasnt you stupid ass. I know what I mean when I type things out and yes you are assuming because I know I didnt direct anything to you over guildchat. You say I jumped you a lot of other times too lol. Gawd you are weird. Shoot, i'm gonna throw out a few more quotes from this conversation we had. Keep in mind all I said in guildchat was &quot;If you want more loot, raid more.&quot; That is all I said and it wasn't directed to anyone in particular, but rather a statement having to do with the current guild conversation. Pay attention to where this conversation gets to..You can see why I was so lost and confused as always when talking to Sorrow.<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;'Hey bro, you may want to quit jumping on me everytime i make comments in guildchat. You keep assuming im complaining if i say ANYTHING at all about casters and drops, even if it's in the same context that you do with melee's and drops&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;Hey bro, you need to stop assuming im jumping on you. If you were smart and read what I said after that you would realize what I said wasn't directed towards you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;okay, althought im obviously not smart, you did jump on me, then quickly added thats to everyone. meanting casters can not say what you said about melees. I will tell you next time you do it. its getting old. makes me feel unwelcomed and disrespected'&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;How did I jump you lol? Thats because you take it that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;Scroll back, If you can't see it, there's no need to discuss it&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;See what? I know what I mean when I say things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;Nothing. Nevermind&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;U are trying to tell me what I mean when I say things. Nothing I said was directed to you or casters. Why don't people just freaking chill... my god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;dude, when you do something over and over, it stops mattering what your intention is. I would recommend considering that i'm not stupid and have a valid point or concern. If you dont, that kind of makes you a jerk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;Lol ur not making sense. What is your valid point and concern here? You think i'm downing casters? and what is it that I do over and over?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;Ok , lemme explain it so you can understand. Answer these next 2 questions for me without going off in a tangent. Did you know that silk drops more frequiently in NTOV than it does in HOT? I know you know, just answer.&quot;'<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;Oh boy&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;there's a part two to this. I'm going to pretend that your defensive Oh boy was a yes. Next question.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;How is it that that information makes you believe that i am unaware of the other drops that occur for casters in tov? And part b, how in the world is it relevent enough for you to constantly bring it up? You understand?<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;I do not know where in hells name you figured that out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;Ok, the my friends in EV are mistaken.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;Go based on what they say then and use it as facts if ya must.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;XXXXX , XXXXX and several others have told me. But what does that have to do with your need to remind me of the spell drops and stuff? It was a comment. your changing the subject.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;I'm not changing the subject.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorrowsong tells me &quot;doesnt matter if its right or wrong. You didnt address that point.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinkness tells her &quot;Address what point?&quot;<br>
<br>
[Fri Mar 15 16:07:52 2002] Sorrowsong tells you, 'Nevermind. Yo udon't know hwo to listen. Nor are you trying. Have to go to work. I'll refrain from commenting on any subject outside jokes since you cannot preceive me in any other way.'<br>

Sorry for the length of this post btw.. Maybe I was wrong, but during that conversation I had no idea where she was going with the things she was talking about.  What did Silk dropping in Ntov have to do with anything?  Sure Silk drops more in wtov than in HoT, but the majority of Skyshrine silk armor has better stats than Kael caster armor which makes hot silk rarer.  Why did Sorrowsong bring this up? What did that have to do with me saying &quot;If you want more loot, raid more.&quot; in guildchat which was not even said towards sorrowsong.  Maybe she took it to offense because she did miss a lot of raids, but /shrug. Honestly here. Someone help me out and tell me why she mentioned silk dropping in ntov.  What was her Valid point and concern?  <br>
<br>
Well sorrowsong.. Again, I never really talked bad about you and tried to hear you out, but obviously I did something that upsetted you.  Im not even sure why you think i'm loot oriented.  Take care..<br>
<br>
The Vagrants<br>
-----------------<br>
For some reason I dont really think The Vagrants split from EV and remade The Vagrants to take a break from the heavy raiding EV did.  Maybe im wrong, but I see Vags raiding daily and progressing really fast. My opinion on the taking a break from heavy raiding thing is , I feel it was a nice excuse to leave on good terms while they plan their vendetta on EV. Lol, but again I may be thinking too deep and too much. Ive also noticed how heavy The Vagrants recruiting has been lately and wow have they done a lot.  Im sure you already know like I do they got a 65+ man roster already.  <br>
<br>
Yea, I can say im jealous a lil since they recruited a lot of potential recruits I was looking into, but I'm not forward when I do recruiting and I dont promise anyone anything really.  I basically talk to them and get to know them and have them get to know me and i'd tell em about the guild a lil.  Was kind of a long processs so it's my fault anyways. Maybe I should take the car salesman Approach when recruiting people I want.  A couple of my friends have told me Vags promised then full ToV armor if they joined ^_^.  I thought that was funny, but anything will work I guess.  <br>
<br>
Vags got a nice strong force now though and my opinion is they are trying to get back up to EV standards as fast as they can, but I may be talking out of my ass =). Don't be surprised if you see them doing high end ev stuff in the future though.  I have lots of friends in Vags though so don't think im dissing ya'll, but I do know there are a few in there that aren't too fond of me.. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, im done for now and wasted a good chunk of my time typing this.. You OWE me big time XAVRE for some extra fuel on your lame Thread..<br>

<br>
Hey dumbass HoT silk quests have better stats than NToV silk quests.  With vulak nerfed there is no longer a huge rush to get into ntov.<br>
<br>
I never wanna hear you whine about loot or someone else being a loot whore or shit.  Loot is all you are about.  You never showed up for velk raids after you got your boots.  Before you would always log on RIGHT before we were about to start, usually after me or another mage had finished CoHing most of the guild.  You always had to log right when a raid where nothing you wanted dropped, and always magically relogged on right after that raid was over.  Whenever something your interested in was about to start ya would magically log on right before it was about to start, avoiding almost all the time spent waiting or clearing junk.  For sky you logged on when the guild was already on bee or sphinx isle, and it also happened to be right when a wizard was porting up for some other reason.  It was so obvious that you sit playing twinks checking guildchat or /who logs to miss anything you didnt want to do.  I figured this out within a few weeks of joining trans without hearing anything about it from other people or knowing how much of a clueless jackass you are.  You can make up as many reasons as you want for why you joined the vags but we all know it's cus they will probably be killing those mobs in ntov that drop the caster shit you are drooling over before us, and that's all you have your eyes on now that you got the epic and boots.  Maybe you even figured out that pissing off your guild leader and class leader and rarely attending raids wasn't a good way to get the loot you want so you decided to find a new guild that you could fuck over before they figure you out; but knowing you I highly doubt you coulda figured that one out by yourself. <p><font size=1 face="verdana">
