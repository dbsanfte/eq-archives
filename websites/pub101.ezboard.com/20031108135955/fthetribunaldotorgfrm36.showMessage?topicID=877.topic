<br>
Not surprising. Both have books to sell and an angry, moronic audience, in both the US and Germany, are perfectly willing to drink up the Osama bin Bush tales that they provide.<br>
<br>
But then there's Michael Meacher who, just a few months ago, was Britain's enviroment minister.<br>
<br>
These words of his appear, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>oddly enough</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, in the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html">Guardian</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>First, it is clear the US authorities did little or nothing to pre-empt the events of 9/11. It is known that at least 11 countries provided advance warning to the US of the 9/11 attacks. Two senior Mossad experts were sent to Washington in August 2001 to alert the CIA and FBI to a cell of 200 terrorists said to be preparing a big operation (Daily Telegraph, September 16 2001). The list they provided included the names of four of the 9/11 hijackers, none of whom was arrested.<br>
<br>
It had been known as early as 1996 that there were plans to hit Washington targets with aeroplanes. Then in 1999 a US national intelligence council report noted that &quot;al-Qaida suicide bombers could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the CIA, or the White House&quot;.<br>
<br>
Fifteen of the 9/11 hijackers obtained their visas in Saudi Arabia. Michael Springman, the former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah, has stated that since 1987 the CIA had been illicitly issuing visas to unqualified applicants from the Middle East and bringing them to the US for training in terrorism for the Afghan war in collaboration with Bin Laden (BBC, November 6 2001). It seems this operation continued after the Afghan war for other purposes. It is also reported that five of the hijackers received training at secure US military installations in the 1990s (Newsweek, September 15 2001).<br>
<br>
Instructive leads prior to 9/11 were not followed up. French Moroccan flight student Zacarias Moussaoui (now thought to be the 20th hijacker) was arrested in August 2001 after an instructor reported he showed a suspicious interest in learning how to steer large airliners. When US agents learned from French intelligence he had radical Islamist ties, they sought a warrant to search his computer, which contained clues to the September 11 mission (Times, November 3 2001). But they were turned down by the FBI. One agent wrote, a month before 9/11, that Moussaoui might be planning to crash into the Twin Towers (Newsweek, May 20 2002).<br>
<br>
All of this makes it all the more astonishing - on the war on terrorism perspective - that there was such slow reaction on September 11 itself. The first hijacking was suspected at not later than 8.20am, and the last hijacked aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania at 10.06am. Not a single fighter plane was scrambled to investigate from the US Andrews airforce base, just 10 miles from Washington DC, until after the third plane had hit the Pentagon at 9.38 am. Why not? There were standard FAA intercept procedures for hijacked aircraft before 9/11. Between September 2000 and June 2001 the US military launched fighter aircraft on 67 occasions to chase suspicious aircraft (AP, August 13 2002). It is a US legal requirement that once an aircraft has moved significantly off its flight plan, fighter planes are sent up to investigate.<br>
<br>
Was this inaction simply the result of key people disregarding, or being ignorant of, the evidence? Or could US air security operations have been deliberately stood down on September 11? If so, why, and on whose authority? The former US federal crimes prosecutor, John Loftus, has said: &quot;The information provided by European intelligence services prior to 9/11 was so extensive that it is no longer possible for either the CIA or FBI to assert a defence of incompetence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nor is the US response after 9/11 any better. No serious attempt has ever been made to catch Bin Laden. In late September and early October 2001, leaders of Pakistan's two Islamist parties negotiated Bin Laden's extradition to Pakistan to stand trial for 9/11. However, a US official said, significantly, that &quot;casting our objectives too narrowly&quot; risked &quot;a premature collapse of the international effort if by some lucky chance Mr Bin Laden was captured&quot;. The US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Myers, went so far as to say that &quot;the goal has never been to get Bin Laden&quot; (AP, April 5 2002). The whistleblowing FBI agent Robert Wright told ABC News (December 19 2002) that FBI headquarters wanted no arrests. And in November 2001 the US airforce complained it had had al-Qaida and Taliban leaders in its sights as many as 10 times over the previous six weeks, but had been unable to attack because they did not receive permission quickly enough (Time Magazine, May 13 2002). None of this assembled evidence, all of which comes from sources already in the public domain, is compatible with the idea of a real, determined war on terrorism.<br>
<br>
The catalogue of evidence does, however, fall into place when set against the PNAC blueprint...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
'High ranking' previously well respected official, in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Britain</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, pushes the idea that the US government wished for, allowed and perhaps masterminded the attacks on Washington and New York. To the best of my knowledge he's not selling any books or directing any movies. The British government is not pushing anti-americanism down everyones' throats, like some others. He has no possible excuse except stupidity, insanity or simple pure hatred of the US.<br>
<br>
Of course, people like those at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=%22world+socialist%22+%22meacher%22&amp;btnG=Search+News">World Socialist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> love this stuff, calling this &quot;evidence&quot; that &quot;strongly suggests&quot; the US welcomed the attacks &quot;highly disturbing&quot;.

<br>
This is the one that I have wondered about for a long time. It's not like all the planes hit simultaneously. I could understand them not shooting the plane down as they weren't sure what was happening, but to not even scramble and take a flyby of them?<br>
<br>
I don't think it is an unreasonable question, though I think these conclusions are... kinda nutty. But who knows, maybe they wanted to let this slip by to wake the American public up, not knowing that the towers would actually collapse instead of just taking damage. I could maybe buy that theory, but to say that the US trained them specifically for this mission is waaaay out there imo. Just letting them slip by sounds crazy too, but then it sounded crazy that a US president would be behind the break ins at the Watergate.<br>
<br>
I am not sure what the lack of air defense response means, but I don't think the question itself is crazy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1611<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/14/03 8:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=877.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Baby George Bush Abdul Kader Faris Abed El-Hussein</span><hr size=1> The one thing that absolutely destroys this little theory in my eyes is that a decision to &quot;let it happen&quot; would involve hundreds, potentially thousands of people.

If someone had, many many people would know about it, and it's simply impossible that not a single person would have at the very least dropped hints about it by now.<br>
<br>
Watergate is a perfect example of why this did not happen. It wasn't kept secret for long- it's impossible.<br>
<br>
I won't say that some in the US government would never dream up this sort of plot... I need only look at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/jointchiefs_010501.html">Northwoods</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  in the 1960s.

<br>
Unfortunately, this is all rubbish. Six minutes after the notification of the first hijacking, at 8.44am, fighters were ordered to be scrambled from Otis Base in Massachusetts. Two minutes later the first plane struck the World Trade Center. Another 16 minutes on, the second plane struck. Twenty-three minutes on and the third plane was notified as having been hijacked en route from Dulles airport. Another two minutes later fighters were scrambled from Langley (not Andrews), but arrived over Washington two minutes after Flight 77 struck the Pentagon. Nor was this lateness unprecedented. A year earlier F16s had failed to intercept a Cessna light aircraft that deviated from course, and buzzed the White House.<br>
<br>
But watch Meacher build. It's a classic of its kind. &quot;Was this inaction,&quot; he asks, &quot;simply the result of key people disregarding, or being ignorant of, the evidence? Or could US air security operations have been deliberately stood down on September 11? If so, why, and on whose authority?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is conspiracy 101. Say something is a fact which isn't. Then ask questions, rising up through incompetence, gradually to mal-intention, and then - abruptly - demand who might be behind it all.

This is pretty scary in itself and pretty much shows what the government is capable of. Doesn't it strike you as terrifying that not one of the JCS refused to sign off on this?<br>
<br>
You might expect one crazy guy to come up with something like this, but Northwoods passed right up the chain.<br>

<br>
The order to stand down may pass through several people/groups, but the decision and the reason for the decision would only come from and remain at the top.<br>
<br>
If the JCS could be convinced that Castro was such a danger that they needed to attack our own people to wake up the US, is it really that hard to conceive that they would see al-Qaeda as even more of a threat? They could very well convince themselves that they were saving the US from having a nuclear device going off in a major city, much as Bush Co supposedly convinced themselves they were saving the US from Saddam setting of a nuke or chemical attack on the US.<br>

<br>
This was the part I had wondered about as there was a pretty big window between the second trade tower hit (the first hit could have been seen as an accident, so I don't include the time between the first and second WTC hit).<br>
<br>
I thought it was closer to 30 minutes, but even 23 minutes is ample time to scramble aircraft over NY and DC, which I imagine would be the first action after realizing this was no accident and that it involved more than one plane.<br>
<br>
The thing is, this went on before the hits. When you have 4 planes that suddenly veer off course at the same time and you can't contact them, I would think the alarm bells would have been sounding pretty loud at that point. Then again, I know little about air traffic control and how common it is to lose touch with planes that are off course.<br>
<br>
In any event, the fact that planes were scrambled seems to shoot this theory down. I figured it had to be inaccurate anyway (the interception part) as I read about this a year ago and no major news outlet had picked it up. Also I remembered an interview with somebody who did say that planes had been scrambled... it might have been Cheney now that I think about it.<br>
<br>

Keep saying that Kreese, it keeps the machine rolling.  Our personal liberties keep getting chipped away to nothing and people keep saying this.  Government pimps right out in the open now and people think it's business as usual and just keep their heads buried.  Lies from the government are business as usual, election process is a national joke.<br>

Northwoods actually did happen, can you get that through your head?  The implications?  Naw, it's ancient history, who cares.  He used to beat me, but he's changed now and I still love him! *cry*<br>

<br>
As to the &quot;delay&quot; you have to remeber our airforce was not deployed or set up to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> set up to actually defend US airspace from attack at a moments notice.<br>
<br>
The fact that they got combat aircraft with real weapons up that quickly is nothing short of a miracle.<br>
<br>
The F-16's over Washington were up dman quick but the Plane that hit the Pentagon took off from Dulles and was essentially allready at its target.<br>
<br>
The ones that hit the WTC took off from Boston (the F-16's launced from nearly the same distance, so the hijackers simply had a good head start)and again the F-16's had to play catch up and simply did not make it.<br>
<br>
The plane in Pennsylvania didn't get hijacked till it was over Ohio so it actually had a long trip back to its target.  If it hadn't crashed, it would have been shot down, the F-16's were dman near there already.<br>
<br>
I still not sure we could intercept such an attack again in time.  We have a huge amount of territory to cover, and ALL major airports are close to significant targets.  We are never going to be able to depend on the Airforce to protect us from this.  Its simply impossible. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

True. I guess I was forgetting that after the Cold War, we no longer had planes on alert 24/7/365. As a matter of fact, I guess even Looking Glass (is that still the name of the President's ACP?) would take a little while to get off the ground these days... unless they have changed it again since 9/11.<br>
<br>

<br>
It seems strange that fighters wouldn't be stationed closer to NYC though, seeing as it is such a strategic target. I know they closed alot of bases in the late 80's, early 90's, but I would have thought they would keep bases open next to major metro areas... at least the ones on the coast and borders.<br>

US bases are garrisons, not defensive edifices.<br>

Even during the Cold War, US air defense was a froward one, we were deployed to intercept the enemy over the Atlantic, Pacific and Artic LONG before any enemy plane got clsoe to US shores.<br>
