I have no problem with homosexuals themselves, any more than I have problems with adulterers, thieves, insert random_sin_001 here.  Because guess what...?  We've all committed a few of 'em.  The only thing I have a problem with is when people, like some homosexuals, decide to run around flaunting themselves and their private activities for no particular reason other than to garner attention or sympathy.  If a guy wants to suck another guy's cock, go right ahead.  Just don't do it in front of me, either in practice or by waving a banner proclaiming the same.  It's simply horribly rude, if nothing else.<br>
<br>
Of course, the underlying reason all the gay activism and gay pride crap goes on is that it's an attempt by some elements to subvert society itself into accepting them and their &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; as perfectly normal.  I'm all about tolerance (see above paragraph), but attempts to alter societal norms to fit your particular perversion are outright ridiculous.

Maybe.  But 100% true.  You have no ability to place a moral judgement on a war with Iraq Merton.  Maybe an economic judgment, a social impact judgment - but while you can feel one way or another about the social impact - and you can reason to a conclusion about what they would be - in the end you have no way to discern which outcome is best because the word best is, by your definition, meaningless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 1747<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/03 5:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=264>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Cal, it's quite simple really.  A creator that doesn't communicate a morality structure, means that morality is left to interpretation.  Since there is no way to know the truth, it's all opinions and hence relative.  Just because *I* believe in a creator, doesn't make it true.  I'm objective enough to realize that my beliefs and opinions could very well be wrong.  Hell, look at history at how many times a cultures belief in morality was shown to be incorrect by current standards.  As walkabout mentions, a morality in flux over the years makes absolute morality impossible.  When we die, we may found out that there was some kind of absolute morality, but without that communication, it doesn't really matter does it??  It cannot be absolute without an arbiter.  Since there is no arbiter, it's all opinions and beliefs... <br>
<br>
Elche is kinda saying the same thing with his &quot;there is no morality because what i believe to be moral, you believe to be immoral&quot;.  Where he is missing the boat is that it's completely impossible to prove that anything is moral or immoral, in any type of morale system... always has been.  Just because we disagree on what is moral, and just because you can't prove something (im)moral, doesn't mean that morality doesn't exist.  It's an opinion and you can't prove opinions and there will always be opinions contrary to your own.  <br>
<br>
Rig, please explain to me why a relavist cannot form a moral conclusion about something??  ALL beliefs are relative, that doesn't mean you can't have beliefs.<br>

This is pure nonsense, moralistic arrogance at best.<br>
<br>
1) If you go to attack Iraq because your paranoid leaders think that Iraq is a threat to you. This is how the cold war started, but it was with equal partners. What the rest of the world wants to know is who is next on that list. There is no rationale behind this that could make this work for the world - attack on suspicion is something that should be a part of the western worlds history, not present.<br>
<br>
2) I am absolutely against ANYONE (including myself) thinking anyone elses values are better than others. That also applies to others, I do not tolerate that the US thinks its values are better than Iraq. Going in to &quot;liberate&quot; Iraq and show them the better way with democracy they're likely to get rid of asap (hint : at least 60% of the Iraqis are shia muslims - where do you think they'll look for political advice if not to Iran ?) is completely and fundamentally wrong.<br>
<br>
3) It isn't for another country to directly take control over the fate of anoter country. It's called invasion, not liberation. If the suffering people of a nation is such a consern, which in Iraq for the most part really really really hate the US just like the rest of the arabic worlds too, I would suggest &quot;liberating&quot; a country more susceptible to your values.<br>
<br>
Further doubts lies around the &quot;stability&quot; Bush claims that will appear in the region. As the washington post pointed out, there is a difference between dreams and reality. Other western media are far less diplomatic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Solve&quot; the Israel/Palestina conflict ? LOL<br>
<br>
I think most of the world would like to see Iraq reasonably disarmed, there is no doubt or question about that. If we're shown evidence he's armed &amp; dangerous the rest of the world would see him disarmed - peacefully, if not then attacked. Why create so much trouble just to avoid trying to avoid peacefully disarmanent ? Well, that's why the rest of the world don't trust your motives, because the US created situation is entirely too stupid.<br>
<br>
The US has through it's astonishing diplomacy and the use of characters like Bush, Fleischer and Rumsfeld managed to piss off the entire world, it isn't limited to france and western europe. The coalition of willing without a UN resolution is nothing but a wet dream. I see talks about sanctioning the US now if it goes ahead alone, as seems entirely likely, although I have no idea how serious effort is behind it. I would rather hope it didn't get down to that point, but I don't really rule out anything right now, the entire situation has become rather surreal.<br>
<br>
Rigadoon, it isn't for me to condemn the morality of the americans, but I'm not accepting that you condemn others. My moralty dictates that, the morality you claim I don't have.<br>
<br>
It's odd, the US is back to the days of the cold war, it feeds on terror, distrust and suspicion. President rating drop ? Let's increase our terror alert to a new &amp; shiny colour. It's surreal, I didn't think it could happen, but it has. At least Reagan and Bush senior had real &quot;enemies&quot;, Bush jr. had to create one to get this stuff working (see : axis of evil). <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

If you want to talk about judging... we judge people morally everyday, by DIFFERENT views of morality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/03 11:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=271>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Morality is not relative.&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In a relative system, there is no such thing as Right and Wrong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

If gay/lesbian priests/bishops become as common as their % in society, will it still be wrong ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We don't have a lesbian or gay bishop yet though, I figure it will take a few more years, till the old church's men in power are dead. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
I can turn that around too... does absolute morality carry any weight?? Obviously not since there are SOOOO many morality issues that are debateable.  Why are they debateable?  Because there is no absolute morality.  <br>

A maze has at least one exit, but maybe there is none.<br>
<br>
It's like trying to understand nothing, i.e. the universe was created from nothing (or god created the universe but who created god). Our intellect cannot grasp it.
