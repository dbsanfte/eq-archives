When one or two select pieces are proven false, mis-represented, or just pure lies, then the whole farbication must fail.  I had neither the time or resources to dig as you did.  Thanks again.<br>

The printed word can be a powerful thing.  A published study may be a flawed and biased gathering of information, or it may be a golden piece of work leading to marvelous things.  A study presented in the AMA Journel may be reasonable, logical, and apprear completely viable, but I'm betting there will be a number of other studies on record having different or completely opposite findings.  There might even be stuides that would provide the information needed to mate Ladmo with a rare form of Arkansas razorback that would produce a hairless swine capable of drinking cheap bourbon, that would smell good, and that would write complete sentences with capatilization and punctuation.  Now there's a Real project for a pot smoking, sroom eating researcher to take on.<br>

One other point D you can maybe explain to me.  Saying your &quot;product&quot; (what ever you want to call it), will prevent cancer.   Is'nt what you are saying absolutely unprovable?   You can feed 10k volunteers your product and 10k others instructed to never trouch your product, and after 5 or 10 or 20 years measure what every you want.  It is will be absolutely impossible to prove our product Prevented anything.  Pure chance or luck may have prevented it; or your own makeup; or green ju ju bees.  You Can state that the volunteers using your product had more or less incidents of something, but you cant prove your product was the actor.  It might even be the covering on your product, or the filler used in making it, or even the 1% animal parts allowed by law.  It might just be that cockroach legs prevent cancer!   <p><BR><center><img src=http://bakamon.freeservers.com/mysig/Bakasig.jpg width=400 height=150><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulargthemiserable.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 12:47:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1113.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Ladmo's golden if cockroach parts cause cancer.<br>

Arleanna, I've never crunched the numbers, but I thought the oscillation about the mean distance from the earth to the moon was more of a superposition of sine waves due to the varying gravitational forces in time as 9 stellar bodies and a shitload of satellite bodies around said 9 stellar bodies orbit a large star.  Though, to first order approximation, you really only see 1 due to the three-body interaction of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun (because to first order, those are the large-scale gravitational forces that affect the moon).  The other stuff is minor because the gravitational force between them goes as mM/(r*r)  (mass of one body times mass of the other divided by the square of the distance between the two center of masses).  Hurray for science, now back to my conjecturing on fluid dynamics in a foam at work. <p>Jaggedspine Infinitelysad, Phalanx<BR>60 Barbarian Shaman, The Tribunal<BR><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97215>My Stuff</a><BR><img src=http://www.umr.edu/~clloyd/Sig.bmp><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 605<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/25/02 1:30:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1113.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> Dygitalis leaves are great for salads :) add some Yew berries for extra flavor.

I did my part, I presented the information...you're quite free to read it (well, 'try to' in your case), ponder it, and dismiss or accept it if you want -- all I know is, I will not be on the short end of that 50th percentile of cancer-ridden victims.

I won't pretend to know what the hell you all are talking about for the most part, but what I did get was that exercise, a healthy diet and some good clean air and water seems to prevent cancer. I don't really care about all that technical stuff but that seems like pretty damn good advice... oh wait, I think I've heard that before... NEXT! <p><br>

<br>
My problem with your logic regarding him being awarded 2 nobel prizes is pretty simple - If you look at the other Nobel winners during World War 2, you'll see something pretty interesting - Otto Hahn of Germany won it for Chemistry in 1944, at the height of the war.  So that pretty much shoots your &quot;He was Germany so he lost the award&quot; thing in the foot, aside from the fact that Warburg was notoriously anti-nazi and in fact FLED Germany and was not allowed to collect his supplies.  So why would they give the award to a German a year earlier (when propoganda portrayed Germans as the MOST evil) for technology that could be potentially used for weapons of mass destruction, and then give then take away an award from one who made &quot;such a great discovery&quot; in the field of Medicine?  It just doesn't make sense.  It doesn't add up.  Warburg never won a Nobel Prize for his theories, in fact, it wasn't until 30 years AFTER the prize was awarded that this theory first came to light.  And it was brought about by people trying to proclaim the use of Hydrogen Peroxide to cure Cancer, which was later found to be funded by a leading manufacturer of Hydrogen Peroxide.<br>

Actually, what's funny is that in 90 percent of situations, the first step we take is administration of 02.  Anyhow, as I started to analyze your sources, I noticed that the majority of your figures and problems were taken from studies before the year 2000 - and before the use of several medical dosage tracking programs that are used constantly and consistantly now.  I can direct you to some of the webpages where they claim that their products have saved millions, but I urge you to find more current studies - every article you list is either written before 1995 by medical professionals, or later, by LEGAL PROFESSIONALS.  I would argue that a Legal professional has a lot more motivation to lie about figures and skew the data than a medical provider.  In fact, the one that I'm mentioning - the Kent State piece that I read, doesn't address the fact that in most of the study, THE PATIENT reacted to the medication in a way that was NOT forseen, or abnormal for studying.  The way you have presented the information makes it seem as if medical professionals have no clue what they are doing, and just give the drugs.  That's simply not the case.<br>

Do you see a theme there you ignorant fuck?  I apologize, I forgot you're a doctor or some pseudo-medical practioner, thereby ignorant of the word 'prevention' by definition.  Let me help:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> pre·ven·tion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->   Pronunciation Key  (pr-vnshn)<br>
n. <br>
The act of preventing or impeding. <br>
A hindrance; an obstacle. <br>
<br>
As for this nobel prize thing, again apparently this is too much of a riddle for you.  Doesn't make sense, doesn't add up?  Probably because you don't know what the hell you're talking about.  Nice try on twisting the story with your 'logic' though.  The Nobel prize people didn't rescind the award moron...the Hitler regime itself wouldn't let Warbugh accept the award.  You're comparing a jew, who during the holocaust <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'was notoriously anti-nazi and in fact FLED germany'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as some kind of argument, against a guy who wasn't jewish and was in allied custody when he won his award?  Man are you reaching.<br>
<br>
As for your denial of facts presented to you, upon your defiant request, I guess you missed that big article at the end there.  You know, the one which was an update for all the previous ones, dated <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and appearing in JAMA.  Didn't get that far huh?  That's alright, I've witnessed your reading comprehension level, or should I say lack thereof, so I can see why it's taking so long.  When you do get down to it and read it, you let me know.  By the way, what kind of argument is 'uh, those were written by legal professionals' ?  So unless you're a certified (pun intended) MD you're not allowed to count now?  What's next, 'I've never heard of the researcher in question, so unless it's someone I know or a guy who works in my building, I consider this obscure, vague and arguable' ?<br>
<br>
I gotta tell ya though, this one takes the cake: '<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> THE PATIENT reacted to the medication in a way that was NOT forseen...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'.  If I may borrow from bakamon's bag of tricks and resort to a tired old cliche, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No shit Sherlock!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Wow are you dense.  You think those 100,000+ deaths a year from prescription meds are from people hocked up on robotussin  driving off cliffs? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The way you have presented the information makes it seem as if medical professionals have no clue what they are doing, and just give the drugs. That's simply not the case</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Oh, I imagine they know exactly what they're doing...cause the pharma rep came to them with free calendars, pens, pads, and pamphlets on the wonders of their new drugs...which said doctor is only too happy to prescribe.  Do no harm huh.  Au contraire, the whole basis of modern medicine is 'what can I accomplish before maximum harm sets in' or 'how much of the disease can I kill before I poison something else beyond capacity'.  Guess on that last point it's lucky there's 1000s of animals tortured everyday with extreme amounts of these future marketable toxins, to test just how far you can stretch the body.<br>
<br>
You and bakamon ought to get together and talk things over.  What a fantastic conversation that would be.<br>

h: That is a direct fabrication. Please provide evidence of this from an unbiased source.<br>
b: Damn I hate zealots. That dog won't hunt<br>
h: I guarantee you you're incorrect<br>
b: you're so full of shit it's pathetic<br>
h: Please direct me to an article <br>
b: I'm starting to imagine you as a slobbering dolt, stomping around the room pounding on things <br>
h: Please enlighten me.<br>
b: You're trying too hard dude, way too hard.<br>

<br>
I don't think all or even most doctors are like that. I do believe there are many doctors who get kickbacks from pharm companies, but I don't think these doctors see the medicine as doing any harm, but rather they see it as an &quot;adequate&quot; treatment that may or may not address the problem most effectively. It's not doing harm, but it's not the best treatment either.<br>
<br>
I think the two biggest factors in the state of MDs here in America is:<br>
<br>
1. Training. They are traditional taught to see things through a very narrow view. Only recently have the effects of spirituality, meditation, and other complementing treatments been taken half way seriously.<br>
<br>
2. MDs in this country are treated like high priests. I am not sure why it is, but we look at and treat our doctors very differently than other countries do. People need to realize that medicine is a profession just like any other, in the respect that it's members are taught a craft and then they practice it. They do not know everything and they do not have magical gifts of prophecy or insights or healing. Hell, they don't even know how or why many of the medications they treat patients with work. They only know the conditions under which to use them and the results they might bring about. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that doctors should be exposed to the varied treatments and belief systems that have shown positive results, while in medical school ( and I mean more than just a paragraph or two that is breezed over). If medical science were more inclusive and open minded, rather than than an elite fraternity, I think we would see a vast improvement in our quality of care. <p><br>

There was an article I read (this was years ago, you want page number and author you look it up holdan) that says because of the wealth of information and studies that happen everyday in medicine, there's no way for doctors to keep up with everything.  So something like 97% of all new drug information that doctor's learn comes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> from the pharmaceutical rep who teaches them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Not exactly an unbiased, objective source there.  And that's why they bring all those calendars, pads, wall charts -- when a doctor goes to prescribe something he looks up at them on the wall and says 'hey, there's a new medicine they just came out with, I'd like you to try it.'  The pharmaceutical annual advertising budget for companies is sick.  <br>
<br>
Being more open minded to other treatments and to the actual inefficacy of the ones they use would be great..but who's gonna teach em?  The grants these companies provide buy the medical texts the students learn from, and their sales reps power the force of continuing education.  There is no rep out there with a $5 million budget touting the strengths of oxygen and keeping your blood pH alkaline...just no money in it.<br>
<br>
And that's what it all comes down to, isn't it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utoreyj01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>toreyj01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/27/02 5:32:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1113.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/da3bf501/bc/My+Photo+Album/is_ani_e0.gif?bcVvmU9AKuak95UR WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who was the guy...</span><hr size=1> It always puzzles me how people espousing being open minded seem more recalcitrant to accept simple axioms.  Like Dvin and his previous posts, but a few major corrections are in order, these are all FACTS by the way, written in stone.<br>
<br>
1. &quot;The heart is the most oxygenated organ and it does not get cancer&quot; - (paraphrase) - Have several patients with Atrial Myxomas who would tend to disagree with you.  The Brain and lungs are more oxygenated BTW and they both have a host of cancers.  But Leukemia does not fit this trend, White blood cells which they stem from do not carry hemoglobin.<br>
<br>
2. Oxygenation PREVENTS (see I got that prevent part, good eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Cancer. - Nope, not at all.  The most promising field in Cancer therapy right now deals with angiogenesis inhibition.  Basically what it means that a tumor needs oxygen to grow so it grows its own blood vessels and leaches off surrounding tissue.  By inhibiting this process (angiogenesis) we starve the tumor.  Very useful hopefully for highly vascular tumors like PROSTATE and Colon.  Prostates are highly vascular, btw, bloodiest procedure you can do, takes 4 units of blood to replace minimum.<br>
<br>
3. Alkalinity is not until 7.42 or above, but over 7.45 you run into all kinds of cramping and such (Metabolic Alkalosis), so you correct it by respiratory depression.  Your body regulates its PH quite nicely, but the best assesment of PH is of course the blood, better if arterial.<br>
<br>
4. Dietary considerations are certainly in order for prevention, nitrates have long been established as a carcinogenic element.  People who eat meat high in Nitrates (preservatives) usually in fish or smoked/preserved meat, show a high risk of stomach cancer (such as asians).  Taking Vit C or E decreases Nitrosamine levels when consumed simultaneously.<br>
<br>
5. Obesity is a risk factor as well, the only source of Estrogen for post-menopausal women endogenously (inside the body) is body fat.  More body fat equals more estrogen equals increased risk of endometrial cancer, etc.<br>
<br>
6. Selenium is a proven factor in colon cancer, the patients who exhibit colon cancer typically have lower levels.  Dietary fiber helps here as well.<br>
<br>
7. Antioxidants (Vit C and E) recently have shown no difference in outcome for a Physicians Health Study in a fifteen year review of patients.  The jury is not out, it came back with bad news.<br>
<br>
8. Folate shows tremendous promise in heart disease prevention though, as does a glass of red wine with an aspirin chaser.<br>
<br>
The field of preventative cardiology is certainly outside of the Flameboard but unproven theories just tire me.  Holden certainly nailed it on the head, nice job. <p><a
