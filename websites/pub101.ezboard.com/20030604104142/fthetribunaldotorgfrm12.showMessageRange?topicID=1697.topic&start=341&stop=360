Q: Was that one of the arguments that was raised early on by you and others that Iraq actually does connect, not to connect the dots too much, but the relationship between Saudi Arabia, our troops being there, and bin Laden's rage about that, which he's built on so many years, also connects the World Trade Center attacks, that there's a logic of motive or something like that? Or does that read too much into --<br>
<br>
Wolfowitz: No, I think it happens to be correct. The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the U.S. government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason, but -- hold on one second --<br>
<br>
(Pause)<br>
<br>
Kellems: Sam there may be some value in clarity on the point that it may take years to get post-Saddam Iraq right. It can be easily misconstrued, especially when it comes to --<br>
<br>
Wolfowitz: -- there have always been three fundamental concerns. One is weapons of mass destruction, the second is support for terrorism, the third is the criminal treatment of the Iraqi people. Actually I guess you could say there's a fourth overriding one which is the connection between the first two. Sorry, hold on again.<br>
<br>
Kellems: By the way, it's probably the longest uninterrupted phone conversation I've witnessed, so --<br>
<br>
Q: This is extraordinary.<br>
<br>
Kellems: You had good timing.<br>
<br>
Q: I'm really grateful.<br>
<br>
Wolfowitz: To wrap it up.<br>
<br>
The third one by itself, as I think I said earlier, is a reason to help the Iraqis but it's not a reason to put American kids' lives at risk, certainly not on the scale we did it. That second issue about links to terrorism is the one about which there's the most disagreement within the bureaucracy, even though I think everyone agrees that we killed 100 or so of an al Qaeda group in northern Iraq in this recent go-around, that we've arrested that al Qaeda guy in Baghdad who was connected to this guy Zarqawi whom Powell spoke about in his UN presentation.<br>

Not really.  You reacted with a whole big long post showing everything I said was not true.  As if I have any interest or desire to know the truth about you, I did it to twang the nerves my little Oinker.  You can go on and on and on about how you run 8km a day and wear a size 2, but unless everyone reading this can see you (and I don't mean through pictures), it could well be that you're a 450 lb man behind the keys.<br>
<br>
Also, I never said you were French, I poked that I remember you BEING French, because you were so gutless.  Still, I have no way of knowing outside an IP trace where you are typing from, nor do I yet again care.  I got a reaction.  Heh..  score one more.  This IS a flameboard, and all you pious and history quoting morons are forgetting that I'm here to entertain myself.<br>
<br>
I DO find it funny that you talk about how you DO poke fun at &quot;Americans&quot; as if you aren't one though.  It's laughable.  You're every much a part of all you're poking at as anyone else is, yet you're trying to act as though you're above it.  Pretty fucking funny Porky.<br>

Now you are trying to sell us the &quot;This is only the flameboard&quot; line BS.  By the level of fanaticism in your tone though, I don't think it is way off base to say you really do believe in the shit you are typing.  Because, as with a Bowynn or some such, you can tell they are doing it just for laughs.  You however, display plenty of the mindless sheep mentality so prevalent in the &quot;hide behind patriotism&quot; crowd.  You are like a Loveseeker who no one really took seriously, but everyone could tell that something upstairs was broken.  This difference is, Loveseeker was entertaining, you aren't.  So try selling that line somewhere else, as no one here believes you.<br>
<br>
Of course you couldn't say anything in RSI, because if you strip away your infantile insults, you are basically left with &quot;Ummmmm, war is good. America Rules!&quot; as ammunition.  So you provide no proof, you can't approach the issue in any logical means, and you cover up your ignorance with the hurling of ineffectual insults. <br>
<br>
So while you are gleefully typing in this thread with your one inch dick between your fingers spraying the screen with your spoo, you can be happy to know that your idiocy is plain for all to see.<br>
<br>
What was that?  You dont' care?  I can't wait for your nice long post to that which you don't care about in your pathetic attempt at self denial. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

This IS only the Flameboard Ditch Pig.  It's not BS, it's the simple truth, and you apparently think its more.  When you say &quot;you don't think it's way off base&quot;, you're right.  You DON'T think.  You're the mindless sheep you rancid little pig, and you don't know anything about anyone here, especially me.

<br>
The places I get my information from are:<br>
<br>
The Globe and Mail, The National Post, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Washington Post. (Newspapers)<br>
<br>
www.globalsecurity.org<br>
<br>
And from daily conversations I have with three teachers, one an expert in WMD, the other in State Security, the third in International relations.<br>
<br>
I do not count Major terrorist incidents as those &quot;Only&quot; directed at the United States. In the last 5 months there have been numerous suicide bombings, shootings and car bombings in Palestine, and State level terrorist responses from Isreal.<br>
<br>
In Northern Ireland there have been strong signs that the &quot;Real IRA&quot; has been actively rebuilding through armed roberies, and bank thefts.<br>
<br>
In Indonesia there has been a number of bombings and shootings by various terrorist factions.<br>
<br>
Then there has been the two you name. These are only a faction of the incidents that are occuring around the world that can be labled terrorist incidents.<br>
<br>
I would love you to post where you got your figures on terrorist incidents for 2002. I find it very hard to locate information that has a direct running total of all incidents for any year. It would be great to have more areas to access information. (I mean that, not calling you on your sources, I really could use more info.)<br>
<br>
Dante, flaiming me on grammer is really weak. So I made two spelling mistakes on my post, I don't think it affected your ability to understand the post, but then again maybe it did.<br>
<br>
As for showing proof of Iraq finally giving weapons inspectors access to sites, I should not have to, it was in all the newspapers. This was why the UN was asking for more time, infact the weapons inspectors were openly asking for more time. Go back and read some news pre-dating the invasion by 1-2 months.<br>
<br>
&quot;Best show proof of that before you make a statement like that, or else you're just like all the other turds. You won't because it's not there unless you consult some of Loegan's l33t sources, but I'm curious to see it maggot. I'm also no fan of grammar flames, but for fuck's sake get out the goddamned dictionary dimwit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Better follow your own advice though, as there is some realy bad grammer in there.<br>
<br>

Before you flame someones grammer you should make sure yours is spotless. <br>

The people of Iraq have said they want to have a government formed around Islamic law, and have voiced their desire to have the Clerics step in and form the government. I am very interested to see how that plays out. The US and Britain will probably not allow this to happen, as Islamic governments are not friendly to the West. Kind of negates the whole idea of free elections though if they do not allow the Iraqi people to elect whomever they want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3365<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/03 3:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=349>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> This administration has already made it crystal clear that they'll not allow a Theocracy in Iraq, so it looks like the Iraqis will have to oust the US before they are free to have a government of their choosing.<br>

They are free... free to be a US friendly state and free to have a government of our choosing. And of course they are free to bitch about if they don't like it... as long as they don't actually do something about it.<br>

Gimmie a fucking break Merton<br>
<br>
I never resort to namecalling as the basis of a flame, that's just ignorant, however, this being the Flameboard it will happen, and I have seen you do it more than once.  So cry me a fucking river.<br>
<br>
And you are saying you can backup your accusation that the US put Saddam Hussien into power?  That's no more accurate than saying the US single handedly saved Europe in WW2...it's actually quite parallel to your description of the collapse of the Soviet Union as something that happened from within and had nothing to do with the US, but you pick your battles there tough guy.  You still insist that the US gave some fictitious 'green light' for Saddam to annex Kuwait...back that one up.<br>
<br>
You dared someone to find something innacurate on an earlier page, I found about 4 innacuracies that you never answered to other than 'walking away'.<br>
<br>
Keep picking on the little guy Merton, and although I have to agree that Moradis does a little too much of it on a POLITICAL thread, don't cry to me about name calling on the Flameboard. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kandilia>Kandilia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/03 5:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=351>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> you're a poophead Merton <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flasshgordon>FlasshGordon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F is for Friendship.</span><br>  Posts: 1399<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/03 5:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=352>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> FUCKING DIE ISHMAIL 2, DIE AND GO TO HELL RIGHT NOW. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dantemoradis>Dante Moradis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/31/03 6:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1697.topic&index=353>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>eep picking on the little guy Merton, and although I have to agree that Moradis does a little too much of it on a POLITICAL thread, don't cry to me about name calling on the Flameboard.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's the whole point though Arec.  It IS the Flameboard, and this isn't a political thread, it's a flameboard thread.  If I wanted to be political there have been threads like this for months and months on RSI.  Yeah, I'm more right than left, but I'm no where NEAR as right as these assclowns believe.<br>
<br>
I also agree that every time these guys are called to task on proving a point, they just point a finger elsewhere to try and diver their own lack of facts from the limelight.  It's actually pretty funny to watch, and when I DO hanker for some politics I like to go over and scan the RSI forum.  What these fools don't get is that when they post something HERE, they do so without &quot;protection&quot; from insult.<br>
