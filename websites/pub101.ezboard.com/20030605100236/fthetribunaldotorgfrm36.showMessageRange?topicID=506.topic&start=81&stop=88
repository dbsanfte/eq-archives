We give the Ambassador the right to speak for the US. If she gave the ok, right or wrong, it doesn't change the fact of what Saddam was led to believe. He smiled after getting the news - it's obvious what he asked and the answer he got, while not explicit, was certainly enough to give anyone the impression the US would not get involved.<br>
<br>
The Ambassador confirms what she was thinking when she gave the OK. Did Bush give her the authority to? I have no idea and there will never be transcripts of that posted even if he did. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that she was the fall guy for a deal gone bad though.<br>
<br>
It still doesn't change the fact that he was fucked over on this. A deal is a deal even if it's made with a person like Saddam.<br>

I am not foolish enough to claim he should have been allowed to stay in Kuwait, but his invasion over this dispute is far from making him the Hitler level type person he is made out to be. <p><br>

Saddam:<br>

<br>
U.S. Ambassador Glaspie -<br>
<br>
We have no opinion on your Arab - Arab conflicts, such as your dispute with Kuwait.

<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know how much clearer this conversation can be. I honestly don't know how much clearer Glaspie could have made it when she responded she didn't think they would take all of Kuwait. <br>
<br>
Your version is weak without her response to the reporter, but after that response I just don't see how there can be any doubt what she was thinking when she gave her answer to Saddam.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am crazy, because I just don't see how you reconcile the transcript and the response Glaspie gave to the reporter with your version.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I am just dumb, but I seriously don't get it.<br>

No wonder you are confused. The part of the transcript reads:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>TARIQ AZIZ: Our policy in OPEC opposes sudden jumps in oil prices. <br>
<br>
HUSSEIN: Twenty-five dollars a barrel is not a high price.<br>
<br>
GLASPIE: We have many Americans who would like to see the price go above $25 because they come from oil-producing states.<br>
<br>
HUSSEIN: The price at one stage had dropped to $12 a barrel and a reduction in the modest Iraqi budget of $6 billion to $7 billion is a disaster.<br>
<br>
GLASPIE: I think I understand this. I have lived here for years. I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country. I know you need funds. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60's. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak. All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly. With regard to all of this, can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us? </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
My assessment after 25 years' service in this area is that your objective must have strong backing from your Arab brothers. I now speak of oil But you, Mr. President, have fought through a horrific and painful war. Frankly, we can see only that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned. And for this reason, I received an instruction to ask you, in the spirit of friendship -- not in the spirit of confrontation -- regarding your intentions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I simply describe the position of my Government. And I do not mean that the situation is a simple situation. But our concern is a simple one.<br>
<br>
HUSSEIN: We do not ask people not to be concerned when peace is at issue. This is a noble human feeling which we all feel. It is natural for you as a superpower to be concerned. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>But what we ask is not to express your concern in a way that would make an aggressor believe that he is getting support for his aggression.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We want to find a just solution which will give us our rights but not deprive others of their rights.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> But at the same time, we want the others to know that our patience is running out regarding their action, which is harming even the milk our children drink, and the pensions of the widow who lost her husband during the war, and the pensions of the orphans who lost their parents.<br>
