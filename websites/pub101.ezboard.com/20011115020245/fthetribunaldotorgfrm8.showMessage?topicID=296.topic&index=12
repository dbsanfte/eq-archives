Think I just couldn't care at all about what would happen to the stupid main character.<br>
<br>
<br>
And my advice to Cogito: go watch french movies, some are so much better than Hollywood stock movies, but never get translated unfortunately (until they scrap 90% of what makes it good and remake it Hollywood style that is).<br>
<br>
All time favourite movie: The City of Lost Children, everyone go see it NOW (and everything else from Jeunet too) :)<br>
<br>
Oh and I never liked StarWars btw. Laser sabers are for losers. Real men use Kung-Fu (yeah I do love those incredibly cheap hong kong movies though) :)<br>

That is true, about explanations. <br>
<br>
Mildaene, yeah I've seen City of Lost Children, it is a fantastic movie. I cannot remember how I ended up watching it, but there was a movie that was &quot;connected&quot; with it somehow -- my initial reaction just now, was to think of Brazil, but I'm not sure if anyone involved with that movie had anything to do with the City of Lost Children, though. Gilliam was not involved with it I don't think. <br>
<br>
Possibly, it was Delikatessen. Ever seen that one? That is a very good movie also, raaaaaather uhm, bizarre, and yes, French too. <br>
<br>
I agree about French movies -- in fact, that goes for any movies not made in Hollywood, even it goes for things made in the US but not under Hollywood's influence. I don't have the Short DVD here right now (lent em all to a friend), so don't remember what name it had, but there was a movie, a French one, that inspired 12 Monkeys... A real masterpiece, except it was made entirely of non-motion images. It was basically a slideshow of images, of a post apocalyptic world, its main point being a man who travelled back in time and ended up in an airport somewhere, where he was as a child, and he ends up watching himself getting killed, the child not knowing who it was, but the adult knowing the child of course. Very peculiar. This bit is in 12 Monkeys also, but not everyone &quot;got it'. Gilliam is a great director. <br>
<br>
La Femme Nikita, I like that one a lot. I've watched Point of No Return (I think) with Bridgitte Fonda, and it's good for a Hollywood movie, but can't hold a candle to Nikitia. <br>
<br>
Then there's The Birdcage, that was a French movie. But the Hollywood one was actually good,  I thought. Comparing the two, I gained a lot of respect for the acting skills of those two guys in the Hollywood version, Robin Williams -- and I forget the name of the other guy. <br>
<br>
Then you've got El Mariachi, and Desperado, except with this one, the Hollywood version is also very good. <br>
<br>
Can't remember any more right now, but yes that's true, perhaps obvious, there's a lot of great movies made outside Hollywood. <br>
<br>
I think Hollywood is just a corporation, just a machine that makes money. So they follow formulas. They look at movies that made money, and cost little, and they try to create movies from those criteria. My pet peeve are the happy endings. You put a sad ending in there, people just don't like it, they want 'Lived happily ever after'. You put ambiguity, they don't like it, they want to be told what to think. They got screenings, with audience members who vote on what they liked, and no sad ending ever makes it through a vote like that. <br>
<br>
Great movie made outside Hollywood: Fargo. Remember the bit about the asian dude who calls up Margie, and has dinner with her, tries to get busy with her? It had nothing to do with the main plot, and was just an irrelevant slice-of-life episode -- it wasn't even enough to be described as a side-plot. People really disliked that bit from what I heard. They didn't understand it, and didn't see how it related to the main plot. That would never have made it through a vote like that. Well I don't know that of course -- this is just my opinionated opinion, hehe. But what's bad about Hollywood I think, is that it is a corporation, a money making machine, that does not like to take chances. <br>

<br>
Actually, Delicatessen was from the same team (Jeunet/Caro)who did the City of Lost Children, that's why it's got the same weirdness factor (and the same actors too). Compared to Brazil, Delicatessen/CoLC are a bit more poetic though imho (the world of Brazil is much colder).<br>
<br>

Sadly, most people are mindless sheeps and seem to love it.<br>
(I hate happy endings too... they feel so artificial, it's like they have to twist the main plot just so the girl and the guy live through the movie so they can be together again, and it shows). Why they never ask *ME* to vote is beyond me :)<br>

If you're into following the plot line and tend to skip over tangents that don't directly involve the fate of the main charachter, then most of this book will be lost on you.<br>
<br>
For those who haven't read it, the main gist is that rewriting history using ideas and 'what if 's and things you find interesting that you can intelligently support using other references can actually change history.  That your new hypothesis can actually become more real than what happened by sheer dilligence.<br>
<br>
Like a trial lawyer.  Using his own reason this guy killed that guy to defend someone.  Through his clever and endless selective references he can convince the killer that yes indeed this is the reason you did this.  Not just convince him, but actually make the reason a matter of record, in his mind, the courts mind and the killer's mind.  So much so that it's becomes actual history, making what 'really' happened trivial.<br>
<br>
When confronted by an eye witness, the lawyer can laugh at him.  What is reality now ?  I have recreated it, my version is now real.<br>
<br>
It's not about lies that turn into truths really, it's about alternate realities that become truths, who's only justification is that they are currently in the spotlight.<br>
<br>
This book explains it alot better. <p><hr>

<br>
A friend of mine saw a preview/teaser/trailer (why do they call it a trailer? that makes no sense to me) of Delikatessen, that sounds like the world's best trailer. <br>
<br>
Delikatessen takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, in a butcher's shop. The butcher is in charge, and everything he does, or say, everything is sort of part of him. I'm not sure how to explain this, but everyone who lives in the house, is tied to this guy, bonded. It's like an organism, he is the beating heart, the rythm, and everything there reflects him in some way. They march to the beat of his drum, sorta. <br>
<br>
The trailer is very simple, it's nothing except one single scene from the movie. The scene shows the butcher in bed having sex with his young mistress, banging away... And then it switches to a woman (his wife, possibly) beating the dust off a rug -- with the same rythm. Then, the butcher. Then someone chopping wood (or some other thing, I can't remember). Then, the butcher's daughter playing the cello. Then the wife beating the rug, the butcher, wood chopping, cello, butcher, rug, etc., etc., etc., faster and faster... I can't remember if anything happened with the other activities, but at the climax, the girl playing the cello, she broke a string, like SPLOOOOINK, possibly the bow also breaks -- the hairs on the bow I mean. <br>
<br>
Well, this scene kinda makes sense in the movie, it's part of their daily activities, but as a trailer, it was pretty bizarre. And that's all it was -- just that scene, and then, the title, &quot;DELIKATESSEN&quot;. <br>
<br>
I like that! I like that a LOT. I wish I'd seen that trailer. It musta been great -- sex, woodchopping, sex, cello, dusting, cello, sex, cello, dusting, sex, woodchopping, sex, cello bang,  -- DELIKATESSEN. &lt;end&gt; -&quot;What the HELL was THAT?! I gotta see that!!&quot; <br>
