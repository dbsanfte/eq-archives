Of course it's not the covering of the event that makes it callous and of course I expect them to fix it as quick as possible. It's the lack of coverage of Iraqi suffering and it's the lack of progress in helping them that is callous.<br>
<br>
Just move out, huh? Reminds me of Ari Fleisher's warning - &quot;People need to watch what they say..&quot;<br>

If you are expecting me to be apologetic for having empathy for Iraqis and pointing out how we fuck up other people's lives and think little of it, but raise hell when we get just a little taste of the same thing... keep waiting cause it's not gonna happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

Iraq has a population of ~20 million people.  Not all of them are without power.<br>

The power loss last night affected 50 million people.<br>

The reason why Iraq is having such power problems is because of Iraqis.  People are cutting power lines.  If they want to help get their power back online, turn the criminals in.<br>

Not only are the situations completely unrelated, but any attempts at comparison are necessarily useless and pointless.  There is no relationship or connection between them other than the fact that they're both related to a loss of electricity.<br>
<br>
Much less guilt trips about the poor Iraqis from you, of all people!  You would have been happy to let the Iraqi people rot under Saddam's rule - and I feel very confident in saying that Baathist rule was a very great deal more harsh than the consequences and aftereffects of our war removing him.  Go ahead and mouth your doom-and-gloom predictions regarding our nation building, I know you want to, but dire warnings of future failure mean very little when comparing a regime based on terror, torture, and murder to a benevolent administration that is having trouble keeping electricity running due to saboteurs.<br>

Nothing on this scale or even close to it. Iraq was a modern country, with fiber optic networks and power grids that were probably better than ours here in the Northeast. Baghdad was right behind Saudi Arabia infrastructure wise.<br>

<br>
That is a copout. We knew (or should have) going in that we would cause massive unrest. The decent people are suffering because we didn't secure what we took over. We went into Iraq like a bull in a china closet.<br>
<br>
I don't know if you have been reading the papers, but I would say not since you seem to be unaware that anyone who turns in their fellow Iraqis or are seen helping Americans gets executed and we can't protect them.<br>

Oh, that's a valid comparison. Let's see how many riots there would be if the outage was caused by an occupying force.<br>

<br>
I have plenty of empathy for my own country, but I have a wide enough view so that's not the only thing I see. I am also perceptive enough to know that our problems are caused by being greedy and codling big business who won't spend money where it is needed while Iraq's problems were caused by an invading/occupying force. Big fuckin difference. We are reaping what we have sowed, Iraq is at the mercy of an occupying force.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Your comments are offensive. This power outage has nothing to do with Iraq, take your whiney self elsewhere and go create some more bashing threads. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It has everything to do with showing how we are. NY looses power, 24/7 coverage. Iraq has been without power for 5 months, it gets a fleeting mention and then on to the financial news.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Much less guilt trips about the poor Iraqis from you, of all people!

<br>
Well bully for you, but there are alot of Iraqis who disagree and they are the ones living there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wonder why I even bother. You people are so gung ho for this mess in Iraq and so sure in yourselves that they are so much better off. I swear that you guys are so far up Bush's ass and so full on rabid patriotism, that no matter how bad it gets or how many people die, you'll still keep singing the praises of this war.<br>
<br>
We loose our power for a couple days and everyone is patting themselves on the back for not rioting and actually helping each other a little. Look how great New Yorkers are! They didn't riot in the 12 hours they lost power! We sure have high standards for ourselves if simply being civilized is now grounds for a medal.<br>
<br>
We go invade a country and decimate their infrastructure and then we slam them for not turning in saboteurs when past informants have been executed on the streets and in their homes. They are just bringing it on themselves.<br>

I don't know, if I saw someone climbing up on the power pole in my backyard.... I'd shoot'm.  Especially if my favorite show was on TV.

POWER OUTAGE TRACED TO DIM BULB IN WHITE HOUSE --- The Tale of The Brits Who Swiped 800 Jobs From New York, Carted Off $90 Million, Then Tonight, Turned Off Our Lights<br>
ZNet<br>

<br>
I can tell you all about the ne're-do-wells that put out our lights tonight. I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power Company -- some years back. You see, before I was a journalist, I worked for a living, as an investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s, &quot;NiMo&quot; built a nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally costly piece of hot junk for which NiMo and its partner companies charged billions to New York State's electricity ratepayers.<br>
<br>
To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium fabricated cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job on the account books. In 1988, I showed a jury a memo from an executive from one partner, Long Island Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho on how to lie to government regulators. The jury ordered LILCO to pay $4.3 billion and, ultimately, put them out of business.<br>
<br>
And that's why, if you're in the Northeast, you're reading this by candlelight tonight. Here's what happened. After LILCO was hammered by the law, after government regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens of other book-cooking, document-doctoring utility companies all over America with fines and penalties totaling in the tens of billions of dollars, the industry leaders got together to swear never to break the regulations again. Their plan was not to follow the rules, but to ELIMINATE the rules. They called it &quot;deregulation.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make safecracking legal.<br>
<br>
But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one devious little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas, operating under the alias &quot;Enron,&quot; talked an over-the-edge free-market fanatic, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the first completely deregulated power plant in the hemisphere.<br>
<br>
And so began an economic disease called &quot;regulatory reform&quot; that spread faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher's Energy Minister, one Lord Wakeham, with a bushel of dollar bills for 'consulting' services and a seat on Enron's board of directors. The English experiment proved the viability of Enron's new industrial formula: that the enthusiasm of politicians for deregulation was in direct proportion to the payola provided by power companies.<br>
<br>
The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans wouldn't swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten used to cheap power available at the flick of switch. This was the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to be the last of the power pirates, Samuel Insull. Wall Street wheeler-dealer Insull created the Power Trust, and six decades before Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped off consumers. To frustrate Insull and his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal Power Commission and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act which told electricity companies where to stand and salute. Detailed regulations limited charges to real expenditures plus a government-set profit. The laws banned power &quot;trading&quot; and required companies to keep the lights on under threat of arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates.<br>
<br>
Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed in repair and the lights stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire and, like me, crawled through the account books, to make sure the power execs spent customers' money on parts and labor. If they didn't, we'd whack'm over the head with our thick rule books. Did we get in the way of these businessmen's entrepreneurial spirit? Damn right we did.<br>
<br>
Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility companies -- no 'soft' money, no 'hard' money, no money PERIOD.<br>
<br>
But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure from the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one long deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of electricity. It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the gratitude of power companies which ponied up $16 million for the Republican campaign of 2000, seven times the sum they gave Democrats.<br>
<br>
But Poppy Bush's gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the feds only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer. For the big payday they needed deregulation at the state level. There were only two states, California and Texas, big enough and Republican enough to put the electricity market con into operation.<br>
<br>
California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a 1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nadar which would have blocked the de-reg scam. Another $37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating the campaign coffers of the state's politicians to write a lie into law: in the deregulation act's preamble, the Legislature promised that deregulation would reduce electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when in the first California city to go &quot;lawless,&quot; San Diego, the 20% savings became a 300% jump in surcharges.<br>
<br>
Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one contributor to the George W. Bush campaigns, it was confident about the future. With just a half dozen other companies it controlled at times 100% of the available power capacity needed to keep the Golden State lit. Their motto, &quot;your money or your lights.&quot;<br>
<br>
Enron and its comrades played the system like a broken ATM machine, yanking out the bills. For example, in the shamelessly fixed &quot;auctions&quot; for electricity held by the state, Enron bid, in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts of electricity over a 15 megawatt line. That's like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble -- the lines would burn up if they attempted it. Faced with blackout because of Enron's destructive bid, the state was willing to pay anything to keep the lights on.<br>
<br>
And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the California state Independent System Operator which directs power deliveries, between May and November 2000, three power giants physically or &quot;economically&quot; withheld power from the state and concocted enough false bids to cost the California customers over $6.2 billion in excess charges.<br>
<br>
It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find his lost Democratic soul and impose price caps in California and ban Enron from the market.<br>
<br>
But the light-bulb buccaneers didn't have to wait long to put their hooks back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving into the White House, while he was still sweeping out the inaugural champagne bottles, George Bush the Second reversed Clinton's executive order and put the power pirates back in business in California. Enron, Reliant (aka Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas Utilities) and the others who had economically snipped California's wires knew they could count on Dubya, who as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the richest deregulation deal in America.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners ripped the lid off electric bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara Mohawk of the expensive obligation to properly fund the maintenance of the grid system.<br>
<br>
And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven: They allowed a foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National Grid of England, to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most of their wages - producing a bonus for NiMo stockholders approaching $90 million.<br>
<br>
Is tonight's black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field who've watched Bush's buddies flick the switches across the globe. In Brazil, Houston Industries seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro's electric company. The Texans (aided by their French partners) fired workers, raised prices, cut maintenance expenditures and, CLICK! the juice went out so often the locals now call it, &quot;Rio Dark.&quot;<br>
<br>
So too the free-market British buckaroos controlling Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark Ages.<br>
<br>
Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster: re-call the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to the electricity price fixers. And unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov. Gray Davis stood alone against the bad guys without using a body double. Davis called Reliant Corp of Houston a pack of &quot;pirates&quot; --and now he'll walk the plank for daring to stand up to the Texas marauders.<br>
<br>
So where's the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing the foe that they used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for yet more electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there's no sense defeating Iraq if a hostile regime remains in California.<br>
<br>
Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don't know if the truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the dim bulb in the White House. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1558<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/15/03 12:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You're nearly back into &quot;we gave Saddam the greenlight, see! the transcript says he smiled!&quot; territory.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Here's a, ahem, slightly different perspective, at least on the California issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Davis in the Dock<br>
Ross cancels his visit.<br>
<br>
By Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute<br>
 <br>
  <br>
kyrocketing wholesale electricity prices and the daily threat of brownouts and blackouts in California has cast a pall over the regulatory enterprise. California Governor Gray Davis, like most of the pundits and the press, blamed deregulation for the crisis this week in his &quot;State of the State&quot; address and warned that the California meltdown is a harbinger of things to come; not only in national electricity markets but in industries throughout the economy if we continue our mad rush toward laissez faire. But the California power crisis is not an example of what happens when businessmen, not bureaucrats, are running important industries. It's a sobering story of what happens when politicians attempt to manage competition and impose their vision of what a market should look like. <br>
<br>
If &quot;deregulation&quot; means less — not more — political control over an industry, then by no stretch of the imagination has the California electricity industry been &quot;deregulated.&quot; First, the state forced the electricity companies to sell-off all their power plants to independent investors and become nothing but power distributors. Second, the state assumed total day-to-day control of the utilities' grid of wood and wire to make sure they couldn't abuse their market power. Third, the state required new owners of the divested power plants to sell their juice to a state managed &quot;power pool,&quot; the sales price of which to be established by a daily spot market managed by — you guessed it — the state. Electricity companies that wished to compete for your business had to buy their electricity from this pool, and the price charged them was to equal the highest price received by any electricity generator in the daily state-managed spot market. Fourth, regardless of what they paid for the power in the wholesale market, no company can charge a consumer more than 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour until it has paid off its allotted share of the bailout the state gave the old incumbent electricity companies to embrace this new regulatory scheme. <br>
<br>
Now, what kind of &quot;deregulation&quot; imposes rigid government dictates on how industries should organize themselves? What sort of deregulation keeps fixed prices on retail providers? What kind of &quot;deregulation&quot; requires retailers to buy power through a state-run central exchange? And what brand of &quot;deregulation&quot; forbids retailers from buying electricity more than one day ahead? <br>
<br>
Real deregulation would have meant turning the old power companies loose to build what they want, charge what they want, and run the grid as they wished while simultaneously decriminalizing competition and removing barriers to market entry. State regulators, however, went in the exact opposite direction. If this is the portrait of a free market, then it’s a portrait painted by Salvador Dali, not Adam Smith. <br>
<br>
But is this new regulatory regime — no matter how we label it — the cause of five-fold increase in California electricity costs? Hardly. While it did make it worse than it had to be, the primary culprit is the high price of natural gas. Since November, the spot price of natural gas in Southern California has risen 600 percent over the 1998-99 average, and since 90 percent of the marginal cost of natural gas-fired electricity is fuel cost, the marginal cost of electricity would have to spike from 3 cents per kilowatt hour to just above 15 cents per kilowatt hour just to cover costs. And that, not coincidentally, is exactly what's happened at the wholesale level. <br>
<br>
The bottom line is that, because the state is so heavily reliant upon natural gas during periods of peak demand, Californians would be facing the same unpleasant combination of high electricity prices and blackouts even if the old regulatory rules were still in place. <br>
<br>
The situation, however, was made far worse by California's long-term hostility to new power plants. Since 1996, electricity demand in California grew by 12 percent while supply grew by only 1 percent. Every time you turned around over the past two decades, California state regulators were discouraging new construction, arguing that renewable energy would pick up the slack, that &quot;negawatts&quot; — activist jargon for subsidized energy conservation — was preferable to &quot;megawatts,&quot; that minimizing new air emissions was more important than generating new electricity, and in general facilitating the transformation of the NIMBY (&quot;Not-In-My-Back-Yard&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  forces into a unified BANANA army (&quot;Build-Absolutely-Nothing-Anywhere-Near-Anybody&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
Gray Davis's vow to do whatever it takes to build new generating capacity in California is a belated acknowledgement that the Naderites have held the State hostage for far too long. But his threats to seize control of power plants and throw company managers in jail guarantees that few private investors will risk entering the market. Decontrolling retail prices might save the utilities from bankruptcy, but the trajectory of wholesale electricity prices is function of the trajectory of wholesale natural gas prices. Building new capacity will help, but only a bit. This is one &quot;crisis&quot; that politicians are simply going to have to ride out.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1169<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/15/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <br>
