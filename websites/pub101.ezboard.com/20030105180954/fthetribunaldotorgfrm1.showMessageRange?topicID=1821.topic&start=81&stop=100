So, when I think of who those are who have stood out, I think of those who did something outside what would be expected for their class, or have some defining characteristic other than being a warrior who sure tanked good.<br>
<br>
Skyliu, in my opinion, is the best player the Trib has seen. He's already been listed by many as the best wizard, throw in how he plays any and every class, whatever it takes to make the game fun for others.  You never hear we couldn't do X because we were missing X class if he is around, he plays them all, and plays them all well.<br>
<br>
Crush, Sure he's a good warrior, but he stands out for his developing battle plans against uber mobs.  He's keeping a lower profile these days, but he was far ahead of all others for a long time.  The banning of anyone over level 50 whatever from Vox and Naggy is a direct result of his leading that 11 man naggy kill.  Who else has made such an impact on the game?<br>
<br>
Rynnia, Yep, we never had a conversation that wasn't an arguement, and I don't believe we ever spoke a word in the game, but the guy can play.  Many times I would see in guild chat that someone had seen him and that ench friend of his do something that just seemed incredible.  Like...so and so tells the guild &quot;holy shit, they just came into the zone, picked out and killed every named and left.&quot;  Throw in some great BOTB success on his second character.<br>
<br>
Smirky, the first to 50 on the server, and had 3 50s while most were still working on their first one. He wasn't much for the uber game, and hurt alot of friends when he ebayed, but the guy was a leveling machine.<br>
<br>
Valero, He was still a young warrior last I played so I don't remember him as a great warrior.  What I remember him for was being a one man group, playing 4 computers and doing the camps you would expect a 4 man team to be able to do.  Along those lines, Bruen killing the turtle by himself, it cracked me up to see guild raid forces come zoning in to try for it while he would kill it himself.<br>
<br>
Saben, probably few remember him, but he was a political force in the early days.  He wasn't a friend of mine by any means, but I was sad to see him go.  I heard a saying once about being able to judge a man by the quality of his enemies, Saben was a good enemy. <br>

This is so easy a game; if someone has more than 100 days playing time and still can't play his/her class well, he/she better go back to real life and work harder. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
The real kickass players, who know this game all around, must be those players who can play mutiple classes well...<br>
By what I know during my 2+ years EQ life, those few people are Skyliu, Valero and Rynnia.<br>

By your argument, the game is easy to learn.<br>
<br>
I agree.  <br>
<br>
But somehow, you claim it takes more skill to play 5-10 classes than 1 class.  I thought this game didn't take skill?  <br>
<br>
All it takes is more time.  <br>
<br>
Then again, I'm just arguing for the sake of arguing.  I agree Sky and co are good players. <p><img src="http://server17.hypermart.net/catacomb/flasshsig2.jpg">

<br>
Clerics have to be on the ball and aware of their groups total HPs and the damage per round a mob does to be efficient.<br>
<br>
Enchanters have to have built in timers in their head to keep multiple mobs mezzed and not get themselves FUBARed.<br>
<br>
Druid have many abilities and thus have many choices and calculations to make if they want to play above average performance.<br>
<br>
Sure, if you want to just play your class well enough to get by, it doesn't take much skill to just not fuck up. But if you want to push the envelope and be a real asset to your group you have to try a little harder and have a little more of an edge than that. <p><br>

My bad, sorry Ali =P<br>
<br>
As far as this little debate about playing multiple classes, i agree and i disagree.  I can tell you right now, i've played every high end class but Bard.  Lvl 60 Enchanters, who only play one class, are levels above me when i compare myself to their skill.  Cleric is the same way.  Just about any mindless idiot could play a necro on a raid and be effective.  I measure Necro's based on the crazy things they can/try to solo.  <br>
<br>
Being truly great at your class (for casters) means an infinite knowledge of your spell book (even those lvl 34 spells that seemed out of place) and being able to know what they do (to a mob) and how they benefit a raid.  (PS I know jack about melee)  10 or so people from the various classes coming together, with a common objective, and using the knowledge in the spell book = success, that is the mark of true greatness imo.  It is never based on one person, but instead a team effort.  As many classes as rynnia and valero can play, since they only leveled 1 or 2 to 60 as a primary character, they will have some gaps in their knowledge of the class vs. someone who plays one class and plays it well.  However, the ability to use the one-class player to fill in the gap and defeat mob_X is a mark of leadership which is a whole different list for me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubeltanebuttercup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beltane Buttercup</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://beltane.hypermart.net/pics/ezboardicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Modest, Gentle & Innocent.</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/11/02 4:19:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1821.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best of best?</span><hr size=1> &lt;cough&gt;<br>

I think BoTB well go to Draelon with Hypersonic and Pic if he's playing again a close second.  There was a specific thing that only Hyper and Connovar knew in the last BoTB that made a significant difference.  I applaud Hyper for figuring it out and wish to bonk him yet again for sharing it with Connovar instead of me!  Just kidding.<br>

Anyway, I'll probably reinstate my account just to watch the next bard BoTB which I think is by far the most interesting of the BoTB tourneys.<br>
<br>
The Tribunal is blessed with a plethora of bards that have shear talent and an excellent understanding of the class.  All of the upper level bards I have had the pleasure to get to know deserve the title.   <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/rigadoon-gag.jpg"></img><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/rigadoon.jpg"></img></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urillsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rillsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/12/02 5:43:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1821.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best of best?</span><hr size=1> BARD - .... this truely is the hardest class I think to judge   here... so I'll throw both Arrion and Draelon, sorry never able to group with Muse since low 30s so I can't compare and throw her in there but hers and Hypersonics reputation precedes them<br>
CLERIC - *shrug* didn't group enough with several of the top end ones out there so I won't make a call here<br>
DRUID - Pekk #1, Rynnia's quite 0ber also<br>
How dare you Zyerne of even mentioning Skeeja in the same sentence as Pekk.  Skeeja AT BEST is a an above average druid.  Asks more question then anyone I know and still gives the wrong answer more then anyone i've seen when he tries to answer ones.  Best of the best LOLOLOL  Don't think so, not even the best druid left in his own guild. Please, don't corrupt this generally well made list with such bogus names as this. <br>
ENCHANTER - hands down Miette<br>
MAGICIAN - *shrug* is there a way to be better at making mod rods? =P j/k I couldn't tell you, not a class I generally watched much and critiqued<br>
MONK - Chunli<br>
NECROMANCER - umm.... i'd haveta say the best necro would haveta have some insane soloing skills so I wouldn't know<br>
PALADIN - hmm, interesting to judge this class... can't say<br>
RANGER - Ashyla, we never got along, but skillz here, mad skillz<br>
ROGUE - Haderak, Kealii<br>
SHAMAN - same as cleric, though I will mention Boinshar<br>
SHADOW KNIGHT - never group with them enough... not sure why... just never did...<br>
WARRIORS - hmm... once again same as clerics, and please don't say gear makes the warrior completely.  Yes it means how well you'll be able to absorb dmg and keep aggro (to a degree), but like ever other class there's a those few subtle things a warrior can do to make themselves even better, THAT'S what this list is about<br>
WIZARDS - once again same as clerics, but I will mention the name Dvinatsat<br>
<br>
This list has made me think about some of the stuff and 1 question has popped into my head.........<br>
<br>
WTF is up with all these n00b shamans 50+ now that don't cannibalize.  It's your best unique class skill you morons USE IT!  Don't tell me your f-ing oom when you've been at full health the past 10 minutes with RoTG on you the entire time, JESUS CHRIST!<br>
<br>
God damn n00bs!<br>

<br>
It takes a slightly above average player to play all 14 classes fairly well.<br>
<br>
EQ isn't exactly difficult, all classes have their strengths, and all have their weaknesses. An average player can play their class to the fullest, capitalizing on their strengths, and nod in acceptance at their weaknesses. It takes a good player to know all of the limitations of the class(es) they are currently playing, and break them.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I'm setting the standards a little high for the majority, but the few good players out there understand what is expected from their classes, yet is able to break this mold and achieve somethings that totally blows the minds of the average players. <br>
<br>
In my books, to be able to do the unexpected is the mark of a good player. <p><BR>
