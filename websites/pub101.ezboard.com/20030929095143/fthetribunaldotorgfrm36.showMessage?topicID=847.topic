Here is the story.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>BAYER aids-risk-prone blood clotting drug was sold overseas<br>
Washington May 22 Sapa-AFP<br>
<br>
A division of the pharmaceutical giant Bayer in the 1980s sold a medicine to Asia and Latin America that carried a high risk of transmitting AIDS while it was selling a new, safer product in the west, The New York Times said Thursday.<br>
<br>
Cutter Biological wanted to avoid being stuck with large stores of a product that was becoming increasingly unmarketable in the United States and Europe, according to internal company documents obtained by the daily.<br>
<br>
The company also sought to save money by honoring several fixed-price contracts with the old product, which was cheaper to produce than the new, safer blood-clotting medicine, the daily said other company records suggest.<br>
<br>
&quot;These are the most incriminating internal pharmaceutical industry documents I have ever seen,&quot; said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, who as director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group has been investigating the industry's practices for three decades.<br>
<br>
In a statement to the daily, Bayer said Cutter had &quot;behaved responsibly, ethically and humanely&quot; in selling the old product overseas, adding that it did so because some customers doubted the new drug's effectiveness, because some countries were slow to approve its sale and because a shortage of plasma hindered mass production of the new medicine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Decisions made nearly two decades ago were based on the best scientific information of the time and were consistent with the regulations in place,&quot; the Bayer statement said.&quot; The New York Times said it was practically impossible to determine how many hemophiliacs in Latin America and Asia were affected by the company's sale of Factor VIII concentrate after February 1984 (when the new product came out).<br>
<br>
However, in Hong Kong and Taiwan alone, more than 100 hemophiliacs were infected with the HIV virus after using Factor VIII, and many since have died, according to records and interviews obtained by the paper.<br>
<br>
Cutter also continued to sell the older product after February 1984 in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and Argentina, the daily added.<br>
<br>
In the early 1980s, when the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome was first detected, there was no screening test for the HIV virus to prevent it from contaminating blood products. Companies later developed a heat treatment for plasma products to kill off the HIV virus.<br>
<br>
The Cutter documents were produced in connection with lawsuits filed by American hemophiliacs, which had gone largely unnoticed until the daily said it began asking about them.<br>
<br>
In the United States, according to the Times, thousands of hemophiliacs were infected with AIDS from contaminated blood-clotting medicine. Bayer and three other companies that made the concentrate have paid around 600 million dollars to settle over 15 years of victims' lawsuits.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thousand of men, women and children got infected and our government will do nothing about it. I don't see how anyone can see this as anything short of mass murder.<br>
<br>
I hope the rest of you will avoid Bayer products whenever possible. I know I am going to.<br>

If Americans in America committed criminal acts in connection with selling tainted drug products they can be prosecuted here. If they are civilly liable to the &quot;victims&quot; they can be sued here and the judgment can be collected. But don't lose sight of the fact that the operation is German.<br>
<br>
The background on this is that the enzyme that hemopheliacs lack, Factor VIII, for years was derived from human blood donations.  Unfortunately, hemopheliacs (and those who received other blood products such as whole blood and platelet transfusions, including Arthur Ashe, one of the most famous victims) died during the lag time between the discovery of AIDS, its transmission in blood products, and the development of ways to detect the virus and to keep it out of blood products.  There was a huge scramble to develop ways to inactivate viruses to improve the safety of blood-derived products.<br>
<br>
Bayer AG, a German company, and Baxter International, a US company based outside of Chicago, were and still are two of the biggest providers of drugs produced from human blood. <br>
<br>
The AIDS scare convinced a lot of people that the future of hemophelia treatment was recombinant Factor VIII, produced from genetically engineered cells.  Today, the blood-derived product is a bigger seller and for most is the preferred drug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=traban>Traban</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/2/03 1:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=847.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bayer outrage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Show me who knowingly sold drugs that caused aids and I'll agree that they should be locked up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'm not following.  They <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>had</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to know some of their drugs contained a virus which hadn't been even discovered until they had been manufacturing it for some time?  Once it's made into a drug, how do you run that drug through a newly developed HIV test that is designed for normal blood?  And, how do you test that drug thoroughly enough for an armchair internet quarterback like yourself?<br>
<br>
Now, your other alternative is that they didn't but they should have known it was tainted.  How the fuck do you not know something but should have known on a true/false test?  Either they knew or they didn't!  If they claim to have not known but did, it's not negligence, it's deception.  If they didn't know because their testing said &quot;not present&quot;, then it's not negligence, it's a tragic mistake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 1528<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/2/03 2:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=847.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bayer outrage</span><hr size=1> The argument would be that they should have simply dumped their entire supply of the drug; destroyed every last bit of it since it was impossible to test whether it was infected (presumably?), and the possibility existed that it was infected.

I don't see how you can entertain that thought when the new and safer drug was available while they were peddling the tainted product.

The lack of an HIV test isn't the right excuse, once HIV was identified as the causative agent for AIDS and HIV detection methods were available.  <br>
<br>
These acts MAY have occured in the time between HIV being discovered and tests being available.  There was a period of time in there where tainted products got sold by several companies, and where HIV infected blood got distributed by the Red Cross.  During that time, the issue was very difficult to deal with. Hemopheliacs die without the drug...but it may be tainted...difficult. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makino>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 417<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/3/03 4:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=847.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.oldcrows.net/~kken/100.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bayer outrage</span><hr size=1> Well it would help my understanding of this issue if someone could explain how the medicine is made and from what.  I am assuming that human blood is somehow involved and that it's a medication that is injected as opposed to swallowed in pill form.  If this is the case, then I don't see how Bayer can not be held responsible.  So, can someone clarify for me please?<br>

It means only that the FDA, an agency of the United States Government, has found that the drug does not meet the requirements to be sold in the United States.  While this is certainly not a good thing, it doesn't necessarily mean that the drug is death on a pale horse - you act as if the FDA is the final arbiter of truth in the universe.  There's more to it than that.<br>

(of course, it very well may mean that the drug is death on a pale horse, but my point here is that if you want to get to the bottom of it all, it will take a lot more research than determining only what the FDA said about it) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 9/3/03 7:33 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=847.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=847.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=847.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=847.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=847.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=847.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=847.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=847.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
