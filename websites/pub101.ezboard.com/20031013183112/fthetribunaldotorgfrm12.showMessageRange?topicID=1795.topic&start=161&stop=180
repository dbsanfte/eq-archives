I wonder....why is it the non famous get ridiculed and flamed and the famous...well we cry for them, the tragedy, the awfullness of it. Anyone remember this story?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>March 20th 1991- <br>
<br>
11:10 am- A matinence worker of the Manhattan high-rise condo finshes up washing the window and leaves it open, forgetting about the little boy who would run to the closed window sometimes for fun. The boy, Conor Clapton, wandered into a bedroom on the second floor of the duplex at 11:10 a.m. and leaned over the ledge of a hinged 4-foot by 6-foot window that was opened inward, like a door, about 18 inches from the floor. He fell to the roof of the five-story New York Geneological and Biographical Society, which faces on 58th Street. <br>
<br>
The boy's mother, Italian actress Lori del Santo, 32, the housekeeper and the maid were in other rooms of the 4,000-square-foot apartment. Neglegence? <br>
<br>
Eric Clapton, who is separated from Conor's mother and who lived in Britain, was staying in a New York hotel and rushed to the scene when a friend told him the news. He and del Santo were treated for shock at Lenox Hill Hospital and released. <br>
<br>
&quot;It seems as if it was a tragic accident,&quot; police Capt. Stephen Davis said. &quot;To our knowledge, there were no actual eyewitnesses.&quot; Police said the Health Department was investigating why the luxury duplex on the 52nd and 53rd floors at 117 E. 57th St. had no window guards, as required by law. I know this was a terrible accident but it could have been prevented very easily. If the window were closed, little Conor wouldn't have fallen out.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A tragic accident. 3 people in the apartment and this boy fell to his death. Why don't I remember Lori del Santo getting put up on the stakes and burned for this? I remember a lot of tears from the public at the horror they must be enduring to losing a child...but I don't remember anyone accusing her of being off someplace else in her rich ass apartment probably picking out colors for her new bidet...<br>
<br>
I don't know. I think everyone is being awfully hard on her. For me, my sympathies go out to her. She made a decision and it cost her a child. Maybe the rest of us have just been luckier so far.<br>

Apparently your kids picked it up through the vagaries of genetics if they're incapable of defeating &quot;reasonable&quot; precautions.  Anecdotal evidence isn't the best way to prove a point, but when my brother was 3 he got out of his crib and disassembled it.  When I was a kid we had &quot;childproof latches&quot; on the kitchen cabinets, and I had no trouble getting em open.  <br>
<br>
You said something about at least lock the car in an earlier post.  If the car was locked, maybe she woulda walked around the yard a lil and come back in.  Maybe she woulda climbed up on top of it and leaped off to her death.  Maybe some sick fuck woulda snatched her off the sidewalk and raped and tortured her before killing her.<br>
<br>
You are obviously lying when you say your kids have never been unsupervised.  If they're too stupid to figure out how to get out of the crib, good for you, but that won't last forever.  The surest way I can think of for something like this to happen to you is you hanging onto your self-righteous certainty that it couldn't possibly happen to you.<br>
<br>
Locking the door is a reasonable precaution, but we don't know that the door was unlocked.  Not locking the door is not grounds for a manslaughter conviction.  Shit happens, and when it does there's always assholes looking for someone to blame.  If you need to blame someone, blame god, or if you don't subscribe to that kinda stuff, blame primitive man who started using tools, stimulating the development of a brain too large to be fully formed upon birth, thereby forcing us to be burdened with helpless young.<br>
<br>
While you can prove anything with statistics if you pick the ones you want, and it's tough to find good raw data since almost everyone has their own axe to grind, the overall picture I got from a admittedly brief scan of some stuff on the net is that accidental deaths of children has been on the decline; about half what it was in the mid 80s per capita.<br>

Because it was the maintenance worker that left the window open. No where does it say the boy’s mother was aware that the window was open.

<br>
That would make it the hotels responsibility. (For not having window guards, but not for having to watch the child).<br>
<br>
This also happened relatively quickly with the mother awake and in the next room. She was neither napping nor was she playing everquest. <br>
<br>
Could this horrible accident have been prevented yes? <br>
1) Proper building code enforcement<br>
2) By careful completion of the job by the window washer<br>
3) Better supervision<br>
<br>
2 out of these three factors were not the mother’s fault. Nor was it the maid fault or the housekeeper fault (unless one of them was also supposed to be watching the child) and you know what it's not Eric claptons fault either he wasn't there.<br>
It's not like she was dangling the baby out the window oh that was another star and he did catch flak for that.<br>
<br>
Does any one know what to do with all these oranges cause the apples are taking up all the counter space?<br>

See, bullshit. According to some of you:<br>
<br>
If the mother knew what her child was doing every second of every day she would have been standing right there and known the window was open, therfor preventing him from plunging headlong into the ground.<br>
<br>
So you can't blame the hotel or the maintenance guy, it's the mothers fault! NEGLIGENT!<br>
<br>
Folks, get realistic. Shit happens. If you say you watch your child every moment, every second of every day I say you are totally full of pious BS. You'd be better off counting yourself as very fortunate that nothing like this has happened to you. Yet. Because you just never know.<br>

And just because this is the flameboard doesn't mean you have to take a &quot;flaming&quot; stance and be a badass about what you think should happen to the mother just because you think it makes you look cool.

Childproof locks are a joke; the majority of children will figure out a way to open a childproof lock.  You know why?  They have to be operable by an adult within a certain time frame.  The majority of parents out there cannot stand the inconvenience of what would truly be a childproof lock - one inoperable by mechanical means, which requires an adult's superior strength.  Like a big fucking wooden bar across it that you would use to keep out the horde of villagers who want to burn the vampire.  Or a timelocked bank vault.<br>
<br>
Children are much more innovative and creative than adults are.  You know why?  They don't 'know' that it can't be done - so they do it.  Just like *you* 'know' that this was negligence on the part of the mother.  <br>
<br>
Got news for you.  You don't know shit.  All you know is the hype the media has built up around this event.  You are being spoon fed information by an institution that thrives on the spectacular, the gruesome, the emotionally heartwrenching.  Have you looked at the inside of the house, to determine what preventative measures were taken inside to take care of the child?  <br>
<br>
This woman could have made it impossible for her child to come to harm inside, but forgotten, just *once*, to lock the door behind her when she came inside, maybe because her kid was running full tilt and tripped over some groceries she brought inside, and she caught him, picked up the groceries and took them to the kitchen.  The door could have had 9000 childproof locks on it.  If, for the 1000th time (child is approx 1000 days old), she was tired and forgot to lock the door, when the other 999 times she did, does that make her negligent?  No, it makes her a tired worn out parent.<br>
<br>
She could have spent millions of dollars on childproofing her house, and just once, fallen asleep.  It only takes once for an accident to happen.  When I was a kid, I was over at my grandparent's house.  There were 8 adults around me.  I tripped and fell face first on the edge of a table, and cut the skin completely around the bottom of one my eye sockets.  This is called an 'accident'.  My parents were not negligent - sometimes shit happens.<br>
<br>
Accidents happen to children every day.  Some of them die.  Accidents happen on the expressway. Some adults die.  Dante, you're one of those people who would follow a chain of events all the way back to Adam and Eve, and place the blame on the serpent for making Adam eat of the Tree Knowledge. <br>
<br>
You can't make a house completely childproof, no matter what you do.  You would have to lock the child in a padded cell.  With no toys.  Hell, sunlight could be dangerous, so let's not have a window - the fucking kid might catch skin cancer and then it would be our fault for not sunscreening him.  Let's put the cell underground in case of a nuclear war - we'd be negligent for allowing the child to be near such a dangerous thing.  Hell, the kid might fall and break an arm, so we'll epoxy his ass to the wall.  But then the sun might go nova...<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the mother is innocent;  but I can easily see a situtation where she wasn't 'criminally negligent.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Grow the fuck up, Dante.  People like you are the reason there are wars - judgemental, ready to blame, and basking in the holy glow of ignorance bordering on criminal.  You're a big one for blaming her of negligence - I'm accusing you of being too negligent to look up the facts before you blame her.  <br>

It was an accident, accidents happen.  It's just unfortunate that the child lost her life over it.

Actually.. I take that stance because I DO believe that the mother should get the same treatment as the daughter if she was negligent.  I don't take positions JUST to flame.

I like that idea. If you knowingly allow your child to play with unsafe toys that result in them choking to death, then you get choked to death.<br>
<br>
Let your child play in the street and they get hit by a car, then you get to be our new crash test dummy.<br>
<br>
Shake your infant to death, then we get to put your worthless ass in a giant paint mixer and shake you till your eyes pop out.<br>
<br>
If you allow your child to slowly burn to death in a hot car (and make no mistake this is what happens - one of the children this happened to pulled out their own hair because of the pain), then you get to share the same fate.<br>
<br>
Maybe if these careless/indifferent parents were faced with the threat of facing the same fate their negligence caused/allowed, they would be much more careful with their children. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=toreyj01>toreyj01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/9/03 8:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1795.topic&index=172>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jtorey/is_ani_e0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: eq </span><hr size=1> Had a few conversations with some Pediatrician friends of mine, and the general consensus is that the stress of that woman could have bordered on near catastrophic levels.<br>
<br>
She lost her husband and father of her child to EQ, was pursuing work and school while raising a child alone and still trying to start a relationship with another man. Any one of them alone is stressful enough, but combined it can make normal life incredibly difficult.<br>
<br>
According to most Pediatric sites on the net, and the Pediatricians I have talked to, as well as a few folks in Social work and Psychology, the risks the mother takes by being sleep deprived are much higher for the child than by timing a rest period when she feels the child is resting as well. Makes sense to me, a stressed and sleep deprived mother can make a hundred different mistakes that could be awful to the child. &quot;Shaken baby syndrome&quot; ring a bell with anyone?<br>

It has been said by many that to sleep while your child does is normal and a good thing.<br>
<br>
Parenting classes teach it, parenting books have it, your own parents will tell you to sleep at this time if you are the only parent.<br>
<br>
Why ?  because you sure cant sleep when they are awake and you often dont get a full nights sleep so you need to sleep when you can.<br>
<br>
You are a complete and utter Moron for blaming this woman in any way at all because she had a nap.<br>

&quot;Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. <br>
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. <br>
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? <br>
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?&quot; <br>
