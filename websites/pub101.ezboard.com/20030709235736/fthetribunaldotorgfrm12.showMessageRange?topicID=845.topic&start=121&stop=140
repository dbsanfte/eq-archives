EV is not here to babysit you throught conflict with ex guildmembers<br>
<br>
EV is not mediators in your ex member loot disputes<br>
<br>
Can you please stop trying to make like EV is somehow involved in this tiff, because it only stems from the fact that you feel you can pressue EV, or guilt Gann, it wont happen.<br>
<br>
When a guildmember leaves your guild, and joins our guild, we dont check him for weapons at the gate, and make sure he has nothing to declare, sorry we dont provide that service for you. If your problem is with Gann which it clearly is, then deal with that, attempting to force EV to handle your loot rules is ludicrious. <br>
<br>
Enforce your own rules, we arent policing your ex guildmembers, we arent forcing YOUR guildrules on our members, its his choice, how hard is that to understand.<br>
<br>
He clearly demonstrates a conflicting story, saying (1)rules were changed and he was not aware (2)he earned it (3)he was harrassed into leaving, thus his following said rules of conduct dont apply as someone didnt follow rules of conduct when dealing with him....<br>
<br>
I am not wasting my time helping you fix your problem, stop trying to make it our issue when it clearly is not.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/02 4:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Just curious how does EV feel when a member leaves with out giving guild awarded no drop stuff back?

How can u people say these things about another human being (yes there is a real live person behind that char we play , behind that monitor) and then have the audacity to say your don't know who  he is ? Then how can u know what kind of a person or guild leader he is ?<br>
<br>
About the robe: the robe in question (was deceided by the guild) that it should be worn by the person who would benefit the guild the most . Notice  &quot;worn &quot; not won.  It was to be worn where it could benefit the guild as a whole . Come on people even I who knows very little when it comes to playing the game understood that is was the guilds and was meant to benefit the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
And as far as uber guilds, well to me Revolution is the most uber guild , not because of what they kill or what gear player no 34 has  , but because of the way they treat there members. We are a family and are treated as such and always told our real life comes first  if we can't attend a raid . We are not deguilded because we didn't attend X amount of raids  nor belittled either. Everyone is always welcome to attend any raid from the low one's to the 60&quot;s. U are encourged to level and excel but not chastised if u don't . They cheer u when you are happy and stand with you when u are sad. and i would bet if 50% of the people walking norrath were asked who came to the rescue when they needed help it would be someone wearing a Revo guild tag.<br>

I have never posted anything on this board in the 2 years I have played EQ but i could not let this one go .<br>

I forget who said it, but they stated that EV and Comps are killing the same things, so 1st and 2nd can't be judged on that. If it were judged by equipment, then there is no doubt in my mind that EV would come out #1 as I believe you have the best equipped players in the game. The big advantage EV has had is being first by a mile in difficult areas and then having time to equip the guild to the teeth while other guilds catch up. By the time the rest have gotten to the level to rotate with you, you are finishing up and getting ready to move on to the next challenge. Being first has it's rewards to be certain.<br>
<br>
But consider this - usually when somebody brings a bunch of side issues into the argument, it's because they are losing on the real issues. If you get fighting them on those, then you lose emphasis on the point that you have won.<br>
<br>
Just hit em head on on the real issues and forget the pissing contest. If they start pissing at you, just move upwind and let em piss into the wind. Doesn't take long for em to learn that it isn't worth it. <p><br>

If you aren't in a big guild you never see them or what they do because they are usualy in a different zone than you. Except for Comps and sometimes maybe one or two other guilds no one gives a shit what we do. They give a shit about themselves. As it should be.<br>
<br>
But Xav has the biggest chip on his shoulder of anyone I've ever seen on these messageboards. I think it could be jealousy. Not sure though. Where did someone post about jealousy anyway? I might have missed it. <br>
<br>
They did say when they formed that Revo would be the next uber guild, which has yet to happen. Accepting one of his admittedly best wizards into EV hurts Xav more than just the robe. Pride can make people do freaky things. Jealous? Possibly. Are gas station attendants jealous of every dork that drives up in a mercedes? Probably not if their priorities have nothing to do with making alot of money.<br>
<br>
<br>
To the people who come to Xav or Revo's defense, you have to understand something here. Dyran and EV didn't start this. The person you are defending so ferverantly did. He had a problem with an ex-guild member and instead of being diplomatic about it he comes to the flameboard and starts hissing about how much EV must suck and is desperate. No where did EV start this by posting how much Revo blows. Could we just take the higher ground and not post anything? Fuck no. It's too much fun bashing this dumb ass now that he 's exposed his backside to us.<br>

I'm glad you guys like him so much but I cant stand the petty &quot;I'm the victim&quot; attitude he has. <br>

Any real leader type in Revolution, please next time you have a problem with us, maybe you can try the higher ground and send a tell to Mojak. He's an asshole, but you'll find that he is a fair asshole. Or you can fuck your guild over by shouting zone wide stuff. That's what my little niece does when she's mad. It's call a tatrum.

Most people I've seen that leave don't get asked for stuff back, but I have seen it happen. <br>

It happens less and less though lately for one simple reason. If you look at any guild member thats been in a year or more all their stuff is no drop. And the stuff that isn't no drop is not normaly that great. Is a mana robe really that great for a wizard. It's ok from what I've seen. But it's used less and less as other uber robes filter in. The only droppables I can think of that are still pretty uber is some Mith stuff for ToV and the SoD. If someone doesn't give something back when asked I haven't seen it being a problem. Either because it doesn't happen or it's just not worth crying about.<br>
<br>
I think I remember an incident last year where someone from Comps joined EV and was &quot;called out&quot; on our messageboard for not returning an SoD. But I believe we just replied that an EV had joined Comps and took a SoD with him, so it was all good. Of course, it wasn't all good, there were about 10 pages of flaming, but I don't think it changed anything. It was left as a SoD swap. Haha. Shit usualy works out in the end.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61467">Arleanna Mistmoore</a><BR>

<br>
Say guild A is all semi-uber but not really and they have all this droppable shit they use.<br>
<br>
Then a small portion of guild A forms into guild B.<br>
<br>
since they had disagreements enough to leave, they probably wouldn't give droppable shit back to guild A.<br>
However, if it was in the guild A charter that stuff stayed in the guild, would the tribunal community expect them to give it back? <br>
Was just curious, since it's not so clear cut a case. <p><center><img src=http://www.hellfire.com/versus/images/chocula.gif </center>

I'm not gonna dispute the fact that you &quot;deserve&quot; that robe. You did put in countless hours on guild raids and you were generally a stand up guy while you were guilded with a few glaring exceptions. You've made reference here and on the Revo boards that you were hated by all of the officers. I know you had your differences with some. I myself thought that you were way off base on a number of your complaints, but then again, other times I was your staunchest defender.<br>
<br>
Speaking as an officer, I can assure you that not ALL of the officers hated you. I considered you a friend up until the day you left and then proceeded to shoot yourself in the foot so many times that you don't have any toes left.<br>
<br>
You can whine about what you deserve and pontificate about how you are a &quot;man of conviction&quot; but deep down you know that its all a line of bull. What you are is a THIEF.<br>
<br>
You were WELL aware of the guild's policy that droppable uber loot was to be handed back upon removing yourself from the guild. The policy has been in place for much longer than a month. You know that damn well. You and I had more than one discussion in tells about that very same policy. Regardless of when the policy was put into effect, if you disagreed with it so much, you should have employed these uncorruptable convictions I keep hearing about abd left at the point it was changed. At any rate, your robe was GIVEN to you well after this mythical one month period you are concoting.<br>
<br>
Your skills as a wizard were considerable. Overlooking the time you cast mana burn on the wrong damn mob and cause a wipe out, and the instance where you prematurely ejaculated on Hoskar which let him get away, I always found you to be a great colleague in the arts of Wizardry.<br>
<br>
No one's disputing your effectiveness. What we are doing is labeling you a THIEF. Which you are regardless of wether or not you and I (which we both do btw) think you deserve that robe. Your sterling convictions amount to a pile of guano when you couple them with the hypocritical antics you displayed subsequent to your removal.<br>
<br>
E/V, I'm not gonna add to the inter-guild flame session here. I do however want to let you in on some truths regarding the whole Manna robe shitstorm. This is the crux of the problem.<br>
<br>
Every member of Revolution knows that when they are on a guild raid and they win an uber droppable like the Mana robe, the are responsible for returning it upon their departure. We don't require that they go away naked and give us back every droppable they have. Only the exceptional stuff. Believe me, Ganndor has no shortage of other robes he could wear and do just as well on a raid.<br>
<br>
Wether you, as an outsider to Revolution personally agree with our loot policy or not, is of no consequence. Ganndor was fully aware of the policy in place and chose to break the rules that he, and his balsa wood convictions, agreed to abide by. Again, this makes him a THIEF. Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
We have a pretty stringent invite policy in Revo. In fact, I can damn well guarantee that everyone applying, wether they were level 60 with mana burn, FT20 and a sherman tank or a completely naked minimum level character would go through the exact same induction process. This is because we value the player over the power.<br>
<br>
I have no beef with how long it takes someone to join your guild. Its got nothing to do with me and I could care less. Flame me to high hell if you choose, but it tarnishes your guild's reputation by allowing undisputed THIEVES to join your ranks. I'm sure most of you don't give a damn what happens to the &quot;friends&quot; that the offended left behind. Hell, its another mana burn with which to knock out uber mob 10,000 with. Just remember though, when you gird your loins by enlisting people of nefarious character, you might eventually end up stabbing yourself in the groin because of it.<br>
<br>
There is no honor amongst THIEVES.<br>

<br>
I am going to go out on a limb here and offer a logical response to this problem.  I know that isn't normal flame board procedure but what the hell I'll do it anyway.<br>
<br>
Why doesn't Revo let Gann keep the mana robe, until he gets a replacement thru EV?  From what I have read here the robe is't that big of a deal to EV, and it should be pretty easy to replace, even if it takes a month or two.  That way Revo gets their robe back, and EV can keep their new member with a good conscience.  It's not like Gan will be out anything, if he had stayed with Revo he would have been required to hand the robe down once he got a replacement.  This way he's just doing the same thing but waiting for the award from a different guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uracknar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Racknar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/02 7:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Gann,<br>
<br>
Please don't take this as a personal attack, because it isn't.  I just wanna pitch my 2cp in whether it is welcome or not.<br>
<br>
As far as the robe goes, well, it isn't yours.  I play a monk and yet I know how the guild distributes and reaquires mana robes and somehow you do not?  There as been a SPOKEN and yet unwritten (until recently) rule about loot such as this and you cannot claim ignorance of it.  The fact that Revo has decided to put this rule in writing does not diminish the fact that Revo has always had a rule about such items.  Don't insult the intelligence of either one of us by claiming otherwise.<br>
<br>
Did you earn the robe?  You know Marclar and I have discussed it and personally we both think you had.  That being said, you STILL wouldn't be entitled to it.  Can a guild leader make an exception? Sure, but they didn't for Entriude and everybody liked him. (P.S. we both hate some of the same people, but leaving because of them means that you, to some degree, put too much value in the opinions of those you dislike. I wouldn't leave a guild because of the opinions of those that I think are morons.  For people like that I use a clever little tool called /ignore).  <br>
<br>
What this comes down to in the end is personal integrity.  I weild at least one weapon that would have to be returned to Revo if I ever chose to leave and if I did, the first person I would find would be an officer so I could turn those items over.  Did I earn those items?  In my mind I sure did.  That, though, has always been irrelevant in the eyes of Revo.  Win it on a guild raid and the guild can lay claim to it when you go.  It is just....that....simple. <br>
<br>
People hating you is not a valid excuse.<br>
Having been on a bazillion Trak runs is not a valid excuse.<br>
Having been in Revo since it's inception is not a valid excuse.<br>
<br>
You are a GREAT player and a nice guy to boot.  EV is lucky to have you in my opinion.  That being said, give back the robe, get some closure on the whole matter, and move on with your life.  The best revenge in this instance is wandering by your favorite detractor in a month wearing a robe that makes them drool.<br>

Most of us wouldn't agree with you, but I for one would respect your view.<br>
<br>
The thing is you dragged EV as a guild into it because they did not do what you wanted them to. You started taking pot shots to try and embarass them for not following your rules.<br>
<br>
I have no probs with you taking pot shots at EV. I don't think it's any secret that I don't agree with some of the current policy/philosophy changes the guild has implemented. But, if I bring up one of those policies and then throw in a bunch of cheap shots with it, are you going to take me seriously or just think I am on a smear campaign?<br>
<br>
I can see where you are coming from and in a way I can even see why you are upset with EV, though I think you are way off base to be expecting EV to shun somebody on your say so. But where you blew it is when you started on this whole desperate thing and then saying Mojak got a ship that was already going down so it's not his fault. That's when it stopped looking like a legit argument and started looking like a person desperate to rattle EVs cage.<br>
<br>
Anybody who has followed EV knows we came damn close to imploding when Diablo II came out. But after 2 months of sticking with it and throwing ourselves at mobs over and over again, we finally made some kills and rebuilt moral. We then went on to have a very good era for EV, maybe even close to the era before that. That didn't happen under Crush, it happened under Mojak. See, I can disagree with his decisions of late and still be honest about his accomplishments of the past. If you could do the same then maybe you could have some credibility. You certainly won't gain any looking like you'll say anything you can think of just to draw them out.<br>
<br>
Course, it still makes for good reading, so flame on.<br>
