The vast majority of said gear cannot be gotten alone, so yes it's your character but it's only as valuable as it is because of your friends that helped build it.  No, the analogy doesn't fit exactly, most analogies don't.  Just trying to show a viewpoint and of course ALL viewpoints are biased by your experience, but I don't think mine has anything to do with leadership and everything to do with a style of play.<br>

I invest my time to help better your character.  I am not the only one that plays that way and neither am I the only one that shares this viewpoint.<br>
<br>
There ARE instances where ebay doesn't bother me.  I could care less unless it personally affects me, and even then it doesn't like give me ulcers or anything.  Recently had a bard join our guild for about 3 or 4 months.  The guild did his epic for him and he wound up with a bunch of really nice gear which of course upped the price he got on ebay.  The fact that he just deguilded and ebayed without a word to anyone is what stung the most.  We invested time in building up his character when I'm pretty sure all along he intended to sell his character.  This is called using people and no, most people don't take well to that. <p><img src="http://www.sonic.net/knightstribunal/images/ravlow.jpg" border="0"> <BR> <a href=http://www.ravlowscorpse.com>www.ravlowscorpse.com</a> <BR> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71567>Property of KoT</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatancoindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 510<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/02 10:37:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.nd.edu/~comet/stuff/brak5.jpg width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebaying</span><hr size=1> I dont have a prob with people who buy or sell their accounts.<br>

Wolvar does have a point but the same goes for people that just up and leave the game or the guild all together.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with eBAY directly.<br>
That is just a symptom.<br>
<br>
Wolvar is just ignorant sometimes.  Running a guild kind of dulls people a bit.  Dont blame him.  Its just poor perception.<br>
<br>
Pat his head and look at him knowingly the next time you see him.  I am sure he could use the support. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 617<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/02 11:30:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebaying</span><hr size=1> Matan- I like Wolvar but I disagree with his perception. Perception being that there is only one way to play EQ. There are no laws stating you must be in guild. Most equipment is not done by guilds contrary to popular belief with an exception of 1-5% of each servers population. There are major differences between a video game, life itself and roleplaying a character persona. There are no laws stating you must help and trust someone. Accordingly, there are no laws stating that if said help or trust is tarnished you must be prejudice towards all of similar nature. But most of all, there is no law stating ownership of another person just because you did a favor. And yes leadership does change your perception :p Which is expected and not a fault. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/umatancoindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matan CoinDancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://pub58.ezboard.com/feternalheroesfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=291.topic&start=81&stop=100>I dont like goats.<br><br>I prefer sheep.</a></span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/26/02 12:44:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.nd.edu/~comet/stuff/brak5.jpg width=135 height=135></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebaying</span><hr size=1> This isnt a matter of liking Wolvar.<br>

I agree with him with what he said about time/energy put into somone and their gear.. only to have them turn around and split....<br>
<br>
That does suck.  Figure in the hours and hours spent helping people...<br>
<br>
I am not guilded and help people 98% of the time, I dont have a beef with that...<br>
<br>
But if I where guilded and helping guildmates with shit... only to have them turn and leave.. that is wrong....<br>

Its the leaving part that is wrong.. not the ebay part.<br>

<br>
Selling a character, at least, this is how it used to be, the value is based on DROPPABLE uber items first, then everything else a distant second.<br>
<br>
<br>
A person would be foolish to spend several months gearing a character with no drop items in a guild if they were only going after a higher sell value.   For example, said bard with epic is probably worth LESS than if the bard did NOT have epic but had a fungi tunic, which could be gotten with a week of farming / selling items and trading and then purchasing for plat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone leaving a guild only to sell their character without a word to ex guildmates is shitty, sure.  It's no different. as far as the greater whole is concerned, though, than the individual leaving the guild for another guild, or leaving the guild to go guildless, or quitting the game.   The guild loses the same perceived value in all cases, and in all cases it could be looked upon as the individual &quot;used&quot; the guild, depending on how you spin it.<br>
<br>
<br>
My opinion?  A character is the owner's and they may do what they want with it.   So long as people give their droppables back to guild, if the guild has such a policy, it's rough to fault them for selling their character if they do &quot;quit&quot; rather than letting it rot, or, as suggested, giving it to someone else who will likely sell it later.<br>

<br>
Correct me where I am wrong.. and these are generalizations...<br>
<br>
They are very emotional.<br>
<br>
They are confusing when they are emotional.<br>
<br>
They just want to be listened too and understood.<br>
<br>
You have to say your sorry a whole bunch of times.<br>
Even when they are wrong.<br>
<br>
You have to make a bunch of promises about everything so that if you do something against that promise. You break the promise.<br>
<br>
If you &quot;yup&quot; them alot.. it actually works most of the time.<br>
<br>
What they say is not always what they mean.<br>
<br>
They talk alot, more so when they are upset.<br>
<br>
Everything impacts the flow and balance of the entire fucking universe.  Even deciding on what you are going to have for dinner.<br>
<br>
They manipulate more often then men.  Much more.<br>
<br>
And they lie.<br>
<br>
Thats all I know so far.  Perhaps you can add to my knowledge.<br>
.............................................................................<br>
Not going to get drunk and arugue with anyone. Much less Wolvar about EQ, he has more gamen knowledge then anyone I know cept maybe Broshan.<br>
<br>
I am just an ignorant fucking clown.<br>
I Gonna get drunk and try to find some whip cream and pie tins. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
