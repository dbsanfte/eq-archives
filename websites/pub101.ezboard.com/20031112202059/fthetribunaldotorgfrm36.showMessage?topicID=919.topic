<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe John Ashcroft poses a greater danger to America than Osama bin Laden</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Not even close.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You think President Bush lied to the nation but his predecessor did not.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's not whether they lied, it's what they lied ABOUT.  If Bush stuck to lying about his sex life, I'd be fine with it.  That doesn't cost lives and $100,000,000,000 of my tax money that could be spent on ways that benefit me more than stopping a third-rate harmless dictator.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe President Bush is too dumb to be President and Arnold Schwarzenegger is too dumb to be Governor of California, but the Dixie Chicks, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, Eddie Vedder and Jeanine Garofalo are qualified to discourse at length on foreign policy.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Everyone's entitled to their opionion - this is flawed because (said celebs) are not in positions to DICTATE foreign policy, simply comment on it.  If all Bush did was speak on talking head shows, I don't care how stupid he is - it wouldn't hurt anyone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe all conservatives are racist, but do not think minorities can ever succeed without Affirmative Action.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I hate affirmative action.  Not sure if all conservatives are racist, though - I think many bible belt politicians are, and they happen to be Christian Coalition-esque conservatives, but they aren't 100% linked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You can't decide which is worse: the Patriot Act or the Patriot Missile.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Patriot Act!  The missle is defensive.  It's a Good Thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Il, and Yasser Arafat were fairly and democratically elected, but President Bush was not.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Bush won without a doubt based on how we elect presidents.  I don't have to like it, but the electoral college did its job.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You root for prisoners when they escape from our oppressive prisons, but oppose allowing poor children to escape from failing public schools.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Definitely not me.  Too many useless people in society already, I take a very Texas view on execution of annoying members of society :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You support every kind of &quot;diversity&quot; on campus, except political orientation.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I don't understand this one.  Both left- and right-wing campus organizations thrived at my school.  I didn't particiapte in either.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You support banning the smoking of tobacco and legalizing marijuana.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Not sure what this has to do with liberal vs conservative, but if I had to pick ONLY ONE of them to be legal, it'd be pot.  Non-addictive = better than addictive.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You are enraged by the so-called mistreatment of Muslim prisoners (who have gained weight while dining on their specially prepared Koran-approved meals) at Guantanamo Bay, but believe the world should have stood idly by while Saddam Hussein filled mass graves.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
They're entirely unrelated.  What we've been doing in Guantanmo is in direct violation of every fundamental law our country was built on.  Moreover, it's disgusting based on the culture we were built on - freedom for everyone, and innocent until proven guilty, right to trial, etc.  It just disgusts me.  Those people SHOULD be held, they're criminals against the US and should be put on trial.  But if the government doesn't have enough of a case to win in court, then they need to be let go.  If it DOES, take them to court, and imprison them legally.  None of this limbo shit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You have found where the right to an abortion is written in the Constitution but cannot find where the Constitution provides for a right to keep and bear arms.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's legal to bear arms, nobody questions that.  The only question is, SHOULD it be?  I'd support limitations on that right - if it took an amendment to do so, FINE.  Abortion isn't in or NOT in the consitution... i don't recall a section where the 10 commandments appear, though our Christian members of society seem to constantly believe it's all IMPLIED or something.  If abortion is murder, where does the constitution say Murder is illegal?  Seems to me it only specifies that congress has the power to make laws which do or don't say that - and there's no law right now for anything except partial-birth abortions, and that's not signed yet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You support campus speech codes that ban pick-up lines and amorous gazes, but never spoke out against President Clinton's physical sexual harassment in the White House.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You can't sexually harass the willing.  Nobody's ever implied Monica was forced to do what she did.  And the overly-PC movement pisses me off, too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You applauded Jimmy Carter for talking about human rights in foreign policy but opposed George W. Bush for doing something about human rights.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's only been in the latest grasping at straws that people have decided this was all a humanitarian mission.  If it'd been sold that way from the beginning, frankly, I'd probably have supported it.  But this statement is rediculous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe that trial lawyers taking 33 to 40 percent of a plaintiff's recovery in lawsuits is just about right, but the federal government taking this amount of our income in taxes is not nearly enough.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Federal Taxes are probably about right, though I do think that those with the absolute extreme level of people with literally THOUSANDS of times more disposable income than they'd ever need should be paying more, not less, as a % of their taxes.  There's an amt of income you need to live, then another layer of what you need to live VERY WELL, and on top of that what you need just in pure accumulation of wealth.  But once you're talking about people making more than a million dollars PER YEAR, EVERY YEAR... if a higher % of taxes means you can't afford to own 9 houses and 16 cars, I'm not feeling bad for you.<br>
<br>
Jury awards need to be capped - seriously - punitive damages are out of control.  That said, if a company acts badly and hurts people, there should be criminal damages - maybe massive FINES equal to today's punitive damages which go straight to a fund to support those effected by the company.  I dunno.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe the former Governor of a New England state with 608,827 people is more than adequately experienced to be President in 2004, but the Governor of a Southwestern state with 21,325,018 people was completely unprepared in 2000.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Dean's not someone I see eye to eye with politically, but it doesn't change the fact that Bush was not even remotely the politician OR goverment worker that Clinton, Bush Sr, or Reagan was.  Gore would have been a far better choice, though he clearly lost on the popularity contest side of things (and I do question how he'd have handled 9/11 and Afghanistan... areas I support Bush on pretty strongly).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe we could get more truth out of the Pentagon if only Don Rumsfeld were replaced by Mohammed Al-Sahhaf.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I don't think Rumsfeld is a liar or is covering things up.  I think he's a warmongering asshole with an agenda that isn't even remotely taking the  best interests of the american people into account.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe evangelical Christians are destroying America but don't feel threatened by the radical Wahabbi sect of Islam.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
One blows up buses, the other abortion clinics.  Extremists of all types frighten me pretty equally.  That said, evangelicals piss me off only because they try to enforce the views of their PERSONAL religion onto others who don't subscribe to that religion.  Branches of Islam doing the same are equally evil in my eyes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-When it comes to violent crime, you believe in hating the crime but loving the criminal.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
See my comments about Texas justice above =P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You support unlimited appeals for convicted criminals, but believe it is undemocratic for Californians to reverse their earlier mistake of electing Gray Davis.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
See above =P and I voted against the recall.  I did my civic duty to oppose the do-over, but my vote lost.  That's how our system works, and I accept that (just like how I accept GWB is a legal president).  I oppose it mainly because of exactly what it was - a whiney &quot;do over&quot;.  The republicans couldn't come up with a decent candidate so Davis won re-election mostly be default - then they came up with a candidate a year later and suddenly its &quot;ooh lets do the election again, we'll win now!&quot;.  That's utter bullshit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe U.S. exports of genetically modified foods pose a greater threat to African nations than corrupt dictators like Zimbabwe's Mugabe.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
No comment here - I think its a stupid issue.  Better food for starving areas is a good thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe welfare is a fundamental human right and workfare is a human rights violation.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I beleive welfare recipients should have to work doing the shittiest labor in society to earn their keep.  Nobody deserves a free ride - I'm all for unemployment, but love the idea that it RUNS OUT.  Here in California, its a big deal to oppose illegal immigrants because they're the ones working the berry fields for $2/day or whatever silliness it is.  I say throw the mexicans out and put the welfare recipients to work for the same wages.  My views are not shared by many californians <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But i've said many times that I despise socialism.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe religion is a scourge on our society, but becoming one with Mother Nature by merging with the universal consciousness and harmonizing with lunar reverberations will save us.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Hippies piss me off.  So do religious zealots. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-You believe President Bush is an environmental criminal for poisoning the water with arsenic, but have never complained about Saddam Hussein's devastating Iraq and Kuwait's environment by setting intentional oil well fires and committing genocide against the Marsh Arabs by draining their wetlands.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I don't see the point here - I certainly don't recall any liberals ever saying what Saddam did wasn't wrong.  That's like saying &quot;You don't agree with Bush's environmental policy, so you must love Hitler&quot;... HUH?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>-Your car sports the bumper sticker saying that &quot;it will be a great day when our schools have all the money they need and the military has to hold bake sales,&quot; but oppose allowing the U.S. military to volunteer recruitment tables on college campuses because of their &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policy.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'm fine with military recruitment, and I think its retarded not to allow gays into the military.  The Don't Ask/Don't Tell policy is a fantastic solution to a difficult problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolvar>Wolvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My third character is Lovawr</span><br>  Posts: 2556<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/8/03 12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=919.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You might be a leftist if....</span><hr size=1> Nobody's gonna read that Tuwene... cept maybe Loegan. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=685611>KoT got me dis' stuff!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 4093<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/8/03 12:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=919.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You might be a leftist if....</span><hr size=1> I heard a great line on cable news this morning when discussing the Kobe case and why he was allowed to play until his trial:<br>

<br>
There is a right to bear arms in the Constitution, any denial of that requires some rather acrobatic intepretation.  However, Flev, you are partially right, The right to bear arms IS tied to a responsibilty to the community, something the gun rights advocates like to ignore.<br>
<br>
The &quot;militia&quot; doesn't refer to a national guard.  That is actually more organized than what the Framer's envisioned.  The militia they were thinking of was the famous Minuteman.  Men taking up arms to defend thier communities.  If you owned a gun, you had a responsibilty to help defend your community.<br>
<br>
Now here is the problem.  This type of militia does not really exist anymore.  So how do you deal with the right to bear arms in todays world.  The right to bear arms is perhaps the only right that was tied in such a direct way to such a responsibility.  <br>
<br>
The National Guard is the closest thing we have to a militia, but it is not the same.  It is an organization of the government, not the community (which the Militia were),  Perhaps we could come up with a lesser form of National Guard, one more tied to the individual communities than the National Guard is.   There is a place for it.  All communites at one time or another face situations that overwhelm local manpower, particularly natural disasters of one type or another.  <br>
<br>
I think it might not be a bad idea to tie gun ownership to such an organization.  That would again tie the right to bear arms to a responsibilty to the local community. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Outrider of Karana</font><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

I also have no problems with guns except for handguns....  Rifles, shotguns, etc I think can be used for sport shooting or hunting etc..  Although handguns can be used for sport shooting, I really think the only thing they are truly useful for is concealing on your person and shooting someone at close range.  So my stance on gun control is, ban handguns ^_^  A very unpopular view I must admit but eh, oh well.<br>

You say that like its a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Say your wife/sister/cousin/friend is being stalked.  Do you want to force them to carry around a shotgun everywhere they go?  Or would a handgun they can conceal in a purse so that they can live a normal life while still being protected from the wackos out there be a better solution?<br>
