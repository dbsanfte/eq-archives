This term has been bandied about by politically correct sicophants who think that this word really exists.<br>
<br>
Their moronic explaination is this<br>
<br>
White man discriminates against a Black man, it is racism<br>
<br>
Black man discriminates against a White man, it is reverse racism<br>
<br>
I AM SORRY, wrong, its still racism, racism is a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.<br>
<br>
Discrimination is Discrimination, there is no reverse shit added to it, no reverse sexism. <br>
<br>
Why does this weird term exist? Because of the belief that racism only occurs to a particular set of people, usually african americans in america, and that sexism only happens to a particular happens to women. It has become ingrained in us that only one set of people or sex can experience these problems so much so that when it happens opposite of what is the norm, it is coined reverse. Sorry but that only furthers this ingrained belief which is wrong.<br>
<br>
Personally, I dont understand black history month, for one month out of twelve, we highlight the accomplishments of one of the many races of our world? It only helps to divide us.<br>
<br>
I dont understand how Black Power is acceptable, but White Power is awful thing. To be proud to be black is a good thing, to be proud to be white sounds like you are from the Klan. I dont get this.<br>
<br>
I dont understand racial quotas, forced diversity is unfair and only helps to promote a welfare mentality and lowers the standards.<br>
<br>
I was watching Ricki Lake on the tv in my computer room during a raid the other night, glancing over I notice the program title. Are white women better for black men? I watch the ignorant morons discussing this topic. I listen as I hear the crowd cheer as a black woman says how black men should date a black queen and not some white trailer trash slut. Isnt that a racist statement? Why is it when a white man says this, it suddenly becomes racist and bigoted? Isnt that a double standard?<br>
<br>
I personally believe that we should embrace the differences in each other. Maybe one day we will treat skin color and sex with no real meaning, because truthfully, it doesnt make that huge of a difference. Skin color, hair thickness, face shape is all part of the environment shaping.<br>
<br>
You want an example of this, nordic european people whose backgrounds are from cold regions have thin noses to insure that heat is not lost when taking in air, their skin is light because of the low ammount of sunlight. Take someone from africa, its hot and dry, their nasal cavatives are enlarged to allow for higher air flow in hot dry air, to insure the body gets enough oxygen. Their skin is dark as a natural reaction to the sun, it helps deal with the heat. Curly hair in your family is often the result of a sea fairing people who lived dry hot dusty places. Races arent really races to me, its more like a yer genetic set up to handle the enviroment. Eventually our bodies will change, as people from different regions mix more and more we will see bodies change to fit the climate, the only difference is, we have evolved to such a point we can control our climate and exposure to sun, so our bodies dont have to genetically re-adjust as fast.<br>
<br>
Just curious why we are so intent on make seperations and pointing our differences like they are bad, its part of our genetic material, part of the most perfect machine ever, the human body. <p><center>

It comes form the more conservitive area of our political landscape.<br>
<br>
While I don't like the word (it is misused to much)  It can best be defined as relating to the unintended effect of certain policies that are meant to correct previous discrimination. <br>
<br>
Quotas and other more extreme affirmative action policies meant ONLY to correct past discrimination often unitentionally cause discrimination towards others that did not really suffer from discrimination before.  THAT is why the term &quot;reverse&quot; was added.  In that very narrow context, involveing institutions, (not people per say) it does make sense, but like a lot of loaded terms it is abused very badly.  <br>
<br>
The reason there is a difference between &quot;black power&quot; and &quot;white power&quot; is that they mean very different things, beyond just the difference in race.  Both terms are raceist to one extent or another.  However, &quot;White power&quot;' most common basic premise is to keep &quot;whites&quot; in a superior position in society.  It is not always violent but usually is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Black power&quot; has its extremist versions, BUT the majority who profess it, while militant, are not seeking to put thier race in a superior position, only equal, though they often believe in racial seperation nearly as much as some of the &quot;white power&quot; groups.  However, while not as prone to race violence as &quot;white power&quot; groups, they are still quite capable of being violent at times.<br>
<br>
Balck History month (like Women's History month) was created to highlight events that involved minorites in this country that were often overlooked.   I don't think it devides us.  You have to remeber that our history is still VERY &quot;white male&quot; in its makeup.  Most of this is because that is the simple truth of our history, BUT there were contributions made by minorities that have not been given enough attention.<br>
<br>
Oh and in the end, it is very much human nature to look for 'differences.'   It is a legacy of our tribal past when anyone NOT from your tribe was a threat.  It is in our bones.   We still have a long way to go to overcome that instinct, but we have also made a lot of progress.  Especially in the last century(the Holocaust being the most notable exception)  We will get there, the smaller the world is and the easier travel gets the better it helps.<br>
<br>
We are not there yet, and till we are we will have to deal with our differences, while trying to eventually get past them.<br>

<br>
Locally, there's been a call for harsher sentences for people that use the N word.  I'd link the article form the paper here, but our paper charges heavily to link archived news.<br>
<br>
In summary, there was a white guy who called a black woman the N word out of his window.  She called a cop and raised hell, he got 30 days in jail and 500 in fines.  Then she went to the local NAACP chapter, they got on the wagon and it made the news.  Now they are making headway for a harsher penalty.<br>
<br>
Funny, but in all that was read this just concerns the N word.  They want to raise the penalty for using the N word specifically and nothing more.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to think we're making progress, but the minorities are trying every manuever possible to increase the rift.  Without the rift, they are no longer minorities.  If they are equal, then they will have to become responsible for their actions without the crutch excuse they have now.  The rift is their tool.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
I have black friends that think that any penalty for using the N word is a joke, and that the actions of the above are astonishingly stupid.  So this only applies to the &quot;voice&quot; of the black community here, not the individuals. <p><br><br><br><br><center><img src="http://home.dejazzd.com/tombern/Personal/Jeffs/Enzo2.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uradgen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Radgen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 8:10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/Radgen5.jpg height=150 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There is no such thing as reverse racism</span><hr size=1> Bah!!

Discrimination - Black man can't get a job, because he's discriminated against for being black.<br>
<br>
Reverse Discrimination - White man can't get a job, because at current quota, they must hire a black guy.<br>

He did not BEAT the man...He didnt shove a plunger in his ass, he poped him on the lip.<br>
<br>
Sorry two of my friends were punched by cops for being smart asses. They knew they deserved it but the wanted to be a smart ass anyway. Crying opresion every time is like crying wolf...People are getting tired of it and its starting to show. <br>

I agree with DM as well, reverse racism is the most sensless term I have seen yet. Perhaps someday if we ever find alien life we will finnaly see past our own diffrences :P. But until we find green men I dont think it will happen.<br>

You do not hit someone once they are in handcuffs and under control.  Police are only allowed to use force to gain control.  So what is the kid was mouthing off.  If YOU hit someone mouthing off you would be charged with assault too 9in most cases.  Police are given the power to use force in order to do thier jobs.  BUT they cannot use force more than needed to control a situation.   Beyond that they are under the same rules as the rest of us.<br>
<br>
In anycase, the incident with the 'N' word has less to do with race relations and more to do with the tendency of a lot of people believeing that anything that offends them should be made illegal.  This has no particualr political flavor to it.  It shows up in conservatives and liberals alike.  It is also not restricted to race issues by any stretch of the imagination.<br>
<br>
I do find it hard to believe that they were able to charge the guy for JUST saying the 'N' word.  Speech, even hate speech (as long as you are not actually solicitating criminal actions) is protected by the 1st admendment.<br>
<br>
Political Correctness, like a lot of things, started out as a generally mild and reasonable.  There were terms and words that were in common usage that we are better off without.  However being the good Americans that we are, we have taken it entirely too far.<br>

Ever see a guy in handcuffs? Yah just cause his hands are behind his back does not mean hes not dangerous. And even tho there were 3 cops there it takes an incredible amount of force to keep another human down...Anyone who has wrestled knows what I am speaking of.<br>
<br>
Grapling with another person may very well be the most exauhsting thing somone can do. It was hot outside and  those cops had been strugling to get that guy in the freaking car for a while. One cop poped him one to subdue him. They did not &quot;beat&quot; him. In the end what he did was most likley safer then the strugle to the car would have been.<br>
<br>
But like anyone would do...He will use his ace in the hole to get out of jail and perhaps sue the police force.Wich I must say just about anyone would do given the option. Most people just think its getting really old that this man who broke a law, will probably get off because in his strugle against the officers he got a fat lip. I hope the judge laughs at him and tells him to put some ice on it you'll be fine in an hour. <br>

It should focus on good things done by black people, and reinforce that in the black community...my opinion though <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/02 4:59:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There is no such thing as reverse racism</span><hr size=1> Sol, popping someone to calm him down, doesn't work. =)  Popping someone one, to get them subdued, doesn't work.

<br>
The way this works is not discrimination from another point of view but a kind of overcompensation.<br>
<br>
What happens is a person with discriminatory beliefs, not wanting to appear as such, exhibits discriminatory behaviour in exactly the oppostie manner as you would expect. For example, a person covering negative beliefs about women (or just trying to avoid being branded as sexist) in the workforce might be more lenient towards women and more exacting of male employees.<br>
<br>
I don't think I've explained this very well but hopefully you get the idea.  <p><table width = 200 border = 0>

<br>
Funny you should mention that, theres a few theories about the origin of discrimination, and the experts are still out on it.<br>
<br>
In 1954 Allport put forward what became known as the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Historical / Cultural Theory</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that says that we gather these beliefs from those around us and hence it tends to be passed from generation to generation and can become ingrained in a society's character (racial and religious tensions in the Middle East is a great example of this). <br>
<br>
The theory is a great account of the transference and robustness of discriminatory beliefs but kind of fails to pass the chicken and the egg test - is a great method of describing how discrimination and prejudice is transferred, but a bit weak in pointing out a source.<br>
<br>
Levine and Campbell's Realistic Conflict Theory (1972) is pretty much what was described above. Competition for resources drives discrimination. Combined with Historical / Cultural theory its not a bad answer to the question of why modern day prejudice exists.<br>
<br>
Taifel and some others around 1971 came up with the In-Group Favouritism Theory though which says that its just an inbuilt sheep mentality - people just like each other in the same group more. There have been studies showing this effect even when groups were made up of cross-cultural mixes. Its considered a bit weak though because it describes the effect of discrimination but fails to provide a real reason for the underlying behaviour.<br>
<br>
There's a couple of other ideas floating about too. Park and Rothbart in '82 came up with the Out-Group Homogeneity Bias idea which says we think everyone in opposing groups lacks definition and &quot;all look and act the same&quot;. This is definetly true of a lot of prejudicial behaviour and stereotyping, and combined with the Illusory Correlation Theory of Hamilton and Gifford (1976) which says we tend to overestimate the pairing of rare events (specific minority groups performing specific crimes) we will then tend to project this against the entirety of the homogeneic mass of peopel from the same background.<br>
<br>
I personally think the theories sort of work together in forming a very complex set of behaviours that makes up prejudice. The bottom line though is that if the behaviour while arguably once beneficial to tribal goons is really destructive to modern society. <p><table width = 200 border = 0>

<br>
In the movies the cop would have hit him once and he would have been knocked out :P. In all seriousness tho anyone who has ever wrestled knows how exhausting it is to grapple with somone else. I can subdue somone much easier with a quick punch then I can with even the best holds. It doesnt work quite like in the movies but if you are holding a man down and you pop him a good one in the face you will see your fist is amazingly more effective <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Also subdueing somone does not mean knocking them out. Most people will stop putting up a fight if every time they do someone is going to rock their jaw :P.<br>
<br>
Also in the movies people like rocky can take 40 right hands to the face and still say bring it. But anyone who watches a real boxing match knows most knockouts look like nothing more then taps that just happened to hit in the right place. <br>
<br>
btw Jas I agree The Rodney king tape was so cut and copied for the manipulation of the masses it was almost shamefull.<br>

Boxers know this, there's a huge blood vein in your jaw and if you hit it right and with enough force, it'll cut down the blood flow to yer noodle and make you pass out.<br>
<br>
Body shots make several blood vessels constrict  and slow bloodflow down over time, making you weaker in the legs.<br>
<br>
Other punches can cause alot of pain, but pain releases alot of adrenalin and that far from subdues...<br>

Rocky Marciano was famous for hitting guys in the upper arms alot,  and eventually making them unable to keep there hands up high, hehe.

Is a staright punch on the bottom of his jaw....Unlike your fight when a man is being held down he can not move his head back or in any way midigate the force of the punch. A punch delivered like that is amazingly effective...Its why wrestlers use thier elbows and knees when breaking holds. The tiny hits that dont break the rules help wear down and subdue.<br>
<br>
BTW it worked....After he got punched he put his head down and was alot easier to handle....Have somone hold you and hold ur head into place...Even if somone half your size poped you really hard you would be seeing stars...Your head snapping back during a punch takes off alot of force.<br>
<br>
btw head locks rock...They are illigal in wrestling and cops dont use them very often because they have a tedency to kill your oponent :P. But yes they are probably one of the most effective ways of subduing somone cutting off someones air supply will have them docile in about a minute. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usolovey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solovey</A> at: 7/23/02 8:43:19 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=181.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=181.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=19><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.threadControl?topicID=181.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=181.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm33">Spell Traders<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm40">Tribunal Tradeskills<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36>Reality Sinks In</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
