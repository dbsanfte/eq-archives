<br>
His little voice told him so, even started to scream it at him. The little voice told had many good points, but he was soon gagged and taken off to the recesses of Solufein's subconciousness.<br>
<br>
It was midnight in Freeport, and Solufein was sneaking into the Sisters Guildhall.<br>
<br>
He had fallen asleep on the boat and had ended up sailing back and forth between Faydwer and Antonica a few times already before waking up. He had stood up Krystarn and also left his Brother Wardenn to hunt without him.<br>
<br>
Solufein had arrived at the docks of Freeport again, exhausted and feeling shameful. As usual when he was in the area he was planning to head off into the Commonlands to make his camp in a Kodiak cave he commonly used when in the area. It was then that Solufein's foolish thought process kicked in. The Sisters Guildhall was in Freeport...Krystarn might be there, and do you really want to wake up with 600 pounds of smelly Kodiak making it's bed on top of you?<br>
<br>
So it was, that Solufein found himself garbed in black leathers, sneaking as quietly as a whisper through the dormatory of the Sisters Guildhall.<br>
<br>
He sniffed the air as he crept, catching familiar scents in the air. Nysa was here..she commonly smelled of holy oils and incense. Mirabor smelled of many different herbs and...Krystarn...who smelled of the seabreeze off of the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
He found her room and found the door unlocked. Easing the door open, he cast a quick spell to dispell any magical wards and crept in, shutting the door silently behind him. He stood there for many moments unmoving, assuring that her breathing was regular and that she was truely asleep.<br>
<br>
When he was certain, he crept  over and knelt at the side of her bed. He gazed upon her sleeping face and smiled. She looked just as beatiful as ever, her face was serene and peaceful, her mouth was open a bit and he could see a line of drool trailing down her cheek which made his smile widen. She shifted a little, smiling and placing her hand near her face. He looked upon the glowing velium ring he had given her.<br>
<br>
He had originally intended the ring to be an engagement ring, for Solufein, ever impulsive, had asked for her hand in marriage. She had been afraid, it was then that she pointed out something that Solufein had neglected to realize. He was 145 years old, nearing 146 in a couple days, while she was barely 20. Solufein was still young for an elf, but he had been around during the time of Krystarn's grandparents, and that unnerved her. She had said no to his proposal, and feared him angry, but Solufein could never be angry with her. He kissed her tenderly, and bid her take the ring as a symbol of his love for her.<br>
<br>
Wardenn had once pointed out something that Solufein had come to realize lately,  now that he knew he truely loved Krystarn. He would not age, and she would begin to wither away before him. More and more he realized that he wished Krystarn had his longevity, or that he could give up his long life to live his days out with the woman he so deeply loved.<br>
<br>
He warded these thoughts away, best to live in the present, and not dwell on the future. He looked upon Krystarn lovingly and stroked her warm cheek. She smiled slightly under his touch yet remained asleep. Solufein turned away briefly to remove something from his pack, a bundle of Marr Cherries he had gathered for her on Sister Isle. He placed them in a bowl on the table in her room, and onced more turned to face her sleeping form.<br>
<br>
The little impulsive voice spoke to him again and he found himself stripping off most of his black leather clothing and tossing it to the floor. Clad only in his breeches, Solufein lifted the covers and eased himself into the bed with Krystarn ever so carefully. He worked his arms in an embrace around her and kissed her open mouth softly. <br>
<br>
&quot; I love you Krystarn...more than anything in the world.&quot; Solufein whispered softly. She cooed softly and snuggled into a more comfortable position in his arms. Solufein held her long into the night before sleep finally overtook him<br>

Behind me sitting around their huts are the fishermen getting ready for the morning, a few eye me but they leave me alone.  <br>
<br>
Looking back to the city, I wonder how long it will take Solufein to wake up.  He startled me this morning when I woke up in his arms… it was so comfortable though… so warm.  I know he will find me, he is good at that tracking stuff and I wasn’t very quiet when I left though I tried my best so he could sleep longer.<br>
<br>
I look at the ring he gave me, it so pretty and it feels so good to have on my finger.  I sigh.  Solufein is so different than what I am used to here.  I wish mother where here now…<br>
<br>
Looking out over the sea I shudder.  I hate the sea, I hate it.  I wrap my arms around my knees and wait for the sun to rise.<br>

He had awoken late thism orning to find Krystarn had gone but her warmth had not. He could have easily tracked her down but decided to take a stroll outside of Freeport <br>
<br>
He snuck back out of the Hall and let his feet take him to the desert. He had not bothered to dress himself, the gentle sea breeze combined with the searing desert wind felt good on his bare chest and back.<br>
<br>
Perhaps unconcsiously, his walk had taken him to the outskirts of the barbarian fishing village. looking up, he saw Krystarn sitting on the shore.<br>
<br>
He quietly walked up to her, sitting down and wrapping his arms around her. He did not feel the need for words, he simply held her close and nuzzled her neck as the sun rose over the tranquil sea.<br>

I don’t know why they didn’t and when I asked her that once, she said that people don’t like being forced from their homes, even in bad times.”<br>
<br>
“Once, I got caught by some of the Militia.  I think they knew me cause they argued with my dad over the fine.  I guess he paid cause they let me go finally.  I was so scared, they kept me under the arena and it smelled awful.  There were people in some other cells, they looked so hurt and some would just lay there.  The guards ignored me until my dad showed up, then they yelled at me a few times before he walked in.”<br>

&quot;Krystarn, you know I don't expect you to act any certain way with me. I am happy just being with you, holding you brings a center to my life that I have never had before.&quot;<br>

Solufein awoke quietly, Krystarn had her back pressed against his chest and his arms were wrapped around her. He buried his face in her soft auburn tresses and inhaled deeply. They had been growing closer over the past few days, after her being gone at the Tmple for over a week. They had spent the day hunting a little bit, but much of it was spent simply talking or holding eachother.<br>
<br>
He had rather pleasant memories from the day...laying together wrapped up in her warm cloak on the windswept tundra of the Great Divide, her kisses, her smile as she ran her hands through his bluish gray hair. Sitting on the railing at the docks at Freeport, speaking of their pasts, closing their eyes and hugging close while the breeze blew in from the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
They had eventualy gone to the wedding of Jaranna to Vivienne and Daninglight. Solufein had originonally had no intention of attending the unholy ceremony, but Krystarn had promised to her Sister that she would go. Solufein went to protect Krystarn. Solufein had sat their stoicly, not reacting to it all, he simply held Krystarn close. Everything had been fine until Mizzery began the bloodletting ceremony. He had not noticed it at first, a slight tingling in his Teir'dal blood. Then his eyes began to glow with a lavander fire, he had felt the dark magic of the Hate Prince in the ceremony. He had tried not to show it, though he could not help but grip Krystarn tighter and graze her shoulder with his teeth, which he quickly covered with a kiss.<br>
<br>
The ceremony had gone interrupted and Solufein and Krystarn had both left, he hoped she had not noticed his burning eyes as they sailed back to the Sisters Hall.<br>
Exhausted, they had both settled into slumber rather quickly, sharing warmth long into the night.<br>
<br>
The moon reflected the flickering lavender flame in Solufein's eyes still, he touched the scars on his neck for a moment and remembered the one who had left those marks. Solufein kissed Krystarn's shoulder and buried his face to sleep in her soft auburn tresses.<br>
