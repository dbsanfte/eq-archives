<br>
That is because the Old Testament people were under the old law. When Jesus died on the cross for our sins he did away with old law and we are no longer bound by it. (Unless you are Jew, then you use the Old Testament since they deny the validity of the New Testament.) <p><br>

<br>
Christians pick and choose out of the Bible. Muslims pick and choose out of the Koran. Budhists pick and choose out of the hundreds of texts they have.<br>
<br>
Sadly, 99.99% of people who follow a religion is probably considered deviant or heretic by other members of their own religion. How many times have you made fun of Jahova's Witnesses? They are a Christian sect. Oh?  You don't recognize them? Who gave you the right to decide? <br>
<br>
Let's face it. Throughout human history religions adapted to changes in human society in order to survive. Ask yourself, how much has Christianity changed since its conception? Ask the same about each and every religion still in existance today.<br>
<br>
Then think about how many hundreds of religions that had long since died out because their failuar to adapt to change in human society.<br>
<br>
It apears that religions themselves follow a pattern illustrated in the theory of evolution. Adapt, or die. <p><BR>

<br>
Please back this up with biblical reference, I have my handy I couldn't find it.  The best I have seen is jokes about this, but I don't actually remember reading it.  But I must be honest, I don't by any stretch of the word claim to be an old testament scholar.<br>
<br>
I have to agree that a lot of Christian people here have expressed Non-Christian views.  It makes me sad but I don't think they're bad people.  If I were to tell you that I live my life completely and totally in the way that Christ has told us to, I'd be outright lying to you.  We all mess up.  The point of the religion is basically to try to mess up less... ideally it's to never mess up but basically in my opinion it's impossible.<br>
<br>
But I do have to say that a lot of times Christians do things that stop the spread of the religion.  If you are to look at early Christianity, it spread REALLY fast comparatively to other religions.  Scholars have traced this to a few things - Early Christians were generally nicer and had &quot;no respect for personal property&quot;, that is, the lived basically in commune style living.  People saw them as nice and content and living what they believed.  I can't really say that this is true today.<br>
<br>
You can bring up the Crusades, you can bring up the Roman Catholic Church not standing up to Hitler, you can list off a number of atrocities that have been committed in the name of Christ.  I say I'm sorry for this.  The actions in these particular events were so anti-Christian that it smacks of Hypocracy, and I think you are very valid in questioning Christianity for them.  The Pope has appologized.  I could come up with a variety of reasons as to why this should be forgiven ranging from I'm not a Catholic, you can't name a lot my church has done aside from be pro-slavery during the Civil war, to the fact that America slaughtered Native Americans for land and our country isn't held to the same accountability.  But in the end it would be sort of self defeating.  Early Christians really messed up with a lot of the things they did.  It was totally wrong, from the homogenization of South American Native Populaces, to the slaughter of Arabic peoples in the Holy Lands, these were all clearly wrong.  They are wrong by the teachings of the bible.  They were wrong at the time and are wrong now.  I won't defend them, in fact as a Christian I will bring up that I do think these were unChristian actions, and I think they will suffer the consequences for them at judgement.<br>
