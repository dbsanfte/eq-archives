<br>
I have been curious, for I've seen it posted a few other times, just what the TRUE History of Shortman Nightslayer is.  I have recieved various answers to just what happened to him, and I never knew the &quot;Original&quot; Shortman myself. I know only the LAST 3 Owners of Shortman, 2 of which only had him a short time, and the Last of which just ended up locking up the account.  I will give further info on them later, but for now, I want to know the Beginning of Shortman. Call me curious, but it's something that has been eating at me for a long time, and yeah, i know where Shorty is right now, I can tell ya exactly how it ENDED, just not how it started.<br>
<br>
If you think i'm askin for Flames, you're wrong. I'm askin for history, to satisfy my own desire to know his past, for my own reasons.  If you want to post Flames, go attack Ryn or Estevan on the flameboards some more, I'm not interested.<br>
<br>
Thanks and I appreciate any info (useful) that I get as responses here.<br>
<br>
Respectfully<br>

<br>
Yeah, it sort of is a &quot;Fishing Expedition&quot; in a way....I'm just lookin for a little more info on something I know alot about. I know the Ending to the Shortman drama, but not the beginning.  I will fill EVERYONE in on what happened to him and as to his finallity, but I want the info on why he was considered so &quot;Disreputible&quot; to begin with.  I've seen the &quot;Shortbay E-Man&quot; posts and other demeaning remarks, but never the story behind them.<br>
<br>
If i could get just ONE post or reply that gives me any useful info as to his history and roots, I would be happy.  And once I get His history, I think i will finish off his lifespan on this board. I knew Shortman, who he was, and who he became, not as a char, but as the people BEHIND the char.....just want to clear a few things up, but gotta know the whole story first.<br>
<br>
If anyone can give me....even the simplest, short story, get to the jist of it, kind of background on him....I would appreciate it VERY much so.<br>
<br>
Thank You in advance....<br>

They were effectively using EV as a source of personal income.<br>
<br>
Nobody outside of a few folks like Rynnia(probably, he seems to manage to know every ebay transaction that happens on this server) really knew who was doing it - they were using twinks for delivery, etc, but my understanding is that (like Rynnia) they were making quite a good 'living'.<br>
<br>
At some point post-kunark and post-epics, for reasons I can't even possibly guess at, Shortman decided he was done with EQ, or at least with E/V and his Ebay business.  The character went up for sale (without a name, of course), and I think many people were caught by surprise, as he'd been one of the more high-profile &quot;original&quot; E/V crew, ala Steele, Crush, etc.<br>
<br>
That's the &quot;gossip&quot; version, only what I picked up over the years from hearing stuff and reading the old trib boards on everlore and Talamay's board.  I'd expect an old-time E/V member at this point to reply with a &quot;yeah, that's close enough to what happened&quot; or a &quot;no, not really.&quot;  But I think that's the high-level history! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dextromethorphanhydrobromide>DextroMethorphan hydrobromide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/11/03 8:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2522.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> anyone have a link to the original trib board?  the one before Talamay's.

<br>
Shortman was THE cleric of EV. He was who I wanted to be when I grew up. He was one of the original EV members. As in when it originated. Bigtime as Steele, Magnom, Crush, Khal, Minng &amp; Boggs.<br>
<br>
This is back when ebay was considered fucking horrible. Sure we flame people about it now, but nothing like how it was. Most everything was droppable. It seemed so much harder to get a truly badass shit. I imagine because of the lower number of mobs and items. So ebay was bad right? And EV hated it, mainly because our chief opponent at the time had a lot of ebay controversy around them &amp; it was an easy punch to hit them with.<br>
<br>
Like Tuwene said, the dude ended up turning out to be an ebayer. Sure we had ebayers before, and some even worse, but Shortman was such a respected leader of EV that it was a massive fucking blow. Like the shit storm when FOH #2 guy ebayed.<br>
<br>
Shortman was shit, but nothing was worse than the shit Sadre pulled. But that my little child is a story for another day.<br>
<br>
Also there was not a Tribunal board before Talamay's. Unless you are thinking of Everlore.

<br>
Ok, I started it, and I've got basically what I expected.  Now to tell you where he went after the first &quot;Shortman&quot; persona left.  I dont' know the original buyer, but I DO know it was someone already playin on this server, and frequently.  From that person, I assume he transferred account owners at least 2 more times before MY history with him starts.  I know of the identity of ONE owner before I attained him, and I know at least 1 other person that &quot;Drove&quot; him for awhile, but I'll leave them anon, for the sake of thier own Reputations. I know they never &quot;Purchased&quot; Shortman, they were handed him just as I was handed him.  <br>
<br>
That's right, I owned Shortman last.  He was handed to me from a guildmate in the guild of WWC, or White Wolf Clan for any of you who haven't been around long enough to remember them.  We haven't been a guild for a LONG LONG time, but alot of old timers remember us.  We were a good guild to start people off, but we never reached the post Naggy/Vox raids except for later on with KoT. But that's all a different story, back to Shortman.....I attained him one day when the last owner decided &quot;they&quot; didn't want to play the game anymore.  They were leaving EQ, and gave away most everything they owned.  Shortman went to the guild, as a gift, and since I was a friend of this benevolent person, and I was one of very few people online in the guild at the time, the info was passed to me, and I started his account anew, taking over payments.  <br>
<br>
I played Shortman for prolly about 9 months total, he wasn't my Main, simply a &quot;Guild Cleric&quot; that I used on occasional raids for rezz's or &quot;Uber&quot; heals and such.  I got to like playin him, and TRIED to re establish his name as one of honesty and good will.  I started something I personally liked calling &quot;Drive By Rezzing&quot; where whenever I saw a dead body, i would automatically do a /who all and ask if they wanted an epic rezz, I'd then rezz them, heal em and run off.  <br>
<br>
I recieved TONS of tells calling me all sorts of names, and eventually I tired of EQ altogether, and I retired.  Someone decided they weren't happy with me quiting, or saw opportunity knocking, and proceded to hack my computer, I lost not only the Shortman account, but 2 other accounts in the doing.  I got the passwords reset on 2 of those, but Shortman was lost forever, and my other 2 accounts were stripped down to nothing, my Original Main, Lazarux, still remains nearly Nekkid.  I've retired him permanently, and started Reptylle.  He is my current main, and will remain my &quot;Main&quot; until I tire of him, or quit the game.<br>
<br>
I started this thread to give a finallity to the character of Shortman, for those that hated him, be happy, for those that got rezzed by him, I'm glad I could help at times.  I also wanted it to be known that at least 2 owners of Shortman, Myself and the owner before me, Never paid a cent for the char or any of his gear. When i recieved him, he had only his Planar gear (Hate) and like Donals Guants, Boots and Arms....the rest was gone.  I also wanted you all to know who he was in the end, and just kinda put an end to the speculation of what finally happened to him, I'm not sure if the original owner reset the passwords and resold him, or deleted him, or he's just sitting in someones computer collecting dust, I just know the last time I had him, and what I tried to do.<br>
<br>
I'm not wanting flamed for any of this, or lookin for sympathy or awe or any other bullshit, just kinda putting a bit more into the books as official history, if that is what you all want to call it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for yer time, and I'm still playin, if ya have any questions, or can fill me in on the lost time between the initial Sale and the time when he was given to me, just call me Curious.<br>
<br>
Respectfully, <br>

Back in the day we both gave eachother enough grief.  No need to push that more than it already was. <br>
<br>
I did that to Serine after a good month long mess of ebay flames and having to deal with the BS he tossed out, and then finding his character on ebay.   Guy was a huge hypocrite.  Not that that warrants posting of RL info but... you live and learn.<br>
<br>
I don't believe I have posted anyone else's RL information beyond a RL name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Far as Shortman goes, I really have no idea if he was part of some ebay crime ring or whatnot, although he was chewing through 300 items a month back then which was far more than any one person or even two people could run through.  Talking high end things also.  Cloak of flames, sebilite croaking dirk, sibilisian cloaks, heiro cloaks, kunark armors etc etc.   High end stuff back then, and considering a cloak of flames could fetch $8000 (yes, no joke) back pre kunark, extremely profitable.<br>
<br>
The reason I question whether or not he was an outlet for some of the others was merely because many of the others had their own ebay names and their own auctions.  The upper echelon of EV (mostly E) had a good percentage who did actively Ebay or at least dabbled in it from time to time.  The only one I know of that Ebayed considerably and still plays, is Dredd.  But who the heck knows who plays that guy anymore.<br>
<br>
And of course I kept up on it all.  Back before Kunark when I was still doing this, I kept tabs on competition much like anyone would with a business.   That is all it was, and I took the time to know each and every one of my competitors if possible.  It was easy enough to ask a customer &quot;hey I see you bought from XXXX.... what was their name if you don't mind me asking?&quot;  Shortly before Kunark I stopped and got out of it all, so much that went on in that world after that I really have no idea on beyond helping a few people track down a couple scammers.<br>
<br>
I also know the original purchaser of Shortman, and I'm sure that information is kicking around somewhere although it has slipped from my memory.  It was someone I had spoken with on the phone pre-kunark.  A customer back then in WWC.  Female half elf ranger comes to mind.  Mid to high level.  After that my crystal ball goes a bit fuzzy  : P  This individual may have been the second purchaser of Shortman as well and not the first.  I just remember them sending me a tell from Shortman one day and telling me about their &quot;new cleric.&quot;  It was highly amusing.<br>
<br>
Anyways, again, I never posted Crush's RL info. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2522.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2522.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2522.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2522.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2522.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2522.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2522.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org/">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br> <!-- .. -->
