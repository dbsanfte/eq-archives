Bushit. That is the right wing propaganda machine that you are a part of. Were all the protestors during the course of the Vietnam war unpatriotic? Nevermind, I already got your answer. Looking back, who was right - the protestors or the government? Who lied about death counts? Who candy coated the progress? Who held our hand telling us we were going to win?<br>
<br>
I don't care if you are registered as a democrat, because it is about as meanignful as my being registered as a republican. The shit you spew is just to intimidate and shame those who oppose this war into silence.<br>
<br>
The country I live in is has been kept in bounds by the voice of dissention. Without it, the government would run amuk and do as it damn well pleased... much like it is in Iraq despite all the warnings and all the global protest.<br>
<br>
True Americans don't seek to supress any opinion. True patriots don't try to silence opposing views by using intimidating labels.<br>

YOU are the one tied to a party.  That is quite obvious by the context of EVERY FUCKING ONE OF YOUR POSTS.  Why do you think everyone discounts everything you say as irrelevant?  Why do you think people call you Monica??<br>
<br>
Looking back on Vietnam, it depends on your definition of wrong.  The protestors actions during the war and their treatment of our soldiers were inexcuseably unpatriotic.  The governement's decision to involve themself in that war was a mistake in my opinion.  That does NOT justify the unpatriotic actions of the protestors.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to intimidate anyone into silence.  Why would my opinion that you are a piece of shit intimidate you in any way??  I am not trying to shame anyone into silence.  The shame you feel when I call you unpatriotic is your own feelings and sometimes the truth hurts.<br>
<br>
The country you live in has been kept in bounds by the voice of unity you stupid fuck.  Yes, there is dissenssion, yes there is difference of opinion, yes there is debate, UNTIL A DECISION IS REACHED.  ... and then, there is fucking unity.<br>
<br>
What bothers me is the fact that every Fucking word out of your mouth is either anti-Bush or Pro-Clinton.  What you fail to understand is that BUSH IS THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICA.  You cannot be anti-Bush and not be anti-US in the extreme that you are.  You cannot SUPPORT something when every word out of your mouth criticizes the leadership of it. <br>
<br>
You didn't find me whining about the presidents I didn't care for.  You didn't find me ceaselessly criticizing everything about them and their administration.  You actually have NO FUCKING IDEA what I think of Bush as a president.  What you do know is that I support my country and I support the decisions of the leadership of this country.  I may not always agree with them, but I support them.  Once again... cuz yer fucking stupid... support IS NOT ENDLESS CRITICISM.<br>
<br>
I have NOT mindlessly parroted the virtues of this war.  What I have done is criticized you for not shutting the fuck up and supporting the decision YOUR country made.  Supporting the decision to go to war is different than agreeing with the decision to go to war, are you too fucking stupid to understand that??<br>

<br>
I agree 100% on the treatment of our soldiers. They were following orders and alot of them were drafted. I would never -NEVER- disrespect those who serve. I do have every right however, to disrespect the leaders who make the decisions when I believe those decisions are bad for MY country. That's right, this is my country too, so stop acting like the only people who have a right to be here are hawks that can't wait to send our troops to kill citizens of a foreign country on their own soil when they have made no aggressive moves against us.<br>
<br>

<br>
You are such a hypocrite. Using the label of unpatriotic is just a cowards tactic when they don't want to argue the issues.<br>
<br>
Anyone who calls a person unpatriotic just because they have an opinion that is in opposition of this war is either a fanatic or a coward... and I would bet it's the latter 90% of the time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The country you live in has been kept in bounds by the voice of unity you stupid fuck.

<br>
<br>
Bushit. I repeat - were all the protestors who showed opposition to the war after it started un-American? FUCK NO! It was their opposition that caused us to finally pull out after a massive loss of life for NOTHING.<br>
<br>
Without opposition the President will look at the numbers and see what he considers to be support (or indifference) and continue on his merry way. If the numbers drop enough he pulls out to avoid political ruin.<br>
<br>
That is democracy in action and it is absolutely pro-American to do so.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What bothers me is the fact that every Fucking word out of your mouth is either anti-Bush or Pro-Clinton.

<br>
Bullshit. I supported Bush 100% in Afghanistan. I thought he handled it wisely and decisively. He had a coalition and we had global support unlike any other time in history.<br>
<br>
It's his actions since then that have earned him my contempt, such as the &quot;shock and anger&quot; strategy on foreign affairs. His spend the surplus and drop us into a HUGE deficit on the economic front and still insisting on tax cuts to further deepen that deficit. It's his Doctrine of Pre-emptive Strikes on any country who he happens to label as terrorist and his complete and utter indifference to global opinion.<br>
<br>
I don't give a fuck if a president is republican or democrat, but I sure as hell care what he does if it hurts MY country.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> have NOT mindlessly parroted the virtues of this war. What I have done is criticized you for not shutting the fuck up and supporting the decision YOUR country made.

<br>
Bushit. Supporting the troops is not supporting the war and if opposition to this Iraqi fiasco will bring them home faster and keep them out of harms way, than I can think of no more pro-American way of supporting those men and women.<br>
<br>
So you can take you propaganda of &quot;support the war on Iraq or you are unpatriotic&quot; and shove it up your ass.<br>
<br>
I am sick and tired of hearing this putrid rhetoric of those who are too concerned with being PC or too scared of being called unpatriotic by the right wingers.<br>

I believe that i will defend what i believe in defending, i refuse to defend what someone else believes unless i think the same,and in this specific occasion i DO NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO WAR WITH. I believe i should defend my country, and my countries freedoms, but right now defending what this country was truley based on isn't about picking up a gun. You can argue that the fore fathers of our nation were naive, they were because they don't deal with exactly the same thing we do. They would accept almost anyone into the nation that wanted to live here, that is naive, but the fact still remians that is what this country was based on. We kinda fucked ourselves with it. The most important war right now is defending what the country was started on. in the words of benjamin franklin &quot;Those who give up liberty for security, deserve neither liberty, nor security.&quot; <p>Teenage dirtbag<br>

<br>
\Pa&quot;tri*ot*ism\, n. [Cf. F. patriotisme.] Love of country; devotion to the welfare of one's country; the virtues and actions of a patriot; the passion which inspires one to serve one's country. --Berkley<br>
<br>
In that definition, anywhere, does it say blindly following a leader? can i get a hell no? in fact that says love of ones COUNTRY. Just because you don't believe in what the leader of your country says or does, here's the key part, DOES NOT MAKE YOU UNPATRIOTIC, IT MERELY MAKES OPINIONATED. can we say that outloud? O-PIN-ION. gooooooooood, now we can learn our 1-2-3's. if your gonna use the fucking word use it right and don't fucking twist it just so you can use it as a defense, and a very poor one i should add. Nowhere does it say &quot;To be patriotic, you must be a team player&quot;. Thats like saying &quot;If your part of a school, and you're not on the sports team, you obviously HATE the school&quot;. Now does that make sense to you? I hope not.  <p>Teenage dirtbag<br>

Hell no!<br>
<br>
I am glad you understand the basic concept that the president is not the country, but rather just an employee of the country who happens to be elected instead of selected (with the exception of our current president of course). In fact, they can even be fired (Nixon), but Wolvar would never contemplate such a thing as it would be unpatriotic.<br>
<br>
Presidents must love fanatics since all they have to do is wrap something in the flag and they will treat it as if it's the Holy Grail without question. <p><br><br><br>

You mean like I did with the Raiders until they finally got Coach Gruden who knew his shit and got the team winning?<br>
<br>
Gimme a break. If your team is doing stupid shit because your coach sucks, you can most certainly criticize them and reamin loyal to the team.<br>
<br>
Seeing as I have been a Raider Faithful since the Art Shell days and criticized their faults until Jon Gruden took over and made them live up to their potential, I think I can speak to this with some authority.<br>
