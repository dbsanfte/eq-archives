I don't normally post here, but this just really pissed me off.<br>
<br>
Arcibu , jumps my group in bot / winds, and heads for named, charming stuff to kill it. She dies once, zones back in, and comes right back up TOTALLY IGNRORING our presence, then TRAINING crap on us, while she continued to reCharm something to kill named.   She DIES AGAIN, and then proceeds to do the EXACT SAME CRAP and then has the nerve to send me a tell that we're dispelling when we were not.   FOOK you Arcibu.. AND GRATS to my GROUP on RUNE.<br>

<br>
ok, so let me get this straight..<br>
<br>
YOU clearly saw us there, and you ran invis'd by us, charming yourself a pet, and then claim you been there all this time, - meanwhile i find out you have been dying repeatedly as your corpse was a GY a few times. <br>
<br>
You saw us there, prepping to make the kill, and you had no RESPECT for us. YET - we let you try the mob 3 times, and then you trained the mob on us. NOT only did you KS but if you die to something, last time i checked, if there is no one else alive in your PARTY, the mob is open to anyone ready to make the kill.... so you KS'd us 3 times. and 3 times you paid for it. <br>
<br>
Come on now  , be realistic. Even the GM told me how stupid of you that was. Yea i would love to have heard that conversation : yes mr.gm im here solo'ing a level 65 mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
Arcibu give me a break. You need to REALLY chill bro.  Yes its just a game, but the game does has its rules and ethics and you disregard them constantly. <br>

She has the spawn of all 4 mini-bosses timed, and within 5mins of a named popping she will be in the zone, run straight past whatever unlucky group happens to be in her way, and gank the named, usually dying 5 or 6 times in a charm/bind rush until she kills it.<br>
<br>
I've also seen her train anyone unfortunate enough to get in her way (including groups killing to the named - &quot;there is no one in the named room right now&quot;), and do things like charm a giant, cast see invis on it, and leave it sitting at the top of the stairs leading up from the zone in. She also ran an aggro Askr the Lost (a non-KoS NPC in BoT) through and over my group for about 10 minutes, while rains and other AE spells were being used, despite me asking her to stop, and eventually blowing my cool at her.<br>
<br>
I've had the misfortune of being between her and a named once, and I intend to make damn sure I am never in that position again.<br>
<br>
She personifies greed and acts like an immature child who will throw a tantrum when she doesn't get what she wants.<br>

<br>
Firstly, if its an enchanter the morals of someone like Arcibu, being driven by greed, how well do you think the group is going to last in the face of trains, adds, etc and all the other wonderful &quot;accidents&quot; that an enchanter can cause with the tools at their disposal? Sure, you could /petition, but every time I've seen Arcibu kill these named, its been peak time in Aus (about 2-3am US time) - wanna have a guess at how many GMs are on at that time?<br>
<br>
Secondly, even if you petition, you still have deal with a CR from whatever train or disruption she caused you. Frankly, no group can stand up to the trouble a grief-inclined enchanter can cause (not without sinking to their level, at least, and then you run the risk of being petitioned yourself).<br>
<br>
Thirdly, even if *does* get into an actual fight for the mob (ie. both the enchanter and the enchanter's pet attacking it, both claiming they started first), if the enchanter is willing to risk hasting their pet there is no frickin' way any group is going to outdamage it (to get the xp/loot).<br>
<br>
Finally, part of the problem stems from the fact that alot of the time, her kills of the named aren't actually breaking Verant's rules - to be honest, I've never actually seen her attack or KS a named while another group was actually fighting it - but god forbid you have to clear more than 2 mobs, or you lose your attempt. But the fact that she might not be breaking Verant's rules all the time doesn't mean she isn't behaving like a complete twat.<br>
<br>
Frankly, all they need to do is fix the regen rate on the BoT mini-bosses so that you can't just throw pet after pet (zoning/gating in between pets) at him until its dead.<br>
<br>

if a solo enchanter runs through you invis to the named, its your fault for choosing to clear through, thus taking a longer time and giving someone the oppertunity to leap frog you<br>
solution: invis to the named<br>
it's a lot quicker and gives you the right since you're there first<br>
<br>
another thing you can do is kill mobs around the named<br>
no mobs = nothing to charm<br>
<br>
you could also try root parking mobs away from the named, so a charmed mob is out of reach of the named<br>
<br>
also dispelling charm and slowing the mob would be deterimental to the solo enc since they can't do anything to get rid of slow, and a slowed giant can not KS your named<br>
<br>
alternatively if she trains you and runs to the portal you could also port away avoiding dying.<br>
<br>
just some ideas<br>
<br>
but then again, if she's training you and stuff, that doesn't have much to do with BoT named but moreso with the fact the said person is an asshole and, eventually, will get what they deserve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sorran>Sorran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/5/03 6:42:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arcibu GREEDiness GETS you NOWHERE!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>solution: invis to the named<br>

This weekend in GC, we heard that he was selling an ornate chain pattern and his Bazaar alt (an old EV pallie account that starts with M, but can't remember the name right now) is selling weapons drops for over 100k. Supposedly he also  multiquests runes for 65k but didn't see that personally. <br>
I did petition Arcibu one night after our group wiped to a train but by the time I heard back from a GM 3 hours later I couldn't be bothered to pursue it. <p> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com/flash/tatSig/SigSingle.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.royalnorrathianguard.com/flash/tatSig/SigSingle.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rimidal>Rimidal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/6/03 4:35:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arcibu GREEDiness GETS you NOWHERE!</span><hr size=1> yea well, I was standing outside west named for about 40 minutes with a full spawn in the whole wing, then you come in with a group, clear through and try to claim it<br>
