Ligius is the protagonist, Faust is the antagonist. Enjoy.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
A confused Ligius stepped into the chamber, overwhelmed by senses of familiarity, mystery, and fear. He knew not what lay in this chamber but for his premonition that it was both ancient and very important. Instinctively, Ligius reached for Requiem, shuddering as he realized that it was no longer at his side.<br>
        “What is this?” he could be heard to whisper. He knew that the unearthing of this place had been coincidental. The sandstorm’s happening almost at the same time as the beginning of Ligius’ journey… he felt as though some fate had preordained for him to find this place. Whatever divine scheme it was that was now occurring, Ligius intuitively knew that what was to come next would be an integral part in it.<br>
         All too suddenly, there was an unmistakable sound; a long, labored inhalation from what was undoubtedly a gargantuan beast. As the unknown creature exhaled, lights exploded across the chamber, revealing a giant statue, obviously carved in the likeness of a god. Standing approximately 50 feet tall, it was truly a majestic sight, and seemed to only grow more immense in size as Ligius approached it. At the base of the armored caricature a chest was placed, inscribed with faded words of an ancient text. The script was illegible save for a single word: Aaumin. “Aaumin…” Ligius repeated, brushing his hand over the ancient engraving, “the fallen Elder God.”<br>
        “Correct, I am Aaumin,” boomed a sudden, echoing voice that encompassed all of the chamber yet obviously emanated from some point within the caricature's bulk. “I have summoned you here, for there is that which must now be revealed. There is much about you Ligius, of which even you are ignorant. You live your life, day in and day out, sworn to protect in the name of Rashavic. You toil in these mortal confines, with no reprieve in sight. Such devotion, young man. And for all this, for what does your patron god stand?”<br>
        “For that which is good,” replied Ligius, regaining his composure, “I act as his instrument of light, in the holy duty to cleanse the world of that which is corrupt and evil.”<br>
        “Interesting,” interrupted the statue, “You destroy that which is evil, you say. You kill it, with neither remorse nor pity. Such heartlessness has become a second nature. Now, you can deny this, but let it be known that I speak the truth: The taking of life is unconditionally and completely evil. It is not in any way shape or form a good deed under any circumstance. What would you say to that?”<br>
        “I would say that I had thought as much,” Ligius responded, raising his voice to match that of the avatar, “but at some point I simply stopped trying to understand, and gave in to faith. I assumed- I prayed- that at least the gods would tell the difference when all was said and done.”<br>
        “Well Ligius, you assumed right. So, answer me this. Has your service to Rashavic not greatly enhanced your ability to take life? As you must have felt before, you are His avatar. His prophet. His very essence flows through you in concentrations the likes of which nobody bound by a mortal soul has ever experienced. Can you explain, then, why the god of ’that which is good’ would infuse you with such an unmistakably evil gift?”<br>
        “Why…” began Liguis, taken aback, “because in this imperfect world, it is necessary to fight evil, even if evil must be used as the means toward the end.”<br>
        “There was a time I was the most worshipped god in the land,” began Aaumin, changing the topic of conversation, “I was looked at as the embodiment of many things: knowledge, power, and chiefly: justice. Some were right- I am the God of Justice. These primitive peoples saw firsthand the atrocities of evil, and had need of a god which could fight this in kind. My disciples ruled with a fair but firm hand, Ligius, and the land prospered. Then, however, came the Renaissance. People softened, far removed from their id. Romantic philosophy evolved, and what I embodied was looked upon as an archaic and inherently cruel institution. The philosophies that my disciples held sacred were defiled and spat upon by the common man. Within a passing moment of time, my following was all but extinct. In place of justice, the newer man opted for a god of good… of truth… of righteousness. And, when you think about it, there is not much difference between what I was and what Rashavic became. However, the people did not see it as so. I was the fastest god to rise, and the fastest to fall. My worshippers abandoned me, Ligius. Do you know what happens to a god without worshippers?”<br>
        “Of course,” responded Ligius, “they die. Gods without worshippers cease to exist, for it is from the belief of mortals that gods derive their very essence, and thereby, their power.”<br>
        “Correct again, Ligius,” continued the avatar, “but then the question begs asking. My followers left me long ago. I am a dead god, Ligius. Yet I live. Did I defy the very laws that hold this universe together, or did I never die at all? Maybe, I just… changed. Think upon this Ligius, and realize what has come to pass. This bond that you feel now, tugging at your very soul, does it make this all clear now?        <br>
“It is becoming so, Aaumin, but continue.”<br>
        “Ahh, good. Patience, Ligius, was a quality that I valued highly among all my disciples. No coincidence at all. Now, bring forth your blade.” Ligius reached over his back, clasping the hilt of his greatsword. As the eerily radiant blade caught the light, the statue continued. “To kill, while an evil deed, does not make an evil person. Like you said, in this imperfect world, the ends must justify the means, unfortunately. You yourself have left uncountable corpses in your wake, yet you still can be held up as a beacon of good to the common man. However, your spirit does not go unblemished. While you remain a good man, you will, as a result of your tainted hand, be forever guilty. Such is the imperfection of justice as we know it. Now, think of the nature of your blade, Ligius. Many a good man hath died by Requiems blade… but never an innocent one.”<br>
        Understanding dawning on him, Ligius nevertheless remained quiet, staying attentive as Aaumin continued, obviously nearing the culmination of his speech. “Think of the nature of justice, that which I embody. In this world, justice is the practical man’s good. In of itself, justice is even inherently good. However, it requires a component of evil, which, while small, is absolutely crucial to its very essence. Justice, of course, has its validity derived from strictness, the threat of course being deeds that are undeniably evil. While good, justice allows for and even condones killing when such action is justified. Justice is all about fairness, about lawfulness, even righteousness. It is really not very much unalike your Temple of Rashavic. In fact, it is your Temple of Rashavic.”<br>
        “So, what you’re saying is…” stammered Ligius.<br>
        “That I am Rashavic. Or, that Rashavic doesn’t exist. Either way, I, Aaumin, am the entity that you up until now knew as your patron god. I never died because you, unknowingly of course, gave me my essence. It was the followers of Rashavic that worshipped me, albeit indirectly. However, as you now notice, even Rashavic’s following wanes. To counteract this, I made, for the first time in aeons, an avatar. I channeled my powers into one mortal, so as to give him potential unrivaled by that of any before him. That mortal is you, Ligius. From his birth, I tailored this mortal to be the perfect vessel of my power. The pain to which you were subjected, that which dehumanized you, which stripped you of even a basic capacity for love, this was all for a cause. The burning desire that was imbued within you, was put their for a reason by my hand! As my harbinger of justice, you would cleanse this world. People would see... and believe.”<br>
        “This all makes sense now,” said a suddenly tranquil Ligius. “While it relieves me to no end to know, for once, exactly who I am and where I belong, but still... If it is even possible, in light of these revelations I now know even less than before. Why now? Why did you pick now to tell me?”<br>
                &quot;That which is now unfolding... it requires you to act. Act sooner than I could have wanted, but not so soon that we are without hope. You can, and must, fulfill your potential.&quot;<br>
          &quot;How?&quot; asked Ligius, bewildered by what he heard.<br>
<br>
             “A simple question,” replied Aaumin, “and nearly as simple to answer. You simply must make the unwavering choice to accept your destiny. Not many people have the courage to accept such a heritage in face of the consequences. You, I sincerely hope and believe, do.”<br>
        “May I ask what these consequences are?” inquired Ligius, a definite note of uncertainty in his voice.<br>
        “Of course. Once you embrace your essence, there is no return. You are mortal, and will surely be overwhelmed. Your mind will take over, unrestrained by conscious thought. Now, seeing as to how conscious thought is what has kept your rage in check for so long, the consequences can and will be undeniably messy. The atrocities you might commit... they will damn you, and they will martyr you. You have no soul, only my essence. In its unrestrained release, this will become painfully apparent. Can you accept this fate?&quot;<br>
        “I… I think  I can,” replied Ligius, visibly shaken to the core.<br>
             “Good. I pray you can, and, as I said, I also believe you can. In the mean time, all I can ask is that you continue this journey. Ivan is dead, but not gone. The façade is now lifted and in this new light you will reach new heights of spirituality, and things will now, at last, just maybe, make sense. And, as a start, I can only suggest that you open the eyes of the Illuminous One. Cian was meant to know the truth.&quot; <p><img src=http://www.game-revolution.com/games/xbox/action/azurik_james.jpg>

It is the culmination of one of the main subplots. Once again- enjoy<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Saeleos strode through the threshold of the chamber,  every step poignant in its emphasis on his anger. The very clud of his feet on the stone floor fueled his rage. As Saeleos mounted staircase leading to the dais, he drew his blade and donned the shield. The dais was enchanted so that it was shrouded in darkness. However, as Saeleos drew nearer, the enchantment faded, destroyed by Saeleos’ essence. As the shadows receded, Saeleos was greeted with a floor blanketed in blood. Blood of the innocent; blood of those who could not protect themselves. <br>
        As the throne was uncovered, Saeleos finally laid eyes on that which he sought. A corpse lay there at rest, now barely more than skin and bones. The eyes were sunken and had long ago receded back into the face. The hair, long and matted, cascading down over the carcass’s face and onto its shoulders. The skin, waxy in its consistency, was ghastly pale, and the fingernails were yellowed, crusted, and grown into claws. The body was dressed in a magnificent suit of armor, spikes protruding from all of the joints and Shiravak’s clan emblem emblazoned on the breastplate. The armor, large and unforgiving, stood in stark contrast to the carcass, which looked as though it might crumble at mere touch. However, despite its weak looks, Saeleos was not deceived. While he could cause intense pain to Shiravak in this state, Saeleos knew that he could not kill the being that was Shiravak unless that being inhabited the body at the time of death. <br>
        “Shiravak!” he shouted, “Show yourself!” As if operated on strings by a pupper master, the corpse rose, its gray misty eyes staring blankly in the direction of Saeleos. A voice, hoarse yet unmistakably powerful, issued forth.<br>
          “You have come,” it began, “you have come to end my very existence. You have come to end this wretched, tortured existence. I would almost thank you, but for the fact that now… you must die.” With that, the arm that clasped a mighty pike swung forward, the momentum carrying Shiravak to his feet. While his head still flopped weakly like that of a dead man, Shiravak stood like a live man, tense and ready for combat. Without warning, Shiravak’s pike flew forward, seemingly carrying its wielder in its wake. Saeleos dodged, lashing out in a backhand stroke with his blade as his nemesis passed by.  The blow hamstrung Shiravak, a wound that wound have greatly hindered most fighters. The vampire, however, paid the wound little heed, though it did cause a slight limp. <br>
        The sight reassured Saeleos, as it asserted that Shiravak was vulnerable to physical attack. Shiravak spun around, thrusting his pike forward. Saeleos was ready, and not only blocked the blow with his shield but also drove forward, the pike wedged between Shiravak’s chest and the shield. Saeleos dropped, for an instant releasing the pressure. Shiravak tried to readjust, but couldn’t in such a short period of time. Before he knew what was happening, Saeleos had driven the shield up into his face, and as the spike scraped off of the corpse’s cheekbone, Saeleos fired…. Too late. Fired a millisecond earlier, the blow would have entirely incapacitated Shiravak. As it was, it merely left a gaping wound across the right side of his face: the upper jaw, fang and all, was exposed, the eye socket was partially shattered, and the ear was entirely shorn off. Shiravak swung his head, his blood drenched hair whipping at Saeleos and partially coating his face with gore. As Saeleos clawed at his face, Shiravak seized his chance.  He brought his pike back, intending to end the fight by spitting Saeleos upon it. The strength of pure evil behind him, Shiravak drove the weapon forward with a force that wracked the frail body, which looked as though the force inside might truly break it.<br>
        Saeleos had no chance. Try as he might to get his shield up in time, he was unsuccessful and the blade drove straight through his chest guard, lifting him up in the air. Saeleos lay suspended in midair, impaled upon Shiravak’s pike. The force doubled his body over, causing him to curl up into a ball as his chest was pierced. As the paladin held this position, Shiravak began to feel a vague foreboding that rapidly grew more powerful. Within seconds, his mind was engulfed, echoing primal fear throughout his thoughts. Sure enough, as Saeleos’ body came out of the position, he lived. Shiravak had watched Saeleos die, had felt the dying shudder as it rattled the shaft of his blade, yet somehow Saeleos lived. Only now, Saeleos was much different. He had undergone a metamorphosis, and was now unmistakably an avatar.  As his body spread out, majestic, pure white wings spread out, sending a gust of air that staggered his murderer. The blood that ran down the shaft was a shining, metallic silver. As a drop fell to Shiravak’s wrist, his flesh was seared. A hole was burned right through his hand, yet he hardly noticed, transfixed as he was by the sight. Saeleos’ features, once so human, were now something more. His skin was paler than Shiravak’s, yet was perfect, unscarred and unblemished. The pupils were gone from his eyes, which were now silver orbs. Even Saeleos hair, silver lining his normal brown, seemed to glow, radiating purity. As a pillar of light engulfed the Avatar that was Saeleos, Shiravak burned. <br>
        He screamed until he could no longer, for the corpse collapsed to ash, the armor boiling. Saeleos, fading into the light, could barely be seen. All at once, flame erupted outward. Flame, the bane of vampires, engulfed the city of Shiravak. Vampires turned to ash, their buildings and coffins to soot.  With a single blast of holy flame, Shiravak, his followers, and even his city, were all as nothing.<br>
<br>
        Mere miles away, Gahar and a few of his men took up the rear of the retreating party. Gahar stared sullenly at the twisted palace, wondering what Saeleos was doing. Suddenly, a pillar of light reached down from the clouds into the middle of the palace. It grew wider, until, all of a sudden, an arc of flame shot outward. Gahar alone had witnessed the event, and the sudden flash of light blinded him. The other men, feeling the searing heat, spun around. Some uttered exclamations; most were too amazed to speak. Regardless, there was a sudden panic, and the men all ran forward. Gahar ran with them. No longer having his eyes to guide him, he tripped on the hill.  In their haste, nobody noticed. Maimed as he was, Gahar simply regained his balance, leaning on the sword that had served him so well in his fighting years. In that instance, despite his sixty one years, despite his grayed hair, and even despite his blank, sightless eyes, Gahar, standing tall in his family armor, looked like a warrior again. <br>
        He stood, silently praying for Saeleos when he heard it. The methodic dragging of semi functional limbs rustled across the grass: There was still a vampire patrol out, and the patrol had found Gahar. His senses honed from four decades of warfare, Gahar took his stance, a formidable fighter still, even without his sight and youth. Not a sound issued from his lips and he coldly took two steps forward and brought his blade crashing down on the skull of his first victim. Backing up, he sensed movement to his right, and flailed his blade outward. The tip of the blade sheared into the vampire’s temple, killing it. Wizening up, the last two vampires came at him at once, one from in front and one from behind. Gahar arced his blade, slashing through the chest of the first vampire and shattering its ribs. As he completed the swing, the other vampire reached forward and clamped its claws down on his left shoulder, grasping around the shoulder pads. Gahar issued a vague grunt, groping back behind his head. The vampire leaned forward, sinking its teeth into the General’s throat. As death came screaming towards him, Gahar drove his elbow back. It impacted with the skull of his would be killer, and, after years of decay, the beast’s head gave. It sunk to the ground, dead, as Gahar held his throat, his very life flowing between his fingers. He tried to speak, but couldn’t, and sunk to the ground. Gahar died the way he had always wanted to die: as a warrior.  <br>
