Errr... that would be Game 3 of the Sacramento Series. He had 3 legitimate fouls called on him. The rest shouldn't have been called, but that they were was understandable because of the pace of the action.<br>
<br>
<br>
And even when the ref is standing right over the incident, you'd be surprised how quickly a collision can happen. The ref was expected to make a split second call, and he did. Was it the wrong one? probably. Was it indisputable evidence that the league is corrupted? Hell no. <br>
<br>
If they really wanted money, a Lakers-Celtics (oldest rivalry in basketball reborn) or Nets-Kings (up tempo teams with tons of offensive weapons duking it out) would have been in order. However, it didn't work out that way, simply because the Lakers and the Nets ended up being the best teams in their respective conferences.  <p><center><img src=http://www.bangalorenet.com/system1/sailo/images/2rips.jpg </center>

<br>
Yes, he had one weakness, one that he has since pretty much corrected. I said he was a great basketball player, not a god. A center's job is to rebound, block, post up, score, pass out of double teams, etc. Shaq does all of that exceptionally. Yeah, he can't hit a 3 pointer for the life of him, but if you're going to play that game, I can name a major weakness in the game of anyone who EVER played basketball, though I'll conveniently ignored whether or not it mattered one bit within the gameplan.<br>

If you're referring to this year's playoffs, his back was hurt so badly that he could hardly get up after falling to the ground. That he played at all was pretty amazing. How about we be a little fair and go back to last year's playoffs, when he was actually healthy. What did he do then? He only averaged something along the lines of 35 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists a game (estimates, but they're pretty damn close I bet).<br>
If all he does is take up space, then why is he regarded as one of the most versatile, best all around players in the NBA, better even than Vince Carter in most opinions? Once again, general NBA consensus &gt; you.<br>

The the casual fan who knows nothing about the game, Damon Stoudamire of the Toronto Raptors was better than Damon of the Trailblazers. However, ask anyone within the NBA, and they'll tell you what most fans who have any sort of a clue know: Damon is just as good now as he was then- probably a more intelligent player even. He doesn't fill up the box score as much as he did in Toronto because with the Raptors he was the first and only scoring option on an expansion team. On the blazers, he was in the same starting lineup as Scotty Pippen, Arvydas Sabonis/Dale Davis, Rasheed Wallace, and Bonzi Wells/Steve Smith, depending on the year. He still can score, he just doesnt have to as much.<br>

Yes, before he was an acrobatic, straight out of high school kid who knew nothing of the intricacies of the game and in crunch time airballed a couple threes that cost his team the series. Now that he's arguably the most skilled player in the league, with three championship rings on his fingers, and on pace to (dare I say it) become a better player than even Michael Jordan was, he's overpaid and skillless. Riiiiiight. You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Just shut the fuck up.<br>

The guy's a fucking ape. He's a shame to the sport and was so before he got his contract. He's the kind of guy that should never make a million dollars in his life. Unfortunately, he did. But you want to know what? He still doesn't fall into your example. Because he still has all the skills he had before. That would be why the Rangers picked him up. The only difference now is that he's a little pussy piece of shit that can't take the heat of being a major league closer. It probably has something to do with the fact that every time he enters a game, even in his own stadium, he is booed mercilously.<br>

It's called aging. While I'm not a huge hockey fan (especially since Ray Bourque retired), its a principle that extends across all sports. In football, there was the Ravens and the Cowboys. In Baseball, it's the Yankees, who would suck by now if there was a salary cap that limited Steinbrenner's ability to buy his way out of all the holes he digs for his team. In baseball, it's the Blazers. Teams who pay aging players more than they were worth even in their prime because their scouts suck and don't realize that skills deteriorate with age. <br>

Wrestling isn't a sport, and the people, while good actors for the most part, were never especially talented. That's why they wrestled instead of playing in the NFL.<br>

You put a 30 million dollar contract in the hands of a 18 year old kid that's never had 200 bucks in his life, and that's kinda what happens. Our culture has created that. Is it unfair? yeah. Is it wrong? Nope. Look at what a lot of these players do with their money. They have entourages, effectively spreading a good amount of cash out among a good dozen or so people that would be on welfare otherwise. Then look at what they do for their families... Ron Artest almost went broke setting up his family and friends after he got drafted. <br>
Then the athletes age, and they mature a bit. Do you have ANY idea how many Youth Centers, funds for research, etc. have been set up by athletes?<br>
<br>
Your stereotype disgusts me. You pay to watch the sports, obviously. You obviously have no fucking clue what you're seeing, but you pay to pretend you do. It is your support that keeps the whole thing going. Either stop watching or stop bitching about athletes being overpaid, cause as long as you do you're not only a fucking idiot, but a fucking hypocritical idiot. <br>
