<br>
I would personally pick the &quot;Ignore it, and leave if she persists&quot; option. Why? Because of a couple of different reasons. <br>
<br>
This is a game, and you have no damn right bringing up your personal problems with me. In fact, the reason why I started thinking about this is that someone threw the &quot;My husband beat me up last night&quot; line at a friend of mine some time back, and he was incredolous. &quot;I don't wanna know about it!&quot; he said, both angry and laughing at the same time -- &quot;what a bunch of losers and headcases there are in this game!&quot; and I fully agree. Now, there's one thing to ask for advice about the game, game related stuff like computer equipment, or say, someone's travelling to Ireland, and there's an Irish player, go fer it, sure, fine. <br>
<br>
Secondly, the last goddamn thing in the world you wanna do, is get involved in shit like that. As we all know, there are some real fruitloops out there, who'll make crazy shit like this up, to get pity and sympathy and attention. But even if the tales are true, hell, it's even worse -- you end up saying &quot;Your husband is an asshole&quot; and a week later, they've made up and you get the husband sending you a tell saying &quot;So, I hear you think I'm an asshole...&quot; I don't know if we have any cops reading this board, but I've heard that domestic disputes is a situation cops really do not like... I can believe it. I had some neighbors that went nuts all the time, you'd have the wife screaming HEEEEELP!! struggling, wrestling out on the porch, with her husband who tried to shut her up and drag her back into the appartment, ten minutes later the cops are on their door, and she's answering, going &quot;Domestic dispute, that musta been a crank call, how DARE you insinuate that!?&quot; <br>
<br>

It's hard for me to be unsympathetic to such a claim even so, my mother is a domestic violence counselor and my sister was in an abusive marriage for a couple years. It's a horrible situation, but there are two things to remember.<br>
<br>
One, you can't help the person by giving advice. Period. They can only help themselves. They will leave when they are ready to and not before, even when they are terrified and know they should get out. All you can do to help a woman who is being abused is to say &quot;When you're ready to leave, I will support your decision, here are some women's shelters you can call.&quot; If you offer help of any other kind (money, a place to stay, etc.) you open yourself up to a lot of legal and physical trouble, and verbal advice is a waste of time because the woman already KNOWS she should leave at the point where she's even willing to admit the abuse occurs. <br>
<br>
Two, there are a lot of wackos out there. I personally have encountered people who've spent years crafting an elaborate lie to hide RL gender, looks, marital status, etc. I used to staff on an online RP site where one of the site founders &quot;died&quot; due to complications from diabetes and &quot;her&quot; supposed lesbian partner came on to thank the site players for the outpouring of supportive emails, etc. after this &quot;death.&quot; A few months later this person turned up on the site again as a different identity, and as we discovered, &quot;she&quot; was in fact a middle-aged male plumber from Brooklyn who killed off the online persona because he couldn't think of any other way out of the web of lies. Lies his RL wife aided and abetted for over two years, including pretending to be &quot;her&quot; on the phone. Never ever believe anyone's sob story online until you have proof in the form of court documents, I say. And even then be wary.  <p>Einthe MacBuff<BR>Diamond Katana<BR>Shaman of the Tribunal<BR>"Irish Diplomacy: The ability to tell someone to go to Hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uiniyeni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iniyeni</A> at: 6/13/01 5:11:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaerroch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerroch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/13/01 7:00:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Serious Question -- what would you do?</span><hr size=1> I picked the &quot;Ignore it, and leave if she persists&quot; option as well.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I have a heart of gold the size of Texas, and if a friend of mine in real life was ever being beaten, I would go over and make sure the guy never ever thought about so much as farting in a woman's direction again (yes, this is macho toughguy stuff that just sounds nice to say, but it is truly the way i feel).  But in a computer game, where I come to relax and have fun, and where I don't know any of the people in real life, don't bring those sorts of problems to me.  If you're looking for sympathy, call your friends and family.  If you're looking for help with the situation, call the police.  That's what each of those respective groups are there for.  EQ is not the place to be looking for a pity party, nor is it a place to go and expect help with a serious situation such as abuse.  There are shelters for that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
If I come across as cold, then so be it, but a distinction needs to be made between the two areas, and separation needs to be kept.  Especially if I don't know the person all that well. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaerroch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerroch</A> at: 6/13/01 7:04:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uiniyeni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iniyeni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/13/01 8:31:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Serious Question -- what would you do?</span><hr size=1> Aerroch:<br>
<br>
You sound like my kind of guy, at least in your impulses. But keep in mind one thing about domestic abuse, just in case you ever do run into this situation in your RL. If you go threaten the abusive husband, you'd better kill him and make damn sure the cops never find out who did it, because otherwise the second you leave he'll take it all out on her. It's a classic pattern, in fact frequently these kinds of actions by loved ones of the abusee will cause the abuser to become *more* violent, sometimes even killing the woman. <br>
<br>
Sorry to interject such a serious note here, but I've seen the case files. <p>Einthe MacBuff<BR>Diamond Katana<BR>Shaman of the Tribunal<BR>"Irish Diplomacy: The ability to tell someone to go to Hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utrindletrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle Trueheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/01 7:22:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Serious Question -- what would you do?</span><hr size=1> Well... i picked the comfort/advice option...<br>
<br>
Why?  I just can't turn my back on people.. i'd rather be dragged down with the problem then know in my heart that i turned my back to someone.<br>
<br>
This is a Game... i do not log on to play counselor.. but i do end up hearing lots of things about people's RL problems and such.  <br>
<br>
A woman is being beaten..<br>
That means one thing for sure.  Her husband is a controller... and she could very possibly be confined to her house.  No, i don't mean tied down and confined.  I mean emotionally battered to the point of not having the guts to walk out her front door to the real world.  In cases of violent relationships, the person being hurt usually thinks they are getting hurt because of it being their fault... it's all messed up.  But anyways...<br>
<br>
i believe you should offer advice.  That advice being, get the hell out of there.  If you can, send me an e-mail and let me know you're okay,  after you leave.  <br>
<br>
If she won't take the advice, there's really nothing else you can do.  DON'T feed her with sympathy... because sometimes that's what people are fishing for.. that and just plain old attention.  Sick but true.<br>

<br>
Can't help it, I'm used to it.  For years I've been the Officer in my guilds who people felt comfortable coming to when they had problems, because I never ignored them.<br>
<br>
In my time I've been a shoulder for discussions of sex, drugs, death, suicide, children, love, hate, marriage, divorce, domestic violence, depression, and anything else you can imagine.<br>
<br>
Even so, people in my guild can't understand why I used to go to the flameboard to blow off steam.  I have over 83 days played and I guarantee you that 50 of those were spent sitting in North Freeport staring at a wall listening to someone with a problem.  It's just something I was good at.<br>
<br>
Amazing how little that means when it all boils down, how easy it is to forget that someone sacrificed their time to be there for you... I learned too late that 99% of the good things you do for people are forgotten or dismissed. <p><center>

<br>
I would like to see a few more people explain their reasoning for this decision. Quite a few people voiced their opinion, but not many have explained why. I'm not out to prove anyone wrong -- I'm not really sure there is a right or wrong here. But as interesting as I think this whole cyber-world interaction is, I still think there are things that belong in the real world, and this -- as well as intimate relationships are some of them. <br>
<br>
An emergency that I heard about years ago, was a woman who lived alone, having a medical emergency of some sorts, and managed to get help via whatever game or chat system she was on -- that makes sense. Emergency, or whatnot. This may have been an urban legend of course -- I think I heard about this happening over CB radio or someting like that too. But an emergency, I can understand that. That's different. <br>
<br>
The only time that I can remember having tried to help/listen, is when someone that I knew played another character, and had started a new one, which he called stupid, or idiot, or something along those lines. I said hahah, good name, and he replied well, I must be, cos my dad says so. Now, that pisses me off a helluva lot more than a wife beater. I've no kids of my own, but I've worked with kids a few years, so I tried to help. Dunno what good it did. But a kid is a kid -- they don't have any options, as far as going somewhere. In a battered wife's mind there aren't any options either really, but kids are different. Not that I'd say it's ok to meddle with that either of course, that's just the only time I remember getting into it. <br>
<br>
If people need help, they should get it in real life. <br>

But by choosing the "try and help" option...all I really meant was "not shrug them off and tell them this isn't the proper medium for them to be bringing this up".<br>
<br>
I'm not saying you should offer advice, tell them "things will get better", or try and fix the situation in any way.  You're probably not qualified to do that, and you may end up misleading an already confused individual.  What I do say you should do is listen (this is, of course, assuming you want to help), and maybe provide a bit of sympathy.<br>
<br>
Hell...I think a lot of the people out there who do this only really want to feel like someone out there cares about their situation, so why not let them indulge?  They could be talking to an NPC programmed with the ELIZA logic and it would probably work as well, but the fact that they BELIEVE there's a real-live person at the other end makes them feel better.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, if someone brings something up like this, they obviously want to talk about it...otherwise they wouldn't have brought it up.  Assuming they want to talk about it, I'm usually willing to have a couple extra purple lines going across my screen if it in some way makes someone feel good...<br>

It all depends on the situation.  if she was afraid to leave the house then call a friend or mother and they will probably do something about it.

<br>
Do you even comprehend what a lift it can be to imagine someone gives a shit about you, when you're feeling down and out?  They don't know you, but fact is, it's another human being who may be severely lacking in self esteem or confidence.<br>
<br>
Just a couple minutes of your time to someone who really just needs a kind word... isn't that a reward in itself?  Jesus, do you know what kind of power that is?   I forget who said it, but &quot;Make them love you and they will die for you&quot; is all too true.<br>
<br>
NOW, I'm not saying be nice to manipulate people.  What I'm saying is to realize it's an awesome power that you possess in a world that you are largely powerless in.<br>
<br>
I had a little Rogue send me a tell asking if my guild had a minimum level to join.  I replied yes, lvl 50, to which he repleid with &quot;sigh.&quot;<br>
<br>
I asked him what was wrong.  Then I did a who on him - lvl 14 if I remember right.  He says back &quot;nothing, just seems like I'm not getting anywhere.. thinking of quitting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I've been there.  Sounds like this person needs a little boost.  So I says &quot;look, man, the lower level game is the most fun you're ever going to have.  This is where you make the friends who will stick with you, regardless of guild.  This is where you make your memories.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but I just don't think.. I dunno... are rogues supposed to suck?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HAHAH.. dude, wait till some of the higher levels where people will BEG you to join thier groups... some dungeons can't even be practically done without a Rogue..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;really?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, and I tell you something else.. keep at it and if I get any Rogue drops the guild doesn't need I'll look you up and give you a present, how's that sound?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WOW, thanks!!!  You serious?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;yep.. writing your name down&quot;<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Okay, not exactly an out of game moment, but all the same he sounded down in RL and I had the ability to perk him up a bit.. so I did.  <br>
<br>
On a very different note, a while ago a person who I won't name, was really freaking me out and acting odd.  I finally told her she needed to tell me what the fuck is going on or I was logging... nothing for a good 5 minutes.  I said &quot;Fine, logging off&quot; and she sent me a tell &quot;wait..&quot;  I said &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You wanna know what's wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I DID ask...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine.  Two nights ago I was raped.&quot;<br>
<br>
You think it was easy for me to even respond?  Do you think me not knowing her in RL made it any less shocking?  Do you think I considered her LESS deserving of my attention or care?<br>
<br>
No, no, and no.  We talked for hours.  She cried, got hysterical, went silent, talked some more... and in the end she went to sleep.  Now, almost a year later she has a boyfriend and should be having a baby in about 5 months.  She seems very happy.  I found out much later that she was intending to kill herself that night.  Did I change that?  Probably not, but if there is even the REMOTEST chance that *I* had ANYTHING to do with her changing her course.. well, wasn't that worth some of my time? <p><center>

Of course! <br>
<br>
But to be honest, I'd be pretty goddamn angry too! This game isn't my life, I play it for fun and relaxation, how DARE they, a complete stranger, start laying their life story and troubles on me just like that? You go golfing, and get paired up with someone who lays that story on you, yes, you'll obviously feel sympathy, but jesus, WTF? And there are kids in the game too. <br>
<br>
I know I sound like a cynic and a big meanie. I'm not. I'm not saying what you did was wrong of course. It was right, potentially a fantastic thing, but if that's your thing, there are volunteer services you can sign up for, to help people who are depressed. And if you need help, there are people you can call.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usalveghostwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salve Ghostwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/01 12:15:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Don't Cry Wolf</span><hr size=1> Heh, I haven't voted because it generally depends on the person; if it's some complete stranger, I would think, &quot;Why are they confiding in ME when they have friends in the game?&quot; If it's someone I know, at least within the game, I give my thoughts but I don't expect any imbedded advice to be heeded.<br>
<br>
I must warn people, however, not to cry wolf.  I used to MUD alot years ago, and one mudder thought he would get sympathy by telling everyone he was going to kill himself.  He cited real problems that he had, failing grades and a recent breakup with his long-time girlfriend; he was utterly convincing.  He was, though, just screwing around.  Unfortunately for him, the sysop fell for it hook, line, and sinker, and contacted the police.  The kid was taken, struggling, out of his bedroom, wrestled into a straightjacket, drugged, and carted off for two weeks of psychic evaluation. <br>
<br>
The police, his parents, everyone bought into it.  The kid was released after two weeks but placed into &quot;counseling&quot;, where he was supposed to try and deal with a problem that didn't exist.  This happened near the end of a school year, and any chance he had of saving his grades went down the toilet.  Ditto the ex-girlfriend, whose parents now considered him an unstable danger to their daughter.  This kid's life was turned upside down by threatening suicide online.  <br>
<br>
If some woman wants to tell people that her husband is beating her, and that she would show undying devotion to someone who would rescue her, she'd better be prepared for someone to show up on her doorstep and club her husband to death.  It can happen.  Of course, maybe that's what they're all hoping .... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucogito.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cogito</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of the Whacky Woondarland</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/01 12:47:18 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://server49.hypermart.net/voxton/flash/mouse.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Don't Cry Wolf</span><hr size=1> Salve, I'd never think anyone could get me to laugh on a thread like this, but you did it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well said, and damn funny too.

Yes it may seem strange that someone asks a question like that, but maybe she had no where else to go out of fear... or on the other hand it could be some 12 year old punk messing with peoples heads.. You never know.. <br>
<br>
I picked the console/comfort option.. being a woman I would opt to offer some advice, but not get too personal and let it be with that (since you DONT know if this person is a weirdo)<br>
<br>

How well do you know anyone? Even RL friends.. <br>

I cant tell you how many times I have been screwed over in RL because of jerks.. yet made the best of friends online.  <p><center><IMG src="http://members.home.net/zyleeseraphim/ZyleeFinal"></center><br>
