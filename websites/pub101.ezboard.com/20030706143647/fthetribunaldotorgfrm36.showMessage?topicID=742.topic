Orrin Hatch: Software Pirate? By Leander Kahney<br>
Story location: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59305,00.html">www.wired.com/news/politi...05,00.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
11:56 AM Jun. 19, 2003 PT<br>
<br>
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) suggested Tuesday that people who download copyright materials from the Internet should have their computers automatically destroyed.<br>
<br>
But Hatch himself is using unlicensed software on his official website, which presumably would qualify his computer to be smoked by the system he proposes.<br>
<br>
The senator's site makes extensive use of a JavaScript menu system developed by Milonic Solutions, a software company based in the United Kingdom. The copyright-protected code has not been licensed for use on Hatch's website.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's an unlicensed copy,&quot; said Andy Woolley, who runs Milonic. &quot;It's very unfortunate for him because of those comments he made.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hatch on Tuesday surprised a Senate hearing on copyright issues with the suggestion that technology should be developed to remotely destroy the computers of people who illegally download music from the Net.<br>
<br>
Hatch said damaging someone's computer &quot;may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights,&quot; the Associated Press reported. He then suggested the technology would twice warn a computer user about illegal online behavior, &quot;then destroy their computer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Any such technology would be in violation of federal antihacking laws. The senator, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, suggested Congress would have to make copyright holders exempt from current laws for them to legally destroy people's computers.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday, Hatch clarified his comments, but stuck by the original idea. &quot;I do not favor extreme remedies -- unless no moderate remedies can be found,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;I asked the interested industries to help us find those moderate remedies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just as well. Because if Hatch's terminator system embraced software as well as music, his servers would be targeted for destruction.<br>
<br>
Milonic Solutions' JavaScript code used on Hatch's website costs $900 for a site-wide license. It is free for personal or nonprofit use, which the senator likely qualifies for.<br>
<br>
However, the software's license stipulates that the user must register the software to receive a licensing code, and provide a link in the source code to Milonic's website.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday, the senator's site met none of Milonic's licensing terms. The site's source code (which can be seen by selecting Source under the View menu in Internet Explorer) had neither a link to Milonic's site nor a registration code.<br>
<br>
However, by Thursday afternoon Hatch's site had been updated to contain some of the requisite copyright information. An old version of the page can be seen by viewing Google's cache of the site.<br>
<br>
&quot;They're using our code,&quot; Woolley said Wednesday. &quot;We've had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.&quot;<br>
<br>
When contacted Thursday, Woolley said the company that maintains the senator's site had e-mailed Milonic to begin the registration process. Woolley said the code added to Hatch's site after the issue came to light met some -- but not all -- of Milonic's licensing requirements.<br>
<br>
Before the site was updated, the source code on Hatch's site contained the line: &quot;* i am the license for the menu (duh) *&quot;<br>
<br>
Woolley said he had no idea where the line came from -- it has nothing to do with him, and he hadn't seen it on other websites that use his menu system.<br>
<br>
&quot;It looks like it's trying to cover something up, as though they got a license,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
A spokesman in Hatch's office on Wednesday responded, &quot;That's ironic&quot; before declining to put Wired News in contact with the site's webmaster. He deferred comment on the senator's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which did not return calls.<br>
<br>
The apparent violation was discovered by Laurence Simon, an unemployed system administrator from Houston, who was poking around Hatch's site after becoming outraged by his comments.<br>
<br>
Milonic's Woolley said the senator's unlicensed use of his software was just &quot;the tip of the iceberg.&quot; He said he knows of at least two other senators using unlicensed copies of his software, and many big companies.<br>
<br>
Continental Airlines, for example, one of the largest airlines in the United States, uses Woolley's system throughout its Continental.com website. Woolley said the airline has not paid for the software. Worse, the copyright notices in the source code have been removed.<br>
<br>
&quot;That really pisses me off,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
A spokesman for Continental said the airline would look into the matter.<br>
<br>
Woolley makes his living from his software. Like a lot of independent programmers, he struggles to get people to conform to his licensing terms, let alone pay for his software.<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't want blood,&quot; he said. &quot;We just want payment for the hard work we do. We work very, very hard. If they're not prepared to pay, they're software pirates.&quot;<br>

You can fry a moniter by setting the wrong refresh rate, but I think you would need physical access to the computer for that. You could fuck up the BIOS with software I guess, but that can be fixed.<br>
<br>
I dunno, maybe you can destroy a computer with software, but I haven't heard of it, other than the HD hack, but that doesn't work on newer drives iirc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hayzen>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 691<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/03 6:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=742.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~digitalfoenix/tsukasa.jpg width=50 height=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A little bit of irony on friday afternoon...</span><hr size=1> I don't know.

<br>
in the olden days... you could set up the data rate of the DMA bus. by exceeding specs and pushing full bandwidth you could burn the chip on the motherboard in about 2 or 3 mn without the user ever noticing. as pointed out, you can also access the vid card DAC registers and set the horizontal &amp; vertical refresh frequencies to 0 which effectively centers the electron beam on one pixel and fries the phosphor coating on CRTs (doesn't work for LCDs obviously). not sure this still works on &quot;modern&quot; monitors (i discovered this over 15 years ago when i was diddling with my CGA card...).<br>
<br>
BIOS altering would only possibly work after a reboot as most parameters are only read once by the various components it controls.  I haven't heard of any component that could be set into a state that can damage the hardware though (ie. the voltage is a selection of a number of finite states, not an actual number). Maybe you can turn off the GPU fan of your NV35 and fry that with a bit of effort...<br>
<br>
i guess that if you want a comprehensive listing of all the mischielf you can cause, you could always track down a few editions of VLAD and have a good read... but yeah, all in all it's pretty hard to cause physical damage to a PC. but quite frankly... data loss to me is a lot more of a problem than component loss.<br>

Senator Hatch didn't know that unlicensed code was on a website that his staff commissioned someone to create, and Pres. Clinton didnt know that his dick in an intern's mouth was sex.

Didn't you say you used an Apple computer? If so then you have to know that your computer is liberal, unlike PC based machines who are hardcore conervatives. So, it is my guess that it must have grew wings and flew out of happiness!<br>
<br>
I have a PC based machine, but it has not eaten my posts or wrecked my files yet, so I am thinking it must be an independent or maybe even a moderate. Gateway made it, so anything is possible since their CEO sports a pony tail.<br>
