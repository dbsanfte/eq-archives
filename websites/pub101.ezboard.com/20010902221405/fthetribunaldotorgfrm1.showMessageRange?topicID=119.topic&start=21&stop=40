IMHO and as it has been up until now, if a cleric gets there first and puts forth the time and effort of camping him, then they are entitled to that spawn if he pops while they are there. Should he not spawn and that cleric leave the camp then it is basically open until the next cleric happens to come along and start camping him. Thats the luck of the draw. But respect should be given to the cleric already there. <br>
<br>
There is nothing more frustrating than being in that position of having cleared the Fgs 4-10 times straight, having camped for 32+ hours straight, RF spawns and another guild swoops in and takes it from you while your guild is on their way to help you as well.  RF is the last piece, and all clerics who have the pearl are entitled to him, no doubt, but give it to the cleric who has put forth the effort to camp him.<br>
<br>
In respect, this goes out to clerics of all guilds on Tribunal. Dont be a wanker. Put yourself in the other clerics shoes and think of someone else coming in to KS you after a long haul camping RF. And like Aauminki said, what is ultimately going to happen is a wasted RF spawn. If you  see another cleric in Solb already camping RF, wish them the best of luck. =)<br>

<br>
Its the same thing with Naggy, we need Naggy to die asap so that Ragefire will spawn.  Ragefire should die immediatly so that Naggy can spawn...the cycle goes on.<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Sylena on this one.  IMHO, someone who puts forth the effort and time to camp something should be rewarded...period, end of discussion.  But, if they leave the spawn, then yes, that spawn is up for grabs.<br>
<br>
I mean, what guild wants to send 15 people to sit and wait for RF to spawn with the cleric?  That is simply ridiculous.  It makes more sense for a cleric that wants to put in the time &amp; effort to sit and wait on RF.  They put in the effort, they DESERVE to be rewarded.  That cleric that has sat and waited ridiculous amounts of hours for RF to spawn DESERVES to call on ANYONE from ANY guild to help them get RF for them.<br>
<br>
That said, if any cleric puts in the time to get an RF spawn, you can count on me to come in and help you take down Ragefire if needed.<br>
<br>
Stop this petty bullshit and work together!! Lets forget the guild tags, group together as citizens of The Tribunal and help each other, ESPECIALLY a person that would sit for hours upon hours waiting for Ragefire or some other ridiculous spawn.<br>

<br>
We all know that knowing first is the key to getting Ragefire. If I am participating in a race to Ragefire and when I get there if there is already a cleric &quot;camping&quot; Ragefire and his/her force is not there and ready to spawn I will recommend the cleric I am helping spawn Ragefire. <br>
<br>
When our clerics camp Ragefire they do so knowing that we are there beside them so when Ragefire pop's we can spawn it as soon as possible and have Ragefire dead before anyone else even knows he spawned. <br>
<br>
Its the difference between camping Ragefire and just watching for Ragefire with a mule or a character that will do nothing else for that time. If you as a cleric want Ragefire via the camping method you best get your guild there in the lair to camp with you. <p><table style=filter:glow(color=#FFFFFF

I believe Sylena meant that the ACTUAL cleric is camping the spawn...not a FD monk twink or a mule.  Its called common fucking courtesy.

<br>
I believe that 90% of the time no matter who the cleric was if they were there camping ragefire by themselves and they said &quot;I've been her for 30+ hours please don't kill him my guild is logging on now to come kill him for me&quot; That most guilds would laugh at that cleric and move past them. <br>
<br>
There are those times when a Ragefire capable force would show up and say, hey great you spent your 30 hours here, you get Ragefire, we will help you kill him. But they are few and far between. And with what I have seen on this server it would be niave for our clerics to think they would be treated any different. <br>
<br>
If I truely believe that everyone would honor a single camping clerics request then it might be a viable system. However, next time, the situation will be different, a Ragefire capable force will show up, the cleric will beg, the guild will wait for their supposed forces on the way, and wait, and wait, mean time some other guild will come in and spawn ragefire. <br>
<br>
I've watched groups moving through FG's get bypassed and everything further in the path just destroyed so that the guild could get to Ragefire first. <br>
<br>
I see no reason that the first cleric with a ragefire capable force in naggies lair shouldn't be the &quot;winner&quot;. <br>
<br>
If you know your cleric in your guild is camping ragefire, better park your character nearby and play your mule so you can be first.  <p><table style=filter:glow(color=#FFFFFF

I don't know what test to do to determine who gets Ragesfire's spawn. If 2 groups came in and cleared FG's while there was no cleric in the lair and there was a cleric in this group, would they then get to claim they are now camping the Ragefire spawn since Nerple left?<br>
<br>
What if 4 groups clear firegiants and right when they get to the lair Ragefire pop's and Nerple is at the zoneline but her Monk is lying in the lair FD, Then who gets Ragefire?<br>

<br>
I know that there have been multiple twinks, clerics in the lair as well at one time, checking to see if the spawn is up. Therefore, the clerics who are at the Ragefire step can easily start communicating to each other about who will get the next spawn, or who was there first, or /random 1 100, and then let the other clerics who are in line know, when said cleric camps, or when they are done with Ragefire.<br>

The idea of anyone &quot;sitting&quot; for endless hours &quot;camping&quot; Ragefire is preposterous. Watch the spawn, sure.  But totally fuck that.  EV is right - if you assemble a reasonable force, fuckin go for it.  Noone owns a spawn like Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Now after popping the dude, it gets hazy.  Admittedly, I want to feel that yes, if you spawn him you get him - but then we get into issues of a group loosing and someone else going in.<br>
<br>
The whole truth is, sorry, you didn't have reasonable force.  If you did have reasonable force - you would have won.  But you feel you have a &quot;right&quot; to the spawn because you /sat on the camp...<br>
<br>
So ideally people will be understanding if someone pops Ragefire and looses and give them a second chance.  But I tell ya what - if we ever need another cleric epic - and someone spawned him sittin on his ass expecting to CoH a bunch of people up - and I've got a sizable force.  Sorry dude - you just lost yer pearl. <p><img src="http://www.putrescence.org/symphony/rigadoon-gag.jpg"></img><img src="http://www.putrescence.org/symphony/rigadoon.jpg"></img></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujadaepacifica.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jadae Pacifica</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/30/01 8:51:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire</span><hr size=1> Congratulations The Tribunal.

Frankly i have no faith in a scheduel now, ive seen some pretty sick things concerning ragefire and a few people are willing to step on anyones toes to get him. Yes, i WANT to see something happen but i really dont know if others would co-operate. its first come first serve on everything now because your all greedy, who would to stick a ragefire scheduel at this point?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uoohay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oohay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/30/01 9:18:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire</span><hr size=1> WTF, there are not 20million people camping Rage.

<br>
If I found RF was up, and headed in only to find someone already camping RF and just waiting for some people to get online/in then I'd hold my people back (or offer to help if another guild came along that wasn't going to respect the cleric's camp).<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but to me a cleric camping RF for their epic is no different to any other spawn in this game that we have always accepted as camps (such as Guk, Seb, etc). It amazes me that anyone can feel free to just roll over the top of someone that has put in 30+ hours of their life to get something of so much benefit purely because they are in a different guild.<br>
<br>
The cleric epic is such a screwed up quest, in the same manner as that of the Wiz and Enchanter one, but is of so much more importance to each guild that it is understandable why these issues arise but also should be totally unreasonable that any guild stoops to them.<br>
<br>
We should look at it as each epic completed is one less in competition for RF spawn, but we are often times blinded by either our own greed or blinded by the fact that getting a res-stick will provide immense benefit to our guild that we forget about some of the attitudes we sure in earlier levels and were so discussed about.<br>
<br>
I doubt anyone here would like to be compared to Alexandr in any way, but by ganking RF from a cleric that has put in so many hours waiting for the spawn then that is what we become...Alexandr mk II, and I'd hope for most of us that is something we don't want to be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On the other side of the coin, it would be nice for a cleric that knows they won't have enough people on in a reasonable time to also make a gesture to allow a fully ready to go guild to take the spawned RF knowing that that is then one less person they have to compete with and also knowing that next time that guild will most likely offer to help with the kill instead.<br>
<br>
I know that most people won't as it is hard to see past the &quot;this will make me more powerful&quot; mentality to the &quot;this will make the guild better&quot; let alone to the &quot;well this will make someone else and their guild better, but it will benefit us in the long-run&quot; mentality but that is what we need to get.<br>
<br>
Yes, put your guild first but also think about how helping others helps your guild.<br>
<br>
Hmm, this is most likly longer than I wanted it to be, and strayed a little off-topic from Jadae's post so I'll finish up by saying that if RF spawns and you need a few extra people to drop him, give me or an AN member a tell and we'll see what we can do (mileage may vary per guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p><center>
