<br>
Bacris,   I have said something adverse about ~Two~ companions in the past... and also clarified in the ~same~ post that it doesn't mean i hate you all.<br>
<br>
This &quot;blanket hatred&quot; is a figment of your own mind.  Now yes, maybe you like your guild well enough to jump up in arms against anything negative...(which is the honorable thing to do imo)  or maybe your ego gets bruised easily... but for God sakes, i have ~never~ said i hate your guild lol.<br>
<br>
Relax...<br>
<br>
I am only stating the obvious here.  The reason i do so is so that Muse and Jas don't get sucked into a pattern... <br>
<br>
To what end will they go to to defend their own guild when it comes to a &quot;Community&quot; board?<br>
<br>
Is this *really* a community board?<br>
<br>
The rest of the &quot;community&quot; got bashed on a regular basis... it wasn't until the moderator's guild was the subject of different accusations or sarcastic comments that the flame forum was openly rebuked and moved.<br>
<br>
That is *all* i'm saying.  I don't give a flying frig ~what~ guild it is.<br>

<br>
In fact, this particular forum is unique in the sense that OTHER moderators aren't supposed to moderate it, only the two designated Flameboard moderators Aatlaar and Ladida. (Yes I know it has happened that others have moderated it, but that was as a result of misunderstandings: first time, we just hadn't determined that this was the way it should be, second time, it was thought that Aatlaar and Ladida were both missing in action, and last one was when some new moderators came aboard). <br>
<br>
I'm just saying this cos I think you should know that there are people trying to make this thing work... And I think it's gonna be a great thing -- thetribunal.org webpage is gonna own all EQ webpages, man...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 2:23:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=200.topic&index=64>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok...</span><hr size=1> I think it's awesome we are getting a webpage and can't wait to see it.

As for this board, Aatlaar and Ladida reign supreme. Even I've been &quot;buttmatized&quot; here, they can do what they want. Except for a couple moderations (ditching some anon flamers, which Aatlaar said he would have done himself) when we thought they were both MIA, we haven't really touched this forum at all. <p><div align="center"><p align="center"><a href="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/characters/Muse/lizzie.htm"><img src="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/images/characters/Muse/lizzie-sig2.jpg" width="400" height="149" border="0"></a><br><img src="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/images/quotes/06-05-01.jpg"></><br><br><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><a href="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/">&lt;The Companions></a><br><a href="http://www.thetribunal.org">Tribunal Server</a></font></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubowynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bowynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Head Whore of Playsure Palace</span><br>  Posts: 635<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/9/01 3:00:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=200.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visveres.com/ezboard/members/bowynn1.jpg width=118 hieght=191></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok...</span><hr size=1> Liz/Muse, <br>

Keep your chin up.  Change brings dissention.  As you've already said, the dust will settle.<br>

I needed most of my non-inebriated brain cells working in unison to find it hidden WAY at the bottom where they (the lame fragile-ego moderators) are hoping it gets less advertizing. So now, on to the flames!<br>
<br>
Muzzie Tempestdumbass first. Even I'm not stupid enough to accuse you of being the anti-christ just because you've moved the flameboard to where you were hoping that no one would see it. But I will say it's starting to look like maybe you at leat work for the anti-christ. This kind of &quot;It's my ball and you can go home if you don't like it&quot; shit is juvenial at best and (yes, I'll say it) oppressive at worst. Go fuck yourself! And who the hell do you think you are serving by moving it? Yes, yes, it's all part of the Master Plan(tm) that we aren't privy too, of course. But what do you think you'll get for having a website and messageboard where everyone Loves eachother and are perfect citizens? A gold star? Stop serving just yourself, you self-ritious fuck. Ask the Tribunal community if they want any changes maybe? Oh no... it's YOUR board, I forgot. Maturity &gt; Muse.<br>
<br>
Cogito. Who are you really and what did you do with the old Cogito? This is like a bad scene in Invasion of the Body Snatchers or something. I don't expect you be all &quot;yeah! Down with the Flameboard oppressors!! Burn Burn!&quot;, because you are usualy a bit more calm than us witch hunters. But you sound like a giant freakin PUSSY latey, just doing everything possible to defend an old friend. You're so good at seeing both sides, so why don't you let Muse in on why we might be a bit upset about being treated like second class citizens? And if you really think the board moderators are so homoginized then let's let Aatlaar (The Mean Elitist) arrange the board any way he wants. If he switches the positions of the Lameboard and the General forum will you be as understanding? Just give it equal treatment is all we're asking I think.<br>
<br>
Leogan, STOP BEING SO GOD DAMN LEVEL HEADED! I would have banned you from the Lameboard if I was a moderator. You're never pissed about anything and that's just all kinds of wrong.<br>
<br>
To anyone that thinks this is no big deal, well, I agree with you somewhat. I'm not even as mad about it as I pretend to be. But moving the flame board to where it is is an obvious attempt to hide it from view and try to shelter newcomers from the &quot;big meanies&quot; of the Tribunal... well, that's ok really. But don't try and say you are representing the community when you really aren't. That makes you a hipocrite. So instead, let's just rename the board and website to the Happy People Of Tribunal. (no bad stuff here, folks, we promise). When you do, I'll go elsewere. Until then, I'm here to represent the pissed off, mad as all hell, morons of the Tribunal community! It's my calling. Thanks, and go fuck yourselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utookynooks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tooky Nooks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>tooky tooky tooky</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/01 1:13:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=200.topic&index=69>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.phalanx-eq.com/Images/narc1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok...</span><hr size=1> I agree about many points on the class forums...not that they were made to bury the FB (but who knows)...but they ARE redundant when there are already established boards out there that serve the purpose I can only assume your trying for<br>

Perhaps make forum/links to them like you have BPP and others<br>

I hope my posting the things I don't agree with didn't give you the idea that I am slamming you or the Comps or dissing your effort. Yeah, a few things you said in Wolvar's thread kinda rubbed me the wrong way, but there is no doubt what I have posted has rubbed you the wrong way too. I have seen more tolerance on the main board the past couple of days though and I hope it continues even after this debate dies down.<br>
<br>
And yeah, I said I wouldn't post in the GD again either, but it's probably kinda crazy for either of us to refuse to post on any forum here... I was just pissed about Wolvar's thread getting locked, but as I said, GD seems more tolerant now.<br>
<br>
Just keep in mind that running a public board that the Tribunal uses has put you in the hotseat. Your actions here will be up for debate since what you do effects us all. Doesn't mean we think any less of you as a person (at least I certainly don't). <p><br>
