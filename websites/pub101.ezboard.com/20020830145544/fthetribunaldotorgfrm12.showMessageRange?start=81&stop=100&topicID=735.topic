Yes, if the Uber guilds ( in our servers case Comps and EV ) made getting epics a priority, yes, they could do them 10 times easier than can the smaller guilds. How many Eternal Heroes does it take to take down Ragefire as compared to how many EV it takes ? <br>
<br>
  What the small guilds are missing is that to the best of my knowledge, neither of the Uber guilds even do epics anymore, meaning pretty much, if you want your epic, you have to find non raiding time, then round up a lot of people outside of the guild to do it ( of course you will get some guild help, but you can't bank on it ). Were as in a smaller guild, you can get your entire guild to Kith Forest to do a Rogue epic.<br>
<br>
  So , pretty much it means that neither sized guild has an advantage over the other, it comes down to the individual player and his desire for the item and his ability to convince people to help him. Also, a few lucky breaks along the way help , but that is another subject <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I bet if you did a study on who has what you would see that the Uber Guilds dont need to do epics because most of them have it already.  Now I dont mean every cleric in the guild have their epic but I am sure there are enough to make their raiding a breeze.  So yes the clerics that were unlucky enough to be at the bottom of the list even in Uber Guilds do get screwed out of their epic.  The guilds needs come first.  But that is the choice of that cleric to go where others cant go with the Uber Guild or to get individual glory and seek their epic.  <br>
<br>
When it comes to the lesser guilds that are still working on getting their first epic I can definately understand the feelings that come up when a larger guild gets in the way and takes it away from them.<br>

I know this is the Flameboard so I should be bitching but I am really just curious.<br>
<br>
Seems like nobody is happy; <br>
<br>
Uberguild members are irritated because they are at the bottom of lists and they have to do it without guild help on their epic encounters...<br>
<br>
non-Uberguild members are irritated because they lack the mobilization to do epic encounters which are non-trivial and require more resources (and therefore difficult when unplanned like the RF spawn)...<br>
<br>
Is anybody happy with the Ragefire situation on Tribunal?<br>
Anybody think that what we have now is a good situation?<br>
<br>
If everyone thinks it sucks, why don't we ATTEMPT some sort of waiting list... Are we really that unable to reach an agreement about how to manage it?<br>
<br>
Basically I'm wondering why people who would agree that it sucks so bad wouldn't want to at least try something different.<br>

I wasn't there...all my information is from what was posted on these pages.<br>

My question is...Its clear that Tuatha was the first to engage via kiting (FYI...that point IS MUTE and yes, I agree, a guild in full force can take it from a person from another guild if their guild is not there in force) and was the FIRST to have sufficient force there...Why didn't those that came lurking in leave once they figured out Tuatha was engaged OR at least help them take down the mob instead of standing around gawking at them?<br>

Druid epic is not as useless as you think. /smack!!  It is a significent upgrade to gear in the main hand slot and IS useful in situations where a druid needs to ghetto mez. /smack!<br>

All epics have their uses in one form or another.  Sure, cleric is useful when people die, but until then...its useless.<br>

My point is...saying certain class epics are useless is just a plain ignorant comment.<br>

(nice run on sentence there eh?)  I have been stating all along that the ubers have better resources to take down the epic encounters, they are better equiped to win the fights, and are more experienced at organising said raids and therefore can mobilize quicker.  Am I mistaken in any of these statements?  Notice I never said they had an easier time scheduling these events, just an easier time DOING the actual encounter.  Not camping it, not gathering the vonlunteers for it, the actual DOING it.  If you think an uber will have as much trouble actually killing General V'Ghers than my guild did, then shit we're ready for ToV. LOL (for the humor impaired that was a joke)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> same 120 members have 6 times (or more) goals <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Some earlier gave me crap about my post structure, so look closely at that sentence.  That sentence implies that each member has six times as many goals as member of smaller guilds.  That sentence says the MEMBERS have six times as many goals not the GUILD has six times as many goals.  Notice the difference in syntax?  That is why I called that statement assinine, and ignorant.  So next time you jump down my fucking throat learn to speak fucking English.  Every person who plays this game has goals.  Just because you are in an uber guild does not mean you have more goals, it just means your goals are different.<br>

<br>
Face it, every person wants an epic. Mostly cause its called an epic, and a large part because of the effort required for most.<br>
<br>
Hell, i have better and i want mine because i poured over a year into it.<br>
<br>
Nobody is more entitled to an epic, but it all comes down to choices.<br>
<br>
High level, raid-oriented guilds have difficulty because they can do above and beyond so they dont bother. They chose to do the bigger stuff because the rewards are much better.<br>
<br>
People in low level guilds chose to be there. They could powerlevel (aka 24/7 grinding) to 60 in no time at all, join a larger guild and get their epic. They chose not to. It is nobodys fault.<br>

I am from VV and I was told to get to the OT zone. When I got there Rage was engaged and I saw adds coming. Me and Mac a fellow VV'r tried our best to kill the adds and what killed us was Rage's AE. So dont say VV tried to steal Rage when we tried to take your adds and ours(and yes some where yours) and get rid of them after I died you guys went down and my guild got summoned 1 at a time to their death. BTW if a guild fails to a mob the mob then it becomes open for the taking. No one stole the mob from anyone and I would like to salute Revolution on a job well done.<br>

<br>
its all about choices and sacrifices and desire. people who join uber guilds know what they are getting into, they do it for a reason and they make that choice willfully. people who join small guilds are the same, they make their choice and then they have to live by it. being in a small guild has many benefits but it also has many drawbacks. it does not give anyone the right to complain about the choices that uber guild members have made.  <br>
<br>
and stop flaming minki's grammar, grammar flames are weak sauce. We all understood the meaning. the intended meaning was that bigger guilds have 6 times as many members, and therefore they have 6 times as many individual goals.<br>
<br>
in theory EV/Comps have a tactical advantage in aquiring epics, in that they have better gear, more play time etc. but in practice they have a disadvantage because for the most part guild leadership could give a crap about getting epics at this stage. A smaller guild with 25 people who are in their 50s could do just about every epic encounter and make it a guild priority. look at KoT they have a very high ratio of epics to members.  <p><font size="-2" face="verdana">Elche Proudfoot<BR>

You have a group doing Upper Dogs in Velks ( or any other camp for that matter ). You get whiped out, while standing at the zone line to get ready to CR someone shouts camp check . How many members of VV or Revolution would hesitate for a second to call Upper Dogs, even though they have just gotten whiped out trying to hold it ? What if when you made it back to camp, another group would have taken it, how many of you would just loot your corpses and say &quot; Wow, goodluck guys, we had our shot and screwed it up , and therefore we don't deserve the camp &quot;. ( btw, not singling either guild out here, pick anybody on the server and ask yourself the same question ), we all have seen it done over and over in every zone we have been in, group gets whiped out, and still they call the camp they are dead in and pretty much everyone just assumes that it is their camp.<br>
<br>
  Now, argue situational ethics all you want, but think about it abstractly, what is the difference between a camp and a single Mob ? Think of how much fun it would be if everytime you had to CR from somewere, a group showed up and took the camp over. Or think of how fun it would be that everytime you had Disco in Seb, another group stood there waiting to see if you could hold it , all the time arguing with you in OOC and doing small things to annoy you. I'm not talking about this specific example btw, I am talking about all the various flames and bitches posted about everything from Lodizal to Ragefire.<br>
<br>
  You see, it comes down to this, people on the server don't feel it is worth being thought of as a prick over something like a camp, but when it comes to something that can drop a pretty nice item ( like Zland or Kland ). They suddenly quit pretending and greed takes over.  Lodizal pretty much set the tone for problems like these, semi rare spawn, good loot and an easy kill . All of a sudden, if you were wondering through IC and saw a group killing him, you could just take your 3 man group over and hope to get the kill shot, then if anyone said anything, you would of course say &quot; Oh, everyone knows that Lodizal is FFA&quot; . No guild is above that. <br>
<br>
 That is the thing about desire, if you want something badly enough, you will ALLWAYS justify whatever actions you take. Same way as a ninja looter or scammer can always justify to themselves stealing something . The main difference here, is that a scammer just tries to justify their actions to themselves, wereas people who watch you fight a mob hoping you will fail, try to justify it to everyone else.<br>
