Hey Warrior with the fancy logo, got one word for you...<br>
<br>
<br>
NAMES, NAMES.... Maybe you should listen to ya momma when she says Proof is in the pudding? Girlfriend level 10 got hit on in ten minutes or less.... BTW Who are ya along with this pretty lil girlfriend? Names, but since you don't have one, I know you got proof when you sent in the email's along with Logs....  As for Sendri being alittle girl which I read in the post above&lt;had to come back in and write this before I left for work&gt; which is good friend? Is she now 25 or so or is she this little girl? You seen her in tears may I ask?? I mean omg, she got married to 3 different peeps, one being a guy playing a girl on top of telling people she has Cancer to get them to like her and shes in tears??  BTW DO you know why the guys come and go and again, I gotta say for coming back to the server you might want to ask yourself this... Was she crying for lack of sex???  The last thing I would want if my daughter was that badly upset and I was a loving parent &lt;OH YEAH, did you also hear the stories of her telling people that her parents where truck drivers and were getting a divoce?&gt;  is to come back to the server that caused so much pain to her! Let me ask ya, so do you really think she was that upset.. I mean come off it now... One story shes this young girl, another shes 25 and home finally from running away to the circus? I never seen so many lose ends in one persons life? Shes the James Bond of EQ... Normally when something doesn't make sense or has too holes and no proof, well I call it a lie. But you seen her cry you say.. Your a friend that will do anything for her you say?  Doesn't matter than does it, all the proof you need won't take off a person's name cause shes the friend of the owner of the bar... Free drinks gang! <br>
<br>
I leave ya with this final thought as you read on....<br>
<br>
Why come back if this was true.... Friends can't read email? Loving family thats getting a divoce and living in a part of your state is willing to let this so called young girl of 25 married 3 times withone she has the best of both worlds come back?  Hmmmmmmm Heck loving family letting her run away to join the cicrus? Was she the clown in the act or the one behind the horse shovling the shit cause I am having a hard time figuring out which one was it cause she does both so well.    As a friend, I ask her to stay away and keep in touch with emails, as a loving family member I say OMG with such records against him hes banned.. No record and as I see in the post above also, he has helped me out once without a problem... /walks away shaking his head mumbling   too many holes, too many holes.......<br>

The girl may be nuts, but there is more then her just making these claims. Jude needs to defend himself, because all you are doing is drawing attention to an issue that no one really cared about, now you tossed blood on it and you dont realize you are in a shark pool. *cues theme from jaws* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usciekspellbottler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sciek Spellbottler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/17/02 4:37:57 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Judeis and Sendri</span><hr size=1> Actual Log Snippet to follow:<br>
<br>
Judeis tells you, 'I want you to squeeze my nuts so hard they turn purple, and then kick me in the stomach.'<br>
You tell Judeis, 'WTF?'<br>
Judeis tells you, 'Come on cybor wif me!'<br>
You tell Judeis, 'go away...'<br>
Judeis tells you, 'Gimme hot lubbins.  I want to lick your bunghole and munch on your dingle berries!.'<br>
You tell Judeis, 'Dude, you're pretty fucked up.  Go away.'<br>
Judeis tells you, 'Spank me pls thx~~'<br>
<br>
So there you have it!  PROOF, that Judeis is a sick little monkey.  Afterall this is as good as any log file.  I just edited out those timestamps and stuff to make it easier to read.   Yep, that's it.  Of course if you want I can go back and put the stamps back in.  Of course you'll say this is BS I made up and doesn't count as proof, but then again no matter what logs someone sends or posts you'll say the same thing no doubt.   Can we have a new list under PoMS... call it the CDF list.  Clueless Dumb Fucks.  Seriously, we need to be aware of the people that stand out above and beyond your average idiot, even if they aren't malicious enough to make the PoMS list.  Let's start it off with Raylar and his alter ego(s) and their demands for JUSTICE and PROOF!<br>

<br>
First off, if you're going to attempt to try and flame and insult Sendri, at least use proper spelling and grammar, and try using less profanity.  Sure, it may be hard given your IQ, but it couldn't hurt to try...<br>
<br>
Second:  Why the hell did you bother to try and dig up this tale from the grave?  It was done a long time ago, if you wished to try and get your &quot;friend&quot; removed from the list, you should have done it a long time ago.  I don't believe that it should be removed now.  If you can't produce your &quot;proof&quot; within a certain amount of time, and get enough &quot;real&quot; different people to vouch for Judeis, it should've been taken care of in the first round in this whole mess.<br>
<br>
Third:  You want proof?  Well, unfortunately for you and your friend, there is no hard evidence other than what is kept by VI/SoE on their servers, and they claim to not log text at any rate.  You're not gonna get it from VI/SoE with nothing less than a subpoena, it was over a long time ago, and I highly doubt they chose to keep logs from that long ago.  Simply put, I can rack up a 7-40 megabyte log file in a casual playing day, even if I'm only for a few hours tops.  Multiply that by all of that by the number of people who play EQ, and different alts, etc., and you have a monstrous amount of space being taken up by that.  I hate to burst your bubble, but professional backups done by a company such as IBM are expensive, and storage for all of that information is expensive.  Not gonna happen.<br>
<br>
On the individual side, Sendri, Judeis, yourself, Aeaolena, myself, ANY of us.  Can't be trusted.  EverQuest logs are easily faked.  Any personal logs can't be trusted by ANY party.  So your &quot;proof&quot; is out the window.  You can't prove it by the logs, neither can she.  Go cry me a river.<br>
<br>
What we DO have is people's testimony.  In game and on the message boards.  The Moderators and/or the forum Administrator SHOULD be able to check the IP addresses to see if a message was posted by the same person.  I say this, because back in the day, I was our guilds forum Administrator.  We have since moved to an EZBoard (for now).  There would always be a little box by the person's post with their address on the Internet.  You could be even more restrictive about whether they would be using the same Internet Service Provider.  I'm confident that the results will turn out in our favor.<br>
<br>
Fourth:  I know Sendri, I know her family, I was at their house a week ago to work on our Guild Leader's computer.  I won't claim I'm close to Sendri, but from what I can tell, she wouldn't lie about something like this.  Period.  She's an overall caring person who is close to her family.  I wouldn't hold a doubt in this case about whether Judeis is guilty as accused.  I consider myself a rather good judge of a person's character, and I believe that this holds true, especially now.<br>
<br>
Fifth:  Why would she come back to The Tribunal?  That's easy.  She has friends and family among her.  Her whole family plays on The Tribunal, and EVERYONE I know personally plays on The Tribunal.  Oh, and now that Aeaolena is defending her, I think you and your friend are doomed.  I know that she's been playing this game since like the Dawn of Time (tm), and those she plays with regularly, and her guild, will more than likely defend her judgment on this situation.<br>
<br>
Raylar, I doubt anyone here is present for some sort of &quot;revenge tactic&quot;.  Maybe you should remove your tinfoil hat.<br>
<br>
I think I've said enough for the time being, and I eagerly await your reply so I can shoot any accusations out of the sky.<br>
<br>

Think that will get Alexandr removed?  Anyone believe that?  If so, I have a very rare patch of gnoll fur for sale, only a thousand pp. This is a very very unique patch of gnoll fur, from the 'Sabmudmai' gnoll.  Raylar, it's too late.  You should have done this back before he got his name up there.   You keep pointing to real life analogies.  Well, he had his trial (6 months ago or whatever).  He lost.  He got his sentence(guilty).  There is no jail time.  But he has a criminal record now (thx POMS list).  You asked for an appeal.  So far, it's just two people speaking up for Judeis that I see, not even your ten people speaking up for him.  I'm sure this will be followed by a spam of 14 or so '1 post' wonders saying what a cool guy he is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukneightskye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KneightSkye</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/17/02 8:33:12 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/kneightskye/images/Mhummrah.gif width=84 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> now you're going to get spam tells from olav trying to by that fur. <p><font size="3"><p align="center"><marquee bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#00FF00" vlink="#00FF00"

     The two people who say he did it only offer you  the text of them typing into the message boards. The two people who are saying he did not Only Ask For Proof. No Proof is provided. And they Make up excuses Why they cant Provide it. When You Type /log that puts it to your hard drive. Easy as hell to find at that Point, You know why No one logged this? It is an elaborate scheem to Tarnish some ones Good Name for revenge and retribution for being kicked to the curb. Women have the worst Revenge in the world. Colder than an artic winter wind.  I refuse to adress the other posts any more. You have here two people posting for judeis and two against the rest is just people putting in thier trash talk. Plus you have Judeis Posting in his own Defense.<br>
