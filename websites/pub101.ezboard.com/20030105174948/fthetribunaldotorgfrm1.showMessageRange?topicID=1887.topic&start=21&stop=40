<br>
I had a friend who drank robotussin for a week straight, tripped and stayed awake over 150+ hours.  This was an accelerated student, who had an IQ well over 150 -- at the end when he crashed he was in a coma for 2 days.  When he came out of it, he could no longer read or write and had trouble speaking and communicating.  He was institutionalized, where he was heavily medicated on drugs like Buspar and Resparadone (sp?) and other anti-schizo and downer shit.  It took him almost 6 months to regain the ability to read, and probably another 6 before he was released into his parents' care...he was legally insane.<br>
<br>
So if you claim to have stayed up 29 straight days on meth, I hereby call bullshit...cause you'd be a dribbling vegetable.<br>
<br>
But if you do intend to stand by that, I suggest you let Michelle Hines know...cause you see she's the current Guinness World Record holder for consecutive days without sleep -- the record is 528 hours 17 minutes, one which shattered the previous record by 75 hours.  In case you're wondering, that's around 22 days.  However, YOU have destroyed that flimsy record by clocking in at 696 hours. <br>
Are you sure about that 29 days?<br>
Are you sure about that 29 days?<br>

Personally I like sleeping, but I've stayed up a day or two on acid before.  I think however that David Blaine atop a 500+ foot 25&quot; diamter pole for 36 hours straight beats any of us.  Except for Mr. Record Breaker. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucyndarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyndarr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/14/02 12:07:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1887.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: longest time you've gone without sleeping</span><hr size=1> /agree Dvin.<br>
<br>
When I was in HS I use to do the Stay up a night, sleep a night, stay up a night etc.. thing. I usualy couldn't last more then 8 days on that schedual w/out sleeping a full 18 to 24 hours. The longest I went was 7 days on that shcedual and then 48 hours bender. I slept for a full two days after that. <br>
<br>
From what I remember if I went for more than 30 hours w/out sleep I started to see things out of the corner of my eyes, shadows, etc.. So WHY on earth would anyone WANT to go several days w/out sleep unless it's drug induced or you have insomnia. Surely EQ can't be that exciting hehe. <p><center><Table BORDER>

Scariest thing for me is driving without enough sleep.  I used to have a 90 minute drive to and from school and then another 60 minute drive to and from work (and this was daily) so approx. 5 hours of driving a day, and I would regularly fall asleep behind the wheel and scare the shit out of myself (and any of you that have had this happen will agree... you are AWAKE for the rest of the drive after you wake up halfway off the highway at 90 MPH ).  It's amazing I'm still alive today and never had an accident from falling asleep behind the wheel, although I had ALOT of close calls.  Wake up barreling forward 20 MPH faster than the car 20 feet in front of you... wake up aiming off the shoulder on a sharp corner... wake up cuz the light had turned green and then red again and you didn't move... (people really don't like that one  lol)<br>
<br>
Got to the point where I'd just pull over and sleep and be late to wherever I was going.   God forbid I hurt or kill someone else cuz of my idiocy.  I could never live with that.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is... I see alot of people on the highway heading to work (I have about an hour drive to work now all highways) drifting lanes, sliding over into the bump strips, or just nodding off in slow traffic.  It's kinda scary...     anyways, no need to de-rail the thread  : ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ubarrandaam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BarrandAam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/14/02 3:20:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1887.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: longest time you've gone without sleeping</span><hr size=1> You can train your body to go on lesser amounts of sleep.

<br>
it's funny though those who stay up can probably attest to this. After a certain amount of sleep deprivation, your head is pounding, and you feel like shit.  this lasts for about 2 hours.  After that period is gone, you are no longer tired, and can stay up for another full day without trouble.<br>

<br>
However i did have one deployment where I was only getting 1 - 3 hours of sleep for 4 weeks.  Halucinations and slap happy do not begin to describe the state i was in by the end(And I was splitting driving duties with my squad leader, who also was just as sleep deprived.  I am surprised we didn't kill ourselves or someone else)<br>
<br>
That kinda thing happened less toward the end of my military career.  (My first stint was at the end of the 80's, the second in the mid 90's)  The army seem to realize that going without sleep for to long was more dangerous to the soldiers than the enemy.<br>
