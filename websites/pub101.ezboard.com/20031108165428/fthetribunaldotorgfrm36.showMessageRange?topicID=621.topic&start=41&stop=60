Furthermore, US has left plenty of destroyed countries in its wake without bothering to &quot;rebuild&quot; them at all.  You keep repeating how you rebuilt Germany and Japan.  America didn't rebuild them because they wanted to turn them into wonderful prosperous democracies, they rebuilt them because their economies were so shot that they might lean towards socialism/communism and migrate to Soviet sphere of influence.  Now that communism is no longer an issue, America will be all too glad to pull out after a few months once the global attention has shifted somewhere else and leaving the Iraqis to rot there.<br>
<br>
Now, when was the last time America actually rebuilt a country?  Because as nice as those examples of Germany and Japan sound, the truth of the matter is that is not the norm, but rather the exception.  Frankly, I can't recall a single example off the top of my head where a country invaded by America, destroyed by America and then rebuilt by America happened since WWII.<br>
<br>
Just look at the last country that you promised to &quot;liberate&quot; from &quot;maniacal regimes&quot; and then promised to &quot;rebuild&quot;.  I'll give you a few clues, it was the last military action until Iraq, it happened in 2001 and it starts with an &quot;A&quot; and ends in &quot;fghanistan&quot;.<br>

The double standards just fly left and right.  Hey, I just remembered when your own allies were assholes to you just a month ago, why don't you go attack them?  The fact of the matter is that you and I know exactly why this war was fought, unlike you I won't resort to trumpeting rhetoric again for the sake of rhetoric - I'll just say that you are perfectly aware as well as I am that this war was not fought for truth, justice and the American way as the administration would have you believe.<br>

No, I think you missed the point!  The point being that US has a legacy of &quot;liberating&quot; countries and then leaving them to rot.  But of course you conveniently ignore that.  The legacy of US, isn't Germany and Japan style rebuilding efforts, it is Afghanistan, Vietnam, pick-a-random-Latin-American-country clusterfucks which result in leaving the aforementioned country in worse shape than it was to begin with.<br>

Did he do that in Afghanistan?  Because that is when it would have been actually appropriate.  Bush isn't trying to make you into what you were Post WW2, he is trying to make you what Germany was pre-WW2.  Too bad that he is too dim to realize that America is showing more prominent neo-fascist tendencies than the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; combined.  Don't patronize me, and dont insult my intelligence, prick.  You might be able to sell that to some dimwitted redneck farmer in Nebraska who voted for Bush - but you'll have to do hell a of a lot better against me.<br>

I think you are seriously disllusioned about the Iraqi perceptions of US.  If US does rebuild them like Germany/Japan (highly unlikely), that does not change the fact that they still hate Americans.  In best case scenario, you will end up with another Saudi Arabia on your hands, in worst case scenario - I dont dare to imagine...<br>
<br>
Your perceptions about the rebuilding of Germany and Japan are severely misguided - you seem to hold them in some sort of hallowed admiration.  Its been 55 years, and it hasn't happened since.  I think it's time for you to realize that those events were exceptions rather than the rules and move on.  Rejoin the rest of us in reality, please.  And bring Caledhon and Wenin with you.<br>

That's not the point, the point is that &quot;not being a maniacal dictator&quot; doesn't get you jack fucking shit in this world, not even from America.  The fact that you even bring it up just shows how badly you are stretching for explanations and rationalizations.  History is fraught with many examples when democratically elected, moderate leaders who were genuinely interested in the welfare of their countries got dicked by US.<br>
<br>
What you need to do is to get off the GOP teat and rationally examine the situation, rather than watching through the rose tinted glasses of republicans.  Very likely that I won't be on this board a year from now on, which is a shame because then I can throw a &quot;I told you so!&quot; in your face while Iraq is rotting to hell and Americans are beating the shit out of terrorist penguins in Antarctica.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  I never brought this up, but it grates on my nevers.  What the hell is wrong with your spelling and grammar?  Seriously, do you have a learning disability or what?  I mean, I don't want to call you stupid although many of us are seriously thinking that.  Frankly, it frightens me that they let guys like you actually crunch numbers on my taxes.  No wonder this country is in so much deficit.<br>

Well since you did not pick it up in the previous posts and completly started spouting off drivel about something that had nothing to do with what I was saying. <br>
<br>
Look at Afganistan, Then look at all the little shithole Latin American countries, Now compare them to Iraq...Whats not the same?<br>
<br>
Iraq has a readily available resource in which to gain the capita to rebuild their country. This in conjucture with the U.S. should make a strong foundation, for what could be another dominant Pro U.S. power in the middle east.<br>
<br>
Invading a country like Syria, and fucking everything up there would leave us with a destroyed country with no resources to rebuild itself on.....Hence why we chose Iraq first.<br>

No I will explain once more, just for you Merton.<br>
<br>
The scare of &quot;terrorism&quot; is about the same as the scare of &quot;communism&quot; was in the United States. Nearly all Arab states hate America, However some of them (Syria) openly endorse &quot;terrorism&quot;, Allowing us to label them as &quot;terroristic&quot; states...Much like how we labled some countries &quot;Communistic&quot;  states, And then toppled their goverments, even though they were not really all &quot;communists&quot;.<br>
<br>
Thats where the comparison comes in Merton, In how the American people percieve this threat. <br>

LOL, you are so fucking dense.  You think that Iraq will be different because they have a wealth of natural resources?  Here's a newsflash, Japan has practically NO natural resources to speak of.  Japan has to import most of it coal, steel, oil and food, etc.  If Japan can become the second biggest economic powerhouse in the world although it has practically no natural resources of its own what does that say?  It says that your notion that just because Iraq has oil, that it will be instantly wealthy and prosperous and democratic is FALSE.  You couldn't be farther from the truth.  What will most likely happen is that wealth of natural resources will not go to benefit Iraqi people and Iraqi infrastructure - most likely it will get abused and usurped by whatever puppet government that is set up there.  At least its unlikely that Americans would stick another Platt Amendment into the Iraqi constitution and if they do - Iraqis can always flip them off.  Not like Americans can afford to stand around in Iraq forever.<br>
<br>
The secret to success for the Japanese and Germans has not been natural resources.  Coincidentally, these 2 countries have an extremely high work ethic amongst its people.  Which is why they have been able to do great things with what has been given to them.  It is a work ethic that is lacking in a lot of arab countries, primarily because their attitudes and lifestyles are different from Japan and Germany.<br>
<br>
If it can be done in Japan, then technically it can be done in Afghanistan, right?  Both countries are/were war ravaged, both countries have little to no natural resources of their own, yet something is missing, the magical component, the ultimate pixie dust...  Once you factor in the different attitudes to work in Japan and Afghanistan - you will see why Japan can prosper and Afghanistan can't (at least not in any forseeable future, if ever).  It's the same reason that Japan and Germany can prosper and Iraq can't.  It has to do with the character of the people, not natural resources.<br>
<br>
Now I know what your reply will be:  &quot;If  poor Joppan kan bikome a wurld ekunomik pover than oil rich Airak kan too!&quot;  Let me cut you off right there before your complete ineptitude in your own native tongue makes me dizzy.  Like I told you before, resources have little to nothing to do with how well a country rebuilds and develops.  You have countries like Japan who have to import practically all their raw materials and food and yet are still one of the most powerful nations in the world.  And then you have countries like Russia which is probably one of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources, but is too incompetent to do anything about it.  The only reason it even stays on the world stage is because of nuclear weapons.<br>

You just dont get it, do you?  Communism needs to have a state to be a possible threat.  Terrorism does not.  10 communists passing out leaflets in downtown New York doesn't mean much.  10 terrorists ramming jets in downtown New York into buildings kill 3,000+.  You don't fight terrorism the same way you fight communism.  Do you know why?  Because they are 2 completely different things that can't be compared.  Once again, communism is a form of government.  Terrorism is a political tool.  Terrorism can be an aspect of communism (actually, it can be an aspect of almost any government or be completely independent), but it cant be compared to communism.  Like a wheel is part of a car, but you can't compare the car to a wheel.  Terrorism can be implemented in nearly every form of government as a political tool and a policy tool.<br>
<br>
That is why you can't fight terrorism the same way you fight communism.  You can't hope to contain it, you can't hope to root it out and destroy it.  Communism operates on the Rational Actor Model, it has a genuine interest in self-preservation.  The terrorists do not.  Understand?<br>

As for rebuilding Germany, the German and Swiss are well known, at least here, for being a hard working people producing solid high qualify stuff. Surely that ability along with a strong industrial tradition helped a lot during rebuilding. <br>
<br>
I would generally agree with Merton that it's going to be far harder to reorganize Iraq than Germany and Japan, partly due to the missing (industrial) working culture, partly due to the ethnical mix problems not present in Germany or Japan.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Iraqi oil is a bonus which might accellerate the rebuilding process. But it won't help much if those oil resources are controlled by foreign companies, be it US or other companies. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

---------------------<br>
<br>
And you're right, I did overlook (unintentionally) that Japan's sea access gave it a huge advantage.  However, you don't need to have access to the sea to be prosperous and you dont need to have natural resources.  The point still stands though, if a landlocked country with no natural resources (e.g. Switzerland) can become prosperous, so can in fact any country (given that are lesser countries that can be exploited).  The crucial factor is the character and structure of their society and their work ethic.  The work ethic that exists in Japan and Germany, the work ethic that DOES NOT exist for the most part in Islamic countries.  Oil will not be a substitute for determination to be successful.  It really serves no purpose to belabor this point any longer as it seems that we have reached an impasse.  Looks like we will just have to find out how it turns out in a year.<br>
<br>
Work ethic is not a resource like oil.
