I truly believed that once you were banned you wouldn't return.  I thought maybe this time he will stick to his guns(because he was forced to) .  <br><br>It's to bad the moderators of this board went ahead and coddled you like a rich kids parents.  You will never learn conviction, self worth, or loyalty.  This is a sad day for you Loegan, you willalways be a bandwagon hopper with no nuts to stand behind your beliefs.  <br><br>As much as you might like to convince all of us that you have any shred of manlihood, you can't.  You have proven how gutless and babied you need to be.    <p><hr><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26730"target="_blank">Xavre X`Vicious ~ Tribunal </a><br><a href="http://transcended.okcforum.org/" target="_blank">Transcended</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujonlee2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jonlee2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/02 4:02:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Didn't that fucktard start his own board??  </span><hr size=1> Didnt Transcended disband? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaatlaarsolthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aatlaar Sol Thule</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ioms.homestead.com/files/R.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>POVAR SUCKS</span><br>  Posts: 930<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/02 4:53:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Didn't that fucktard start his own board??</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.themall.currantbun.com/hogansheros/sound1.wav">www.themall.currantbun.com/hogansheros/sound1.wav</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://larryhovis.homestead.com/files/1lh.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uaatlaarsolthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aatlaar Sol Thule</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ioms.homestead.com/files/R.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/19/02 4:54:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uladmovonwallace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ladmovonwallace</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 768<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/02 6:37:50 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.send4fun.com/IMAGES/bassethound_playingbanjo_lg_clr.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Didn't that fucktard start his own board??</span><hr size=1> aat we knew that <p>retired poo slinger</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 980<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/19/02 8:16:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Didn't that fucktard start his own board??</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Loegan you said you were never coming back.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Do you fuckin retards ever get anything right?
