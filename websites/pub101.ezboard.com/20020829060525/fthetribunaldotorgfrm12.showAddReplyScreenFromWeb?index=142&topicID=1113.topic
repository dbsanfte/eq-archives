One was my grandfather, who I was very close to. Quadruple bypass surgery, he comes through with flying colors. He makes it through the 72 hour 'critical' period or whatever, still strong and recovering. Doctors then decide he doesn't have to be on his high blood pressure medicine which he'd been on for 28 years. One week later he was dead. In fact where I live Jefferson Hospital is so notoriously bad that there was a multi-car pileup right down the street from it...they life flighted everyone to another hospital 28 miles away rather than take them to jefferson. I know, I was in the ER waiting room at the time and talked to the paramedics (who were watching the news going 'hey there I am')<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Is Jefferson a Certified Level 1 Trauma Center?  Because in most severe motor vehicle accidents, we have to take patients to a Level 1 Trauma center, we can't pick the nearest hospital.<br>

This is very true, the biggest example I can think of is that our Normal Saline flush tubes used to be in a package nearly identical to our Albuterol tubes.  Basically, you had to stop and read the package, because the chemical name was in small letters along the bottom.  Now most stuff is color coded for ease, but this problem still exists.<br>

I have had to argue for nurses to do regular checks on diabetic patients' blood sugars before they are approved for a five hour transport.  There are some nurses who are great, and some who suck.  Usually, it's the new ones that keep the best records because they are paranoid.  But this is a problem.<br>

<br>
This is notorious in the health field.  High hours and low pay for the majority of the low end health care positions.  Most ambulance workers in my state make less money than the people who sell them lunch.  The good part of this is that people who work for ambulance companies here do it usually because they want to and not for the money.<br>

I agree with this, I've seen placebos function better than the drug it's supposed to be.  But in some cases the placebo does nothing.  It's not a rule of medicine, but an exception that the placebo works, but if you look at a legal aspect, you will get in more legal problems for giving a placebo presented as a treatment for a disease that ends up resulting in a patient's demise than you will prescribing a medication that ends up not working on the patient.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No one has really said anything about the possibility of it being hereditary. Holdan and Dvin, could you give some insight into that theory? Couple of options, as I see it. One is that it is genetic. Period. Not the best answer, in my opinion. Another one, the one I believe is best, is that heredity gives some people a more genetic disposition to cancer, and not taking appropriate measures to avoid it (Excercise, vitamins, etc.) are the real cause. Another option is that it is not hereditary at all, plain and simple. That covers the whole spectrum. In simpler terms, It is hereditary, or it is partially hereditary, combined with a poor lifestyle, or it is not hereditary at all. Again, I don't pretend to have the answer, just my own ideas on the subject.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There is sufficient evidence to support the theory that cancer is as hereditary as heart disease, where it's not necessarily directly hereditary but instead that family medical history is a huge factor in determining risk factors.  I can get articles on it if you really want it, but this has been an accepted theory for a while.<br>
<br>
Now to Dvin -<br>
<br>
Sorry for the abrupt stop in posting, a buddy of mine just got accepted into a college that he was really excited about, and I got wrapped up here and was almost late to the party.  Then I spent the last few days looking at the campus, so I was out of town.  Here we go -<br>

<br>
Your study and figures as documented in the footnoting refer to a study done over 10 years ago.  Read the footnoting and reasearch the data, the author is quoting an estimate done by a legal firm specializing in medical malpractice lawsuits on data gathered circa 1990.  Footnotes 8-10 all reference the same study, do some research on it and see what legal firm did it and what major lawsuits they have filed in the following 2-3 years.  It's old info.  It's not to date, and the author is rehashing stuff that's already been brought foreward.  In fact, that article is nearly a reprint of the 1993 article in which the information was gathered.  What I'm presenting is that if you had an organization without motivation to skew figures doing the research, it would be more believable.  I do not think using a legal firm who sues people over medical malpractice suits is a good entity to conduct an unbiased poll on how the medical field behaves.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, in reading the article, it talks a lot about economic inequality - why didn't you talk about that?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Just thought you might be interested in that, not everyone has a PDR. For the life of me I can't find this one article I know I had...was about a conference that happened when all the big wigs of medicine and psychiatry got together once and for all to classify ADD/ADHD and treatment for it. After the conference they concurred that 'we don't know anything more than we did, and that's a lot of nothing'. I'll have to hunt for it tomorrow.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The only part of this argument I'm going to concede to you is that it's overdiagnosed.  It's like being Bipolar was in the 70's and 80's, everyone who can't behave in school was Bipolar.  I think that Ritalin is over perscribed, and I don't think that everyone with ADD has ADD, but I do think that some people who have it, have a disorder that is sometimes cured by Ritalin.<br>
<br>
Here is the problem I have with what you have said, Dvin -<br>
Approximately 80 percent of lethal heart attacks can be prevented with prompt treatment (within 12 hours of onset of symptoms) available at most hospitals.<br>
<br>
Approximately 90 percent of fatal Strokes and TIAs can be prevented with prompt treatment (within 4 hours of onset of symptoms) available at most hospitals.<br>
<br>
These treatments cannot be administered after the window of opportunity has been passed.  What you are advocating is that doctors are going to kill you and not let you know what is going on because they haven't learned anything in school.  I fully admit that a healthy diet can't do you much wrong in the health department, but it is my belief that healthy diet and a good working relationship with your doctor go hand in hand for the best medical treatment around.<br>
<br>
If you advocated a good diet alone, I would back you.  But here you have presented that if you have enough oxygen and monitor your pH levels, you are not going to get cancer.  That is simply an unproven hypothesis with no concrete evidence to support it.<br>
<br>
I fully agree when you say ask your doctor to explain everything to you.  Understand that as a patient you have that RIGHT, (as well as the right for treatment without ability to pay) and your other rights are usually posted clearly in large writing near where you enter the hospital.  I strongly advocate that everyone sit and read these next time they are seeing a doctor.  I am constantly frustrated by the number of people who have a medical problem they are taking medication for, but do not know what the problem is or what the medication they are using does.  These are all things that should be done normally.<br>
<br>
If you want to know what I think needs to be done with the medical profession, you should have asked already but I'll tell ya now.  The problem with the medical profession is that I spend approximately 33 percent of my time treating patients and 66 percent of my time writing lengthy paperwork to prevent myself from suffering a lawsuit.  The reality is that the medical profession is nearly paralyzed by the mounting costs of fighting lawsuits and the fear of the possibility of losing your job for doing something correct, but doing the paperwork incorrectly.  Am I advocating that Medical staff be above the law?  No.  But if you look at the way, say, California law works, someone WITHOUT ANY MEDICAL TRAINING can do more harm to you than someone with medical training and be protected from lawsuits via the Good Samaritan law.  Basically, you are only liable if you do something that someone with your training would know better than to do.  If you are walking down the street and your sole medical knowledge is that you have watched ER 3 times and you do something that directly leads to a patient's death, you have little to worry about via liability.  But Medical Professionals have to constantly worry about every step they make from a liability issue instead of a medical issue.  If we could look at patients and go &quot;He needs this, let's do that&quot; instead of &quot;He needs this, let's see how we can give him that and do it legally, then do a bunch of paperwork in case he reacts poorly to the medication and sues&quot; perhaps the medical care in this country would be better.  Examine the figures for lawsuits regarding medical practices, and you will see that the United States has the most medical lawsuits filed in the world... maybe that's the reason sometimes health care here can suck.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I have to go to work now, and work to keep our #3 leading cause of death rates up.  I'll check this thread later.<br>

<br>
That applies to federally funded hospitals, but private hospitals can and do turn people away based on their ability to pay. Of course, the laws vary from state to state and maybe no hospitals can turn away patients in your state, but they can in some (New York comes immediatly to mind).<br>
