I don't know the band or even listen to their music, so I can't say if you are right or wrong on that. I do think that they must have known their fans at home would pissed and they said it anyway and they haven't backed down even now, so I have a little more faith in their conviction than you.<br>
<br>
I understand in way what you mean, but this isn't a private matter that only concerns US citizens like Clinton's affair with Monica. This is a global issue that effects everyone, so everyone should be able to say their peace, no matter where they happen to be.<br>
<br>
I also support the people who are burning Dixie Chick CDs and calling radio stations demanding them to not play their songs. That is also as American as apple pie and I have no problem with it. It is a form of protest and protesting IS american.<br>
<br>
But that's just my view. <p><br>

<br>
I liked the Dixie Chicks...mind you...LIKED...until I heard this coming home.  Most Texans (if I can go by the calls that were coming from listeners on the music stations) are ready to boycott their concert, and asking for their music to not be played anymore.<br>
<br>
I think they should realize why they are able to voice their opinions so readily.  And realize how we got that...from people dying and fighting for that freedom and privilage.  <br>
<br>
I respect your opinion to not agree with someone.  But what I think is truly disgraceful is not showing the President any type of respect at all.   You may not like him.   I know I did not like Bill Clinton.  But I never ever would have shown him disrespect, simply because he was our President.  I am sorry if that doesn't carry any weight with those big mouthed movie stars or the Dixie Sows, but it should.  First and foremost they should be Americans.  Oh well, thanks for showing your true colors, for I know I will NEVER buy another record of yours (or see another movie or television show of yours as the case may be).<br>
<br>
I normally just watch silently from the sidelines.  But I had to comment on this because I can honestly say I am ashamed they are from my beloved state of Texas.   <br>
<br>
Oh, and for the record.  Most people in Texas LOVE George W.  We LOVE our military troops.  We LOVE the stars and stripes.  And we LOVE our country.  God Bless America.<br>

I agree 100% and I think the DCs too as they stated support for the troops. You see, that's a lesson the US learned from Vietnam I am proud to say - be against the war all you want, but you better damn well support the troops because despite whether the war is justified or not, our troops deserve respect and support.<br>

That's great, but I also hope you realize that people who are against this war also love America and the flag that represents it. Just because I dislike the President and his policies shouldn't mean to you that I dislike my country or form of government.<br>
<br>
George Bush is not America anymore than Clinton was. People protested him plenty and I don't recall anyone questioning their patriotism because of it. <p><br>

<br>
I just think this is more hatred of a Republican President, then it is for the war.  Why I just have to wonder about all these that have suddenly found their 'voices' now.<br>
<br>
And sorry, again, you may not like the man and what his ideologies are, but you should have respect for the office.  I  just don't see that from you or those big mouthed elite who think money makes them more knowledgeable about world affairs.<br>
<br>
And if everyone of you who are so 'vocal' about being 'anti-war' wish to show support for our troops, then have 'troop support rallies' or something that says something about our men and women fighting for us.    Don't go to Irag and have a love in with Saddam (i.e. Sean Penn).  Or don't sit there and say I don't support the war when our people are already over there.   Sorry, but doesn't seem to supportive of our country to me.  <br>

As for me, I have nothing but respect for those who enlist to defend my country. This war with Iraq may not be what they signed up for, but they follow the President's orders and risk their lives out of loyalty their homeland (the pay sucks I am ashamed to say).<br>
<br>
I can understand your dislike of Bush, the man who is giving the orders, but I really don't understand your dislike of our troops. Do you expect those who disagree with this war to become deserters? <p><br>

Right now I'm not sure what to think, as I've posted before it's not because I'm a pacifist, it's the way this is happening. This isn't a war worth fighting, this isn't a war worth killing for - the negative consequences far exceed any possibly positive outcome. And while of course you american do look with pride at your troops, I have no reason to and subsequently won't do the same.<br>
<br>
Seeing that people posting to this thread actually means freedom of political disagreement only applies domestically is pretty disturbing, and if that is a common view it's rather fucked up to put it very diplomatically. But hey, one of my friends here where I live is Jim - he's from Boston, he's also scared and ashamed of what Bush is doing and is expressing it her in Norway. Want his name and address so you can mess with his family perhaps ? <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
I see him as an ignorant person who cares about nothing of the lives of Americans because he doesn't agree with our government, yet blindly talks about how Americans are going to end up killing &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of &quot;innocent&quot; Iraqi troops. You disagree? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 3/14/03 6:36:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadaetidalstorm>Jadae Tidalstorm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~jadae/pain.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 6:03:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=492.topic&index=33>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dixie Chicks are playing my song</span><hr size=1> wow the blood is thick in here today.

In no way shape or form.  You mean nothing to us in that respect, or any other actually.  Your sarcastic, sharp tongued comments only fuel why many Americans feel the same about you folks as you do about us.  You taunt us, and call us names, and say we are arrogant SOBs.

Now one thing that gets my goat more then anything is people who completly do not understand anything...<br>
<br>
No one said the Dixie chicks CANT say anything, No one said our right to free speach only aplies domesticly. What we said was its pretty shitty that they run too another country and bad mouth the president and some of thier own fans, For what? To be aplauded over there?<br>
<br>
Can you see what a petty a crappy thing that is walk? Or does Eruope just think that kind of crap is ok? <br>

Mother of god you are sad Walk...  Talk about stereotyping the entire friggin country because you watched The Godfather and Scarface too often.<br>

You honestly know nothing about Americans as a whole.  Our President, your imaginary friend Jim, and all the figures in movies/sports/music that voice THEIR opinion does NOT actually constitute the rest of the country.  Open your eyes man, realize that there is more out there than the small portion you've been exposed to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1056<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 6:53:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=492.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dixie Chicks are playing my song</span><hr size=1> With all the &quot;daft&quot; people in here(myself included), it's amazing that an intelligent conversation can manage to take place in here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 407<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/14/03 6:57:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=492.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dixie Chicks are playing my song</span><hr size=1> Most europeans have never really met an American, And they draw thier conclusions about us by our movies.

So sitting in a big fat chair earns you respect now ? <br>
<br>
&gt;Most europeans have never really met an American, And they draw thier conclusions about us by our movies. Kind of sad really how easily Hollywood brainwashed them.<br>
<br>
Well some of those i have met on this forum i sure wouldn't want to mention elsewhere, because it wouldn't exactly break the stereoptype, would it ? Guess i'll just blame it on youth and innocence instead.<br>
<br>
Tell you what Dickie : this european has been working his ass off for the last 3 years with a view on the Hollywood sign. I am part of the invisible army that -manufactures- your so precious &quot;freedom&quot;(TM) culture. I'll leave you one thing to think about : the american media is the worse travesty of freedom you can buy. You just have no idea. <br>
<br>
In the meantime you go back replaying your favorite Black Hawk Down DVD and when you feel good about yourself : don't forget to bash the french, the germans, the swedes and next the brits. They sure haven't been insulted enough yet... Difference being : they earned their respect not by bullying the weakest target they could find but by standing against the bully. <br>
<br>
How un-american of me of even exercising my european freedom of speech !<br>
