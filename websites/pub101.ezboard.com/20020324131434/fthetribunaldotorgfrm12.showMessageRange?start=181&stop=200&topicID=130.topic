Here is the truth and I am your mesiah, please dont praise me I like to keep low key while playing Everquest.<br>
<br>
1. That woman that killed her babies, yes she believed in the all mighty but that wasnt why she did it. She killed her children because of a chemical imbalance that sometimes occurs when pregnant people give birth. It is a severe form of depression and it affected her judgment. This occured after each birth but she lost control after the 5 th time<br>
I am sorry I didnt bring this up with the Gman himself I was playing EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  me bad but dont worry while those 5 kids died another 12 were born so its all good.<br>
<br>
2. Evolution. (shortend version)<br>
This occured, you are all actually decendants of a superior race that once lived proudly on the planet you call &quot;Mars&quot; hundreds of million years ago. The planet sufferd unspeakable destruction from some messed up comets and planets that altered gravity, temperature etc forcing people to flee to &quot;Earth&quot; again this was hundred and hundreds million years ago and the earth was much diferent.<br>
<br>
Earth isnt a very stable planet unfortunatly and it seems it is prone to world wide devestation every so often and as such the lands where the people from &quot;mars&quot; lived were basicly washed away 2 times so our history is buried deep, deep under the ocean floor.<br>
<br>
Not everyone died a few people were able to flee but with absolutly no belongings except the knowledge in our minds, we experimented with animals and lower life forms and thus what you know as humanity was born <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  this process took us billions upon billions of years where as we sped it up quite a bit for &quot;Earth borns&quot; we are all part of the same genetic make now adays so again its all good.<br>
<br>
3. Religion/Jesus/Satan/Ganesha etc...<br>
These people actually existed but again lack of education and resources at the time cause people to learn things via the broken telephone way. The people were renegades and were to eager to rush out in this new world trying to get it to our former glory(some became drunk with power)<br>
<br>
We educated the Greeks, Egyptians and basicly anyone that showed an inkling of inteligance and those races became great in a matter of short time. The religious idea came from set of rules we doctord in order to give our &quot;earth born&quot; people a set of values and  beliefs of what is right and wrong<br>
(You have no idea how hard it is to get monkeys to step it up a notch) with our our renegade visionists the world would have fallen into a state of pure anarchy, chaos, destruction (trust me I know what I'm talkin about)<br>
<br>
The problem came along that these people&quot;earth born&quot; became complecant and refused to learn on their own they were happy being followers ( this was bad) With people like jesus and co running around there was also a small group of &quot;True born&quot;(Mars) that traveled what was left of the earth and tought people the sciences of what they knew. Some people that were religious that didnt understand quickly tried to destroy the teachings of these other renegades. Witch burnings, false gods etc (one time In a previous host long ago I was regarded as a fire god by a small city, because I had a lighter with me. These people burnt themselves to death and they're city because they were scared of running from me incase I got mad LOL) well anyways I learned a lesson there and covered it up but thats a different story.<br>
<br>
You have religion thats to us<br>
You have science thanks to us<br>
We are out there<br>
You are part of us<br>
Evolution existst just look around<br>
Religion is good to teach some for right and wrong<br>
Alot of churches are corrupt( this wasnt even something we came up with, people assumed this is what some wanted)<br>
<br>
Yet as they were divided so long ago they remain the same today, each can work together but people (not all) refuse to learn or &quot;evolve&quot; into a new way of thinking but dont worry only time will tell besides you have a few hundred years to mature still (we predicted 3289 as the year of this but you guys did rather well!)<br>

For everyone trying to argue that creationism and evolution can co-exist, i suggest a much simpler and more rewarding task ... constructing a perfect Unified Field Theory model, combining Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Nuclear Physics, Cosmology, Superstring Theory, etc.  <br>
<br>
To the &quot;original thinkers&quot; coming up with the &quot;Where did God come from?&quot; question, he is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end (not literal translations I know, but who cares).  Gee, how do scientists think the universe began?  Once upon a time, in a place far far away, there was all this enormous HEAT and one day ... um ... where did the heat come from? Stephen Hawkings once said, when talking about God and the Big Bang, &quot;God may have created the Universe, but he didn't have much choice about WHEN to create it.&quot; Um, so what?  You don't get out your umbrella until it rains.  <br>

Back to the original topic of jesusfreaks, my friend Richard found an answer to the problem of door-to-door religion peddlers.  One day, little girl knocks on his door. &quot;Sir, may I talk with you for a few minutes about ...&quot; she was holding a copy of the Watchtower in her hand.<br>
<br>
Rich, picking up a loaded Supersoaker.  &quot;You have to leave now.  If you don't, I'll have to soak you down.&quot;<br>
The girl, undaunted, continued her pitch.  Rich gives her a final warning.  She blazes forward.  He starts soaking. By the time she reaches the foot of the stairs (2nd floor apartment), she's totally drenched.  He runs to his front window, just in time to see her jump into her mother's car and see them zoom away.  <br>
<br>
Was he a little cruel? Maybe.  Was some mother a raving lunatic to let her young (maybe 7 or 8 years old) daughter go knocking on doors alone? You bet.  Did they both learn a valuable lesson?  Hopefully.<br>
<br>
No means no.  I don't care if you're selling God, Satanism, or the Brooklyn Bridge ... if I ain't buying, go the hell away.  <br>
<br>
Personally I believe in God, and if I'm wrong, I'll never really know it, will I?  I also believe in super soakers and double barrelled shotguns, so I will try and make sure that I only &quot;share&quot; my beliefs with people who want to hear them  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utalamaycrystalspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talamay Crystalspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/3/01 12:57:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=183>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Question time!</span><hr size=1> Question:<br>

<br>
Besides, the Jehovah's Witnesses don't do that stuff anymore. They were notorious for the &quot;foot in the door&quot; type of methods, but even though they long abandoned that type of aggressive shit, they are stuck with a bad rep. <br>
<br>
When I was working nightshift for a while, I had mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses dropping by every now and then. Since you don't have much of a social life while on nightshift, I welcomed them. I went dead easy on the mormons, cos they were just kids, who didn't know a lot, really had not seen a lot of the world. The mormons were also very pleasant (most mormons I've met, have all been pleasant people; they don't know their religion is a fraud, hell, people walked around thinking the earth was flat, didn't make them bad people). But the Witnesses were really agressive, so I went harder on them. The mormons would say &quot;Oh, we didn't know that!&quot; where the Witnesses would say &quot;That's a lie, and you are going to hell for saying it!&quot; <br>
<br>
Hm, I didn't realize there were actual references to Lilith inside the bible itself? I thought her myth was only described in various other texts, that were not part of the bible per se?<br>
<br>
Did you know the Mormon church is the biggest private land owner in the state of Utah, and that it controls the state's biggest newspaper and television station? And that the mormon controlled Utah supreme court once ruled that the first amendment does not apply in Utah? I once walked into a gas station and tried to buy a six pack of beer, but the lady refused, saying it was too late. I joked and said, &quot;Whatever happened to the land of the free?&quot; and she replied, &quot;This is Utah!&quot; Bwahahaha no shieeeet, lady! <br>

By choosing to be a Christian, I find no doctrination that I am not allowed to question.  I don't have to give up science because I choose Christianity.  I believe that the Bible is the word of God, and to truly understand it, you have to be a history buff, learn Greek and Hebrew, study the psychology of man, study the context of every scriptural setting, compare it to other historical documents, and believe in Jesus as the Christ, God, I AM, the Lamb, Lord, and Savior.<br>
<br>
Now since I don't have time to learn the history of the world or Greek or Hebrew or human behavior (though playing EQ helps with this one) or study ancient documentation and ancient culture... I simply believe through faith.that the foundation of Christianity; and the Bible, is Jesus.<br>
<br>
So we've got this Jesus fellow, who lots of you think is no different than any other great prophet of that day and age.  Some compare him to Confucious or Muhammad or Ghandi.  However, they always leave out one key difference between these chaps and Jesus.  They never claimed they were God.  Jesus claimed he was God, reincarnated on earth.<br>
<br>
Ok, so he thinks he's a deity.  We can at least agree on that point.<br>
<br>
Well, if he claims he's God, then that makes it pretty easy for us... he's only left us with 3 options to form our opinion about him:  pathological liar, madman, or God.... or as Josh McDowell puts it (pssst, Rigadoon... his first name is Josh), Liar, Lunatic, or Lord.<br>
<br>
(borrowed from &quot;More Than a Carpenter&quot;)<br>
&quot;Was he a liar?  If, when Jesus made his claims, he knew that he was not God, then he was lying and deliberately deceiving his followers.  But if he was a liar, then he was also a hypocrite because he told others to be honest, whatever the cost, while he himself taught and lived a colossal lie.  More than that, he was a demon, because he told others to trust him for their eternal destiny.  If he couldn't back up his claims and knew it, then he was unspeakably evil.  Last, he would also be a fool because it was his claims to being God that led to his crucifixion...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;...If Jesus wanted to get people to follow him and believe in him as God, why did he go to the Jewish nation?  Why go as a Nazarene carpenter to a country so small in size and population and so thoroughly adhering to the undivided unity of God?  Why didn't he go to Egypt or, even more, to Greece, where they believed in various gods and various manifestations of them?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yah, good points.  They persuaded me to at least say that Jesus wasn't a Liar.  Its a logistical nightmare.  Nothing makes sense to show that Jesus was a Liar, so I will believe that (at least on purpose) he didn't lie about his belief that he was God.  Maybe he was just lying about it through some sort of schizophrenia or mental illness?  Which brings us to the 2nd &quot;L&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was he a lunatic?  Someone who believes he is God sounds like someone today believing himself Napoleon.  He would be deluded and self-deceived, and probably he would be locked up so he wouldn't hurt himself or anyone else.  Yet in Jesus we don't observe the abnormalities and imbalance that usually go along with being deranged.  His poise and composure would certainly be amazing if he were insane.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;C. S. Lewis writes: 'The historical difficulty of giving for the life, sayings and influence of Jesus any explanation that is not harder than the Christian explanation is very great.  The discrepancy between the depth and sanity . . . of His moral teaching and the rampant megalomania which must lie behind His theological teaching unless He is indeed God has never been satisfactorily explained.  Hence the non-Christian hypotheses succeed one another with the restless fertility of bewilderment.'&quot;  you go boy! &lt;--inserted humor, you don't have to laugh.<br>
<br>
Third &quot;L&quot;:<br>
Lord and God.  &quot;The issue with these three alternatives is not which is possible, for it is obvious that all three are possible.  But rather, the question is 'Which is more probable?'  Who you decide Jesus Christ is must not be an idle intellectual exercise.  You cannot put him on the shelf as a great moral teacher.  That is not a valid option.  He is either a liar, a lunatic, or Lord and God.  You must make a choice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The evidence is clearly in favor of Jesus as Lord (using the Bible as a historical document).  Some people, however, reject this clear evidence because of moral implications involved.  They don't want to face up to the responsibility or implications of calling him Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
I made my choice for my belief in Jesus.  I think he's God.  Although like the author of this book says, regarding moral implications and responsibility... you can talk about God or &quot;A greater power&quot; with any Joe Shmoe all you want, and have a perfectly good conversation with them like two normal rational people.  But if you say Jesus instead of God, they'll instantly close up and stop talking, or they'll just blatently say they don't believe in that hocus pocus.  Occasionally, they'll become visibly agitated and more aggressive.<br>
<br>
That one name can have so much power over people confirms my decision every day, and is the basis for my faith and beliefs.  Go read your newspaper tomorrow, check the date.  Specifically check the year.  That number is there because of Jesus.<br>

<br>
Which is based on a logic principle called &quot;Occam's Razor&quot; which I probably mis-spelled. The concept is, and I'm paraphrasing, that &quot;the explanation which fits all known facts is the most probable truth&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Before you trying argueing against creationism (God), try looking at how flimsy the pro-evolution arguments are, and how much of evolution's &quot;evidence&quot; has all ready been disproved (though much of it is still being taught).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not all non-Christians are evolutionists. I am pagan and a creationist. I believe that there was divinity present in the creation of the multiverse, but I don't suscribe to the belief that there is only on God (or that Muhammed was his prophet, either).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways. I think that there is a lot of good in the Christian religion. I think a lot of good things got lost in the years due to corrupt religious leaders. I mean, hell King James (which I've had MANY people tell me is _THE_ only version of the Bible which is inspired by God... now that's fucked up shit...) was not a nice guy at all. A lot of phrases that are in that regarding such things as divine right, were put in at his order to the translators to strengthen his hold on the political situation of the day. Real unbiased version. (*nods sagely*)<br>
<br>
I think the elements of ritual that the Catholic church use are beautiful. The way they sancitfy their holy places to separate real life from worship is amazing. The beauty in their cathedrals is astounding. And the lack of faith in most of the congregations is ... well, frankly, disgusting. I've met a lot of people, and most Catholics I know don't know jack about the Bible and are only concerned about going to Mass and Confession so they don't go to hell and proceed with doing the things the church damns so highly.<br>
<br>
I think some of the other traditions such as the Baptists are inherently cold and heartless (this is the tradition I was raised in, and abandoned). The worship ceremonies are unchanged year after year and everyone is somber and dour. There's very little life in their worship, and very little spirit in their spirituality. Talking religion with them is, in my years of experience, almost like talking politics. Dry and boring.<br>
<br>
The two groups of people I have a lot of respect for are the neo-Christian mystics and the Pentecostals. The Pentecostals are the ones that hold most of the same views as Baptists, but they're the ones that are into speaking in tongues and everything else. Man, maybe they're crazy, but when they get down to worship, you FEEL it. There's life and joy in what they do, and I gotta respect that shit. Hey, maybe they're wrong, but I give them mad props for actually caring about it and acting on it.<br>
<br>
The neo-Christian mystics are basically neo-Gnostics... people who believe in the meta-physical but believe that the metaphysical powers (spells, healing hands, whatever you want to call it) can be used for good and SHOULD be used... not just something that is either a miracle or came from the devil. I met one of these a few years back in Providence and had a VERY interesting discussion with him. We talked, as a follower of the Druidic path and a Christian mystic, and we shared many elements of belief in common. I respect that, and the way he lived.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now... on to the last thing I wanna say...<br>
<br>
There's a big fucking difference between a Christian and a Jesusfreak. There's a lot of Christians who will show you what they believe and why by how they live and will answer what you ask if you ask but don't forcefully try to proselytize. I respect this. Jesusfreaks, on the other hand, are those little dickwads who actively go up to people on the street and tell them &quot;Do you believe in Jesus? No? Then are you aware that you're going to burn in hell for eternal damnation if you do not accept the good Lord as your personal savior?&quot; They're the people I despise.<br>
<br>
Similarly, while there are many things in the Islamic faith that I respect and admire, the concept of jihad is abhorrent to me. The Crusades, Inquisition... Islamic wars... it all sucks and shows how uncivilized some of these fanatics were, and some modern day followers still are.<br>
<br>
So... I will respect the Christian religion. And I will respect the Islamic religion. But when any one of their proponents fucks up, damn right I'm gonna slam them. Now that's assuming that they claim their actions were inspired by their religion. I'm not going to call a person who kills another person a Jesusfreak because they're a christian, unless they bring their religion into it (ie, that Elijah fuckwad). Similarly, I would expect (and probably be disappointed) to not have the fact that I'm pagan brought into it if I ever snapped and did something that landed me in jail.<br>

I don't think that God is going to damn me to hell for wearing my hair long, dancing, or partaking in the evils of Rock and Roll, but I like to think that there IS a special place in the afterlife for folks like Hitler.  I think that the few real monsters in this world deserve a place like Hell, but I dont believe a merciful God is going to chuck folks into a Lake of Fire for not getting their ass out of bed on Sunday morning.<br>
<br>
I think if we see sorrow and evil in the world and do what we can to help fix it, we're doing what we can to make the world a better place and we'll each get to spend eternity playing EQ with time enough to get all the phat lewts AND spend two tons of quality time with our loved ones.  IF the religious extremists ARE right, and God is as strict as they make him out to be, then I guess Billy Joel got it right. <br>
<br>
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.  See you all on the Lake of Fire.  I'll be the fella floating around in the asbestos Innertube.<br>
