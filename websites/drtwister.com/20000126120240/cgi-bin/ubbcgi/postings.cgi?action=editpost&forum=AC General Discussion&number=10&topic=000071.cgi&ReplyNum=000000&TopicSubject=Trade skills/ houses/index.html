<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I read where someone was asking if they make trade skills in AC, what are some different skills people could do.  One idea 
someone cam up with is making armor out leather and as your skill inproved, so would the different type of piecies of armor 
you could make.  A wonderful idea.  Some other ideas might be:

1.  Sowing-  Now befor all you tuff guys roll your eyes, how many of you cook?&lt;G&gt;  In this skill, one could start out making
        the little side carrying  bags and work there way upto pocted belts, hats, large sacks, pockted pance and then even        
different types of backpack.  Why would this be so nice one might ask?  The items you make would look more unique than the 
items that you bought from stores and as your skills grows, the items you make would weigh less than the items you buy from 
the store.  Turbine could easily add different type of monsters that would "sometimes" produce a type of material that could be 
sold to seamtrist in use for sowing.  This would add in a small way to more player interaction on selling the material and selling 
of the goods made with the meterial.

2.  Poitions and oils-  I'm not sure if this can be done at the preasent time or not but if it can not, one could do this just like the 
mentioned idea above.  Have rare ingredients turn up from time to time on munsters for people to find and sell to the mages 
who make potions.

3.  Armorer-  I would not want a player in AC to be able to make the mega armor.  However it would be nice if an armorer 
could chose to only learn how to make one type of item.  i.e. a helm or a shield.  An armorer could make unique pieces of 
armor for is allegiance.  It would be nice to see someone walk up with a unique shield and helm like yours and come to find out 
that this person just joined your monarchy.  Like sowing, these items would get lighter as the skill grows.

4.  Scribes-  As of now you can hand someone an item and they can tell you what the item "stats" are.  What if when a scibe 
views an item through a special gem, the itmes "stats" are permanently attached to the item?  These special gems could 
randomly turn up on monsters and be sold to scribes.  After a limited nuber of uses, say 1-5, the item is used up.  Again alot 
more reason for player to player contact.  As a player advanves in Scribe, so would his ability to read the stats on higher level 
items.

5.  Jewler-  You can now find or buy jewlry.  What is a person could make jewlry.  Lets say Docter Bombay the jewler takes 
his 5000 pyriels and buys 5000 worth of jewls.  With his handy dandy jewlry kit makes a piece of jewlry worth 5000.  He can 
then sell this to people for the amount he thinks he can get for it.  If Turbine increased the note rate from 10% to 20%, one 
might be wanting to look up the jewler for a 5000 pyriel item for 5300 instead of trading in his 6000 pyriels for 5000 pyriel 
note.

6.  Bowier-  I know that is not the proper name for a person who makes bows so shoot me with the bow your charcter has 
just made!  It looks like the two cl***es that seems to get left out alot is Archers and Vagabonds.  So, how about letting the 
archers make bows.  As his skills grows, so would he ability to makes different type of bows.  The different types of bows 
could arrage from just looks to effectiveness and weight rating.

7.  Wands-  When I say wands I do not mean the one that comes with the instant unlimted fireballs.  I'm merly talking about a 
different looking wand in someone hand.  As a maker of wands, you skill would allow you to make different lookin wands that 
look more stunning to other people.  Imagine what you would think as you see tha 30 level war mage walk into town with a 
long sleek black rod with a bulls skull on the tip and the eyesglowing or that life mage with his long white wand with a unique
symbol that can only be made by the v***al in his allegiance who happens to be a Jewler!  The items that are used to make the 
wands again would randomly and rarely be found on creatures.

This is only the beggining to what could be done.  Most what you read above envoled people as young as level one in maybe 
finding the items to as old as people want to achieve in the game.  Now imagine someone who has found or bought roughly 10 
of these didderent type of items.  He goes and buys several leaflets and prints in the that there will be an auction on each of the 
items outside of town soo and soo at a certian time.  Everything I mentioned above WOULD inprove player to player relation 
and that can only be a good thing.

Last but not least his houses.  Has anyone heard if Turbine will let people own and or build houses on down the road?
If so, that is another area that one could create many different types of skill to make the world of Derth fill like home.</TEXTAREA>
