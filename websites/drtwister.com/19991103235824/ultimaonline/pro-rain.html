<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">The Rainman
Debate</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To begin, everyone
must realize that Rainman is NOT an OSI employee. I solicit interview
requests during the UOHoC chats that occur on IRC. Since this
post was made, Rainman made an open statement that his entire
conversation was a fabrication. To this day, we still don't know
why he chose to lie to me in an open and supposedly honest interview
setting.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt; </FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial">Are you open for a chat?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Sure<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> only for the next 30 minutes or
so however</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Ok... thanks for taking the time<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Let's start off simple... what
is your Job description at OSI?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Job Description? Mostly just a
volunteer, slave laborer kind of thing. Den Dragon doesn't even
pay me</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> What do you do daily?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Truthfully? Mostly HTML work for
the website</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Daily updates? Stories? how much
email do you get a day?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I do get quite a bit of e-mail,
and the subjects really vary<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I do HTML work all over the site<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> sprucing up this here, that there<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> little bit of everything really<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I once got an e-mail from someone
asking me to fix their client for them, it's funny how e-mail
can get misdirected by the user</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> For those who don't know, what
site / sites do you work on?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, because of employment restrictions,
I can't say exactly where I work, but I can tell you that I have
ftp access to an OWO server, and that I use it to do CGI and HTML
work<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> that's about all I can say on the
specifics of the webwork that I do</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> So you work for a company under
contract with OSI and do regular HTML updates because OSI employees
don't have the extra time?<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> No, I said I was a volunteer<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I dont have a &quot;regular&quot;
employment agreement with anyone in regards to OWO</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> ok... you did mention above, you
got a lot of misdirected email. It's actually rather difficult
for players to get in touch with the correct people, any changes
being planned to help with this?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, frankly, I think most of
the misdirected mail I get is because the person e-mailing isn't
taking the time to figure out who to e-mail it to. I mean seriously...
asking a volunteer HTML worker to fix their client? It's absurd.
I dont see how OWO needs to do much to fix it, as it's not really
my problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, you are correct, it's not...
but on the broad scale, you have a customer who doesn't know why
his client isn't working<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> he may be frustrated and looking
for help from anyone he can get through to</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Oh, I'm not saying I dont try to
help them, but far beit from me to actually give good advice on
fixing the client. I dont even play UO anymore, I mean seriously.
EQ is just shooting up there so fast, and it's more fun. (you
didn't hear that from me)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I know it's not your position or
duty to answer these types of email, but maybe OSI should look
at that situation in a way to improve their customer relations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I think we have someone doing that,
I couldn't tell you their name tho as I dont remember it. I've
only dealt with him once... <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> And, believe it or not, I do take
the belief that it's not the customer relations dept that suffers
quite so bad, but the customers that really blow it all out of
purportion when they can't get what they want.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> why do you think that?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, cmon, it's just a game. It's
leisure activity. I mean, if this were the banking industry, then
I could understand large frustration with the customer relations
department. But this is something people do in their spare time.
It should never be so important where we go out of our way to
bash the customer relations of a game company. Seriously.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Ok, but the Customer is paying
9.95 a month to play a game.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> What happens if you go to a restaurant
and get bad service<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> what happens if you go to the movie
theater and the film breaks and you don't see anything</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, then I might complain</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> These are both leisure activities
that we all do in our spare time<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> The moment we begin paying for
a service<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> we should be entitled to a certain
level of quality<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> The game industry has never experienced
this before<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> UO, EQ are the first of their kind</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, I dont pay to fly a kite,
and that's a leisure activity. Why not instead take the stance
of &quot;finding something else&quot; to do with ones time when
one leisure activity doesn't work right?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> But customer service is something
that will only become harder in the future. The more spare time
we spend, and the more money we pay to be entertained.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Because playing a game is something
fun, and in this situation, we can't play without paying.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Why pay money to even be entertained?
I mean the real entertainment comes from interacting with other
people... that doesn't cost money.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, in that situation you have
me</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> One last quick question....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> okay, I doo need to get going</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> What is the deal with the counters
on the front page? The ones that tick the time, and player count..
etc.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> There is no way they are accurate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Actually, they're perfectly accurate,
I did some of the CGI work there<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> the entire site takes stats directly
off the OWO game servers</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> but they are calculated in perfect
rythm. It's hard to believe that they advance at the same rate
at all hours of the day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Well, it would appear to me, and
I'm not an expert on how they work, but it would appear to me
that they're counting minutes up for each shard<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> over a months time<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> They're accurate<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I need to go<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> I apologize for bowing out early<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> Farewell</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> No Problem<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Arial">&lt;DrTwisTer&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> thanks for spending the time with
me</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Arial">&lt;Rainman&gt;</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Arial"> sure thing</FONT></P>
