<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">	There I was playing
my character on GL, not doing much of nothing except messing around
looking for real estate space, when I come upon what I think is
a good little spot.  Well, after trying a couple of times and
it not placing (and in-between killing the local wildlife and
monster spawns) I run back to it, screenshot it, and mark it.
 Along comes this guy named KiLlA K3wLd0oD.  I thought people
like this stupid didn't exist anymore, but hey, when you are so
unoriginal you can't even make up a name, go figure.  Now, I'm
playing my 1 1/2 year old character, so I'm not too worried about
being PK'ed or stolen from as I can CMA.  I decide to say &quot;Hail&quot;,
and it starts.  He goes off on some kind of rant about how the
&quot;jackass role players make this game so shitty&quot; and
alot more verbal expletives.  I tell him as polietly as possible
that all I did was say &quot;Hail&quot;, which was about the length
of most of my conversations in game.  He keeps it up for a while,
and finally I get the &quot;KiLlA K3wLd0oD is attacking you!&quot;
 OK, I can handle this.  I put a couple of ebolts into his ass
and he runs a couple of steps and drops from war mode and just
stands there.  I was cool with this, as I don't like to kill anyone,
PK or not, it just sucks, and I guess you'd call me a pacifist.
 So I start talking to him about &quot;how really dumb it is to
attack someone to PK them if you are alone&quot;.  Nothing.  No
response.  So I say &quot;hello, you there?&quot;  Nothing again.
 I tell him I'll watch his character till he can get unlocked
or logged back in (like he'd have seen it anyway), and then I
heal him back to 100%.  Just as the last heal went off, POOF,
I'm in jail!!!  Well, the proverbial WTF comes from my mouth,
as I find myself standing in front of GM Jerk Off, or something
like that.  Anyway, he tells me that I have been put in jail for
&quot;harrasing&quot; other players.  I try to hold back my explosion
(which my wife got the full brunt of), and ask how he knows I
was harrasing someone.  He said that he had gotten a page from
a player naming me a being &quot;verbally abusive&quot;.  Well
I tell him that I can send him my journal from the past hour to
prove it wasn't me and he agreed, which shocked me knowing how
GM's are about abuse.  After a while of this back and forth, he
gets my email, checks it out and says, OK I'll send you back,
but don't do it again.  Well I end up in Britain, and I INSTANTLY
recall back to that spot, and there he is.  He sees me and bolts.
 One paralyse, and he was stopped cold.  I ask him why he reported
me, and he starts spewing about how that was the spot for his
house, and he hates role players, and bug users, etc, etc, etc.
 Well, I gave him no hint that I was any of this, and then he
starts BRAGGING about how if I had gotten banned, it would have
been his 15th ban reported and confirmed.  After much more aggrivating
chat and a few more paralyses, I find out he's friends with 3
GM's and attends a bunch of OSI player luncheons and they &quot;listen
to him&quot; when he suggests a player be banned.  He does it
on every shard with a different character name on each, and it's
how he &quot;has fun&quot;.  I grinned at him and said not anymore
as I was sending the entire journal log to the GM I just spoke
with, paged a GM myself, after half an hour of keeping him pinned
there, he blinked away.  I asumed to &quot;jail&quot;.  Well,
I log on this morning and he's running around<BR>
Brit, passes he and laughs.  Oh well, another ass in with OSI...<BR>
