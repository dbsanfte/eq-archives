Well I just talked with Gaute Godager and here is what he had to say. <br><br>When AO goes live we will have a few new things to do with PvP. <br><br>First: A wider range of PvP level. (It will be lowered from 100 to 75. <br><br>Second: PvP Rating (More to come on this as, when I can actually understand Programmers) <br><br>Third: PvP Title (This will be displayed over the player) <br><br>Fourth: You will be able to loot all the items on a player that they have gained since their last save.</font></blockquote>See the rest of it <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=872a5d2f1686b1129ff6ea821ba8a42e&threadid=3159"class="link2">here</a>.<br>

We are very close to a solution to this problem and when that solution is in place, we will be taking actions against players who use such programs. Unlike most bugs in our game, fixing this problem has proven to be most challenging. We appreciate your patience while we finish the fix.</blockquote></font><br>So it looks like it's getting close, however if you read the first thread, the rumor is out that AC will be banning those caught using Gear. Reality check folks - it is very conceivable that AC can accurately DETECT this program. IF you choose to download and use it, do so only at your own risk.<br><br>One other note... it's about time!<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week a link appeared on this site, which redirected viewers to a different site that resorted to using pornography to talk about Shadowbane. I apologize to those who I offended by allowing the link to appear on my site. My site is about bugs and exploits, but NOT the exploitation of women. This is what I feel the particular page and site had been focusing on. As a husband and father of two daughters, I try to present my views, although sometimes controversial, in a way that is open and entertaining to any gender and age. This style of propaganda is shameful and I apologize for those individuals offended by it. You will not see this style or links to this type of material ever on my sites.<br><br>In addition, the very site that used porn to promote their opinions has on several occasions associated the game Shadowbane with pornography. I feel this is a bad rap that Shadowbane has recently been receiving, and for those who may have been persuaded to believe in this attitude, I would suggest giving Shadowbane a second consideration and look into more of the actual content and not the bad press.<br><br>Thanks!<br>Dr.Twister<br><br>

Insurance Fraud!<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Thursday, May 31, 2001   5:50 PM EST by <a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dipes</a></font><a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Warden stopped by the SB boards today to talk a bit about insurance.  Currently, there is an insurance feature set to be in the game which will allow a guild to retain a good deal of their investment if a building inside a city is razed.  Warden made it clear that insurance does not extend beyond city walls or to the tree of life.  Warden went on to alleviate several posters' concerns about the point of sieging an enemy city if the enemy's investment is not all lost, which is when my tainted opinions began to come to bear.<br><br>Why attack another guild?  Why siege their city?  As Conan said: <br><br><blockquote><i>To Crush your Enemies,<br>See them Driven before You,<br>And Hear the Lamentations of the Women</blockquote></i><br><br>I don't think I can say it any better than that, because those are three very good reasons to do some ole fashioned murderizin'.  Wolfpack has only gone 2/3 the way, however.  Currently  you can crush your enemies, and you can also see them driven before you, but I have heard nothing about lamenting women.  It is for this reason I am going to petition wolfpack to instate hire-a-bride NPC shops.  Sure, the woman trading business hasn't been as strong as usual in the last few years, but perhaps wolfpack is ready to repopen the virtual door to such a lucrative business.  Imagine now that you have just crushed your enemies and they are being driven before you, climbing over their own corpses to escape yet another death.  But wait!  Something is awry.  Although your victory was absolute, you feel that is lacks something.  The order is given, and suddenly a horde of scantily clad women come charging from your war tents onto the battlefield.  Immediately they begin their pre-programmed lament sequence by randomly selecting a corpse of your enemy to cry over, thus completing the battle scene.  If you play an evil character you can emote doing unsavory things to them as well, to further enhance the experience.  <br><br>Head on over to the boards to discuss <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=335&forum=14&0" class="link2">lamenting, crushing, and driving.</a><br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Anarchy-Online Dr.Twister Network is recruiting amongst the common, in search of the elite.  With Anarchy-Online entering beta 4, the dropping of the NDA will lead to a vast amount of information.  We hear at the AO DTN have lots to release, but we also need to stay on top of the next stage, of the game.<br><br>We need two more full time reporters.  Skilled writers, who are capable of pushing the information out of Funcom, and searching for every scrap left on the side.  All applicants must be able to prove their use of the English language, and understanding of the Online Game World.  Finally, they must understand that DTN is not everybody's favorite game network.  We push the game developers like no other site, we do not "suck up" for beta accounts, especially since now the game is about to release.  If you can write, love games, and want to report without restriction on Anarchy-Online, consider this site.<br><br>We also need PvP and Power Leveling strategic writers: those who can give walkthroughs on how to level in Anarchy-Online the fastest.  If you have been beta testing, and consistently leveling fast, then you may want to consider this.  Experience writing walkthroughs before is a plus, but not a necessity.  Those who enjoy PvP, and want to report solely on this area of AO are needed.  Please, if this fits you, consider joining our site.<br><br>If you are interested, and would like more information on how to join us, then please send an email <a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com">here</a> stating what position you would like.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A viewer has been in contact with me and we have chit chatted about what was said at E3. The thread is located <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=17239.topic">HERE</a><br><p><br><blockquote><i>New PVP server<br><br><br><br>- will be released in 2-3 weeks.<br><br><br>- 3 Teams. Based on Religion. Evil, Neutral, and Good. <br><br><br>- These teams will be hardcoded, as in no beneficial spells. They will allow rezzes.<br><br><br>- Factions still play a role, but you only get a faction hit if you kill the guy in his town. IE- a Human SK can kill a human monk in Qeynos, but his faction with qeynos and the monk guild there will go down.<br><br><br></blockquote></i><br>>br><br>This is just part of it, read the thread for more. Looks like my kind of server if i can get past the fact that MOST staff at Verant play on PvP servers. The thought of one finding out who i am and being killed 1102993843 times a day is just not too appealing )<br>

From MindArk<br><br>Time for a new issue of our newsletter to update you on what's <br>happening at MindArk on Project Entropia.  I will keep this section <br>short this time since there is a lot of you to read further down. <br><br>Summer is arriving here in Sweden, but you don't have to worry about <br>it causing any delays in the development of Project Entropia. We will <br>not shut down the office just because it is summer, but will instead <br>continue to forge ahead as quickly as possible.  <br><br>We have seen the traffic at our forum increase a lot, and there are <br>more and more people joining up every day, both of which make us <br>really happy. We will try to catch up with as much as possible on our <br>forum, answering whatever we can.<br><br>Last but not least I'd like to welcome again all the new and old <br>subscribers of Project Entropia Global news.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>2.

Our goal is to <br>update the site every second week starting this week. <br><br>Some updates will have themes; for example, this week's is tools.  <br>Each day this week, we will release some new information about tools. <br>Some days will have graphics, so be on watch for them too.<br><br>We will also have a contest that takes place the week after, June 4 <br>to 9.  Sometime during that week, we will do a secret update of the <br>Project Entropia site that we won't announce.

That is why many of you may not want to read the spoil information that so many sites, including ours, will have up when the NDA is dropped. We will add warnings to pages that may have information you do not want to read. Funcom, reading these results, should make sure they increase design in the missions of the game, and not worry so much on the monsters.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, summer is pretty much officially here.  For many readers of DTN, this marks the beginning of a long summer of Sex, Drugs, and Rock and roll, though techinally without the sex and drugs.  Oh yeah, and video games.  While others are out beefing up their tans, we will be buffing up our avatars.  While they get laid in a drunken stupor by some hot chick in South beach, we will right click 2 stacks of Ol'Tum's fierce brew and then cyber with the innkeep in Kelethin.  This is what summer is about, faithful readers.  Have fun.<br><br>Dipes<br>

We feel that our efforts have been ignored long enough, and therefore have taken drastic measures to ensure that our agenda is met.  We cannot allow the wildlife of this planet to continue to suffer under the oppressive burden of the Omni-Tek strip mining operations.  We cannot allow the plantlife of our beautiful world to choke anymore on the toxins that are dumped into the water and pumped into the air.  The golfe population has declined by half since the arrival of Omni-Tek.  Certain plant life are now extinct.  That is why we have infiltrated the Omni-Tek corporate headquarters and kidnapped one Thorton B. Weatherbury, a Vice President of Omni-Tek and assumedly a resource that is as valuable to the corporation as the safety of the planet is to us.  Mr. Weatherbury will be returned unharmed when the demands that we have forwarded to Omni-Tek have been met.  If they are not met we will be forced to take even more drastic action.  We regret that it has come to this.</font></blockquote>Check out their site <a href="http://r.e.a.l.home.att.net/"class="link2">here</a>.<br>

This is starting to make more sense now.<br><br>The majority believes that GEAR is only truly affecting Darktide. Darktide is obviously only one server being played by a minority group of gamers and as always, PKs opinions don't count. I see it now. Darktide is the one place where you know what you are getting into from the start, and if that means cheating occurs, you should be expecting it. Turbine doesn't care that the players of DT are suffering, it's not really affecting the players who they have to really baby-sit. They don't call them CareBears for nothing.<br><br>Turbine needs to get off their butts now and realize, we on Darktide pay each month just like everyone else.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was emailed to me earlier this week. I had emailed several verant people about this issue and had not 1 reply back. This is the type of stuff Verant needs to abolish. This story comes in the light of the  lead GM, of fennin ro, threatening to suspend or ban MANY of DOA members for asking him to "do his job" and  asking him " What is your supervisors name" Sounds like a kid on a power trip. Read on.<br><p><br><blockquote><i>Hi there,<br><br><br>My name is **************, and I would like to share a short story with you.  <br><br>About 2 weeks after Rhuyai became lead GM on Fennin Ro, We had a little incident that resulted in the unwarranted banning of my account.  I would like my real name to be left anonymous because I don't wish for Rhuyai to be able to know who my current EQ character is, since my new account is registered under my name instead of my mom's. <br><br>Well to make a long story short, through several events, including my account being accessed without my knowledge , by a so called friend and not getting restored, Rhuyai found out that I was not the "owner of my account", and my mom was, through me mentioning something about it while he was investigating the situation. <br><br>My account was banned for 2 years of "continually violating the license agreement by logging onto my mother's account."  I would like you to bring this to the attention of the EQ public .<br><br>I e-mailed three of his supervisors and only got a response from one, Michelle Butler, who also was a very RUDE dead end.  Thank you for your time in reading this, I don't know how to rally any support so maybe you can?<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>**********<br><br>P.S. I lost a 57 Bard and other characters.<br></i><br><p><br> But wait it gets better<br><p><br><i><br>I forgot to mention,in my previouse email that while i was in "gm jail" being "investigated", i started telling my guild everything that was going on in detail.  a few of my guildys started joking around "hey tugor wanna log onto my account?" "sure rayn lets just trade accounts" in guild chat. <br><br>Rhuyai was watching this, yeah reading guild chat, (as well as Axgoreth invis).   He ended up banning Rayn and Suspending Tugor for joking around in guild chat. Right before I was world kicked, they had locked my controls, I couldn't move, backspace, or take screenshots.  All I could do was type.  You might remember those two names, yes I was a member of Defender's of Akanon, and I know you had a little trouble with Gwiz but I wasnt a member till about a week or so after he started to stop playing, I think he finaly got banned. But plz dont let this bias your view.<br><p><br></blockquote></i><br>Ok 1st. I was "sic'ed" on Gwiz...I got nothing against him personaly,so no I wont be biased :)<br><br>lets address an issue here. A GM viewing guild chat and suspending players for making a joke. Now we all know uber guilds share accounts and verant ignores it. But why didnt he ignore it this time WHEN nothing had happened ? Yes he acted on hearsay. Noone had logged into anyones account..So Strike 1 for premature ejac.....well you know.<br><br>Now he bans a guy WHOS A MINOR and therefore in his state CANNOT register for any, I REPEATE, ANY online service. His mother LEGALY HAS to do it for him. So His suspension, based on the GMs reasons, was harassment and possibly a criminal offense since in order to meet the GMs criteria the guy would HAVE TO BREAK THE LAW.<br><br>Verant, you guys have a sweet game, we love it, Loose the staff, replace it. Kick this guy out and replace this poor guys account.<br><br>I find it odd this happens, then the GM threatens to ban MANY DOA. Sounds like the GM has a character on fennin ro as well or a friend whos got his ear.<br><br>I emailed my attorney (yes even I have an attorney, hehe) the particulars of this issue as well as copies of the persons state laws applying to online services. <br><br>Verant has the right to terminate any account at any time for just about any reason. To force someone to break the law to meet the requirments on EQ, since hes a minor, is contributing and possible harassment, Correct me if im wrong Mr.Weiss as im sure you will be asked to read this)<br><br>So we got a power trip GM. And a company squeezing us for $10 a month we pay gladly...and I have the feeling im in Pre-Revolution America and Verant represents King george.<br><br>You know they may or may not resolve this matter the right way. But it wont matter. You know why? Because YOU ,thier boss', refuse to cancel your account for 30 days to show who has the power.<br><br>That's all it takes half of the people canceling thier accounts for 30 days would take 1.5 million from verant/Sony. You think the Board wont notice that? ROFL. You think they will wanna know why? You betcha.<br><br>But this is a dream. Half of you cant tell where reality starts and EQ ends. So why am I bothering ~<br><p><br>Give him his account back Butler. Stop pissing in the wind.<br>

Gear Can Not Be Fixed<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Saturday, May 26, 2001   12:30 AM EST by <a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dr.Twister</a></font><a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've come to the understanding that Gear simply cannot be fixed. How else can you explain the lack of motivation, the lack of fixes during regularly schedules patches let alone hot fixes, and the number of Turbine developers that just seem to ignore the fact that they have a serious problem on their hand.<br><br>When it boils down to it, I'd be willing to bet that deep in AC code, there is a data stream that is so hard coded, there is simply no way around it, and to change it now, would break the entire system. Instead of failing that miserably, I believe Turbine has just gone in denial, and has refused to fix Gear.<br><br>Look at this past patch. How many mods to the code where legitimately asked for? Did anyone out there ask for weightless pyreals? Go search the dev boards, please, show me a link where a great multitude of players desperately sought for weightless money. Check the same boards and scan for how many messages complain, demand or simply mention the word GEAR and that Turbine needs to put an end to this problem. No doubt you will find a lot of threads, yet for some reason, Turbine decided to implement a patch that no one seemed to care about, plus one that was never even relayed to the players as a potential change.<br><br>Why is there still no accountability for game developers actions? Why am I still complaining about the same stuff game after game? Oh where oh where is there a log of upcoming fixes and changes to the game? There are none. Why is this information still considered sacred and why must it continuously be hidden from the players who pay for this service? How hard would it truly be to say, &#8220;Listen folks, here are some of our plans for this upcoming patch&#8221;? At least that way we could take a look at what is being worked on and what the development staff and programmers are spending their TIME on.<br><br>The reason is simple. If we actually knew, we&#8217;d be able to complain more. Do you honestly think if Turbine came out with a list and GEAR was not on that list, which everyone would just accept it and move forward? Heck, we have players <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/cgi-bin/kdata/990816534,48128,.shtml" class=link2>trying to agree with each other NOT to use GEAR</a>, simply for the respect of fellow gamers. Of course that&#8217;s silly also &#8211; like anyone would actually not use it even with a &#8220;fingers-crossed&#8221; agreement. I&#8217;m telling you now, until Turbine supports the players and communicates with us, we will not be able to express our opinions as to what we want done within the game we are paying money to play. There is no opportunity for us to debate what is more important, weightless pyreals or fixing GEAR. How about the next patch &#8211; are we going to be giving the opportunity to say, &#8220;No we don&#8217;t want that &#8211; just fix Gear&#8221; &#8211; and yet more, why hasn&#8217;t GEAR simply been fixed as a HOTFIX &#8211; immediately solving the problem?<br><br>The more you look at the reasons why it&#8217;s not being fixed, the more you may realize that it simply can&#8217;t be fixed. So I suppose the only way to put even more pressure on Turbine &#8211; download it &#8211; use it &#8211; it&#8217;s obviously a feature they don&#8217;t mind having in the game.<br><br>Tell us what you think. <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=286&forum=3&0">Can GEAR be fixed?</a><br><br>

Horizons is a long way off and It's understandable that there won't be much news around here, but don't give up on us.  I'm going to update this site the second anything you'd want to know about comes out.  In the meantime, I'd check out some of the other kick ass games which are coming our way soon.  World War II online goes live in less than 2 weeks, Anarchy online is about a month away, and Shadowbane follows a few months after that.

A lot of people have been asking about the NDA, and if it will be lifted or not for Beta 4.  Well. The answer is YES. I just got the official word, and the NDA will definitely be lifted for Beta 4.  However, if any fan sites are uncertain about some of their material, do not hesitate to send it to us.  In general, we would like to make sure that the fan sites that didn't attend E3, will not be at an disadvantage concerning publishing info.  So there you have it folk. YES, the NDA is going to be lifted for the start of Beta 4</font></blockquote><br><br><br>

We will bring you this newsletter every month to give you up to date view of Anarchy Online, the community and events and features. As the release date comes closer we will have more and more to share with you in the AO Newsletter.<br>This month's newsletter is a little short with everything that is going on.<br><br><br><br>Greetings Anarchy Online Fans.<br><br>Anarchy Online Price<br>Ok many people are asking about the prices for Anarchy Online and what the monthly subscription price will be.  So I decided to get the official word. <br>Yes it is official, the monthly price for Anarchy Online will be US$12.95 /per month..<br>Also as many of you may have seen the selling price for Anarchy Online will be US$49.99 <br><br>Beta 4<br>To be open or not to be open that is the question?<br><br>Well this has been the question on everyone's lips these days. I spoke with Tommy and here is what we have so far. Beta 4 will be open in chunks.  And yes all the Beta 3 testers will be in Beta 4. As Beta 4 starts, people will be added in chunks depending on feedback from the testers. Each day more testers will be added. At this time I cannot give you specific numbers as to how many testers per chunk. And then if we do not have enough testers, it will become open to all. <br><br>E3<br><br>        Everyone that did not have chance to attend E3 might be wondering how it went. Well our very own Mowgli was there and has a few comments for us. <br><br><br><br><br>Mowgli<br>        <br>We have been nominated for best in show by IGN - we will find out next week how this went. There were two other nominees: Star Wars Galaxies and Planetside were the others nominated. <br>I talked with a lot of EQ and AC people. The feedback they gave was awesome. The four biggest things were, vehicles, grid, our new 3d engine and mission systems.<br><br>It was fun to meet so many of you guys and we truly appreciate your support. We also hope we have lived up to your expectations with what we have showed at this year's E3. We will very soon, after E3, start the Beta 4 and we hope a lot of you guys are ready to help us put the finishing touch on Anarchy and make it the best game ever.<br><br>Affiliate Program<br><br>        We have received some questions lately on the European status of the Affiliate program. At this time there seems to be a few issues that have arisen but we are working them out. So hold in there.<br><br>Site of the Month.<br><br>Well this month we will have something different. Because it has been a while since we have had a site of the month. We have decided to give this to two sites. The first one would be Rubi-Ka Broadcasting Corporation and our second site of the month will be Sector-7. We wish to congratulate the two sites of the month. And we will be sending out a gift pack to these two websites.<br>  <br><br>-- <br>Best regards,<br>Darren Scott<br>A.K.A (Dai-Galean)<br>Community Coordinator                          <br><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com">http://www.anarchy-online.com</a><br><a href="http://www.funcom.com">http://www.funcom.com</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stolen right from the official horizons site and appearing here today only is a NEWS UPDATE!!!<br><br>David "Requnix" Allen was recently interviewed at E3 by Casters Realm. Here's a snippet from the interview:<br><br><b>Baelish: A lot of information related to your game up on the web, almost the entire design document, it promises a lot. Are you confident you can deliver that?</b><br><br><i>David Allen: We are currently adhering to about 90% of what's in the original design document, which I think is amazing. We have a couple of things going into horizons though that nobody knows about, and those are highly protected secrets at this time. The information we have put up though has achieved its goal. Right now I think Horizons is probably the hottest and most publicly supported MMOG in development in the world. People seem very excited about the fact we are willing to talk about our game and alter our designs based on player feedback. That's why we have released so much information. Sure some of the other companies have well 'noticed' some of our game ideas, but its not really worrying us. We still have some things which just haven't been seen in MMORPG's yet.</i><br><br>Be sure to check out the rest of the interview <a href="http://e3.crgaming.com/interviews/viewarticle.asp?Id=9" class="link2">located here</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to Dr T's poll, I'd like to say that the egg simply HAD to come first.  The only reason people think this is a paradox is because they don't understand darwinism.  The egg was obviously the egg of some chicken predecessor whose offspring had somehow evolved from the pre-chicken chicken into a cluck-clucking chicken.  It's not as if Chickenasaurus suddenly morphed into Chicken, it's more like chickenasaurus wasn't doing too well and nature decided it's next kid, resting inside the egg, would be a chicken.  No paradox!!!<br><br>Dipes<br>

If balance is done correctly, then you won't have one killer template, as the UO 7xGM Tank Mage was.  Everything else there looks good to me.<br>

In character creation a random name based on the 6000 most common first names and the 13000 most common last names in the US. Why you ask would we add such a feature? For convenience! We want the players to quickly get through character creation and enter the game-world to enjoy the world. Once settled down and feel like focusing more on customizing the character, the player can take his or her character to the name registration office in a city. Here you can choose to manually enter a first and a last name or to select between the 78000000 different names that can be generated for you. The cost of changing the name is now set to be symbolic but might increase in the future as we see how the game progress and how people use the service.</font></blockquote>Read the entire thread <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=93c2a361102e0c5717fe521e2ff139dc&postid=22369#post22369"class="link2">here</a>.<br>

The full <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/aboutus/pressrelease05-21-01.shtml" class=link2>press release</a> can be read on the official <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com" class=link2>Shadowbane</a>  site, but here is a quick look.<br><blockquote><font color="#cccc99">Phase one of Shadowbane's beta test centered around character creation and core game mechanics, and ended April 13th 2001. Hailed as a complete success by the development team, phase two will center around the creation of a better and richer game world. New environments will be brought into play, existing landscapes will be refined, and new monsters will come online to menace players. Characters, the player-created 'avatars' of the Shadowbane world, will not be ignored either. More than one hundred new skills and powers are being added for characters, and characters will undergo a second round of balancing and refinement.</font></blockquote><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alot of rumors about Beta 4 starting on May 28th have been floating around. So I took it upon myself to see if the <a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com"class="link2">Anarchy Online</a> support would clarify this. Here's the e-mail I sent in:<br><blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>> I heard that Beta 4 starts on May 28th. I work for Anarchy Online<br>> Twister and I just wanted to clear this up for the people so they know<br>> if it's true or just a simple rumor.<br><br>No date has been set for the AO beta at this point.<br><br>Kegern<br>Funcom Support<br></font></blockquote> I'll try to keep updated on the Beta 4 launch date.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.gamespot.com"class="link2">Gamespot</a> has released their E3 preview today.<blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>We found that in addition to conducting beta 9.0 (the public beta), Funcom has actually been conducting a concurrent closed beta test, beta 10.0 in preparation for the game's imminent release. The alternate build is significantly more stable than the public beta build, and looks so polished that it'll easily be ready for release next month.</font></blockquote>You can find the rest of it <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2762459,00.html"class="link2">here</a>.<br><br>Also, the <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com"class="link2">AO Forums</a> were pretty active with answers from the Support Team:<br><blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>I haven't heard anything of the sort. The closest thing to this is the "virtual" area which newbies will spawn into. This will include plenty of "tutorial" NPCs and signs, which will allow new players to learn how to control the game. There will also be plenty of low level creatures for them to hunt. When these mini-playfields reach a certain size, new ones will be spawned for other new characters, so that any particular one does not become too crowded.</font></blockquote> You can find the rest of the thread <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=18088#post18088"class="link2">here</a>.<br><br>More in-game feature were talked about by Support staff:<br><blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>Tattoos: Yes, there are tattoos in the game now. "I luv M0M!" <br><br>Dimensions: A dimension would be a set of servers that run one Rubi-Ka world. If necessary, we will put up more dimensions if there is a need and demand for it. There will be methods to transfer characters between dimensions. Names will be unique among all dimensions, so we won't have name thieves. :-)<br></font></blockquote> You can find the rest of the thread <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=16972#post16972"class="link2">here</a>.<br><br>Another Support Staffer tackled questions and issue about roleplaying:<br><blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>Role-playing in MMORPGs might not be second nature to everyone, but I don't think it's a lost cause by any means. There are several things that must occur for the average player to be interested in RP, and they all tie together. <br><br>The MMORPG must have a dynamic world. If it's static, the players have a very hard time immersing themselves and feeling that they can actually make a difference. Static worlds tend to pigeon-hole the play styles dramatically.</font></blockquote> You can find the rest of the thread <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=16975#post16975"class="link2">here</a>.<br><br>Monthly payment was touched on also:<br><blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>There will also be different methods of payment (i.e. Credit Card, US Checking Account, Gametime Coupons etc.), but it is undecided as of yet when they will be introduced. There might also be a small surcharge if you choose to pay with for example a US Checking Account instead of a Credit Card, simply because our bank charges us a lot more to process checks than creditcards (higher risk, no possibility of a "live" authorization check).</font></blockquote> You can find the rest of the thread <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=18148#post18148"class="link2">here</a>.<br>

I Killed The Omni-Scum, and won a leather boot?<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is from Kair on the Bulletin Board:<br><blockquote><br>...Maybe an effective tool would be to allow a switch to control your level of looting and that of others. You set the switch to the level you are comfortable with having looted from you, then you can only loot others if you defeat them in combat that have your same level of looting rights. (you cannot loot more then the level you've set for yourself on people that have set a higher level) ex. You set your "lootability" to coin only. You can only loot the coin from players that have coin or higher levels set for themselves. This is a way to enable that everyone is playing at thier personal comfort level. People that are in the game simply to take everything from other players can set their level high, then they will only be able to loot up to that level with others who've agreed beforehand to take that risk. It shouldn't be an easy thing to change once set either. This would prevent people from being low level of risk and then after killing someone changing your level to high so you can loot all their things. </blockquote><br>A discussion was taking place in the bulletin board about looting in Anarchy-Online.  The current problem is only items in inventory can be looted.  Everything on a character is kept when death occurs, as long as the character is insured, which trust me, will always be the case.<br><br>This kills a lot of the fun in combat between Omni-Tek and Clans. Hell, if I "Whoop some Omni-Arse" I want to see them take a loss.  If we are fighting in a conflict, we want to do damage to the opposing team.  If they bounce back with all their belongings, then what is the point of killing them?<br><br>This plan is a great compromise between being fully lootable and the current Anarchy-Online System.  Every player will start with the default looting switch at what the current AO looting system is at. From here, any player can increase their looting switch, as they desire to loot more in their successful combat victories.  A Player who kills someone with a higher looting switch then themself, will only be able to loot up to their looting switch.  When someone kills someone who is equal to or greater then their looting switch, then they can fully loot up to their setting.  <br><br>Funcom, listening to this?<br><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=233&forum=2&0" class="link2">BUT It's Not Fair Because. . .</a><br><br>

Lets recap what we've gotten this week...<br><br>Monday<br>Party System FAQS, and the list of guys going to E3. Getting the info out slowly.<br><br>Tuesday<br>Guild Types get revamped. We get a few more guilds to choose from, as if we didn't have enough to decide already.<br><br>Wednesday<br>WP is running off a T-1 now! No more slow loading the info now.

First off, we get a new beta journal, this one about tradesmen and buildings (where are the griefers?). With that, we get a little essay on the economy, ever bit as confusing as real life economy. On top of all of that, we get some real life accounts of the E3 presentation as told by some of the better known SB community members. Grab the link above and take a look at the new stuff. I'll be doing the same thing &#8216;til I get every bit of it, gobble it up like a starved dog, then vomit it back up in the form of soggy, chewed up, acidic questions.<br><br>Oh yeah, Hi everyone. I work here now.<br><br>(Malcolm says: I don't approve of Wolfpack's tactics. Not giving us info for so long and now drown us with it.

One who is observent can learn many tactics to life on Calypso and Earth by reading these simple stories, or what I like to call, chronicles.

I stole it.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>The vehicle is stolen?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's certification in<br>the glove box when I was putting my phaser in there.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>There's a phaser in the glove box?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who owns<br>this vehicle and stuffed her in the Secured trunk.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yes, sir.<br><br>*Hearing this, the <b>Officer</b> immediately called his <b>Captain</b>.

Here it is.<br><br>*It was valid.*<br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Whose vehicle is this?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>It's mine, <b>Officer</b>. Here's the owner' certification.<br><br>*<b>Quantum</b> owned the vehicle.*<br><br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a phaser in it?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yes, sir, but there's no phaser in it.<br><br>*Sure enough, the <b>Officer</b> sees that there is nothing in the glove box.*<br><br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Would you mind opening your trunk?

The <b>Officer</b> who stopped you said you told him you<br>didn't have an authorization card, stole the vehicle, had a phaser in the glove box, and that<br>there was a dead body in the trunk.<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yeah, I'll bet the lying S.O.B. told you I was speeding, too<br>

He described it as being like the Matrix (not the movie, but the cyberpunk version). You travel to a Grid entrance point, and you enter a digital area that looks like a large blue chamber (this is gonna be hard to explain, I can tell right now). On the floor were openings that would take you from place to place. Basically, you could enter the Grid in Newland and travel across the room, and drop through to Tir or Athens and pop out there. So what's the difference between that and the whompas you ask?</font></blockquote>Read the full article <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail32.html"class="link2">here</a>.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- Well with E3 starting today reports have already been posted and here is one about AO from <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/"class="link2">GameZNet</a>:<blockquote><font color = #FFFFCC>One of the busiest booths at E3 this year was Funcom's Anarchy Online booth. Some of the more interesting areas were on display(places I have not seen before) and they looked fantastic. I'm not sure if the graphics engine on display had some improvements over the current one or not, but they looked excellent. It may have been the zone design was just very well done or there may be some improvements in beta 4. I'm not sure.<br><br>The bottom line was that players were huddled around computers inside of the booth. I think that's a positive sign for Funcom.</font></blockquote><br>- Also <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/"class="link2">GameSpot</a> released this preview of AO with a load of shots right <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2760730,00.html"class="link2">here</a><br><br>- More E3 coverage to follow, we have several staff members on hand gathering information.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the first Scenario in the Adventures of Quantum, a daily to weekly following of I, Quantum, Master Rebel.  One who is observent can learn many tactics to life on Rubi-ka and Earth by reading these simple stories, or what I like to call, scenarios.  Today we begin with a common conversation with an Omni-Pol officer.  I hope you come back to read about more of my adventures.  <br><br><center>"<b>Speeding in Omni</b>"</center> <br><br>Driving in my soon to be implemented Anarchy-Online vehicle, I was pulled over by one of those god forsaken Omni PoPo, which I believe was due to the fact I was too rebel looking.  Using my super stellar Clan tactics, I was able to dodge an ingenuous speeding violation.  For future reference, when caught speeding in Anarchy-Online, you may want to attempt this tactic.  Here is a duplicate of my dialogue:<br><br>*Omni-Pol <b>Officer</b> pulls me over for speeding*<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>May I see your vehicle driving authorization card?<br><br>Quantum:<br>I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my 5th DWI.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>May I see the owner's certification for this vehicle?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>It's not my vehicle. I stole it.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>The vehicle is stolen?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's certification in<br>the glove box when I was putting my phaser in there.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>There's a phaser in the glove box?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who owns<br>this vehicle and stuffed her in the Omni Secured trunk.<br><br><b>Officer</b>:<br>There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yes, sir.<br><br>*Hearing this, the <b>Officer</b> immediately called his <b>Captain</b>. The vehicle was<br>quickly surrounded by police, and the <b>Captain</b> approached <b>Quantum</b> to<br>handle the tense situation*<br><br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Sir, can I see your driving authorization card?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Sure. Here it is.<br><br>*It was valid.*<br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Whose vehicle is this?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>It's mine, <b>Officer</b>. Here's the owner' certification.<br><br>*<b>Quantum</b> owned the vehicle.*<br><br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a phaser in it?<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yes, sir, but there's no phaser in it.<br><br>*Sure enough, the <b>Officer</b> sees that there is nothing in the glove box.*<br><br><b>Captain</b>:<br>Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in<br>it.<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>No problem.<br><br>*Trunk is opened; no body.*<br><br><b>Captain</b>:<br>I don't understand it. The <b>Officer</b> who stopped you said you told him you<br>didn't have an authorization card, stole the vehicle, had a phaser in the glove box, and that<br>there was a dead body in the trunk.<br><br><b>Quantum</b>:<br>Yeah, I'll bet the lying S.O.B. told you I was speeding, too<br>

The popularity of massively multi-player online games is largely due to its highly social nature. Players form groups in the game, using each character's specific skills, to complete missions as a team. Because these characters are not controlled by a computer, but by other people, friendships are often formed with other players. This makes the entire gaming experience much more dynamic than games only guided by artificial intelligence. Due for release on June 27, a nearly finished version of Anarchy Online will be shown at E3 this week.</font></blockquote><br>

Maybe if they took a moment, they would discover that there is no enemy, and the peace they long for is just one treaty signature away. At least that is what many freelance reporters thought, or at least one reporter we know of -- searching out the truth to prove she<br>could make a difference; typing out a message to readers she may never meet. It didn't matter, somehow she felt connected.<br><br>I'm Lacey, a freelance reporter for the citizens of Rubi-Ka. I have been in the territories for months, trying to get information on the mysterious medusa and enigma mutants.  For some reason I was not having much luck, almost like they were avoiding me or I was just looking in all the wrong places. We have all heard the stories about how some medusas or enigmas have helped an adventurer from certain death, but any contact with them directly has been unsuccessful.  <br><br>Out in the territories you don't see many other travelers, so when you do you usually settle around the campfire and swap stories as long as no one tries to kill each other. One such traveler was from my hometown of Newland. He shared a rumor about some new organization forming in the neutral city. This was enough to spark my curiosity. The secrets of the medusas and enigmas could be found out another day. I asked for more information as I decided my destination for the next day. I would begin the long journey back to Newland and ask anyone I meet about this new organization.<br><br>--==Ellen Lacey==--<br>Freelance Reporter<br>"Home is a campfire"<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>  <br><br>-- <br>Best regards,<br>Darren Scott<br>A.K.A (Dai-Galean)<br>Community Coordinator                          <br><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com">http://www.anarchy-online.com</a><br><a href="http://www.funcom.com">http://www.funcom.com</a><br>

In RL you could fly to Japan buy mass handmade oriental rugs or tapestries etc and fly them back to the mainland and sell for a decent profit. Is this what the AC crowd is doing or is it a bug Exploit? You be the judge, keeping in mind that AC has always strived to be very realistic.<br><br>Another unconfirmed bug...<br>Many are saying that if you happen to find a frag that drops a shard it will respawn in the same spot with a shard again and again.<br>One guy from MT claims to have done the same thing with Umbris and says he now has 6 pair of COORD VI gloves..<br>Again this is unconfirmed.<br><br>Pretzel FF<br>

I've provided three points of entry for you <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/graphics/models/orc-1.jpg" class="link2">here</a>, <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/graphics/models/orc-1.jpg" class="link2">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/graphics/models/orc-1.jpg" class="link2">here</a>.  The things is, I doubt we'll be seeing much of this guy in game, as a lot of people see Orcs and Goblins as Dragon snacks.  This is quite untrue, however.  I think orcs are going to be very humanlike in both versatility and usefullness, and I woudln't be surprised if we see these underdogs become some oh-so-ubar^^ warriors in release.  But then again, these are just the rantings of an uninformed newsie.  Leave your thoughts on the board.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we broke new of yesterday, it looks as if the Asheron's Call Emulated Server project is or maybe was for real. Just like the previous attempts, small groups of dedicated programmers for both Ultima Online and EverQuest have successfully developed an offline server emulator to work with the original game client. AC has become the next in line with the controversy associated with these types of projects.<br><br>For those familiar, Ultima Online embraced the concept of allowing alternative worlds to be developed. Emulation servers gave wanna be GameMasters the power to create new lands, slay whatever monster they came into contact with, forge unstoppable weapons, and of course most importantly, build that dream castle they couldn't get through traditional online servers.<br><br>This carefree attitude was cut short when the gang at <a href="http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/" class=link2>HackersQuest</a> released the EQ version of a server emulator. Verant didn't particularly like it. Several rumors shared that lawsuits were in the works. Today, the site still has information regarding the development of the EQEmulator, but I'm unaware of any private servers like the numbers there are for UO.<br><br>Which brings us to Turbine? What will they do? Who knows. It will be one of the questions on hand during my chat at E3 with Turbine. Will they be the tiebreaker which decides the fate of all of the future emulation developers for games such as Shadowbane, Horizons or Star Wars?<br><br>Either way, I'm not sure where they are headed, but if the project does stop before being fully complete, I managed to snag a few screenshots. Normally this is when I get the "fixed" or "altered" comments, but I assure you, they are legit.<br><br>Take a look at <a href="http://ac.drtwister.com/aces/dtn-aces1.shtml" class=link2>Picture 1</a> - <a href="http://ac.drtwister.com/aces/dtn-aces2.shtml" class=link2>Picture 2</a> - <a href="http://ac.drtwister.com/aces/dtn-aces3.shtml" class=link2>Picture 3</a><br><br>After evaluating, share your comments. <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=206&forum=3&0" class=link2>What do you think about the ACES Project?</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I know that just about every website and their uncle has paid tribute to Douglas Adams, and I feel it to be my duty to do the same.  He really was an inspirational figure in my life, and I think Lum summed it up best by saying that no matter how dire of a situation you find yourself in, Douglas Adams taught us that nothing is so terrible that you can't just step back for a moment and laugh at it.  For those of you who have never read Douglas Adams, I suggest you run to the store and purchase the <b>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</b> without further delay.  Don't forget your towel.<br><br>Who knows, maybe Douglas Adams isn't really dead.  Maybe his corpse was placed there as a clever ruse and he is really with that triple-breasted whore from Eroticon 6.  Or perhaps he's decided to take a sojourn to the Restaraunt at the end of the universe.  No matter what the case, however, if he were here today he would be laughing about it.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I ran across an interesting <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/AC01/petition.html" class=link2>link</a> today. A petition to Turbine to actually punish or even ban players who are caught using bugs within Asheron's Call. Can this be done?<br><br>Well based on the Terms of Service, a cheat would mean yes, they have the immediate ability to toss you out of the game. Well my question is not in regards to do they have the authority, but more so, do they want to, and are we far enough into the "way of life" with AC that Turbine really can't begin banning people without it reflecting a negative image on them. <br><br>Sure close to 1400 players have already signed this petition, however does it truly tell us anything? I'm pretty positive I could receive the same number of signatures on a petition that states we would like to see BENEFITS to those individuals who track, discover and bring light to the bugs that you are fighting so hard to get rid of. The point is, yes, there are individuals in the game that will take advantage of "errors in coding", but these are not the individuals who should be put to death for using what is within the game world.<br><br>If we look at other games with similar problems, the moment they began banning players, the exploitation of bugs became worse. Instead of fighting the battle of bad public relations for bugs that are not fixed, devote your efforts, like mine, to the developers themselves who need to understand that as long as bugs or exploits are in the game, people will use them. It's their job to try as hard as they can to get rid of them.<br><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=191&forum=19&4" class=link2>What do you think?</a><br>

Tazoon = Theed?<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Tuesday, May 15, 2001   11:34 AM EST by <a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dipes</a></font><a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking back at that concept art of Tazoon again, I noticed that the city is in fact incredibly large and actually quite nice to look at.  For an MMORPG, this is a good thing.  I remember walking around Freeport being generally disgusted at the grandeur (or lack thereof) of the city. There are only a handful of buildings and all of them are equally as useless the next because no one honestly wants to buy the crap that all of those cookie cutter vendors sell. Asheron's call upped the bar a bit with their towns and villages, but there still is nothing I would call visually super impressive.  If AE can pull off making Tazoon look like it does in that picture, then Goodbye social life.  The thing that always peeved me in AC and moreso in EQ is that there is no where for the "residents" of the city to live.  All of the buildings have some sort of functionality; there are no homes.  I'd like to see Tazoon rich and alive, with NPCs going about their business somewhat like they do in <i>Shenmue</i>.  I'd like to see homes, small businesses, fruit markets, kids playing in the streets, policemen on horseback and many more things incorporated to make the city feel alive and real.  With that being said, Douglas Shuler made a few comments on Tazoon's architecture and history on AEs boards.<br><blockquote><i>Tazoon is the capital of the Central Empire and is run primarily by Humans, although their neutrality allows a large diversity of other races to enter freely. Because Tazoon has been around for so long, it has become an ecclectic collection of architectural styles, representing a wide array of styles over centuries of development. It's a melting-pot of culture, and the locus for most trade in Istaria.The style we've chosen to go with on Tazoon specifically (and not ALL Human cities) is one of stately grandeur. It's influenced by two distinct architectural palettes, Italian and Greek. The Italian influences include terra cotta roofs, eggshell white walls, and bas relief decor along the edges of many buildings. The Greek influences include domes, pillars, open structures, and general scale, as well as extensive use of marble as a building material.<br>Comparisons to Theed from Phantom Menace are inevitable, as are those to Dinotopia. This is because they drew similar inspiration from the same historic sources. They were not the first to use this collection of styles, and we will not be the last.<br><br>As for the other Human cities; you'll see different looks based on their individual locations since they're influenced by thier neighboring races. It's my intention to make each and every city of Istaria a unique place with unique layout and design, so you can tell you're in a different place, and will have interesting places to explore. I'm putting a lot of time into it, so you won't have 'cookie-cutter' cities merely used to resupply between play sessions.</i></blockquote><br><br>Word.<br>-Dipes<br><br><br>

I figure, since I went to a show last Thursday, they should not mine.  If that excuse is not good.  They are suppose to be punk, they should not care about things like this.  Click <a href="http://pe.drtwister.com/littlethings.mp3" class="link2">here</a> to download the song in MP3 format.<br><br>This also leads me to a new plan for the site.  Let us have weekly song posts here at PE Twister.  Everything in this sounded good, except, who would ever download and listen to songs I like.?  That is why I am going to ask Patric from Project-Entropia, to give me a weekly song he likes.  Then I will post both of our weekly songs.  Hope you enjoy.<br>

The simple answer is no; NCsoft has two primary connections to AE and HORIZONS, that as an investor and that as a licensor of HORIZONS for the Asian market. They are in no way directly involved in the design of HORIZONS as a base product. However, we will be working very closely with NCsoft to ensure that the Asian release of HORIZONS is received properly, and making necessary modifications in order to accomplish this goal. I feel that we could not have asked for a better partner to enter into the Asian market with. </i></blockquote><br><br>I personally feel that only good can come from this business agreement, so more power to them.  <br><br>Jolan Tru,<br>-Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Australian developers let go of some employees after the release of Fallout: Tactics which I'm sure most of you , hopefully, don't remember. It was one of those games I like to classify under "put it behind me". They took the worst aspect of a great game, Fallout 2, and made a whole new game out of it. Multiplayer turn based combat ... and this didn't do well why? That said my confidence in BigWorld was low anyway. I mean the easiest part of making a game is coming up with ideas ... Micro Fort could not even do that right. <br> <br>Of course this is all from the rumor mill but if true it means <b>BigWorld</b> may be in trouble. Bigworld is(was?) one of the major MMOGs currently in development. <br><br><b>Update:</b> Only the Canberra division of Micro Fort was closed down. The Sydney division, who are working on BigWorld and Citizen Zero, is still operating. With only one division left, two MMOGs in development, and no other official titles being released any time soon, things are probably still very "iffy" at that studio.<br>

ACTOOL.. An interview with its developer Cameron Cole<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Monday, May 14, 2001   12:32 PM EST by <a href="mailto:pretzel@drtwister.com" class=link2>Pretzel</a></font><a href="mailto:pretzel@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First of all I would like to say that Cameron Cole was the AC Macro development Pioneer and his "ACTOOL" was and is used by 99% of all AC macroers because of its ease in coding and stable platform. I myself use it daily and wanted to learn a little bit about him.<br><br>Q: What got you started into macroing<br><br>A: To tell the truth, I have never really macroed.  I started writing AC Tool<br>in order to fletch some arrows for a character.  I stopped playing the<br>character soon after I started and thus my macroing career never took off.<br><br>At first, I looked around and couldn't find any program for AC that did<br>macros at all.  That is when I decided it would be nice to contribute<br>something to the AC world and dedicated some serious development time to AC<br>Tool.  Before long, AC Tool was simply theraputic programming that took my<br>mind off of my day-to-day development job.  In the later parts of AC Tool's<br>development, it was the users that kept me going.  Several even contributed<br>to the program itself.  This was my fuel so to speak.  As long as users were<br>using, I was writing.<br><br>Q: What do you see in the near future of macroing<br><br>A: Macros as they pertain to AC: I think the limit for macros has almost been<br>met.  Further refinement will come, but the macro engines available now are<br>so powerful that almost any task can be accomplished inside of AC.  I expect<br>to see more and more impressive macros, but the engines that drive them will<br>most likely not change other than minor enhancements and bug fixes.  It is<br>already possible to completely macro a character from 1st to 70th and<br>beyond.  What more could a person ask for?<br><br>Macros as they pertain to future software:  It is my hope that as the newer<br>online games come out they embrace macroing.  There is nothing wrong with<br>macroing contrary to what some believe.  The only problem with it is that it<br>isn't a level playing field.  Everyone should have access to a scripting<br>engine inside a game.  Personally, I believe the next generation games<br>should come with some sort of scripting language built into the game itself.<br>Lets be honest, how many people want to spend an hour fletching arrows?  It<br>is just silly to think anyone will want to do that.  If macroing is<br>considered in the game development process, it is likely that balancing<br>issues around it will be worked out instead of patching or worse banning<br>after the fact.  Macroing should be a feature not an offense.<br><br>Q: Tell me about some of the greatest macros you have come across or<br>coded.<br><br>A: I guess I can let the cat out of the bag since the macro will most likely<br>never see the light of day.  I have seen (even played with it so this is no<br>myth) a macro engine that was the ultimate melee bot.  A friend of mine<br>built a character that was basically impervious to Olthoi in the Olthoi<br>Vault.  This macro engine was based loosely around his character and idea<br>for the most part.  What it did was kill Olthoi, charge items, buff, heal,<br>pick up items, recall to town, restock supplies, and even logged back on<br>when it got disconnected.  The macro made about a million an hour in<br>unassigned exp.  Not a lot, but considering it needed no human control and<br>could run indefinately it was marvelous.  The last version I saw still had<br>timing and recognition bugs, but I believe it was about 80% the way there.<br><br>Q: What is entailed in the aerlinthe macros?<br><br>A: You are asking the wrong guy.  I just write the engine.  I have never really<br>played around with actual macros.<br><br>Q: What are you currently working on as far as AC macros, plugs, or<br>platforms?<br><br>A: I have handed my torch over to the next generation of macro writers.  David Smith fROM onlinegamegimp.com(Portal Bot and Robotica fame) has taken over the development and<br>maintenance of AC Tool.  He has done a phenominal job on all the products.<br>The AC Script guys have definately made a huge advancement in macros as<br>well.  So to answer your question, I am waiting on AC2 and the next<br>generation of macro engines.<br><br>Q: How do you feel about Drain and or Hunting (smart) macros?<br><br>A: Let me describe my basic philosophy about playing games before I answer<br>this.  I play games for me and not for the stress of keeping up with the<br>Jones.  That said if someone wants to macro a character up so they can get<br>to the island, doesn't bother me one bit.  As long as it doesn't<br>significantly impact my playing, I don't care what Joe Blow wants to do with<br>his 10 bucks a month.  I say macro AC if that is what you want to do.  To be<br>perfectly honest, I dislike the players that steal my kills or leech off of<br>my exp MUCH more than any macroer.  Macroing has such a minor impact on AC<br>and the players of the game.<br><br>Q: Is there anything thats not possible by macroing?<br><br>A: With AC, yes.  However, AC macroing is really only limited to what the<br>client and user can do since the AC servers maintain the state of the<br>character.  I think of it as the matrix.  Some rules you can bend and others<br>you can break, but some rules are non-negotiable because that is the way the<br>system is written.  I don't expect to see any Neo's running around<br>deflecting arrows anytime soon, but you never know.<br><br>Q: Do you have a favorite AC Easter Egg?<br><br>A: Not really.  Actually, I have always wondered what Cameron's Curse was.  I<br>hear there was a spell named after me, but I have never actually seen it.<br>If I had a favorite AC Easter Egg, it would be to see a screen shot of that<br>spell.  Not really an easter egg, but it would be my favorite if it is<br>exists.<br><br>Q: Do you currently macro? If so which macros etc?<br><br>A: Don't macro and as I mentioned early never really did.  I was in this for<br>the fun and conversation.  Interesting side note was that I continued to<br>support AC Tool six months after I stopped playing AC.  That is how<br>wonderful the macro users were to just be around.<br><br>Thanks for sending over the questionnaire.  Let me know if I can answer any<br>other questions.  If this does see "press", send me a link.  I would love to<br>see the entire article.<br><br>Thanks again, Cameron.<br><br>If you have an interest in macroing for that trade mule or think you have what it takes to make a full on melee bot check out Camerons site:<br><a href="http://www.cameroncole.net/ac.html">http://www.cameroncole.net/ac.html</a><br><br>"Pretzel" FF<br><br><br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those of you who PVP and have alwayes wondered why some people are impossible to beat might find this interesting. While following up some data i stopped in and said hi to some old friends on a certain pvp server. LO and behold i was told ' yah we rarely have any probs, our Guild Leader is a GM" <br><br><br> Well needless to say i was floored...being as most of the people in this guild were in a guild with me on chesapeak in UO. So i asked another person who was the guild leader..........*drum roll*<br><br><br> Myndpyre was the answer. Lady D is Myndpyre who was also in UO with the Royal Guardians Guild (anti) and then moved on to become TAC ( The aggression Clan)in Aliens On-Line and bearing a Similar name on this particular server. I had been told by Myndpyre when we were  BSing many months ago how he said he was connected with VI and could get stuff done. I put this down to petty BS...if i had only known.<br> <br><br> Verant.......your inability to do something about BS like this shows how weak your control is over your actual staff. Players like this should be on test server with THE OTHER GMs . Im sure the person,after reading this will know who i am...so all i have to say is how could you abuse such a station of power for personal gain ? Is winning so important to you that you would be willing to ruin other peoples fun ? Weak...VI your weak too because ALL of your staff knew about this HENCE you knew about it and allowed it to continue . Well Mynd i hope your gaming fun goes straight to shit. I had half a mind to post your real name, but ill not stoop to your level in doing what i can to ruin a person like you have.<br><br><br> <br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have received some comments and email stating that I was too harsh on Mindark with my opinions on the Development questions.  I am not trying to mock Mindark at all.  I think Project-Entropia is an amazing idea, and I love the projected combat system of this game.  I merely was telling the truth, or my perceived truth.  I am friendly with DROK(Patric), and I believe you the fans, and Mindark the company, can appreciate comments on the game, and not take them as an offense.  If your looking for love, don&#8217;t make game, if your looking for honest journalism, enjoy the site.  Good day.<br>

</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have compiled my opinions on the recent answers from Mindark's Dev Board.  Comments on what I had to say?  Click <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=159&forum=36&0" cclass="link2">here</a>.<br><br><i>We are trying to balance the two factors: the person behind the screen real life skills in moving/aiming the weapon as much as this corresponds with the weapon+ the weapon skill his/her character have evolved. So this will definitely be a synthesis between both real life skills and the characters virtual life and the objects he/she uses.</i> <br><br>This is what sells the game to me, and I am not exaggerating.  No, I do not want MMORPGs to become trigger finger quake games, yet I believe it is dull when no strategy, no player skill, no wit, is needed in combat within these games.  This is definitely one of the greatest problems plaguing recent MMORPGs.  If your not sure what I am talking about, ask yourself this.  Do you generally brew your coffee and eat your snacks, while your in the middle of combat, in your MMORPG?<br><br><i>Stealing will not be a skill since almost everything have a real value in Project Entropia.</i><br><br>I have been waiting for an MMORPG to include stealing since Ultima Online.  Project-Entropia will not be including that though.  I question this: if the reason stealing is not included in the game is because items have real value. . . then why is PKing allowed?<br><br><i>We could set high prizes to get more money in the game, but then we would get fewer people that would play Project Entropia, The other way is to have cheep prizes on things so more people can afford to buy things and play the Project Entropia.<br><br>Our goal is to have One Million players online at the same time 24 hours a day 7 days a week.<br><br>With this in mind, I would say that we will hold low prizes for object in the game, but there will also be unique items that cost more. So the scale what things will cost will be from a few cents and up.<br><br>We have however not started to set prizes yet, this will be don during our beta testing. We want to find as good balance in the game that is possibly.</i><br><br>This sounds reasonable to me, sounds just like what the Republicans always say.  Lower taxes, more people spend money, government makes more money in long run.  What do you think?<br><i><br>1. Well robot pets may be something you&#8217;&#8217;ll find sooner or later in Entropia, development is in progress.<br>2. This will be temporarily pets (depending on your skill and how you treat them).  Yes, not only traditional pets will be possible to have.<br>3. No you won&#8217;&#8217;t have that.<br>4. Probably not, but it may be a good idea if you want to see things better, but not a requirement that is inevitable.<br>5. Yes we will.<br>6. Hehe, maybe.<br>7. Sitting will be possible yes.<br>8. Eat and drink they need to do. Sleep they won&#8217;t need.9. Yes you may invite other players to your house/apartment.<br>10. Yes that is correct (on both questions).</i><br><br>1.  I&#8217;d like to see robots in combat<br>2.  Hopefully the non traditional pets in Project Entropia will be more then a copy of another model in the game with a new skin and a new name.<br>3.  No window from apartment to see the world.  Same as in Anarchy-Online, most likely because they are on a different server.  Technology must not be there for this yet.<br>4.  Flashlights, okay, don&#8217;t make the game too dark.<br>5.  Given. . .<br>6.  Kumba Ah My Lord. . .  Kumba Ah. . .<br>7.  No comment.<br>8.  I think that without eating and drinking your skills should be scaled down, your tired so your reaction time is down.  I actually think sleep would be an interesting way to control power gaming, if PE wanted to.  If you are in continous combat, you begin to get tired after a while.  Thus you perform to a lesser quality, until your character sleeps again (stops fighting for a while.)<br><br><i>If fighting, our systems hopefully detects that you have no &#8220;ping&#8221;, so you don&#8217;t get killed.</i><br><br>This is obvious, the question is, how exactly will it be implemented.  Will I instantely log out, I hope not.  Will it take five minutes to log out, that is a little harsh.  I think Anarchy-Online has it right, it takes about thirty seconds.  I&#8217;d say make it a minute.  This factor also depends on how good the AI fights for you.<br><br><i>Yes, this will be possibly, but not automatically. We have to see the advertisements before we can put it in to the game. </i><br><br>But Mindark. . . I want all the advertisements to be Pepsi with Brittany Spears...  Actually, it would be nice if small companies, say the Dr.Twister Network, could afford some advertising in PE.<br><br><i>1. Doctors I don't really know about, if you mean Non-playing characters at hospitals, instead there will be automatically-machine-healing-systems for this and some doctor "look a like" NPC-person keeping them in service.<br><br>2. Implants will be a feature that is auto generated be the machines if the player pays for the implant.</i><br><br>I believe the person asking the questions about doctors and implants must have been an Anarchy-Online fan.  As what he asked for are major features of that game.  Personally, I think Mindark should maybe look into the Doctor field a little more.  Field medics are fun to play, and add more to the PvP aspect of a game.  Did I mention I enjoy PvP?<br><br><i>The first thing you have to do when you log in to Project Entropia for the first time is to create you character. <br><br>Then you come to your apartment. You will be equipped with some standard cloths and some other things to get started. Those things will not be saleable in any store and won &#769;t have any value. But it will help you to start your way in Project Entropia.<br><br>We will not give away any money for you to start with.<br><br>Prizes for houses will be set under our beta tests. There will be several different houses, from small cottage to huge skyscraper and the prizes will set to what kind of house you want to buy.</i><br><br>This makes perfect sense, obviously if starting items had material worth, you&#8217;d have people making mass amounts of accounts and turning the starting items into money.  People will do anything for money.  Please click our banners.<br>

"For this to work, it's necessary to have constant development of the game - we will make sure that new objects, skills, monsters and robots are added. The development of new land areas will occur partly from MindArk, but also from players who will have the opportunity to buy floating platforms that they may place out at sea, and should enough of these be placed together they would in effect build a new continent. We will even allow players to participate in creating and building their own things." <br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Macroing:<br>I had played the game since just after beta and was truly bored, the game just didn&#8217;t hold the magic that it used to after leveling 4+ guys over 50 by hand.<br><br>Then I discovered Macros and this changed my ideas radically. Mostly because of ACTOOL By cameron: <a href="http://www.cameroncole.net/ac.html">http://www.cameroncole.net/ac.html</a><br>I got in at a good time when the Magic Defense Macros were just starting to get big.<br><br>I leveled "Havalina" to lvl 49 in 8 days of macroing!<br>Then the portal bots came in there were some really cool ones that would log on and off mules that held different portals for you. I made lvl 1 runners in each new world they popped up in to go see these wonders. Then all of a sudden in my own world (FF) Gand popped up, eventually turned into Angel Deepdale and stayed around Ayan and then Baishi for months. My hat is off to Dave for the Community service He provided thousands and thousands of AC players with his portals.<br><br>Dave is an avid macro coder and one of the best from what I have seen . He also Created "Robotica" ,a very useful macro programming platform that reads packets, It knows when you are low on health, mana, stamina, it could tell you which monster is attacking you etc etc etc.<br><br>A small interview with Dave from : <a href="http://www.onlinegamegimp.com/">http://www.onlinegamegimp.com/</a><br><blockquote><font color="#6699CC">Q: What got you started into macroing?</font><br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: I was bored and have no life. The normal prerequisite for any serious AC development. </font><br><br><font color="#6699CC">Q: What do you see in the near future of macroing?</font><br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: ACTool was really hot during its prime, but I see game interaction being the future, since obtaining your stats, monster name, etc are vital for advanced macroing. ACScript fills that gap nicely, but its syntax and nonintuitive structure confuse old-time macroers who aren't interested in diving into hardcore scripting. Robotica was intended to fill the gap, but I overcomplicated my tool a bit and may perform major surgery on it shortly. Choices are always a bonus: ACScript, ACTool, Robotica, Decal, ACHook custom programs, EZClient.. numerous options with limitless possibilities. Our 3rd party devs just rock, no other <br>MMORPG has this luxurious a selection of tools.</font> <br><br><font color="#6699CC">Q:  Tell me about some of the greatest macros you have come across or coded.</font><br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: Classics would be Madar's Magic defense, Oceana's fullpack tradeskill, and single tab fully beneficials. Oceana is my hero for various scripting needs. She'll adopt a macro, then improve it substantially and make the old one obsolete. Just gotta love that Oceana girl!</font> <br><br><font color="#6699CC">Q:  What is entailed in the aerlinthe macros?</font> <br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: When critters start draining back, it's time to ditch ACTool and use programs that react to character changes. Like healing on low health, switching from drain to harm at target points, splitting peas when outta comps, refreshing buffs upon expiration. Not rocket science by far, but merely planning specific goals and reacting to environmental factors.</font> <br><br><font color="#6699CC">Q:  What are you currently working on as far as AC macros etc?</font> <br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: People using scripts all seem to have a dozen common goals in mind - DrainBot, PortalBot, ArcherPerch Bot, MeleeBot, etc. I'm realizing that creating quality, dedicated programs to accomodate each niche might be a superior alternative to generalized scripting languages. Then release the code, and let users customize. Of course, I could be wrong (yet again). </font><br><br><font color="#6699CC">Q:  All of us on FF saw your dedication to the community with the addition of Gand and Angel. Tell us about angels setup (the PCBOARD on plywood) and what kept you there for those long months etc.</font> <br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: FrostFell never had a portal bot, and I kept reading how elite other server's bots were so decided to make my own. I wrote the MT guy asking for code and he refused, so I broke out the Big Chief pad, and maroon crayola, and designed a free bot, planted him in Ayan then prayed people would actually use him. One thing I learned from having a high-traffic bot is how generous people are at heart. Even though Angel was free, folks would dump countless trade notes on me. After filling up three mules with D's to the point I had no room for my armor and wands, I turned off GiveItems on Angel and people STILL tried donating cash. That says a lot about FrostFell inhabitants - there's an ample supply of asses, but nice players outnumber them immensely.</font> <br><br><font color="#6699CC">Q:  From a coders point of view is there anything thats not possible by using the packet sniffers? What type of things are possible? </font><br><br><font color="#CCCC99">A: Sure, all client-side activity that's not sent downstream would require research to find the bytes in AC's process, but ultimately there's no limit. Newer devs bring a fresh prospective to the table, and make cool new discoveries. On every occasion, us older guys can pickup and enhance our tools. When combined, we all help each other out and everyone benefits. Marvelous example would be Cibo's XML. Inside are contributions from hundreds of people. Scramble it all together and we have this big team of folks dedicated to making everyone's gaming experience better. Teamwork - it's what makes all things possible :) </font></blockquote><br>For more great macroing information please visit Cams site: <a href="http://www.cameroncole.net/ac.html">http://www.cameroncole.net/ac.html</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With all of the plugin hysteria going on, this one is on a more serious note. Please be warned, you cannot trust the majority of the sites out there who post or claim to have working plugins. In fact, if someone offers you a plugin that sounds too good to be true, odds are it's a virus or trojan. That is the case with this one. GODMODE.EXE is a trojan. Anyone who offers you a file that claims to supply god or game master types of capabilities, is most likely out to destroy your account or steal your character. Please be warned, and disregard immediately. If you receive anything that you have questions about, send them our way, and we'll put them through a full test.<br><br>Now often you'll have a cruel individual take a working plugin and alter it to a non-working plugin. If someone out there has gotten this GodMode.exe to work, supposedly allowing you to Jump without Delay, let me know also. We'll track down the correct version.<br>

What's up with all of these Plugins<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Thursday, May 10, 2001   10:22 PM EST by <a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dr.Twister</a></font><a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I know that I've already started making an impact on things since my return, by some of the letters I've received in my mail recently. Since most of you probably don't know what my site is really all about, I thought I would take this opportunity to share with you an idea of some of the non-sense I get in my mailbox.<br><blockquote><font color="#cccc33">I'm sure they (Turbine) are VERY glad you have done that (Posted Decal Plugins)... and you have even combined it with GEAR!!! the single most annoying piece of software on the market today.. not only is it a cheat.. but it is lag inducing.. which harms the quality of play of everyone around the CHEATER... <br> <br>I'm just glad you don't have any of my plugins available so i don't have to TELL you to remove them..<br> <br>This is a WARNING do not post or even Link to any of my utilities or plugins most noteable is the upcomming decal plugin for use with merry's next program rainpea...<br> <br>If you do so you will receive the next letter from my lawyers.<br> <br>PS. have a nice day<br> <br>GEAR is for lamers. and posting gear makes you one of them.. your site USED to be borderline decent.. ahh well things change...</blockquote></font><br>My response...Maybe you're not familiar with who I am. My name is Dr.Twister, and I don't really care what you think. The point of my posting Decal plugins along with Gear itself is simply so that the freakin problems that they cause will be noticed, bring a even level to the playing field and hopefully above all, make Turbine fix them.<br><br>This letter amuses me for several reasons. One, while calling Gear a cheat, inducing lag and destroying the quality of play for everyone, this individual goes on to say, they write their OWN plugins, which if they weren't up to speed on things, induces lag, destroys the quality of play for everyone, could be considered a cheat and ultimately, is illegal.<br><br>Illegal you say? Sure, it's all over the place for Microsoft Zone and AC TOS. Like "You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available through the MSN Sites/Services"... ie. a plugin that you use to find where monsters are, or tracks components, or extends the radar field, or increases the speed of your character is manipulating the datastream in a way that it was originally not intended to do and further more, is an advantage to other players. This advantage would be considered cheating and thus, against the Terms of Service.<br><br>As I've stated in the past, and although I can't seem to get it through to most people out there, I make information available to everyone. I don't restrict it to a small group of people to benefit of off others. I make it available so that everyone may have the ability to be at the same level. I make it available so that someone will take notice and fix it. I make it available so idiots like the above email won't be able to write their plugins and run off crying to their parent's lawyers when they don't work any longer. Lawyers, ha, makes me feel like I am accomplishing things again.<br><br>So agree or disagree, think what you want, like it or don't... just do me one favor, if you don't like it, don't come back to this freakin site ever again. As the letter&#8217;s last comments state, this &#8220;site USED to be borderline decent, ahh well things change&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; GOOD, now I can get back to making this site rock once again.<br><br>For those who want plugins, Decal, or Gear - go to our file section at <a href="http://ac.drtwister.com/files" class=link2>http://ac.drtwister.com/files</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had the chance to corner Artifact Entertainment's own Jeremy "Utildayael" Dixon and fire off a few questions that I thought our DTN readers might want to hear the answer to.  Here's what he had to say.<br><br><b>Dipes: How the devil are you?</b><br> <br>JD: Pretty good. It&#8217;s been quite busy here at Artifact over the past months as we march forward in alpha and pass milestones. Things are coming along quite well!<br><br><b>Dipes: So about the PvP system, got any new goodies to whet our appetites with?</b><br><br>JD: There&#8217;s really nothing new to say about the PvP system that hasn&#8217;t been released already. We have some very interesting and unique systems in place that should make PvP quite enjoyable, even for people who don&#8217;t like PvP. <br> <br><b>Dipes: Will you receive experience and/or increased skill gains by engaging in PvP with your enemy?  What about with your blood enemy?</b><br><br>JD: We have not decided at this time on allowing skill gains through PvP for gameplay reasons. We will conduct testing of this during beta to see if it works out or not.<br> <br><b>Dipes: What is AE's stance on exploiting bugs in the game?</b><br><br>JD: Exploiting is a very broad term and would have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Any form of hacking or attempting to alter the data stream is not tolerated in any form and will result in immediate banning and possible legal actions. <br><br><i>While we all acknowledge that actual game hacking is detrimental to the community as a whole, I hope AE will take a leniant stance with people who find and use bugs to their advantage.  DTN's goal is to help these games become the best they possibly can, and rest assured that if we find an exploitable bug, we'll let the community know about it until it's fixed. -Dipes</i><br><br><b>Dipes: I recall hearing that AE wanted taverns to be a large part of the game community where you'd go after adventuring to share stories and drink a beer, unlike in some other games whose taverns are empty 24/7.  What kinds of things are you planning to implement in taverns and inns to actually draw players?  Gambling? Dueling?  Caged monkey knife fights?</b><br><br>We have a lot of things planned for inns/taverns but we aren't ready to disclose all of them just yet since they are changing regularly. <br><br><i>I'm taking that as a Yes to caged monkey knife fights -Dipes</i> <br> <br><b>Dipes: One last question.  How far from beta, in a rough guesstimate, would you say we are?</b><br><br>JD: We are still looking at Q4 of this year for closed beta. <br><br><br>Mmmmm...Beta.  That's all the time I felt comfortable demanding from Utildayael's day, and I thank him for answering my questions.  With E3 coming up, I bet we're going to see some new media come our way soon, so keep your heads up and eyes open, because DTN will try to have it all for you.<br><br>--Dipes<br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=143&forum=11&0"class=link2>Visit the forum to talk about it</a><br>

UO to have NO Support Now<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Wednesday, May 9, 2001   3:08 PM EST by <a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dr.Twister</a></font><a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As if you thought UO was relying solely on its in-game, free, volunteered support staff, think again. It's obvious that now not only will they drop UO2 and focus their efforts on the continued expansion of UO, but they will also use the extra resource to improve their customer support.... hmm... not really! <br><blockquote><font color=#cccc33>In the coming weeks and months, Ultima Online players will begin to see changes to the UO experience that will affect and impact the game in many ways as we update systems, introduce new content, and continue to grow and expand the world of Britannia. <br><br>In addition to systems and design changes, we will address how Origin supports Volunteer programs. Effective today, May 9th, Ultima Online will no longer host Interest, Quality Assurance, and Counselor Volunteer programs in North America and Europe. Though it&#8217;s a difficult decision for us, it is based on the reassessment of our online, company-wide business structure as we address growth and changes in the online entertainment industry. As a result, volunteer programs throughout all of Electronic Arts have been affected by this reassessment. This decision does not affect the existing volunteer programs in Japan, nor does it currently affect the Companion program.<br><br>Whether answering questions, creating intriguing and amusing events, or aiding their fellow players in any number of ways, these volunteers have enriched their own Ultima Online experience and helped fulfill the Ultima Online experience for so many other members of the UO community. A permanent acknowledgement to these volunteers will be placed on both facets of each affected shard, located near the Britain Counselor Hall. <br><br>Over the last several years, players volunteering in Ultima Online have assisted their fellow players with great creativity, aptitude, and grace, and our thanks go out to all who have participated in these programs since their inception. This commitment to UO, as well as the commitment of hundreds of thousands of players worldwide, is the foundation on which we hope to grow and support the game far into the future. </font></blockquote><br><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=132&forum=16&0" class=link2>What do you think?

While I was Out...<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Wednesday, May 9, 2001   2:10 PM EST by <a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dr.Twister</a></font><a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So let me get this straight, while I was out of the office, a program that practically changes the way people play Asheron's Call was discovered, and although a large amount of complaints have been raised, Turbine has done nothing to put a stop to the madness... I suppose they didn't learn from the mistakes of UO when third party programs became a way of life in game.<br><br>It's rather interesting that the week I decide to make a return to the online gaming scene that a little program known as GEAR makes it's way into my inbox.<br><br>Now granted, GEAR is actually better known as SpeedHack - a program that in simple terms increases the speed of your character in game. This program was originally written for games like Counter-Strike, Quake and Unreal, and has supposedly been used with AC for quite some time.<br><br>This program is sick. I mean, can't you people PvP without needing a little boost? What's even worse is that this program has only been made available to those few who get their jollys from running circles around someone they want to fight. If you want to fight, stop running.<br><br>Well there is no doubt in my mind that a few of you out there are saying that you would be able to handle me with or without the hack, and others saying that until Turbine fixes it, they don't consider it illegal. Yet I believe there are even more saying that it's simply not fun any more to play with people who I can't keep up with.<br><br>Hopefully this will help even the playing field a little more, while at the same time, give Turbine a little boost to get things fixed up.<br><br>GEAR is now available to everyone, along with some handy dandy documentation with some more insights to what this thing really does. It may be confusing at first, but take a second to read through the materials, and you should catch on.<br><br><a href="http://ac.drtwister.com/files" class=link2>Click Here</a> - or on the menu to the left, and go to our AC Files section. You'll find what you have all been looking for.<br><br>While on the subject, there are some rumors out there of one or two other programs. These either being additional plugins to GEAR or separate alternatives to speed or radar style hacks. If you have any information, toss it my way, and I'll be happy to host the script.<br><br>Now what do you think? Will or even can Turbine fix this thing? Everquest had a similar problem with fixes that caused more lag. Share your thoughts and opinions in our Game Forum.<br><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=74&forum=19&6" class=link2>Will Gear Ever Be Fixed?</a><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Found on COD and VN boards Jesse (Dev) Writes:<br><br>One sunny idlyic day, Jesse went to his favorite mage shop to restock his comps. After having a number of different macro scripts, decal plugins, bad client hacks fail to help him in his endeavor to shop quickly and easily, he was doing subtraction for the 50+ comps (math is HARD!) he was buying to see how many he should buy. Right around the powdered amber, he snapped..... <br><br>It wasn't pretty. A keyboard was broken and a cat scampered out of the room. <br><br>'Something must be done!' <br><br>Out of my broken keyboard, you get features! <br><br>So sometime in the nearish future, there's a new feature coming down the pipe: automatic component refilling at your local mage shops. <br><br>The way it works is such: in the component listing panel (F5), alongside the amount of each component is a second number in red. This is the "desired amount" of the associated component. <br><br>Walk up to a vendor and open them up, and type "@fillcomps". The buy list will be filled (instantly!) with any components needed to bring the inventory up to the number of desired comps. Any components that either were not offered, or that the vendor did not sell enough of, will be reported. <br><br>So why am I posting this here and not just surprising everyone? I want feedback on additional features for it. What else would your ideal component buyer do? <br><br>Some things that have been brought up: <br>. Sorting the comps into sacks -- This is unlikely since there isn't a good UI construct for it. But who knows, something might fall into my lap. <br>. "Profiles" -- @loadcompprofile 1 might set up your mage for self-buffing, profile 2 might be set up for twinking, 3 might be for draining, etc etc. I'm not sure how used this would be though. Bang for the buck and all that. <br>. What else? This is where ya'll come in... <br><br>-Insert standard disclaimer about how this feature is still in development and may not appear for some time.- <br><br>punk rock, <br>jesse <br><br>Hip preview screenshot: <br><a href="http://www.turbinegames.com/qa/comp_buyer.jpg">http://www.turbinegames.com/qa/comp_buyer.jpg</a> <br><br>Heres the VN board link if you want to post your ideas:<br><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=11506766&replies=1">http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=11506766&replies=1</a><br><br><br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"GEAR" whats all the buzz about? Gear is probably the most contraversial thing to happen to AC since the blowing up of<br>Arwic.<br><br>Gear a.k.a Speedhack has been out for a looonggg time. It was created back in the first days of Half-life. Some say that GEAR overclockes your CPU which is dangerous and this cannot be farther from the truth.<br><br>What Gear does is simple. Your operating system has a thing called a system timer that controls the flow of data and when to process specific timed commands. All Gear does is modify this timer. It causes things to be proccessed much faster than they are supposed to. Most things that use the win32 timers are effected , like winamp,videos,games etc.<br><br>The devs are saying that within the next couple of patches they will get rid of gear. The only practical uses for GEAR that I have found are running across long distances, it speed up my max run about 30%.<br>I will also set it 1 or 2 notches above normal when hunting with "Havalina" My OG Archer at Cathedral as it speeds up the animations on myself and the monsters it allows me to stand right next to high lvl monsters and dodge VI war spells.<br><br>I have added a link to GEAR below for you to try out because they are going ot nerf it this patch anyway.

A Gamer's Look at Snacking<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Wednesday, May 9, 2001   11:05 AM EST by <a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dipes</a></font><a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While not directly Horizons related, I've developed a small list of snacks that I highly recommend for any serious gamer.<br><br><b>Drinks:</b><br><br>For serious gamers, there is a single drink that stands tall above all others : <a href="http://www.bawls.com"class="link2">Bawls</a>.  Many a LAN party has been survived by consuiming this beverage alone, which is powerpacked with a huge amount of caffeine derived from some fruit called a Guarana.  It tastes great, has a neat bottle, and will keep you up all night (You don't even get caffeine jitters).  Trust me when I say you want these Bawls in your mouth.<br><br>For gamers looking for a bit more relaxation, I reccomend Olde English 800, in the forty.  Nothing says "GAT GAT" like sipping your malt liquor while playing a rousing game of Counter-Strike.  Although I can't remember the results, I do recall attempting a test to see if Olde English improved my gameplay.  It doesn't really matter if it did, because after 2 or 3, YOU'RE INVINCIBLE!!!<br><br><b>Snacks:</b><br><br>Crispy, thin, and efficient, the new Ritz crisp crackers have proved to be an excellent source of gaming nutrition.  The bag inside the box delivery method makes it easy for you to reach in and grab a cracker in between respawns and kills and be back in the action without a second lost.  The bite-sized round shape also leaves minimal crumbs on your oversized gut and keyboard.<br><br>If you find yourself to be truly lacking sustenance, I recommend a powerbar as a main course.  They not only give you the energy you need to play on, but they also have an extremely long consumption time.  Taken one bite at a time, these puppies can last all night.  Hell, they can last all week if you take a few breaks, and they taste the exact same as they did when they were opened.  I've had one on my desk for damn near a month now, and it's still going strong.<br><br>Well, that's all I've got for you now.

Is this cheating? you bet your life it is and he should have been fired a long time ago. Last I heard he was promoted to internal investigations, so once again VI tends to promote the problem people that know how to kiss ass. I know who his characters are, as he brags about his kills often, but I wont mention is here. As for the BoB and events like that, Yes, it totally caters to the uber guild, but thats not really his direct doing, just the way it happens to shake out. Unfortunately Lady D lacks the intelligence to craft an event that would even the playing field a bit. <br><br>Hope this helps guys, <br><br>SkrewVI............. </i></blockquote><br><p><br> Well he sure dropped a bomb on the MB with that reply ) Im scared. *mental note;dont try to play EQ's lame pvp servers cause even though its lame,they still cheat*<br> Be sure to post your questions for SkrewVI and cross your fingers and he may just answer them )<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ultima Online, Everquest, Asheron's Call, now Anarchy-Online, all have had and some still do "Dupe Bugs".  Now those unfamiliar with a dupe bug, it is a bug that allows you to make a copy of an item.  Throughout Ultima Online, players sometimes using 3rd Party Programs, other times just playing with the game mechanics, were able to dupe items.  In some cases the servers were turned back to before the dupe occurred.  Then they were fixed.  Other times the duped occurred, some people made it rich, but nothing terrible happened.  Fast forward to Project-Entropia though.  In this game a player can turn his items into cash.  Real life money.  If someone was to dupe items, they could quickly make some real life money.  Costing the company a lot, in fact it could make them have to close their doors in the worst case.  What kind of protection will Project-Entropia have for this?  You can not guarantee a program will have no dupes ever.  Will the company turn back the servers if a dupe occurs?  Also, lets say I sell something and put it onto my credit card.  Now the servers go back ten hours.  Does my credit card refund the payment I just made, since my items are no longer purchased.  I know it must be early, but I would love a statement from Mindark.<br><br>Your opinions..... click <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=92&forum=36" class="link2">here</a> to discuss.<br>

Tab out of EQ and delete the files of the zone your going into to . Say your zoning into ....oh...Western Wastes. You open yer EQ directory,find the Sirens Grotto file and delete it. Then tab back into EQ. You will crash. Relog and it will patch the zone. When you finally get back in game . 1-2 mins later. You will be at the zones safe point MOST OF THE TIME ( i ended up in 2 GM areas on 2 occasions Great Divide was one of those zones) in the case of Sirens grotto,the safe point is at the WW zone. THIS IS NOT the way i was speaking of when i said how to get from CS to WW without getting touched ) This way,however, accomplishes the same thing .<br>

It's also one picture from the heap of junk Glitchless will be throwing out at the end of May. <br><br>You can find the picture <a href="http://dawn.stratics.com/content/sod/05062001.jpg"class="link2">here</a>.<br><br>If you read the news at stratics carefully we also find out that the "big surprise" is just a big load of media. So, it isn't beta. Maybe stratics is just BS'ing, but, we can't tell unless they fix the mistake. Either that or Glitchless is BS'ing Stratics. If they are..HAHAHAHA! :p Until we know exactly, beta is still far off.<br>

In fact, nearly 50% of all people would want Ebay integration.  I am sure Tommy Strand would be interested in these figures, as He currently believes the majority of gamers dislike Ebay.  I for one am very pro Ebay.  Hell, if I work hours in a game, and now I want to move on, it is nice to make a little $$.  If I have tons of $$, but work all day, I wish I could buy a nice well established account.<br><br>Anti-Capitalists piss <a href=mailto:quantum@drtwister.com>here</a>.<br><br>I'll post it if it's good.<br>

The Irekei are fierce warriors, and fond of blades, and they dance with wild abandon at their festivals and gatherings, but they do NOT practice bladewaeving. Why? Because when the Khalinviri took the first steps down the enlightened path that led to their eventual transformation, they deliberately renounced every last shred of Elvish culture - language, customs, you name it.<br><br>So, not only was there indeed a great shortage of bladeweavers after the Dragon rose, but they wouldn't have learned from one even if they had one. The Devil Men are a proud folk.<br><br>Some might say that the Irekei were foolish in this one case, throwing out the baby with the bathwater as it were, but I wouldn't say that to any Irekei's face..."</i></blockquote>Ooh, the Irekei sound like bad asses.<br>And may I mention today is <a href="http://www.goodvibes.com/nmm/mathon.html?BASKETID=00_3af5579198fe3">National Masturbation Day</a> ?<br>Good times.<br>

All of these are things we wanted to have, though (but just didnt have time for) so I wouldn't be suprised if they resurface again at some point.<br><br>Warden<br>Wolfpack"</i></blockquote>What the bloody hell ?

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello and well met. A lot of you may have remember that i used to write for Xsploitz.com . My compadre from Xsploitz, Carnage, is developing a game and needs help. So heres a copy of the request.<br><p><blockquote><i><br><br>This is Carnage from UOServer/Xsploitz/UO/EQ/Whatever Else I did. <br>Most of you are my friends or have played on one of the UO Servers I have made. This request comes a little different then the past requests to play my servers, or to visit my site.<br><br>I'm currently building a 3d Online Game from scratch, and I need anyone who can program well in VB, or who can make MDLs (Models) and 3d Graphics for weapons armor and game items, etc.... You can make these in 3d Studio, or anyother software you are familiar with. I'm looking for a team of about 15 people, mostly artists. This game will be released free for anyone to play. Anyone participating will of course be able to help choose the name of the game and be in the credits, and get anything else they may want.<br><br>So if your interested, please reply or email me at Steven@lacharite.com<br><br>Thanks</i></blockquote><br><p><br> So send him an email and good luck Carnage !!!!<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I used to say tanarus was my relaxation game but its a total shit joke now too. Verant has 100% shown thier lack of concern over customers in general in EQ and it has carrid over into tanarus.To generalize and say THIS patch will help 75% off the people means you alienate 25% ...but hey we still make 754% happy this time... Now if only the 25% would leave and put thier cash elsewhere. Then the next time it happens they loose maybe another 25%.SONY sure screwed this one. Buy into a game and give them the power of managment...stupid. <br><br>I personaly will never buy another Sony Game product or a Verant Product based on how shitty they turned after they started making cash. Another Toilet to flush i suppose.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I keep telling myself that )<br><br> The game is getting old already. Im sure its because its beta.....they work out bugs and fix quests.<br><br> The players,however, all act like EQ players. Im seriouse.<br> Try getting a group the majority of the time. Most would rather solo then look at you much less speak to you. And donot take the tone of an equal to a GM....you will hurt his delicate pride and he will make SCARY threats ! Maybe when the new lands open it will get fun for me again. But as of now its too EQish for me to be playing it in beta when i could be playing EQ which is not in beta )<br><br>Im trying to hang in there. My wife loves it still and plays like a zelot *bleh*<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I've begun to bring DTN back to life. You should start seeing some small changes every day or so. The message forums have opened, so feel free to register and begin using them. From here, I'll try to open up a new game site each week or so, until we get back up to speed.<br><br>Although, the resurge of the network is great, it still is not the much anticipated change that we've been promoting the past month. When we are done with the sites, we'll open up the good stuff.<br><br>For now, just relax, and enjoy what we are able to dish out.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So a guy is selling a Walrusboned shield today. Hes asking 4k...and asking 4k ...over and over so finally i say :" Hey boss, i can get 1 of those every 3 kills" He says how.....so insteadof sharring with him alone i share with you all.<br> <br>The way to get a 90%+ drop rate in skyshrine.<br><br>Pull cubes to the zone........thats it. Thier pathing gets em stuck and they run past the zone, have your group ALL zone out to clear aggro then come back, pull it back to an attackable range and unload. DONOT let it get back past the zone or your gonna be at it all day.<br> <br>9 kills 7 loots 3 were shields but 1 WAS a square helm )<br> <br>Theres yer grit people !!!<br>
