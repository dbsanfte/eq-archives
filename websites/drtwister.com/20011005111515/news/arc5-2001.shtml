New Release of EQW.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At around 5 Eastern this morning, JustSomeDude released his newest version of EQW.  The latest build works with Windows 2k, and XP as well as all other previous Windows versions.  Along with this new build is the ability to run multiple Everquest clients at the same time on the same computer.  While I wouldn't recommend you using it on a raid, or in a sticky situation because of the packet loss that occurs from time to time, you have to agree that this piece of software is phenomenal.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Early this morning I decided to break out an old network monitoring tool and start mapping and monitoring the trials and tribulations of the Anarchy Online servers. I did some tracerouting, some pinging, and various other nifty Internet Tricks. First confirmation was what everyone else has been stating, that Funcom uses Exodus Communications as ISP for the Dimension Server.<br><br>Much to my amusement & chagrin I discovered that the front door to Exodus's network is basically closed. I've been monitoring downtime of said router, going on an hour straight now. That's not 'up and down', folks. That's solid 100% grade A DEAD.<br><br>The question I have is, who is at fault for this? A source inside AO's launch states that if Exodus admitted it, they'd be stating they're unable to deliver what they promised Funcom. Instant breach of contract. If Funcom admitted it, they'd be stating they skimped on server costs and screwed everyone over to save a wooden kroner. Instant fan-base hatred.<br><br>Either way, I doubt we will get a real answer any time soon. This reporter personally hopes the fault lies within the bowels of the Exodus Network, and not the offices of Funcom.<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Icon and Nog from Spyderweb-design have released their updated <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com/downloads/EQHacks.zip">EQHacks.zip</a> file. After the last patch the old .hak file ceased to work, so they worked through the night and publicly released the new offsets. If you haven't seen the Game Hacking Utility or the .hak file I suggest taking a look at it. The best way to use it is to run the everquest patch program, and when it gets you to the "I Agree," "Decline," EULA Agreement, Alt-Tab out and load it up. <br><br>If you haven't already taken a look at EQW, I highly recommend it. EQW does not currently work with EQMacros/Xylobot, but it does work well with Everbot. Dysassymbler, the creator of Everbot, has been working closely with the creator of EQW to have their programs work in tandem. <br><br>It appears that verant hasn't changed the speed hack offset this patch, so the old variables still work. Rumor around the office says that a nice little speed hack trainer to work with Everbot/EQW will be coming out soon. As soon as we get our hands on it here at Dr. Twister we will be sure to scan it for you, and release it to the public.<br><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/index.php?viewcat=8">Drop us a line in the forums.</a><br><br>WoLF`Sebastian<br><br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fadinaway of Funcom Support, leader of the Events Team, replied to some <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com">Anarchy-Online bashing</a>, which is occuring in high volume, but specifically to <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=6242dd204d0fa77eb8ea0a9c803a15f7&threadid=21768<br>">this</a> thread.<blockquote><br>Hi Morgar and Everyone,<br>Actually, please note the announcment at the top of the page.<br>Funcom absolutely did not ignore the Beta Testers.  Beta Tester feedback was extremely valuable in everything we have done with Anarchy Online.  Funcom only wanting your money is another bold statement without valid backup. Funcom is a business, yes.  Funcom does wish to make a profit, yes.  But, to put out something Funcom did and does not feel is ready would be suicide.  I truly hope you do not feel that this is the last product Funcom wishes to put to the mass market.<br><br>MMORPG is *the* newest genre in video gaming.  Therefore, things will be tweaked. Things *may* go wrong, and fixes *will* be found.<br>Believe it or not, Anarchy Online's launch was one of the smoothest in MMORPG history.  Asheron's Call was the only other MMORPG to be released with as few problems, and they had a good share too.<br><a href="http://ultima.lightning.net/ao/en/h...LiveServer.html">http://ultima.lightning.net/ao/en/h...LiveServer.html</a> ... Is a third party link and in no way related to Funcom.  Whether you entirely choose to believe in a program not related to the product is up to you.  <br>To sum it up.  Funcom is very proud of Anarchy Online.  We feel it is a product that was ready for launch.  Yes, there were problems, but they are all being addressed and fixed at a rapid pace.  I hope this helps address some of your concerns.<br><blockquote><br><br>So we learn Anarchy-Online had a better release than Everquest.  Funcom likes money(contrary to socialistic beliefs).  Don't support the AO server tools, cause they make it look like the servers are up. And Asheron's Call had a better release then Anarchy-Online(any theory why?).  In all political correctness, and hopefully before Verant was notified, Fadinaway mentioned that the actual game of Everquest is amazing.  In fact, Funcom modeled their release after Everquests' hoping to get a 400,000 playerbase, as Verant claims.<br><blockquote><br>Hi,<br>Normally I would not reply to a thread I have already posted in, but this warrants an answer.  The last thing I would do is bash Everquest.  Everquest in an incredible game that paved the way for all 3-D MMORPGs to come.  Verant did an amazing job and they will always be known as the first true 3-D MMORPG.  I am not sure how you can state it was not Verant's / Everquest's fault the servers were unavailable over 75% of the time during the first two weeks of <br>launch.  Verant / Everquest will state, just like I will state, they were responsible for every bit of the problems and issues involved in the launch of Everquest.  Backbone / Server choices are the companies, not the internets.  I was very involved in the Beta and Launch of Everquest and Ultima Online.  I can say with full confidence this is an incredibly smooth launch compared.<br>quote:<br>There was no lag causing me to be unable to zone into new areas, use shops, or attack creatures despite a ping time of 110 milliseconds.<br>Absolutely true.  In other games, it prevented you from playing period and logging in.<br>So, in the light of all of these questions and comments. *Yes*, I see Anarchy Online as being one of the smoothest launches in MMORPG history.  I and Funcom will stand behind this statement.<br>Believe me, with what we have seen in "rough launches", this is a very smooth launch.<br>Enjoy Anarchy Online, it will only get better from here.  And, believe me, I will be here every step of the way.<br>__________________<br>Fadinaway<br>Funcom Support<br>Events Team Lead<br><a href="http://www.funcom.com">http://www.funcom.com</a><br><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com">http://www.anarchy-online.com</a><br></blockquote><br>Everquests' excuse is they are the first 3D-MMORPG.  Asheron's Call does not need an excuse.  Funcom, while providing an okay release, being the third 3D-MMORPG(if you write me saying WWIIOL, you get insta-ban), should have done better(perhaps I am just angry I leveled from 6 to 7 about five times already). <br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier today I had another amazing.. 'moment of wonder'. While strolling through the north east streets of Omni-1 Entertainment, I made an amazing (yet trivial) discovery:<br><br><I><B>Bronto Burger</B><br>Bronto Burger locations dot the face of Rubi-Ka more abundantly than trees, or atleast so it seems at times. I recently and purely upon whim decided to check a Bronto Burger vendor and see what products he offered for sale. To my astonishment and surpise, the vendor in question had a quite lengthy selection of food and beverage for sale! From Joka-Poka to Lime Slime Cola. Kappa Berries to Double Bronto Burgers with Cheese. Very humorous, and very impressive!</I><br><br>

Sullon Zek, first impressions<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dipes entered Grobb for the first time that night, to find naked trolls to his left and his right .  After having scribed inner fire and his minor heal, he made for the swamp to bring Ranjor his meal.  When what to Dipes' wondering eyes do appear, but 120 n00bs auctioning level 60 gear. STFU, I say, and others agree, you may find that joke funny but it isn't to me.<br><br>Hail, a large rat I said with a snear, as 20 naked shamans raped it for ears.  Decaying Skeleton, Have at thee!  3 harm touches and they stole it from me.  Froglock tad, you're mine I say!  KS'd again, its not my day.<br><br>OK.  I'll stop speaking in rhyme.  Sullon Zek is ownij, but the first few hours were hellacious.  Everyone makes the same stupid jokes, and everyone makes the same stupid claim that they will be level 60 first.  Another favorite of people is to keep tabs on the others.  "I heard there's a level 14 already"!  "First GBS dropped!"  Dude, STFU!  The only good that can come of my knowing that is me getting my arse kicked by someone twice my level.  <br><br>One other thing that really sucks is the fact that they took out PLing quests.  The Senior Guide got on last night around 10PM eastern and broadcast that they were disabling all the low level quest NPCs because they "want us to experience sullon zek in all its glory"  Whatever that means.<br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#8217;s really a no-win situation. You make a game, you hype the content way before it&#8217;s written in stone, and then fans get all pissy when you can&#8217;t deliver their stables of pet dragons and personalized castles with monogrammed drawbridges. Adversely, say nothing until a few months before release, and no one has any idea who the hell you are. There really has to be a happy medium in here somewhere.<br><br>It was a good long while ago, when I was still hyped about the Dec 2000 release of AO, when I heard of another little game. Dark Age of Camelot, essentially &#8220;another EQ&#8221; in premise, with some similar content. 12 races, 3 major sides in PvP, various classes&#8230; really nothing drop-dead original or amazing. But after playing the beta in two different phases, this clearly is not EQ. At least, as the saying goes, &#8220;EQ without the suck&#8221; is more accurate. Better spell effects, better class variation, better PvP, graphics in general, (naturally) and, quite honestly, a better dev team, when it comes to friendly, sociable, open people. That&#8217;s not really fair to say though. I heard Milo very rarely ate puppies. Alive.<br><br>Still quite similar in concept, unfortunately, as all genre mmogs are. However, in an attempt to bring some unique twists to the norm, everyone tries something different. Horizons dropped trolls and ogres in favor of orcs and goblins. Neocron added naked kinematics technology to enhance our lonely, lonely playing experience. Project Entropia decided to make their in-game credits exchangeable for real-world currency, and baby jebus wept. Atriarch&#8230; well, let&#8217;s not hit them before they get off the ground.<br><br>While not all of these ideas displayed cohesive marketing or even coherent thinking, they were an attempt by each to make themselves unique, to stand out. Mythic, however, broke through this shortsighted mold, with the introduction of a factor hitherto unfound in mmogs.<br><br>Kitsch.<br><br>Nostalgia is one of the highest selling factors in today&#8217;s marketing. Lots of well-off, stupid people want to buy a piece of their lost youth, mostly in the form of hideous décor or a stupid car that is vaguely bastardized off a classic. Reaching farther back into the collective childhood of mankind, Mythic is proud to bring us two pieces of this past, I, personally, would have rather forgot. Forget any preconceptions you might have of what trolls and kobolds are, or should be. Oh please, by the small and merciful gods, wipe those unclean images from your neuroglia. Mythic brings us the new and improved, kitschy swing.<br><br><img src="http://camelot.drtwister.com/pics/bailpic.jpg"><br><br>This isn't neccesarily a good thing, mind you, in my opinion. <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewforum.php?forum=29&7"class="link2">Yours?</a><br>

While skillfully avoiding anything that would violate that precious little thing that keeps me in the game (Non-Disclosure Agreement for those of you that don&#8217;t have a clue), let me say that considering that this is beta and much as still to be implemented, the War Pig is as happy as a pig in &#8230;.hmm, err, ahem, mud. <br><br>	I can only say that from the Midgard point of view, as I do not like playing the Albion side.  Now, before I get a lot of hate mail, let me say this, Bah on you, you fruity role-player!  Thank you, thank you, very much.<br><br>	In all seriousness, I have played both realms, however, I enjoy the Midgard realm, as it now, more so than the Albion realm.  You could attribute this to my nasty melee War Pig nature, if you so chose.  Besides, Dwarf chicks give the War Pig that strange warm sensation in his armored leggings.<br><br>	In other site news, I am still in negotiations with Mythic to get a press list of people that they feel are brave (or foolish) enough to go one on one with Hog of Death.  For those of you that care, I have my sights set on the Online Production Manager, Lori Silva.  Will she accept the challenge?  Only time will tell.  I was, however, grateful to receive an email from the President of Mythic.  It is nice to be loved.  Hey!

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is this reporter's unfounded opinion that today will be the launch day for the highly anticipated Sullon Zek server.  Why would I think SZ is going up today, you might ask?  Well, for one, the 10 hour patch that currently has all the servers down.  The other reason is Anarchy Online.  Let's follow a flow of thought from Dipes for a moment.  Everquest is ailing, with a player base growing more and more disgruntled by the gestapo customer service tactics employed by Verant.  I think for the first time in more than two years Verant may be worried that it will lose a good number of customers to Anarchy Online.  The solution?  Why, give the players some incentive to keep their accounts active; namely, a new server where people can do whatever the hell they want.  It certainly worked for me.  Hell, I reactivated my account for this as a matter of fact.  PvPers want to see this kind of thing, it's just a shame that we don't get experience for PKing though.<br><br>At any rate, we'll know withing a few weeks time exactly what kind of effect Anarchy Online will have on Everquest.  If the Beta test was any indication, we can expect to see tens of thousands of players inhabiting Anarchy Online within the first few days alone.  I think EQ will survive AO with only a few minor scrapes in its player base, so no worried yet.<br><br>Dipes<br>

The announced stress tests never worked, but when everyone was offered good characters, suddenly we have a Stress Test.

Allow a quote, if you will.<i><blockquote>As far as the rest, well it sucks to be number one. And anyone who has room to talk about SBV is J, my only peer outside of Kenickie, Div Devlin, and Morello - who have like.... consistantly updated everyday for the past 18 months, instead of just showing up every six to twelve weeks to post an update about how SB sucks. Other than that, SB.DTN is just a faint echo from the House that J built.</blockquote></i>  I'm not sure what his point is, but I think he's trying to say I'm number one.  Another self-proclaimed internet Genius!  I just wish I had the balls to lick at the heels of everyone I feel is cooler than myself!  Oh J, make my baby!  Scott Jennings, you're so funny, even though you consistently ridicule my existence and I take it like a woman! <br><br>On the Real Shadowbane news front, like, you know, the news people actually give a damn about, nothing new is happening.  Warden has once again come to the boards to tell people that the game isn't about loot, but instead about crushing your oppenents.  This came as a shock to the ign community, who thought the game was about Lum The Mad.  Also an in the news is a <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/community/journal/vamplordkeep/index.shtml" class="link2">Developer Journal</a> which makes an interesting read.  Included are several screenshots and wireframe renders of "The Vampyre's keep".  But don't take my word for it.  Take Vosx's.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, seeing as the cat is out of the bag on those hacks, I guess I'll tell you how to use them. You've got to open up the program called GHU (game hacking utility) and then from that program you open up a .HAK file.  A list of available hacks will show up.  Once this is done, you have to start EverQuest and Alt-Tab out.  Activate the hacks you want to use by right-clicking on them and selecting activate.  Use this at your own risk.  I also figured out how to speed cheat, but this one can get you banned pretty easily if someone sees you.<br><br>The offset for speed is 6710f5, old data is 00, new data can be 03 for level 60 sow speed, and 75 for unbelievably fast speed.  When I was screwing with these values I found that 75 speed will basically allow you to cross west karana in about 2 seconds, which is cool. Like I said, though, use this at your own risk.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Absor did his board visit the other day and answered a few questions that I think you guys may be interested in.  Here is the chopped up and scaled down version of the Absor Infobits, from here on out known as Dipesz0r infobits.<br><br>First, Patch info: On Wednesday, June 27th at 3AM PDT (10AM GMT), all servers will be coming down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 10 hours. <br><b>Dipes Analysis: SULLON ZEK IS GOING UP</b>, Although that's just a guess.<br><br>Question 1:  Put fear/charm back in for pvp range +/- 5 levels!<br>Absor: No<br><br>Question 2: Tell us when SZ is going up!<br>Absor: No<br><br>Question 3: If a monk FDs in a pvp situation, can you kill him?<br>Absor: yes.  We may put something cool in for that though.<br><br>Question 4: Why do we have to con people to see if they are on our deity team?  Wouldn't it be cooler if we had to guess?<br>Absor: Yes, I think it would, but it isn't going to happen that way.  <br><br>Question 5:  Why can't the vendors and guards on the PvP servers be replaced with the same type of MOB but of the alignment of the Team that killed them. <br><br>For example: <br><br>Dark Elves goto East Commons they kill Sgt. Slate this triggers a spawning of a Dark Elf Dragoon that is permanent until defeated by an opposing force which spawns a replacement of the Dragoon with a similarly aligned MOB. The same goes for Vendors. It would seem to me that this would give the teams the ability to control Territiry and put some teeth into any kind of invasion<br><br>Absor: No<br><br><br>So that wraps up this First Edition of Dipez0r infobits.  Have a good Sunday.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Going gold refers to the high quality master CDs that are delivered to the game manufacturing company for replication. These CDs are put in a master machine and their images are read.

These CDs, once written, are packaged, stacked, shrink wrapped and prepped for delivery."<br><blockquote><br>No sure who you're quoting here, but a small (but important) point of<br>clarification:<br><br>Large scale duplication of CD's occurs does not occur with cd-burners, but is actually a more physical process.

After being ignored for several months and watching the same bugs,dupes,hex edits go unchanged i took my stance of total disclosure. Sorry if you dont like it..im sure Casters Realm needs more board trollers.<br><br><br> I mentioned on a forum what i felt was the funniest bit about the pic.....the fact that a SONY employee had that gangsta wigger pic ) Hot young boys with no shirt on is how they viewed it im sure )<br><br><br> Later all, its time for 4 hours of sleep ,everyone have a great weekend, ill be stuck at the damn hospital all weekend.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fatman would call them rumors, but we check our stuff out before we post it.<br><br>	It seems that a certain very nasty witch has been hinting that she is considering a move to DaoC land.  This particular witch is most notorious as one of the founders of EQ ill fated, poorly run guide program.  She was the first top-level volunteer to be given her &#8220;go away&#8221; papers.  Now, for those you of you joining the program late, I&#8217;m referring to EQ as it was in the just prior to release through the first few months of gold.  Said witch is &#8220;rumored&#8221; to be working (read: doing that power hungry corporate slut thing) for another game that is in development. <br><br>	Mythic, be fair warned, the lady I am speaking of is bad news.  In fact, if her &#8220;true&#8221; identity were released to the community that she is involved with, the fall out would be a huge blow to the developing company. Again, nay Sayers, the War Pig does not do &#8220;rumors&#8221;, I speak of only that which I know. <br><br>	Should Mythic decide to ignore the benevolent words of the Hog of Carnage, expect the War Pig to gleefully mock, belittle, taunt and otherwise torment not only the wicked biatch of the guides, but only sharing such love with those responsible for allowing such an evil, horribly demented person into the game.<br><br>	Recently, Mythic added Tweety to their line up.  The War Pig views this as mildly amusing, but, overall, entertaining and harmless.  Hell, I like the idea that Mythic has hired yet another woman to be in a top spot, I hope they pay her well, and treat her even better. <br><br>	Quasi-update: The site has been down most of this week for technical reasons.  I would give you the full story, but, as of this time, it is a ueber geek thing that evades my comprehension.  Suffice it to say, the guilty have been found and are currently having many volts of electricity ran through their most sensitive orifices. <br><br>	Twisted Camelot is also engaged in discussion with Mythic on the subject of exclusive interviews and monthly (maybe bi-monthly) Twisted Chat.  My recommendation for those of you that are literate would be to email the War Pig with your questions.  If they do not appear in an interview, you can either assume that you are an idiot that asks questions more suited for transsexual monkeys with poor fecal slinging ability OR that Mythic would not answer it (so, you should ask in a Twisted Chat). <br><br>	Never let it be said that Dr. Twister discriminates against the mentally challenged.  In fact, evidence would point to the good doctor employing one or two on some of his other sites.<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hola, I'm Dipes and I'm going to be doing some of the EQ updates while Orange takes his sabatical or whatever he's doing.  The only thing I have to say right now is that SULLON ZEK = OWNIJ.  <br><br>For those of you who haven't tried it out yet, I highly reccomend logging on and begging a GM to buff you.  Two days ago they buffed everyone who was online to level 25 to test the new PvP system.  As it stands right now, it looks as if the evil faction is going to be the top dog, as they are dispensing rapings like it's crack-cocaine at an inner city elementary school.  Evil raiding parties have infiltrated Greater Faymart, which seems to be the focal point of the conflict right about now. Give me a tell if you decide to check out the server.  <br><br>For those of you who do play on SZ, I'm still at a loss as to what they want us to do with those PK tokens.  My group must have about 50 of them by now, but the only thing they are good for at the moment (as far as I know) are bragging rights.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'ello Readers, sorry for the outages recently; the  Good Doctor had some Hard Drive problems or something that caused the site to be inoperable for a day or so.  At any rate, nothing shocking happened in the Horizons world at all, so no worries.  I have, however, found the greatest way to pass the time: Sullon Zek.  For those of you who  don't follow EverQuest, it's basically a no holds barred PvP world with three teams of Good, Neutral, and Evil.  Any team member can attack a member of another team as long as both members are above level 6, and the best part of it all: if you're within +/- 5 levels of the opponent you kill, they lose experience.  MWUAHAHAHA.  As of right now the server is in testing mode, and they buffed all characters to level 25.  There will be a server wipe within the week and Sullon Zek will go live.  I reccommend to anyone who enjoys PvP to go play on SZ, it's going to be killer.  If you do decide to play, look me up, my name is Dipes!<br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was taking a look at the poll results we have over on the side there, and noticed that if you add up the 3" uber" races, that's Dragons, Demons, and Angels, you've got nearly 50% of the player base accounted for.  I don't really understand why Vampires hold second place with 14%, I guess there are a lot of Anne Rice fans out there.  Obviously those numbers will dwindle if those races are going to be as difficult to play as AE says they are, but lets be honest for a moment.  My first EQ character was a wizard, arguably one one of the most powerful characters in the original release, especially after the kiting nerfs.  The thing is, I didn't know how powerful wizards were when I started playing (day 1 of EQ's release).  I found the character difficult to play compared to a warrior, so I ditched it.  Warriors were pitiful back then, but easier to level.  If I would have known in the end, however, that a wizard could teleport and cast Ice Comet and the whatnot, I would have stuck it out for the greater rewards.  Many previous MMOG players know now that the more dificult a character is to play, the more rewarding it will be at the higher levels, and accordingly, many won't bat an eye at putting in the time neccessary to develop an extremely powerful Dragon, Angel, or Demon Character.  I am fairly apprehensive about this whole situation.  Unless AE implements a feature that shows every fledgling Dragon the picture of a man's gaping anus every 2 minutes or so, there will be an extremely large amount of dragons.  Sure, a group of humanoid creatures may be able to overcome a single dragon, but how about a group of dragons?  Dragon players don't want to play a sinlge player game either, and I guaruntee we will be seeing some Dragon Only guilds pop up to do some widespread killing.  Go to Darktide today and find Qadi Blood, a level 98+ PK master and ask him if he has any qualms or problems in crushing an entire village of level 50's.  When you get to such obscene power that no one can stop you, mindless PK mode sets in.  There is litterally nothing that a level 98 can't kill solo in AC, so why bother to hunt NPCs?  <br><br>I need some real answers to these questions, so I'm goign to try to get in contact with DA and see what he has to say.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those who troll the FA boards are noticing a trent im sure. people are screaming, hollering and ranting about the lack of the long awaited patch. Savant has said many times that the whole program is being re-coded and that they too are awaiting the data to patch. Sounds cool to me.<br><br><br> Now im comes the disgruntal idiot. Many people are flaming,threatening to quit and out right posting un-nice things on personal websites about the delay of this patch. Not one of the people i have emailed knows the 1st thing about coding, but they feel they have been "lied" to due to th fact that the patch schedualed for 2 weeks ago...isnt up yet.<br><br><br> Now im blown away. Maybe these people should take a look at the big picture.<br><br> RUSH it out and take whats ready and to hell with the loose ends..oh yah..id like to see another game company compaired to OSI )<br><br><br>I mean show some restraint kids. Your playing for free. Your BETA TESTING A GAME. Your not Paying to beta so get off the horse. Fairweather friends are frequenting FAs boards and i wish they would move on to AO or go back to EQ. I guess the fact that most games beta for 2-4 years+ has no bearing on the fact that FA is merely in its 2nd month. <br><br><br> I for one understand how the beta process works, i intend to play and have fun as i am able and DO WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR>.....beta test.<br><br><br>Savant Hang in there...skip the beers( fattening) and dont let the board ranters get you down. You and your companies approach to the game is ground breaking. Letting the player decide how its ran and what goes in was truely revolutionary ...and a pain i nthe ass im sure you know by now )<br><br><br> We are in your world is an apt slogan. So lets all stop acting like an intoxicated VI/OSI employee whos drunk on the power of being able to actually dictate a gamns development direction and get off Savant and his crews ass and let em do what they can as they can. I mean,its funny how SOME people are acting towards FA....they are acting like the same type of people they hate...if ya fight the monster enough you become the monster, eh ?<br><br><br>FA rocks. Those of you who loved UO are gonna go ape for FA. I promise you ) <br> <br><br>

Another working mission type...<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just to add to Maevin's post--I always set my mission sliders to the extremes of:<br><br>Bad<br>Chaos<br>Hidden<br>Phys<br>Head On<br>Money<br><br>This produces three assassination missions that lead off with "sometimes, an ordinary person among the enemy is lucky enough to rise above the grey faceless crowd and ascend the throne of fame." These seem to be particularly rewarding monetarily for the effort involved and I've had them work correctly every time. To increase your payoff, go to an outpost just outside a city and request missions until you get an assignment in the city (assuming the city isn't so badly lagged you can't play there). The game rewards you based on "distance" in zones, and considers the trip to the city (crossing a zone line in the process) to be worth a fair bit of cash, even though it's really just a short jog away. The reward item is usually a fixer nano-formula for me (clan nanomage nano-tech) but the real loot comes from the treasure chests in the missions anyway. Happy hunting.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an absolutely unprecedented move by the developers of shadowbane, a large info-dump containing several servings of nothing at all happened on this eagerly anticipated monday disclosure.  Sure, the day isn't over, but unless you're in Hawaii, the work day is.  Whatever happened to Beta journals?  How about some magic, please?  Everything I've seen so far is of a dude swinging a sword, and then swinging his sword the other way while flailing his left arm as a special attack.  Where is John Spells, uber mage of Aerynth, raining fire and brimstone down upon hapless lamenting kobold women?  Perhaps, much like the removal of mounts, magic has been removed.  Hell, who needs it?  Just wave your left arm around a bit and then do a spin or two and you can easily accomplish the same amount of damage a time consuming fireball spell would.  Right?  Well at any rate, I want to see some frigging magic now, please.<br><br>Dipes<br>

This helpful list of tips was added into one version of the Beta-4 zip that I downloaded. </I><br><br>Note to all Anarchy Online Beta Testers<br>Before you hop off into the game theres some important things you must realize.<br>1) You are not here to PLAY the game, you are here to TEST the game.<br>2) If something dont work, dont bitch about it, Funcom will get around to it.<br>3) Dont go whailing around saying "Anarchy Online Sucks!" because half of it dont work, please refer to line 1.<br>4) If you find yourself stuck use the "/terminate" command dont bitch about losing items and exp, please refer to line 1.<br>5) If you are recieving horrible FPS you can tone down your 3D Card settings in the options menu.<br>6) Dont spend alot of time working up a big badass character, for it will just be wiped, please refer to line 1.<br>7) No specific mission type is bugged, its a bug in the Mission Generator, it causes random missions to be incompleteable.<br>8) If you get kicked off and you can not log back in, more then likely the zone you are in is down at the moment<br>9) Keep in mind, when recieving bad lagg both server and clients are running in debug mode, every action you perform is being loged on the server, with 100,000+ testers you could only imagine what thier servers going through at the moment.<br>10) Remember Funcom, dropped alot of money to bring you a game to play for your own pleasure, the least you could do is give them a friendly hand in rounding it up.<br>Have fun and enjoy the Beta while its going on.<br>

We can then also focus more of our own resources into patches, rather than maintenence and such. We then do an Open Beta. <br><br>It is your world, and we'll do what you want <br><br>Savant<br></blockquote><br>Wow...<br>Ok so..this company,SK, is thier Partners/Publishers/ETC and they have been stone walling on some coding issues. Yes coding is tough but we Americans cant stand to wait. While this delay is going on a lot of players are tripping out and flaming left and right. I would like to say to Savant that i think you got a hell fo a game..do whats best for the PLAYERS and if it means shutting beta down for a short time do so. if it means leaving it up ..do so. Just keep that mentality ..Its OUR GAME.. Thanks for your support and faith in us as gamers.<br><br><br> Mr.Orange <br><br><br> Be sure to check out the new <a href="http://fa.drtwister.com">Fallen Age</a> site out here at the next work.

"Growing Pains"<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Sunday, June 17, 2001   5:48 PM EST by <a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dipes</a></font><a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From Adam Young...:<br><br><blockquote><i>Greetings all,<br>Just to clarify my recent departure from Artifact Entertainment... Is Artifact in turmoil and destined to fail. NO, NOT AT ALL. Artifact is experiencing growing pains that is all. The reason for my termination (yes, I was fired, although the terminology used was that "We need to part ways." and I agreed), simply put I'm not one to hold my tongue, kowtow, or stroke anyone&#8217;s ego; as such you always know where you stand with me. When I started with Artifact I was instructed to speak freely of my opinions as I was hired for my professional experience. And this I did, while at times not in the most tactful of ways (someting I need to work on). Essentially, I'm a highly opinionated individual, while at the same time open to seeing the validity of an opposing opinion; who insists that anyone posing a conflicting viewpoint be capable of logically defending his or her position. This caused some turmoil between Mr. Allen and myself, as I was unwilling to accept a "Just trust me, I've ten years of experience in game development." approach to a dispute over the practicality of a technical implementation. David Allen's creative, reach for the stars approach to game development is an intracal (sp?) part of why HORIZONS is where it is, fully-funded in a time of ever-dwindling industry resources. The other half of the success belongs to James Jones and his grounding sense of reality. It is the combination of these two's personalities that has fostered the trust behind the investor's backing this project. Has there been political jockeying, you bet... Which can be attributed to intense growing pains, nothing more.<br><br>The ultimate success of this product, however, can not be attributed to the dynamics between Mr. Allen and Mr. Jones; but instead to the talent that these two have brought together under one roof. It is the combined efforts and dedication of each and every employee that will make this game the success that it is destined to become.<br><br>My departure, is solely my doing. Let it be known that I was already seeking other avenues, and was in part seeking termination in order to assure a severance package to assist in relocation. My reasons were both professional and personal. From a professional standing, I had completed the database design, up to the level of detail of the current game design documentation. This left some downtime before the implementation of the server-database communication layer. My opinions concerning the Software Development Lifecycle were not shared by the server development team, this caused some tension between the two departments which was only fueled by my personal issues with that team's lead. What this all boils down to is that I allowed my personal issues with two individuals within the company effect my enjoyment of participating on such an outstanding project with an equally outstanding staff.<br><br>In closing, I ask that the fans continue their support of the Devs. This is beyond a doubt one of the most impressive groups of individuals I've had the pleasure of working with. HORIZONS will ship, I repeat HORIZONS will ship, and I will be amongst the fans who purchase and play this title. Artifact is simply experiencing some growing pains and all of this will simply become but a faint memory over he next few weeks.<br><br>I've not been asked to prepare a statement, nor do I have any reason to sugarcoat my responses; as I've already cashed and cleared my severance... While technically fired, I departed on amicable terms; and wish the team nothing but the best in their endeavors.<br><br>Respectfully,Adam "De`Valos" YoungDatabase Developer / Administrator</blockquote></i><br><br>Dipes<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A word from kampfschwein (or War Pig, if you only understand English)<br><br><br>	If you have never seen or heard of Dr. Twister before, I would like to take a moment and tell you about us.  We at DTN (Dr. Twister Networks) are not your typical &#8220;fan site posing as a news site&#8221; nor are we simply the &#8220;bug hunters&#8221; of days gone by. <br><br>	DTN is best seen as a consumer advocate for online gaming freaks.  If something sucks about a game, we tell you.  If something about a game is outstanding, we tell you that as well.  Over the years, Dr. Twister (the man, in this case) has worked very hard to ensure the public is protected from &#8220;tyranny&#8221; that some gaming dev companies have attempted to impose upon its player.  You do not have to look far to see companies treating their customers like crap.<br><br>	That said, I am of the strong personal opinion that Mythic is taking the road less traveled.  It has been my experience in the last month that Mythic is very player-friendly.  Indeed, on the few occasions that I have had the opportunity to interact with their developers, I found them not only friendly, but also helpful.  This makes for a happy War Pig, I can assure you.<br><br>	Back to the tour, on the top right of the page is a list of the articles posted since we started up Twisted Camelot.  Our poll section is on the right of the page.  Please take the opportunity to visit both. They will give you a chance to see what we are about as well as participate in the process. <br><br>	If you would like to sound off about what you see here, share your thoughts on the game itself or just generally become more involved, join our forums at <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/index.php.">http://forums.drtwister.com/index.php.</a>  There, not only will you find the Camelot boards, but also all of the games that we are now reporting on or in the process of beginning coverage. <br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As many of you know, with regular settings you are unable to see anything at night time. Here is a little tip, which could be concieved as an exploit. First change the brightness of your monitor to the highest it can go. If that doesn't work then goto control panel and see if you have adobe gamma. Click it and adjust the brightness. Now if you don't have adobe gamma, find the gamma for your graphics card and then adjust the brightness. This helps greatly!<br><br>I believe one of the reasons for a flying tank may because of GEAR. From sertain people, gear will work in the game but with others it makes the game crash once started. <br><br>Stay tuned for more.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes many account theft/item theft issues are popping up all over. VI seems to have totally screwed every player in EQ in 1 fell swoop. While most arent actually hacked, but loan out account info to a "friend" whom either does the deed or gets a friend too.BUT there are SEVERAL WAYS to access someones account information VIA a 3rd party file. VI does not warn you about these files, they figure " Screw em, they will keep playing or buy another account". Yes VI has totally pisses away customer service in 1 shot. Those of you who play tanarus...thats EQ in the next few months. Heres a letter i recieved .<br><p><br><i>Hello. I've got a story for you. About 2 weeks before EQ's "new policy" went <br>into effect I had one of my accounts "compromised".<br><br> I'm not in a uber guild <br>that shares accounts. I am in the US Army stationed in Korea and I play at <br>an Internet Cafe. As you know your station name stayes on the login screen. <br>I'm guessing thats how it happened to me. Anyway, I tried to log on this <br>account and was getting the invalid station name or password message. As <br>this was right after the patch on May 30th, I figured something got screwed <br>up. So I log on my other account. To my surprice I see one of my characters <br>from my other account logged on. I lost my mind. Then this guys starts <br>tellin me that he bought the account from a friend of his. I petitioned and <br>45 minutes later, after I watch this guy run 2 of my chars to the bank in <br>NFP, a guide gets back to me and says I would need to call customer service <br>(which opened 1 1/2 hours later). So, I call customer service and the lady <br>was nice enough to believe me and changed my pswd and waited for me to log <br>on. To my horror, all my chars (6 on that account) xcept 1 had been deleted. <br>She told me I needed to email a GM and they most likely would restore my <br>account no problem. So I emailed. A week and a half later, and a new policy <br>letter later, a GM gets back to me. "Are you aware of our new policy"? "I <br>can only restore your main char who will be naked". So now I have a 45 <br>ranger with no gear. He then tells me he will track down whoever is <br>resbonsible and deal with them "accordingly". Which my guess is, "bad <br>player, no EQ for you for a week". I didnt have any uber gear on my 5 other <br>chars, but it was some mid-high level things that I had gathered in the year <br>that I had been playin that account. Lucky for me I have a 58 cleric RL <br>friend with entirely too much money that hooked me up with some gear to make <br>my ranger at least playable at that level. And a guild that is helping me <br>out also. The GM told me that because I had brought this to his attention <br>before the policy actually came out that he would "bend the rules" and treat <br>it as a accidental character deletion. While I am happy to get at least my <br>main back, I cant help but feel shafted on this encounter. I have a friend <br>thats a guide and he said they keep the logs for 3 months and it should have <br>not been that big of a deal to get my account back to the way it was. Well, <br>just by reading your web page I see that I dont know half as much about the <br>game as you do. I was just wondering if you would have any insight on my <br>situation that you would be willing to share with me. Thank you for your <br>time. Keep up the good work on your sight.<br><br>Gagt Alpine of Campaigni Callidus<br>45 Ranger Bertox.<br>_________________________________________________________________<br><br></i><br>It sucks to be him and it sucks to be you and me because verant has thrown actual customer support out the window feet 1st.

Final Frontpage Rant<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Friday, June 15, 2001   11:48 AM EST by <a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com" class=link2>Quantum</a></font><a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I will not publish the rants here for now on, instead I will just keep them all on the rant page, and just post links.  I don't want to take up too much room on the frontpage.  To be fair though, we have had two negatives and only one positive rant.  So here is a final reply:<br><blockquote><br>I guess I see this situation positively because that's how I look at life.  It's all a work in progress, a process and above else an experience.  I'm just enjoying being part of Beta.  Let's be positive<br>people.  Oh, and how can we expect Funcom to give super customer service at this point?  We aren't even paying customers.  We just need to report the problems we have and move on.  Of course if, after it is officially released, they don't have good customer service I would be disappointed. <br>Thanks Quantum.<br><br>-Michael Long<br></blockquote><br><br>I wanted to add this rant as well, and let people know this.  I am not supporting anything I post, I am posting what I get.  That is what we do here at AOTwister.  We post what the fans say.  Please do not take this against me, as I do not play favorites.  Thank you.<br><blockquote><br>This flame broiling of Funcom is just uncalled for. In posting of petty whines like I read you submitted today you just snowball the senseless. Funcom is not Verant and is not Microsoft. If anyone would take the time to look at the track record on how Funcom handles the major show stopper bug fixes they would clearly understand that there is a method. How many beta testers in beta 3 had a clue that from their hard work and dedicated testing Funcom had completely redeveloped the graphics engine and client? If you said none your were correct. Even Beta 3 testers got frustrated that they were not getting attention and the bugs they were reporting were not getting corrected. In actuality they were getting Funcoms complete attention as the new client was constructed around them. Funcom patched the servers again yesterday with what they will only know. For two hours after Funcom patched the servers they yoyo'ed up and down. After the yoyo effect was gone we had a huge stability improvement. Zoning was not an issue last night nor was lag. I personally gained two levels in one night and that was something I could not due under the previous server configuration. Now Funcom has a scheduled client and server patch Friday (today) with the rumors of new compiled code going live on the servers. <br><br>Your poster states "As for your other reader who posted in favor of Funcom I would have to say you have not been in many beta's or you would know that the problems that Funcom has right now are the problems that should be getting fixed before final beta." I have not been in many betas but I have been in two MMORPG betas EQ and AO. I can say from my experience that Funcom operates differently from those two companies. For starters, Funcom patching takes 1 to 2 hours where others took 5 to 20. The other betas I was in tried to address one problem at a time with patches while Funcom seems to address each problem offline and take on another before altering the live code. Is this better or worse? Does it matter? The main thing that should matter is that Funcom does it their own way. Out of the 3 betas I have been involved with not one of them have had perfect game play during beta. War and horror stories aside betas are in fact to test things the developer wants to test. Some developers in the past have created fake lag during beta just to test certain aspects of the server farm. Betas should not be defined by the quality of freeplay.<br><br>Some "game bois" sites such as Lum the Mad are resulting to tearing apart Anarchy Online while it's a beta Vs waiting for the live release. I would think this is like saying your food tastes like shit before the waitress takes your order but that&#8217;s just me. <br><br>If the game does not meet your expectations when the servers are live don't continue paying your monthly. If the $13 dollars per month is too much for you don't renew your account. If the system requirements are a bit harsh for your budget don't sign up for the monthly. If the game industry rejects your resume start a "game bois" site and rant about betas for attention.<br><br>Vin<br></blockquote><br>

More Rants- A Cry For Help<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Thursday, June 14, 2001   11:04 PM EST by <a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com" class=link2>Quantum</a></font><a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I will most likely move these all into the rant section, again, I respect everyones opinion.<br><blockquote><br>Dear Quantum<br> <br>I would like to reply to your dear letter writer in your rant section. I am in Beta 4 and think the game looks great. It has great ideas and seems to take all the things that I hate about EQ and fixes them all. The game will be great when it is fixed however it is far from fixed. At least 50% of missions are broken, Either the doors are broken and you can't even get into the mission or items inside that you pick up cause bugs or the inside mission has doors that don't work. Lag is really bad and the game with only 300 poeple inside it in the middle of the night crashs all the time. I agree that having to turn all your settings down to even play is not worth the time to play there is still lag. I have a P3 866 with 265k ram with a great graphics card and cable connection yet the game is even bad for me. I have to also agree that there customer service is sad at this point. You get stuck running all the time and even shop zones crash about every 30 min. <br> <br>Their patch today has their server down more than it was before the patch and with all these problems not to mention just the play lag from the debug code they are  going to release in just over 1 week. I feel for your ranter and would give him a key myself so he can go in and enjoy what he can for the 30 min before the next zone crash. If you could put me in contact with him I would give him a key. <br> <br>As for your other reader who posted in favor of Funcom I would have to say you have not been in many beta's or you would know that the problems that Funcom has right now are the problems that should be getting fixed before final beta. I agree that ranting about beta as its a test is not good however this is not just a beta its their final beta and that is totally different. This beta is for fixing the server lag issues before release so there would be no problems however Funcom is scrambling to try to fix bugs still in game play and those should have been done before final beta. This game is not even close to release quality and I have to agree with your ranter that I would not even think of paying money for this game not to mention a monthly cost to play it which is higher than everyone else out there. Sure they would have issues with switching from 3000 to 100,000 people however at the most I have seen online in this beta at one time before another crash is 300 to 400 and that is far from 100,000 people. They had enough bugs to fix before this beta even started yet they said they were all fixed with the great release of V11.0 which they said was 2 versions over V9.0 which beta 3 was testing. However I still see all the bugs I saw before with now only 1 week to release. I am glad you are so fond of Funcom however if you look at the facts you will see Funcom has not told the truth to now and with release you will see bugs and lag everywhere. I am sorry Funcom feels they have to release now just to start making money from the poor customer who will not be getting what they are paying for. Of course Funcom is stating yet again they have a newer greater version with all these bugs fixed again for release but just like last time it will be all for not. I am glad to have been in beta and helped out funcom find bugs but there will be no way I will be in release till these are fixed. Also I think that Funcom wanting $13.00 US a month is to high for what they have to offer but that is another issue and I for one can pay this so it is not a problem for me. But with no customer support and a bug filled product I will not pay this.<br>Verant did the same thing and it took them 3 month to fix the issues after release and we all ended up with 3 free months and a bad taste in our mouths for having played those 3 months. I wanted so much for Funcom to not be like Verant and they even were publicly saying they were not going to be that way. But just like Verant support is not answering e-mail and like Verant an ingame support rep is rarly online helping as I personally have been petitoning on a regular basis about the bugs and problems I have had ingame. I will continue to uphold my agreement with Funcom and help them test as much as I can before we are all out of beta. But I don't see this helping enough for the release date. <br> <br>On Saturday they want to stress test the server and I will be doing my count to see how many people are online and watching there server to see if I crash at all. I think I will crash alot and I think lag will be unreal as usual but I look forward to seeing if Funcom is true to there word and see if on Saturday when they turn the bug code off to test the real stress of the server if it holds up. I hope Funcom proves me wrong and there servers are up with no lag at all and we can all breath easy and say wow they are ready. But I think it will be as bad as ever if not worse however I look forward to Funcom proving me wrong and I can post this info. Till then we all sit and wait.</blockquote><br><br>

David Allen on Rumors<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Thursday, June 14, 2001   8:04 PM EST by <a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com" class=link2>Dipes</a></font><a href="mailto:dipes@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David Allen was interviewed at MMORPG.net earlier and answered a few questions about the rumors flying around with an excellent layer of corporate bullshit.  Here is the interview word for word, with my own commentary added in in italics.<br><br>MMORPG Network: Recent rumors on Lum the Mad's web site have said that there is bad blood, so to speak, going on behind the scenes at Artifact Entertainment. Any truth to the rumors? Any idea how these rumors got started? Do they have any basis in truth, however small, or are they just complexly off based wild accusations of someone trying to make a stab at AE?<br><br>David Allen: The only 'bad blood' that I know of exists outside of AE at this time, and the fact that it exists at all is truly unfortunate.<br><br><i>This is read as "shit, we fired the bad blood"</i><br><br>These rumors started weeks ago from people within the company that were not acting in an honorable, or positively intentional way.<br><i>(jeremy Dixon anyone?)</i><br>I used to think that there was 'always some truth' in everything said, but with the things that have been said in the past week, I now know that this is not the case. Anyone can believe anything that they want, and that is what makes the statement "there's always some truth in everything" understandable. There could be a person out there that believes that the world is flat, and for that reason, there is some truth to the statement because one person truly believes it. That is the nature of today's truth, especially on the internet - facts are few and far between, but the swaying capabilities of a single opinion read in an Email powered by personal beliefs, and the fact that negative people are much more boisterous than positive... well, it's unfortunate.<br><br><i>This just smacks of subject advoidance.  The answer is ambiguous in almost every regard as he breaks down into some sort of Zen Buddhist dissection of the meaning of the word "truth".</i><br><br>MN: With the departure of Jeremy from AE, it was pretty much required that AE make an official statement about it since he was the main PR contact for the community. Recent word has it that Adam Young has departed as well. Were these departures falling so close together simply coincidence or were they part of something larger?<br><br>DA: James, myself, and other members at the company are working at solidifying the structure here at AE, and will continue to do so in order to build the company into what it should and can be.<br><br><i>Absolutely!  We didn't like those guys because they disagreed with us on something</i><br><br>What people don't seem to be interested in is the fact that anyone who is let go from the company would be let go only for good reasons and with the support of the entire executive and upper management staff - I do not make decisions like this alone. Also, the public is not aware of these reasons, and the truth is that it's only the company's business <i>read: we fired those guys and don't want to talk about it because it will confirm rumors of infighting</i>, and the public shouldn't really concern themselves with these decisions because they'll really never hear the 'real' reasons because we won't talk about them. We do have a policy at AE - when we let go of somebody, we don't talk about why - we created this policy to ensure respect and integrity in relation to those who choose to leave, or those who we required <i>(fired)</i> to leave; the problem is that it is very easy for people to take advantage of this policy, and go out and make public statements where the intention is to do nothing but harm individuals or even the entire company by stating half-truths, slanderous, or even malicious things. It's really too bad - the whole rumor circus has done nothing but take the public's view away from the current goal of the company, which is to make HORIZONS, and have a damn good time while doing so.<br><br><i>The thing I don't understand here is that he could easily squelch all rumors by saying why JD left AE, but yet he avoids this subject, calling upon some crappy corporate mandate which He invented</i><br><br>I have personally been very disappointed by the fact that the fans are so open to believing many of the untrue things that have been posted; not a single one of them has approached James or myself (other than some press members, like this interview) and asked 'is this true?' <i>I asked Jeremy 2 days before he Left.  He said the rumors were untrue.</i>  Instead they prefer to guess at what's going on by continuing to make posts made on information from an unreliable source. Fatbabies and Lum never contacted anyone in upper management here to ask us what we thought <i>Just to interject, if a game company goes out of business or people get sacked, chances are the story was on fatbabies 2 weeks before.  They are fairly accurate in their reports</i> - or how things were going at AE. Of course there's more press in finding the 1 or 2 people who are willing to break company policy (therefore acting dishonorably towards the entire company) <i>Jeremy Dixon and Adam Young...?</i> and discuss issues from their point of view. <br><br>Personally, I would question any information coming from an individual at a company who was so dishearted to share such negative information; I would first ask why are they still working there, and even more importantly, why are they breaking policy to hurt the very company they work for in order to vent what is most likely their own personal issues? I would then question their own integrity at that point, and realize that level of integrity probably carries on to every bit of information they 'leak' out.<br><br>MN: Adam and Jeremy were both part of the database team for Horizons. Will the departure from these two individuals going to effect the release/beta for Horizons at all?<br><br>DA: Nope.<br><br>MN: We can understand there will be some rubbing the wrong way, it is expected in a project the size of Horizons. A few people are commenting that the problems rumored to be going on at AE are because you have a "vision" for Horizons and you get upset when that vision is not obtainable. Passion can be a big part of creating a project as ambitious as Horizons. Has having such a large project such as Horizons been hard to maintain and implement?<br><br><i> This is just basically asking in a sly-ish manner, "So are the rumors of you flying off the handle a lot true?"</i><br><br>DA: Being in charge is no easy task - for people who have not been in a position of running a company with 50 people before, it's hard to understand the burden of the position; especially being the creator of the massive project that the company is working on.<br><br><i>"yes, I like to be an asshole when people don't see things my way"</i><br><br>Do I have a vision? Absolutely - I had the vision of HORIZONS more than two years ago, and now it is becoming a reality. Am I concerned when people want to change the game? I used to be <i>"hell, up to 3 days ago when I fired Jeremy and Adam!"</i>, but now I'm not nearly as concerned since the solidity that has developed between the upper management of the company is to a level where trust is very high - if James approaches me about an aspect of the game that I originally designed and says, "Dave, this is awesome, but... we might want to consider going about it this way - here's why..." I then listen to him, and guess what; he's usually right. Same with others who work here and their expertise as to making HORIZONS the best game that it can be.<br><br>I created the vision and base template for HORIZONS - there are now many other people involved in finalizing that creation, and I am proud to be working with them. Yes, it can be stressful when they want to really change things <i>"I fly off the handle at the drop of a hat..."</i>, but the truth is most of the time, they have damn good reasons, and everyone is usually in support of them, including me.<br><br>MN: One thing that may have fueled the rumors is the delay of some things, like the promised screenshots. Now there are probably very good reasons why you haven't released any yet, but they would probably help show the community the progress that is being made. Any idea when you will have something for the community to see in that regard?<br><br>DA: I completely agree with you, and understand where the player base is coming from, and we do have our reasons for not releasing any in-game screen shots as of yet; but just a little more patience. It will be worth it.<br><br><i>So David, what are the reasons?  I want to see Horizons succeed as much as the next guy, but you aren't giving us much here.  glitchless anyone?</i><br><br>MN: Having brought so many people together on this project in a relatively short period of time was bound to cause friction and growing pains as people learn to understand and work together. Has this process been harder, easier, or about what you expected?<br><br>DA: No doubt harder than I ever expected; but at the same time, the rewards have already been greater than what I expected as well. Is it all worth it? You betcha - contrary to what has been heard, there are some incredibly good things going on here at AE, and it directly involves the people and work within the company. We have some HORIZONS stuff here that the public hasn't seen as of yet, and we can't wait to release it; when the time is right.<br><br>--Thanks to MMORPG.net for the interview<br>DA just isn't growing on me as of late.  What do you think? <br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We post everything we get hear on the Dr.Twister Network, whether we agree or not.  This is a site for the fans, and in many ways, created by the fans.<blockquote><br>Dear Quantum,<br>     Now, I know that there is a lot of frustration circling this whole beta-test situation ... however, I feel that many people are quick to jump the gun on Funcom.  In the latest addition to your website you have an article titled "user rant submission."  Though I believe in respecting and listening to the opinions of others, I find this to be a complete lack of respect for what Funcom is trying to do.  I would also add that this trend of negativity has plagued the server as well.  Seems like everywhere you go you have to hear about how much lag there is and how much Funcom "sucks" because of it.  Perhaps if these fans took the time to thoroughly read about the situation they would realize that the server is in a debugging mode that obviously slows down the speed of the game.  Instead, most everyone wants to go on about how bad it is ... I simply don't understand.  Another thing, as far as those, now famous, beta keys ... Funcom released a perfectly viable explanation about what happened.  About 2000-3000 of the 100,000 beta keys were not correctly executed.  Now, let's look at this from a real-life point of view.  What if the world only had a 3% fail rate?  What if there was only a 3% unemployment rate?  Would people be complaining? ... I think not.  Yes, it is unfortunate that some people are unable to play AO at this stage in the game.  However, we must take this with a grain of salt and realize that it's really not all that bad.  I mean, c'mon ... they go from helping 5,000 beta testers to 100,000 .... that would be a shock for any company.  Also, we cannot expect them to attend to every aspect of this game at once.  It can be an obvious assumption that technical issues are the priority.  Therefore, when every single person doesn't get priority attention it should be understood ... Okay, enough of that already.  Thank you Quantum for bringing the AO community such a wonderful site.  I love your site and read it daily.  I just wish that in the future when someone is going to put such a negative post ... of which many people can view ... at least an opposing side accompanies it.  Thank you for your time and have a great day!!</blockquote><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speed Anarchy-Online up:<br><blockquote><br>Just wanted to try and get a head-ups out, its possible that if you<br>turn off all of the in-game sounds the stability drastically improves. I was at the "give-up" point where 9 out of 10 area changes resulted in crashes and the other usual problems. I forget where I saw a tidbit, but it mentioned some other problem people were having could be solved by turning off the sound for that section... so I simply turned off the sound and left it off.<br><br>Since then I can zone with just about no problem, I crash 1 out of 10 changes instead of the reverse. At first i assumed it might just be me, but I told a few friends and they also noticed marked improvement. It might be worth a try for others, no promises though...

I am very glad we had this "test" now, instead of after release :) We sent out around 100.000 mails and around 2% received a key that did not work. We have now fixed the bugs in the registration system and started to manually send people new keys. We choose to do it like this to test the system even more. This is a beta, and it is important for us to make sure we have systems that are ready when release comes. Its not just the game that needs to be ship-shape for release but also all other systems backing up the game. <br><br>We hope people can see the positive in that we have learnt alot out of<br>these mistakes we have done now. I want to apologize to all the people<br>that has downloaded the game, and have yet been able to log into the<br>game. Support is working 24/7, and we are sending out new keys to<br>everyone that has reported an error with their old key. Please be<br>patient and you will receive a cd key :-)<br><br>Marius Enge<br>Customer Service Manager<br>Funcom Support<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Sometimes I think life is really trying to bend me over. No sooner than I roast the alleged sexual organs of robe wearers, I have to come back and talk about how one helped me out today.  What is next?  Is the fatman going to praise my journalistic skills?  Is Lowtax going to send me a free tee shirt?  Is Bush going to come back from Europe 50 IQ points smarter?<br><br>	All right, after all that ranting, I guess it would help remove doubts about my sanity if I explained.  Today, your hero (or in this case, me) received a quest to fight a particularly nasty monster, which, for the sake of keeping that damned NDA intact, shall remain nameless. <br><br>	This particular unnamed mob must have been giving out free beer or dirty magazines with scratch and sniff.  I counted no less than a dozen of the little buggers gathered around my goal monster.  Now, mind you, the target alone would have mostly likely tanked me. So, even though I knew that I would be taking my ass home in a doggy bag, I proceeded to jump this bastard.  The results were as expected.  Stop laughing, damn it!<br><br>	Not to be deterred by a little ass beating, I return a few more times.  At this point, I was especially pissed off.  However, right as I was about to punch a hole in my monitor, a small sweet voice sends me a private message asking if I needed help.  Thinking it was a request for cyber, I said &#8220;yeah&#8221;. <br><br>Lo and behold, &#8220;help&#8221; came in the form of a max level mage named Caliondra (remember, the War Pig does not change names, I cover my ass and that&#8217;s it).  I cannot tell you what max level is, but then you know this already.  However, I can say this, she could easily one hit me with her melee skills and SHE IS A MAGE!  Does that give an indication? <br><br>	Needless to say, she kept all the little bastard&#8217;s cronies off of me and even one hit the target mob once and took a third of its hit points.  So, for Caliondra and all of you other non-butthead mages, the War Pig raises his mug of chilled imported beer.<br><br>

New PvP Concept<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Tuesday, June 12, 2001   4:46 PM EST by <a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com" class=link2>Quantum</a></font><a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having played every level between 1-200 in Anarchy-Online, and testing out Player vs Player combat, as that is my main interest, I have developed a new idea.  One major part of PvP that is missing in Anarchy-Online, is the actual finding of the opponent.  Funcom designed a large game, with many vivid areas to travel too.  There are vast wastelands, mountains, and forests between Omni-Tek and the Clans.  The problem?  The world is so big Clan and Omni-Tek players will have a hard time finding eachother.  In fact, at times it is hard enough just finding your own friends.  That is why I developed the concept of Hot Spots.<br><br>Hot Spots can be considered areas of tension within the game.  Areas in which Omni-Tek and Clan players will both want to be, or control.  Now how do we develop these areas?  Well, for high level characters, the best missions for Clan and Omni-Tek players will be located within the same area.  This way, if you want the best missions, you may have to risk fighting for them.<br><br>These missions can be placed in some of the best hunting areas, or landscapes within Anarchy-Online.  That way there would be reason to control them.  Now, both sides will be fighting over the rights for certain missions.  To exit or enter a mission you may have to fight, since both Omni-Tek and Clan players will be sent to the same high level mission.<br><br>I believe this will allow for designated PvP areas, instead of players just wandering through large Mayhem PvP Playfields.  I am going to send this concept to Gaute, Funcom Designer, but I would first like feedback from everyone.<br><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=441&forum=25&0">Discuss This Here.</a><br>

Lum digs up some info<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to the Fatbabies rumor, Lum of Lumthemad.net went and did what I simply cannot due to my current status on the food chain.  That is, he actually got to talk to some people at AE to <a href="http://lumthemad.net/story.php?story=2080" class="link2">find out what the deal is</a>.<br><br>Apparently the problem with Artifact Entertainment (as Lum says), is David Allen.  I myself have never spoken with David Allen, or for that matter even engaged in discussion of a thread he's posted on, so my input here is purely anecdotal.  That being said, I can see where Lum may be correct, as the pure scope of the game DA wants to make lends itself to causing problems in the upper management when coders say "it can't be done".  Read lum's story and pass your judgement, although mine has already been passed.<br><br>Dipes<br>

Mine was corrupted too, but I figured out how to get around that and am now playing on AO with it. Here's how:<br><br>Hopefully you haven't deleted it yet, or else this won't work :Þ<br>I'm going to assume you're using Winzip 8 like me, and have already <br>extracted the other files...<br><br>1) Extract data2.cab in Classic Mode (not Wizard mode)<br>2) When it finishes and you get the bad CRC message do NOT click ok.<br>3) Go to the folder you extracted to, and rename data2.cab temporarily (ex. <br>data2.0cab)<br>4) Back to Winzip, click OK, and exit Winzip<br>5) Go back to the folder and rename the file back to its original name (data2.cab)<br>6) Install Anarchy Online<br>7) While you're installing you'll get a few messages saying a file is <br>missing, and asking whether you want to Abort, Retry, or Ignore. Choose to <br>Ignore. If your's is missing an important file there could be a problem, <br>but it should otherwise be fine. Mine was missing 4 .wav files which did <br>install anyway.<br><br>8) Finally, play AO!<br>Enjoy!</blockquote><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Something that makes baby Jeebus (not to mention the Battle Swine) cry.<br><br>	I was asked by someone claiming to check the site periodically (yeah, I think he was full of crap too) which realm I thought was going to be the ueber realm.  When he asked, I replied that I did not know, but thinking about it for a few minutes, I remembered where I was.  As of yet, there have been no major MMORPGs in which the mages did not run the show.  Therefore, the little Irish people will be the ones to watch in this game.<br><br>	For this, I must now bash the idiot monkeys (from coders to producers).  As an avid melee grunt nasty War Pig that I am (Hog Smash!), I am frankly sick of the little sissy boy mages and archers getting their queerness not out of effort but rather by whining like a little girl that hasn&#8217;t any candy&#8230;or like the fatman does everyday, take your pick.<br><br>	It is with good reason that they whine, if we melee grunts ever did figure out a way to exploit/cheat/whatever and avoid the dropping dead 30 feet from the girly little robe wearing freaks their life would be crap.  As in real life, their penises would be very small.  Their imaginary girlfriends would not love them anymore.  However, I would hope that the first result of a melee revolution would be the return to, at least, legible English. <br><br>	What is that?  But, War Pig, isn&#8217;t DaoC different?  Nope, I see the mages getting all the love in here too.  You disagree.  Ok, then tell the old Hog of Carnage, when was the last time you saw a dev team nerf casters because they were &#8220;obviously too powerful&#8221;?  Hmm?  That is what I thought.<br><br>	So, what is my advice to my fellow lovers of up close gore and pain?  Simple, either begin craving the intimate company of other men or keep praying that devs grow a set of man gems. <br><br>**Bashes the stupid monkeys!  **<br><br>Love the grunts, nerf the sissies!<br><br>Have a good week, Piggies!<br><br><br><br>

On this thread you can add suggestions to the guide, and make comments.  If you think there are problems, post on the thread about them.  The thread will have the same title as the strategy guide, but if you read the guide, you will notice a direct link on the bottom of it, to the thread.  It will say"  Discuss Here."  <br><br>I wish for everyone to help in the writing of these guides.  All suggestions will be added, debated, and talked about.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yeah so, I found this bug. Every time I start up the game it crashes. Maybe crashes is the wrong word.. More like Locks Up. I am forced to reboot every time. This was happening once before, but I managed to fix it by messing with the settings. But ever since sometime yesterday it has been constant. <br><br>Look crs. I don't care what your publisher said or made you do. This game was definetly not ready for release. I'd go so far as to say it's not even ready for large scale beta. <br><br>I find it hilarious that you guys thought you were going to have one server for everyone when you hadent even attempted to simulate that amount of traffic yet. You guys must be the kind of developers that think testing your software is a load of crap, that has no real purpose.<br><br>I mean, that's all I can think of.. Seeing as you guys have your heads so far up your asses that you would dare to make people pay for this. <br><br>I think someone should write a Lemon Law for these types of games. I can't return the software now because I've already used the cd key. Also, the glass of water that spilled all over the innards of the box didnt help. <br><br>I shouldent have to return the game though, I should simply be given my money back. I payed for something that did not do what it said it would do. So basically I gave them money for a box with a cd in it, which I can no longer return since I attempted to use it.<br><br>Just seems a little unfair to me.<br>

The packet loss problem was found and fixed. We located the source, replaced some bad glass, tweaked some routing and we are stable as far as packet loss goes now, across all of the current game servers. (Cannot tell you all what a weight off that is)<br><br>All 4 servers are up and running. We are optimizing a few things on individual servers and then applying changes to all as we stabilize them. This will result in semi-frequent re-starts as we re-configure each server. This should be less and less evident as the evening goes on, and more stable service should be seen by all. <br><br>Each of these servers are operating at or near capacity, when you get online look for combats away from HEAVY action for best performance. Also remember to use the F4 key to bring in the view range to help grab some frames per second. <br><br>There are a number of issues being addressed on the front end that will improve re-spawn times as well as &#8220;chunder&#8221; when loading terrain. There will more than likely be a client patch that will include a new &#8220;settings&#8217;exe&#8221; and new &#8220;ww2.exe&#8221; as well as an upgraded dll file. This patch will be between 1-2 MB in size and will probably be ready by Monday. It will be an automatic update, and there will be no manual download.<br><br>Things are looking up here, and we are very relieved to see lots of folks playing. We will be in support mode all through the night and I will post more news as it comes. Our next goals include the following:<br><br>1) Stabilize the current server set<br>2) Add more game servers<br>3) Produce the front end update and distribute<br>4) Rinse, repeat"</blockquote></font> <br>more to be seen at <a href="http://sfi2.com/forum/ubb/Forum10/HTML/000006.html">http://sfi2.com/forum/ubb/Forum10/HTML/000006.html</a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

With the introduction of new Beta 4 players, Anarchy-Online's database was hit pretty hard.  The errors that first started occuring had to do with mixing capitals and lowercase, as well as numbers together.  My password for the game, which contained both caps and numbers, no longer works.  I have changed the password, but I can still not login.  If this error is happening to you, it will say:  incorrect login or password, then you are not alone.  There is no estimation on when it will be fixed.  Rumor has it, using all lowercase non numbered passwords may help you.<br>

Binding Non-Assignable Keys<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Saturday, June 9, 2001   4:45 PM EST by <a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com" class=link2>Quantum</a></font><a href="mailto:quantum@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Great bit of information sent in by Cambell:<br><blockquote><br>I've found out a way to remap the keys which can't normally be fixed in-game (Keypad 0 for example). I put it up on the official formums <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=6590">at this link</a> but thought you might be interested as its scrolled off the page now hehe.<br> <br>***********************************<br> <br>As a lot of people are aware, some keys are fixed and cannot be changed from inside AO. However you can change them manually outside the game by editing the log.cfg file found in the <br><br>\Anarchy Online\Prefs\YOUR USERNAME\ <br><br>folder. You can use notepad to edit this file. <br><br>IMPORTANT <br><br>BACKUP LOG.CFG TO ANOTHER FOLDER BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES!! <br><br>Each key is represented by a number. For example Keypad 0 (INS) is 70, Backspace is 25. If you want to find out what number represents a key (one that can be bound ingame that is) bind they key you want to Autoattack. Then go into the log.cfg and look at the number for the following entry: <br><br>KEY_BUTTON_ATTACK 25 <br><br>The important number here is 25 which represents backspace. <br><br>To find out the number that represents a key which cannot be bound ingame you need to look for its entry in the list. For example, to find out what the number is of keypad 0 (ins) is I would look for the entry for Autorun (some of these can be a bit obscure!) which is: <br><br>KEY_MOVMENT_4EVER_FORWARD_TOGGLE 70 <br><br>So we now know that Keypad 0 is represented by the number 70. <br><br>Now to change the keys. If I swap the values of these two entries, IE: <br><br>KEY_BUTTON_ATTACK 70 <br><br>KEY_MOVMENT_4EVER_FORWARD_TOGGLE 25 <br><br>Auto attack is now Keypad 0 <br>and <br>Autorun is now Backspace. <br><br>If you check the keybindings in AO itself on the options menu, you will see these changes are also represented there. <br><br>Easy! The long bit will be to work out what all the numbers are for each key! <br><br>CAUTION! <br><br>Make sure you don't bind the same key twice (by using the same value for two entries) as I'm sure this will cause problems. Also be sure to bind all keys - it may not matter but better safe than sorry. I'd also recommend against binding keys such as CTRL, SHIFT, which are used in conjunction with other keys as this may also cause problems. Finally - I've tested this and things seem ok so far, but use at your own risk!! <br><br>Anyhows hope this is of help for those that need this kind of information.<br> <br>*****************************<br>Hope it makes sense :) <br>Campbell<br>__________________<br>Shadowbane.EU<br><a href="http://www.shadowbane-eu.com/">http://www.shadowbane-eu.com/</a><br>

Heres part of it:<br><br><blockquote><font color="yellow"><br>There are currently two show stoppers we are fighting here. One is within our distributed server architecture, and the other is at our server farm, both are at a fairly deep level. Many of us have been working without sleep and that is a dangerous place to push ones limits when dealing with server paradigms and routing tables. There is a paradox here that is slightly crippling: The packet loss at our server farm is between the routers there, and our switches. At a certain load level packet loss goes up, finally to a critical level, and then the game host crashes. Without the host up and running a solid load, the packet loss can&#8217;t be tracked accurately. We are sleuthing it as best we can and until we have it nailed there&#8217;s not much to tell. No timelines here, we&#8217;ll get it running as soon as we can. I truly wish I had better news.<br></blockquote></font><br><br>We still love you, sort of. I guess. Get back to work! :D<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SO just my luck that my only contact at AE has decided to leave.  That's right, Jeremy "Utildayael" Dixon has left Artifact Entertainment in this totally unexpected shocker of an event.  Artifact Entertainment had this to say:<br><i><blockquote>I wanted to post a fond farewell to Jeremy Dixon, who is no longer with Artifact Entertainment. Utildayael, who is most well-known for his postings on the message boards and involvement with the public, departed the company today.<br><br>We felt that it was important to inform the player base of his amicable departure because of his public involvement, and that we will be introducing a new PR liason soon.<br><br>A big thanks to Jeremy for his support of Artifact and HORIZONS; we wish him only the best!</i></blockquote><br>This could mean several different things. Utildayael has possibly lost all of his senses and left the seemingly successful company comes to mind as the first option.  Secondly, he could have actually landed a better job, but for a man whose last job before this was an IGN reporter, I somehow doubt that.  Look at where the PR rep position got Abashi, why would JD leave that post?  The third and most probable situation, however, is that he left because of the rumored infighting.  I didn't report this earlier because I asked JD about it and he denied it, but here's what I learned from some of my other sources (fatbabies and a stratics msgboard):<br><blockquote><i>"Artifact Entertainment & NCsoft&#8217;s upcoming massively multiplayer online game Horizons is planned for a closed beta this November. However, we&#8217;ve heard internal politics, bitter in-fighting, problematic server hosting partnerships, and other such headaches will delay Horizons long past its scheduled beta test date. <br><br>The world development group, having only recently received the first version of the editor a few short days ago, has just begun the creation of environments and locations. The bigger problem here is the main creator behind the editor tool has left the building &#8211; permanently. Apparently the political maneuvering among upper management wore him out&#8230; but the more vicious internal rumor that the project is destined to become vaporware could be the real reason he departed. <br><br>The server farm is being contracted from a corporate/web hosting company, but word has it the negotiations have stalled as the financials cannot be agreed upon. The hosting company is worried about excessive bandwidth usage. <br><br>Finally, it seems as if morale on the development team drops a little lower each day. Power struggles dominate the conference room meetings, and managers maneuver constantly behind-the-scenes. Employees must operate constantly in CYA (cover-your-ass) mode, lest some senior manager forget to take his prozac and explode in a rage upon the nearest hapless victim.

One thing you didn't mention is how the developers are also playing "favorites" right now. The "Closed beta" testers, who are also the ones who run around kissing ass and yelling at everyone to return the game if they don't like the wait etc. etc. get access to special info and have their own little secret updates page, which shows, among other things, up to the minute stats on the servers and # of people online. <br><br>This really fucking disgusts me, that on top of everything else, the company has a chosen few asskissers that it keeps in its confidence, while the rest of us paying customers are left out in the goddamn cold. These "closed beta" testers walk around high and mighty, and anyone who bitches about the state of the game, they instantly gangbang saying how they are whining idiots, why by god, what gives you the right to expect to PLAY the game you bought? Why, you should count yourself lucky there was a fucking CD in the box, according to their logic. <br></blockquote></font><br><br>Whoa.. If that's true.. That really sucks. So cornered rat, what do you have to say about that? I have to say, you guys really arent doing much for your companies reputation right now.<br><br>Why arent we getting more updates? You've got 15,000 people out here who payed for your piece of software. The <b>LEAST</b> you could do is atleast make an attempt to speak to us.

QA<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've worked for a good amount of time in the Quality Assurance field. I've seen projects crumble because of the lack of QA staffing. When I was 16 I was hired as a QA guy at a company very close to where I lived at the time. Most of the time I took the bus to work, and I enjoyed the job immensly. I was not however, at all proffesional or knowledgable. <br><br>I tried to invent my own methods of Quality Assurance, taking advice from co-workers and using the projects we worked on as testing grounds for new methods. <br><br>During this time, I figured out a great deal of things about Quality Assurance.<br><br>1 ) Developers will not go out of their way to read reports from inexperienced immature Quality Assurance guys. <br><br>2 ) The only way to get developers to fix bugs is to tell their managers, their managers managers, and their managers managers managers. <br><br>3 ) Orginazation is KEY, if the bugs arent presented to the developers in an orderly fasion, which is fast and reliable, the bugs will not be fixed.<br><br>4 ) Regression testing is extremely valuable. (Regression testing means at the end of a span of time, take all previously reported bugs and re-test them.)<br><br>5 ) Quality Assurance departments need to know as much about the product as the Programmers themselves. It's a lot easier to isolate areas of a program if you know how the program works. <br><br>About 3 months before pretty much half of the company was laid off, a man who previously worked for Symantec (Norton utilities, etc) was hired. By this time 2 other QA guys had been hired (I say QA guys because at the time we didnt know the difference between an analyst and an engineer). <br><br>This man was like a shining light of knowledge. In those 3 months our productivity quadrupled. We developed highly advanced methods for testing, tracking, and following through with defect reports. It was then that I realised how poorly the game industry's QA section was doing. <br><br>I don't really blame the gaming industry for this.. Quality assurance is a difficult area. I've had people describe it to me as sort of a religion, and I'd completely agree. You will never know how important QA is until you have a working QA department. <br><br>A good number of game companies these days were created sort of on a whim. Mostly by friends, friends of friends, etc. This means that the sort of corporate development process was avoided. Sometimes by choice, sometimes by arrogance, and sometimes by both. This definetly needs to change, and I encourage you to help them along.<br><br>Quality Assurance departments pay for themselves. The payments come in the form of press relations, customer relations, and reputation. Sure it may be impossible to make a completely bug free product, but you can damn well try.<br><br>For developers:<br><br>Theres a good number of us floating around right now. Most companies have been taken over by moronic Ebusiness executives who don't know shit about software. The first department they tend to lay off people from is usually Quality Assurance. Some how they think that their product will still be completed without us. You shouldent have a problem finding QA people on job search sites (hotjobs, dice.com, computerjobs.com, etc.)<br><br>Also, here are a few books that you can read if you want to train your own QA guys, or if you just want to know what questions to ask applicants:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0135714648/qid=992042287/sr=1-2/ref=sc_b_2/002-6047489-0210450"><br>Customer Oriented Software Quality Assurance<br>by Frank P. Ginac<br></a><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1570744076/qid=992042148/sr=1-3/ref=sc_b_3/002-6047489-0210450"><br>Internal Quality Systems Auditing<br>by Paul F. Lewis<br></a><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130104701/qid=992042287/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/002-6047489-0210450"><br>Handbook of Software Quality Assurance<br>by G. Gordon Schulmeyer (Editor), James I. McManus, G. Gordo Schulmeyer<br></a><br><br>Reading this books is helpful, but experience in the field is more helpful. Eventually you should be able to give your QA department a product, and they should be able to effieciently write a build report within any specified deadline. Note that the extensiveness of the build report will vary depending on the amount of time they are given.<br><br>I hope this helps, if you have any questions on the topic feel free to <a href="mailto:soy@mediaone.net">email me.</a><br><br>

I was surprised at how fast I was in action.  My first log into the game and I was already in a battle.  The axis players had surrounded the city.  A few other players and I started to open fire on the axis players.  We soon came under fire by their panzer tanks and all of us where dead.  They took the town in about 3 hours.  The gameplay was amazing.  Even though I died 2 times and I don&#8217;t know if I actually killed someone I had great fun in this battle.  Maybe today the servers will be up again and I&#8217;ll be able to post some more.  We will be opening our bug database shortly.

Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught.<br>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back.<br><br><br>In addition, SOE staff observed various members of the guild discussing the cheating -- these comments include:<br><br><br>"we're useing [sic] massive amounts of exploits and u send a gm down here?"<br><br><br>"Any lead GM shows up, this show is over."<br><br><br>"yeah, this is the most impressive Itz-guyversploit [sic] to date"<br><br><br>"every guild exploits these"<br><br><br>The EverQuest Rules of Conduct state, among other things: <br><br><br>"You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game "/bug" command or via the eqtesting@verant.com email address."<br><br><br>"Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct . . . may be disbanded."<br><br><br>As a result of this unfortunate incident, (i) most of the participants were suspended for one week, (ii) a few, who had received previous warnings or suspensions, were banned, and (iii) this guild has been disbanded.<br><br><br>SOE regrets having to take these measures, but SOE is committed to protecting the health and viability of the game and of the EverQuest community. We&#8217;d also like to correct a few related misconceptions regarding this event: (i) Conquest did not complete the encounter &#8211; SOE staff inadvertently spawned the Sleeper during its efforts to stop the cheating, (ii) the &#8220;human figures&#8221; in some screenshots are a result of the screenshot taker not patching, and (iii) the zone is complete and working -- once SOE has patched fixes to these exploits we encourage players to wake the Sleeper.<br><br><br>We appreciate everyone&#8217;s emails with regards to questions and we do hope this will assist everyone in an understanding of the situation.<br><br></i><br>Yes folks, this is the official statement from VI. <br>,br><br>It is also an embarrasment to the company in which it is attributed to. Never have I seen a VI calaber company act in such an unprofessional way as to take our guildchat COMPLETLY out of context, and at the same time have it filled with OUTRIGHT UNDENIABLE LIES.<br><br><br>Lets take a look, shall we...<br><br><br>basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. <br><br><br>This is just an outright lie, period. EASILY proveable with the testimony of hundreds of everquest players who have killed the warders, and many other everquest mobs. YOU CANNOT EVER nullify the npcs summon ability - it is simply impossible. Hell, even VI employee's who play the high level game can vouch for that.<br><br><br>And to top it all off, we never even came CLOSE to killing the monster. The mob was down to 65% at most when we lost (yes we LOST the fight badly - VI decided it was wise to spawn kerafyrm anyways to kill the last few of us off - thus triggering their entire script)<br><br><br><i>In addition, SOE staff observed various members of the guild discussing the cheating -- these comments include:<br><br><br>...</i><br><br><br><br>These lines are totally taken out of context. They were NEVER in reference to the exploit you are describing (which isnt even possible to execute - you can even ask various co-workers like narris, kendrick, etc - you know, the guys who have a CLUE how the game works). These guildchat lines are in reference to useing rez effects to prevent the slow spell from stacking. The SAME tactic EVERY guild who killed yelinak used (casting clarity to overwrite yelinaks AE), the SAME tactic every guild who fought aaryanar used (lots of spells overwrote his AE), and the SAME tactic every guild who killed the 3rd warder used (useing snare so its AE wouldnt take hold). The statements were made IN JEST, because useing this border-line exploit is about as illegal as jaywalking. Verant watches people use these tactics EVERY DAY and doesnt even care - not to mention this isnt what we have been charged with doing.<br><br><br>Give me 8 hours of guildchat of ANY high end guild, and ill cut and paste you a reason to disband them.<br><br><br>As far as the guild being disbanded, the rules state:<br><br><br><i>Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct . . . may be disbanded.<br></i><br><br>How is ONE INCIDENT habitually violating the rules of conduct?<br><br><br>The last paragraph is particularly embarrasing to your company...<br><br><br><i>(i) Conquest did not complete the encounter &#8211; SOE staff inadvertently spawned the Sleeper during its efforts to stop the cheating </i><br><br><br>SOE staff spawned the sleeper due to their superiority complex... They could have very easily killed the CQ members with death touch. Spawning a lvl 99 mob that quads 1950 and death touches, that is KOS to anything and everything (even the npcs in teh zone) AND that sets off serverwide scripts is SURELY not the handbook procedure for killing off a dozen people who are allready LOSING BADLY to the mob you claim they are exploiting.<br><br><br><i>ii) the &#8220;human figures&#8221; in some screenshots are a result of the screenshot taker not patching</i><br><br><br>How can you feel comfortable spreading such blatent lies? Perhaps you should view this screenshot which shows both the human kerafyrm model AND the sleeper model in the same shot. <br><br><br><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/sleepers/sleeper01.jpg">http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/sleepers/sleeper01.jpg</a><br><br><br>DOH, didnt think we had one of those i bet.<br><br><br><i>(iii) the zone is complete and working -- once SOE has patched fixes to these exploits we encourage players to wake the Sleeper.<i><br><br><br>Not really. The script is worse shape then ever before. <br><br><br>Patched fixes to the exploits eh? All you've patched is upgrading the 3rd warders AE to make it COMPLETLY impossible, so noone will EVER complete your unfinished zone.<br><br><br>New 3rd warder AE (get this)<br><br><br>7500 dot over 1.5 mins<br>15 second stun<br>12 second reset<br>Whirl till you hurl (makes the player spin)<br><br><br>Needless to say, 3rd warder will never die in this form.<br><br><br>BTW you screwed up veeshans peak by changing the 3rd warder's ae - Nexona shares that spell. May want to patch that.<br> <br><br> <br><p><br> </i>My take? They were cheating and verant called them on it ..in a VERY lame and bad way. I agree with the screen shots,Sleepers is NOT functional as they state and imply.Spawning that thing to kill players is harassment ..ban that idiot GM. Anyway,what does it matter. Most guilds didn't know you could cast negative spells on yourself to offset effects from monsters. But anywho. My best wishes to the guild, i hope they recover. My fondest /rude to VI for handleing this is yet another Piss Poor fashion. Grats on the stupidity Award Verant. I wonder when an actual employee of Sony will start to view this crap and think " OMG..we backed these guys~!" Oh well who knows )<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Week One: the Breakdown<br><br>	Well, I played the Midgard Realm and the Albion Realm for about the same amount of in game hours.  Honestly, I feel like they are pretty balanced against each other.  While the Albion Realm has the magic, Leveling in the Midgard Realm seemed a little easier.  This week, the Albions got a new class, but their most powerful was nerfed.  (I would name them here, but, hey, that NDA business is tricky.)  <br><br>	I am actually relieved to see them address class balance in beta.  All to often, those sorts of things are left for Retail Beta &#8482;. Frankly, I think the nerfing in gold should end.  In a recent DTN poll, 31% of the participants said that they were ok with having their Toons nerfed after release.  Have we fallen so far as that? <br><br>	I am of the opinion that game developers should be held accountable for such actions and if you do not realize the danger of over-tweaking character classes; just play Asheron&#8217;s Call for a few months.  They have truly perfected the &#8220;flavor of the month&#8221; character.  Whether you are a ruthless peekay fool or a fruity role-player, it is tiresome to constantly restart.  I am glad that Mythic is a least starting on the right foot.<br><br>	Over the past few days, I also discovered one of those ways you can &#8220;make experience without fighting&#8221;.  In this case, I am referring to tasks.  These are aptly named.  Just as in real life, when you go to work, you leave the experience feeling somewhat less than fulfilled.  This is due, in part, to the complete lack of any sort of navigational aid. Think of any RPG that you have ever played.  Think of any sort of interface tool that helped you get from place to place.  DaoC does not have it. <br><br>Now, before you close this window and never, ever think of buying this game, I should point out that I really do not believe that Mythic is so stupid as to leave things as they are.  However, if they are, expect a very vicious War Pig to merrily bash those monkeys until I move on to another product. It is a glaring oversight, in an otherwise damn good game.<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With Shadowbane's release in the not-so-distant future (rumors have it that Wolfpack is telling retailers to expect it by September), now may be a good time to revisit the issue of exploitation.  For those who care, there just now was a rather scandolous incident in Everquest where an entire guild of extremely powerful characters was disbanded and banned from Everquest due to "cheating" against what was intended to be the most difficult encounter in the game.  The players say they were using the world geometry to their advantage just as one would in real life, while the EverWaffen say they were using their own shoddy programming to cheat.  The argument could go two ways here, but it doesn't really matter.  The players are simply playing the game; they aren't hacking it, nor doing something the game designers themselves didn't allow to happen.<br><blockquote><i>The world in which they exist is still bound by a set of rules.  Like any computer simulation, some can be bent; others, broken.</i></blockquote><br>My question is, how does Wolfpack plan on dealing with these things?  People are going to find ways to "cheat" and the cheating will, at some point, run rampant.  It has happened to every online game, most of the time brought to you courtesy of the Dr Twister Network.  To be honest, though, we don't like to see that.  Sure it levels the playing field, but how fun is the game if you have no rules by which to play it?  In the past, Wolfpack has said that they won't come down hard on exploiters, which is a good stance to have, so long as everyone is in happy-land and reports bugs when they find them.  But what will they do when John Q CyberPunk discovers how to dupe his Artifact Obsidian Blade of Giant Slaying +15 and distributes the copies to his guild?  What will happen when one guild exploits such a simple bug to the point where the conquest of another realm poses no challenge?  An exploit as serious as a dupe or a money machine, or even GEAR can seriously sway the balance of power in the world if Wolfpack plans to have a tolerance policy with cheaters.<br><br>I don't have a solution for this, do you?  Stop by the forums and lets get some ideas rolling.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am very pissed at this game at the moment for three reasons, the installation process, playing the game, and connecting to the game! <br><br>It started at 2 PM Eastern Standard Time. I was forced to goto 5 stores, including 2 Walmarts, Software Ect, and 2 Best Buys. After finally getting the game, I had to reinstall it 3 times just to get to the offline mode. Once I got it installed, I had to wait 5 minutes just to load the offline game! After that I tried to play as a plane, and after seeing how complicated that was I moved on to a tank. After realizing I needed a joystick to use the tank, I had gone nuts! After connecting my old joystick, I found out that it was broken, then for 2 hours I played around in changing the commands, which resulted me going only forward but not being able to turn! After I decided to give up on that and work on registrating the product, I went even further nuts! For 2 hours I was refreshing a browser to connect to the main site, I connected twice but twice failed at connecting to the registration script! I have decided to take the rest of the day of on this game. I have already notice several bugs that I will not mention until after I install the big patch to see if they are still there. That is it for my rant. If you could help me with the game, please email me at buddahchrist@hotmail.com , and here is a thread to discuss this topic, <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=372&forum=17&0">http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=372&forum=17&0</a> .<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the recent updating of the <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/faq.html" target="_blank">DAoC FAQ</a> to reflect the more accurate data from Mythic, I thought I'd take a little opportunity here to air a complaint... and perhaps, give some props as well. It's sort of a two-edged sword, so bear with.<br><br>Firstly, I love mmogs with an abundance of variety in races and classes. This is probably the main reason I'm looking forward to <a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons" target="_blank">Horizons</a>, should it ever see the light of day, due to their large, and quite varied, race roster. I played EQ solely for the substantial amount of races available, and their cultures that followed forthwith, though they were pretty disappointing in implementation. I shunned AC primarily for having one race with 3 texture palettes, boring ol' humans. <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com" target="_blank">Anarchy Online</a>, on the other hand, disappointed by having a mere handful of races, and all of them were pretty much cookie-cutter fantasy stereotypes with a sci-fi veneer that wore off quickly. Solitus, atrox, nano, opifex become human, ogre, elf, halfling respectively, from my exposure. UO... eh, why even mention UO.<br><br>So with that in mind, I was pretty jazzed when I read that DAoC would be including a total of three unique kingdoms with 4 unique races per kingdom. Naturally, you had to allow for a bit of leeway with Albion, but I think they've done a reasonable job of making each of the various humans diversified enough to warrant experimentation. That aside...<br><br>However, I was a bit disappointed to note that when compared, the four races per realm adopt a sort of "new cover, same book" theme. i.e. A briton is a norseman is a celt, a highlander is a troll is a firbolg, etc. Basically each realm receives a "tough" race, "magic" race, "rogue" race and "milquetoast" race. The exception seems to be that Midgard got short-sheeted in the "magic" race, with the dwarves middle-roading performance between skald and warrior.<br><br>To be fair, the races aren't railroaded into a particular role. Previous experiments with race/class combinations have been rewarded with unexpected, if but partial, success with races paired with their class antithesis. Interesting indeed.<br><br>Mythic has to take the road of maintaining the greatest balance, as DAoC does have PvP for one of the main selling points, but from a personal perspective, I was somewhat disappointed by this solution. I don't decry or condemn it, I freely admit to the logistics of it, but I wish it weren't so.<br><br>Adversely, I'm pretty much digging on the diversity of classes realm to realm so far. So it's give and take.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you probably know by reading Lum/Stratics, some stuff went down with a DAoC developer flaming Shadowbane. More specificly, Mahrin Skel (Dave Rickey) of Mythic Entertainment posted the following on Lum the mad's message boards:<br><br><blockquote><br>"The simple fact is, the only thing most outside its current hardcore fanboy community expects from SB is for it to skim off the most extreme of the hardcore PK's into voluntary exile, away from everyone else."<br></blockquote><br><br>Ow.. That one stung!<br><br>Anyways.. Everyone has since apologized to each other through long winded and somewhat insincere emails, which have been posted all over the other news sites. If you really care, you can go read them. I'm sure as hell not posting them here.<br><br>I guess since I have the privilage of using newspro here, I should spew my opinion on to you. But I wont.. Since I don't think anyone cares. Personally, I don't give a shit what the idiots on the message boards say about Shadowbane. The game sounds cool, the developers seem to be atleast slightly intelligent, and it will give me something to do instead of play Counter-Strike all day. <br><br>Why do people have to get so testy over the issue anyways... After all, it's just a game... Right?<br><br>Oops! That was an opinion! :(<br>

I think this time around, I'm definately going to be a ruthless barbarian PK.  You see, in AC I always felt bad about randomly PKing people, due mainly to the fact that I was victimized terribly as a newbie.  But no more!  For months now I've been working with some of my old Rainbow Six, Quake, EQ, and counter-strike buddies to make a viscious band of PKers with no small amount of player versus player training.

If all goes well, you'll see our crest dominating the map in no time=)<br><br>This gives me an interesting idea.  If you'd like to see your guild on the front page here, email me.  I'm thinking that it would be a neat idea to help some player run guilds get into the spot-light early, so that people will have a broader spectrum of guilds to consider come release.<br><br>Oh, and one last thing.

VaporWar: The War Between Upcoming MMORPG&#8217;s<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Monday, June 4, 2001   11:45 PM EST by <a href="mailto:buddahchrist@drtwister.com" class=link2>BuDDaHCHRiST</a></font><a href="mailto:buddahchrist@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My first column expect more to come.<br><br>VaporWar: The War Between Upcoming MMORPG&#8217;s<br><br>It seems anyone now a days anyone can &#8216;make&#8217; a game. Even produce a MMORPG. With the resent news in the MMORPG community it seems as if more and more MMORPGs are popping up. Last year there was only 3 main MMORPGs, and by a year from now there can be from 7 to possibly 50 new MMORPGs titles. Is there enough fan base for all of these? How many will end up like the now famous vaporware Dawn? How many are actually destine for gold? We shall examine these and many more questions in this column. <br><br>Recent news has shown that many famous MMORPGs are dropping like flies. Just recently Glitchless announced they are unable to fun their &#8216;project&#8217; and decided to make another project to fuel Dawn. Shadowbane awhile back lost their publisher. Big World: Citizen Zero&#8217;s main company &#8216;downsized&#8217; and now there are rumors Artifact Entertainment&#8217;s project Horizons is having internal conflicts, with the silence of several other MMORPGs in the make, it shows us it is not well in the MMORPG community. Even some new titles coming out shows us the same thing. Many beta testers of Anarchy Online believe the game is not ready to be released but yet it is soon to be released and the same thing with World War 2 Online. <br><br>Even with the bad news, every day a new title pops up into development. Now we must realize that the MMORPG community is limited. It will not grow past a certain point and many people will not be able to afford $100 bills monthly for MMORPGs that are soon to come out. Many of the upcoming MMORPGs have great ideas and potential but will they be able to attract the amount of attention a MMORPG needs to be successful? Few may, and many more will be buried in the sand. With the economy declining, they still appear. <br><br>Many of these new &#8216;companies&#8217; have no idea what they are getting into and soon realize it by having cuts on there original project. I suspect by the end of the year many more projects will be canceled. This may be due to internal conflict, lack of funding, lack of leadership, or lack of ideas. <br><br>Here are a list of certain MMORPG&#8217;s that have promise in reaching your hard drive.  <br><br><b>Horizons</b>: Even with rumors of internal problems, the game has a large fan base even though it is still in alpha! The game promises a lot and might actually deliver what it promises with such a large amount of backing of funding they are receiving. Everything they are claiming to have is possible to make but with so much of it in the same game it becomes very complicated to code and balance.<br><br><b>Star Wars Galaxies</b>: This new title has just recently gained attention from E3, this is mostly due to the fact of their awesome graphics promised in their game. Not much is known about it but what is known shows it has a lot of promise.<br><br><b>World War 2 Online</b>: Although it has some major flaws, including bugs and trapped between political correctness(decided that the swastika will not be included anywhere in the game) and fun, it still will be coming out on June 6, two days from now. The game promises to reenact the entire length of World War 2 in all theaters. This will be a big hit with World War 2 fanatics.<br><br><b>Neocron</b>: Leading the pack of futuristic/punk games is this title. It just recently entered beta and plans on having the game free for download but having a monthly fee. This will perhaps do quite well for 2 reasons. The first reason is because it is a new theme in the MMORPG community! The second is because it is free! Most people will flock to things that are free even if the product is crappy or impossible to make, (example Dawn). Only time will tell about this one.<br><br><b>Project Entropia</b>: This game has some new concepts going for it. One is that it is entirely free! However the game will be using real life currency so you can loose money in game or make money. This game has the same thing going for it as does Neocron. This game also just entered beta. <br><br><b>Anarchy Online</b>: This is also a futuristic game and is soon to hit the shelf. The game has a lot of problems though. There is a lot of bugs in the game, and from many beta testers of this game, they believe it should still be in beta for sometime. <br><br>There are many other games that are possibly going to be on your hard drive soon also. There is also a lot of games that will not. That&#8217;s it for my first column.  <br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is only one reason why any sane person would put up with the lag, the constant nerfing, let alone the monthly bill that MMORPGs offer.  I am speaking, of course, about the social interactions between other &#8216;real&#8217; people.  While a lead in like that would normally prompt me to bash the painfully bad acting of fruity role-players with all of their complexities (read that as low self-esteem), today, I&#8217;m going to offer up a little glimpse into the grouping system.  After spending several days in the game, selflessly sacrificing my need and desire for a personal life, simply to provide your ravenous appetite for information about the game, I noticed a fair amount of requests from players seeking for a group.  Being the social deviant that I am, I resisted this urge until such time as my posterior was more frequently being handed to me as opposed being swung back and forth in some sort of makeshift white boy victory boogie.  Here is how it went, enjoy!<br><br>(No names are changed because, frankly, I do not believe that anyone is innocent.)  A spiritmaster named Singe and a runemaster named Gish (whom I affectionately now refer to as &#8220;Gish the dish&#8221;) were forming up a group to fight some mobs.  The particular mobs in question are one of the &#8220;ueber experience mobs&#8221; for the low level.  We grouped for a while, adding and losing players from time to time.  I was usually the puller of the group.  One thing I did notice that the balance is good, a team can function without several support classes, but it is most efficient with a few from each different type.  I mention because it gives me strange warm sensations in places untold that a gaming company would actually attempt to address balance before the game has been in retail for at least a year.  I am so sick of retail betas.  However, as this is not the fatman&#8217;s site, I shall stick to the topic at hand.  Grouping was not the ueber powerleveler&#8217;s dream that day, however, it was a lot of fun.  Under ideal circumstances, grouping could the mad way to power level, but maintaining that for a prolonged period would be difficult.  Anyway, real life is kicking my ass right now, so I am going to say adios now.<br><br>To L.C., if a man is measured by what he gave and not what he left, then you were a giant among men. I love you and I will miss you.  R.I.P.<br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is an error that certain beta testers are having, I was one of them. At 100% installation of AO, I would receive a CRC Error. It would say something like this "AO Launcher's .cab file does not match setups". Well, this error is caused by the Win95.CIH/Win32.CIH virus. This virus can cause some corruption to files within a zip file, as they are unzipped. The virus is also hard to clean, it will infect virus scan software, and never be fully cleaned. A DOS cleaner is required, and this one works well. I would run it twice to make sure it cleans everything. Install it in your C drive. Shutdown into MS-DOS mode. It will say C:\Windows\. Type "cd..". Then type: cleancih. Follow the instructions. Repeat once more for safety. Hope this helps.

He has been accused of jacking accounts, looting accounts and ripper people off on many occassions. Fact or fiction ? dunno. BUT in his latest fiasco jesse,Keiron,erebis,gwiz..and on and no..was the money source for the Defenders of Ak'anons site, www.defendersofakanon.com. It seems in a phone pissing contest as well as being kicked from the guild, he reverted thier site to gay.com or some such and then canceled the whole site. DOA has told me that they are in the proccess of moving thier files and opening a new webpage.<br><br><br> This is the best i could find, good lord how lame it is when the only thing to report on is some rich kid pitching a fit.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No longer can you see if a monster is aggressive in Anarchy-Online.  There is no "!" point in front of the monsters name.  You use an Information Tool, based on perception, to find out this information.  The concealment skill of the monster of player counters that ability.  This is the same for Health and Nano levels.  There is some use for concealment and perception now.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The desires of battle weary and lost souls spread across Rubi-Ka, calling for help without politics or propaganda. In answer to this silent need, the Advisors of Rubi-Ka emerge. Our vigilant reporter relays this moment as it unfolds&#8230; <br><br>**Grid uplink connecting&#8230; Password accepted&#8230; Welcome to the Rubi-Ka Grid&#8230; <br><br>I'm Lacey, a freelance reporter for the citizens of Rubi-Ka. I left my previous investigations of enigma and medusa mutants in the territories to find any truth to the rumors of an ICC organization in Newland. So far I have discovered a humanitarian group called Advisors of Rubi-Ka (ARK) wanting to build offices in all the major cities. I have travelled from the territories to my source in Newland, following my investigations into any links between ARK and the ICC. <br><br>When I arrived in the neutral city I was looking forward to a hot shower and soft bed, but as luck would have it - I was just in time for another ARK visit. Advisor Apotheos was asking for people to go on a "dangerous but highly paid errand". He was looking for a group of people to seek out Viiir, the sister of famous fashion designer Miiir. ARK wanted to hire her to design their uniforms. Unfortunately Viiir is difficult to approach, as she is known to be temperamental about strangers and has many wild pets to guard her privacy. <br><br>Advisor Apotheos had a gift of good will and message to pass onto Viiir for any willing adventures that could follow instructions to seek her out. To ensure success, I was informed that groups from Newland, Tir and Omni were sent to find the wayward seamstress. The first team to successfully approach Viiir would receive a substantial reward and the other teams some creds for their trouble. <br><br>Now with potential office sites and the designer Viiir commissioned for new uniforms, it appears ARK are preparing to make their full presence felt in Rubi-Ka. I was able to confirm ARK have been assisting trapped citizens and advising on all aspects of Rubi-Ka life. Hopefully an interview with the Advisory Council of ARK will give us details about any connection to ICC. <br><br><br>__________________<br>--== Ellen Lacey ==-- <br>Freelance Reporter <br>Home is a campfire <br><br><br>see the rest of the thread <a href="http://aoforums.funcom.com/showthread.php?s=2f1f32263d2bced34a80c886d993939e&threadid=3760"class="link2">here</a><br>

The Joys of Camping and the Agony of Questing<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Sunday, June 3, 2001   10:47 AM EST by <a href="mailto:kampfschwein@drtwister.com" class=link2>Kampfschwein</a></font><a href="mailto:kampfschwein@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their main page propaganda, Mythic claims that they have the cure all for two of the more controversial aspects of gaming.  Well, the War Pig decided to &#8220;test&#8221; their salt on these two things yesterday. <br><br>In my mind&#8217;s eye, there are two forms of camping, the experience based camping (ala the &#8216;sweet spot&#8217;) and the item based camping (ala kill-the-mob-with-ueber-toy) or, as you may think of them, hunting and questing.  Now, let me be honest here, I love camping so much I have a sponsorship from Coleman.  Hell, my high score in gems would make all you fans of the fatman jealous. <br><br>First, the experience based camping.  It did not take long to find several that were decent for my level.  It was the customary &#8220;pull and kill&#8221; method.  It worked like a charm for a while, but had several drawbacks. If a spot is over-hunted for an extended period, the game will start spawning higher-level mobs.  At first, this was cool; several of us just grouped and poured out a bowl of hell on the poor critter.  Soon, it got harder, so, we moved on.  Therefore, I give Mythic credit for originality (an ueber-quest mob that was at least four levels above me just casually walked by me, scared the hell out of me while I was fighting a social mob that was screaming for back up).  Overall, Mythic has not eliminated this type of camping, just made it a little more fun and interesting.<br><br>Honestly, I&#8217;ve seen questing handled in two ways, first the EQ method, second, the AC method, both, in my opinion sucked.  For those of you just joining us, in EQ, you simply settle in line and hope that some high level dress wearing geek did not steal your place in line.  In AC, you gave item A to NPC X and run for an hour or so to fight for a grand total of two minutes.  Which sucks the most?  Well, I do not bother comparing the suck value of things.  That is like asking me if I would rather be shot or stabbed.  The answer is a resounding &#8220;hell no!&#8221;  Now, the quests that I have worked on for DAoC seem to be equally as bad.  All were along the lines of &#8220;find obscure bastard NPC in the middle of nowhere, get the quest, and find an equally obscure, mobile mob with a traveling jones and a penchant for grouping with a mass of buddies&#8221;.  I give Mythic credit for addressing the problem, but they lose a lot of cool points for the way they failed to solved it. <br><br>

EQ 1.5: First Impressions from the War Hog<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#999999">Posted on Saturday, June 2, 2001   6:49 PM EST by <a href="mailto:kampfschwein@drtwister.com" class=link2>Kampfschwein</a></font><a href="mailto:kampfschwein@drtwister.com"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#CCCCCC">
</font></a><br><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, after a month full of more foolishness than an extended stay in the nut house, the War Pig is finally in this damn beta.  Therefore, I will skip the formalities and get to the chase.<br><br>&#8220;EQ without the suck.&#8221;  One of the DaoC devs said he could live with that.  Well, he is probably one of the few.  However, this being my first few days in the damn thing, I think I can spare some objectivity on the matter.  As I am on a dial up still, one thing near and dear to my heart is how big of a pain it is to download the beta.  Now, to avoid pissing off anyone, let me just say, DaoC devs showed some insight and courtesy.  Chalk that up as a cool point for them.  Ok, so, you really do not give a rat&#8217;s rotting posterior about that, but I did want to give them a little credit before I start beating them. <br><br>The graphics in this game, well, I have to be honest, they pretty much best anything I have seen in this genre on the market or in development.  Will some monkeys argue that AO or SB (Anarchy Online and Shadow bane, respectively) have better graphics?  Sure, they will, am I concerned about it.  Nope.<br><br>Now, because I am still on the low level end of the game (a level 6 Norse Thane, and a level 6 Troll Berserker), it would be an injustice to comment on the combat for the whole game.  Suffice it to say, the low level combat is dreadfully dull for melee.  However, at level 5, it does seem to get more interesting.  More details will follow, rest assured. <br><br>Would you mind terribly if I made some negative comments here?  Good, I was not really asking you anyway.  To be very vague, the interface is perhaps the worst I have seen for such a major product.  This thing needs more love than the not-so-elusive fatman (don&#8217;t worry, you figure out who the &#8220;fatman&#8221; is if you keep reading.) <br><br>While I am giving you people a little info, currently, I am the only one writing for the site until Bailey, lord of terror, arrives.  Beware the great and terrible day of the Bailey.  So, do not expect a lot of that tedious listing crap until we get more manpower.  Especially since I have some fruity role players to find, hunt down and pk. Yes, I said peekay!  PvP is for sissy-boy punks with issues involving their mothers.<br><br><br>

Or does this present too much of a security risk for you?<br><br>A) we will have other options then to buy the box in the store, we will give you more info as soon as the system is in place.<br><br>2) How exactly does Funcom plan on patching the game, I know that during the beta test that some of the larger patches were placed online for users to download and self install.  Will Funcom allow players to have the option to self patch?  This applies mainly to the 56k and dail up crowd.<br><br>A) we might make the standalone patches for the larger patches, but we will wait and see if there are many people that want them.</font></blockquote>Discuss how you think they should distribute the game <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/viewtopic.php?topic=344&forum=2&0"class="link2">here</a><br>

UO Advisors<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was just browsing through IRC when a freind brought my attention to this:<br><br>Customer Support Advisors Jun 1 2001 3:29PM CST (GMT -06:00) <br>EA has arranged with a small group of international customer support representatives to aid in handling game-related customer support, as well as other tasks, for EA.com. As of Friday, June 1st, they will be spending some time addressing Ultima Online customer concerns on the Chesapeake and Atlantic shards from 5:00 pm to 1:00 am EDT as advisors, appearing in peach-colored robes. Please keep in mind that Advisors will only address game play issues. This is an experimental program, and we will post updates when and if the program is to be expanded. <br><br>So it looks like EA have decided to replace counselors with paid up staff. Sounds good except firstly none of these Advisors are ex-counselors - a quick survey in the ex-counselor IRC rooms revealed that to be the case and secondly after a bit more digging around I managed to discover that these new advisors may well consist in the main of asian staff. It doesn't take much to guess that these new advisors are probably working for EA for next to nothing.<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I fired off an email today to Jeremy "Utildayael" Dixon in an attempt to find some quality news items.  Here's what I said:<br><br><blockquote><i>Hey Jeremy. <br> <br>    The community is growing stagnant with the lack of news being released, so I've come seeking it.  What kind of ETA are we looking at for maybe a game trailer or a few in game movies?  Trust me when I say the fans don't care if they're made up all pretty, just turn on the vid capture and show us some gaming!<br> <br>At any rate, drop us a line over at hz.drtwister.com if you've got some news for us!</i></blockquote><br><br>JD emailed me back with a few words of encouragement.<br><br><blockquote><i>From past experience working on IGN, games in alpha are generally somewhat boring to follow, moreso if its a MMORPG. There really isn't much more to release. We already have more info out there than any other MMORPG at this stage in development. <br> <br>As for movies, it's gonna be awhile. I wouldn't expect to see any ingame movies until beta time. <br> <br>I'm gonna try to get something new up on the site today... gotta go bug the art team and see what they have that I can post. :-)</i></blockquote><br><br>So that's that.  Keep your eyes open for some new art soon.<br><br>Dipes<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's rather simple. With the recent "BIG NEWS" Glitchless released, it won't be too much longer that the simple thought of Dawn won't be laid to rest. Plus the fact that they have decided not to publish Dawn as a Massive Multiplayer, there is simply no reason to keep this site open.<br><br>In the meantime, for those interested, there are at least 3 new sites for DTN in the works.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Received a quick note from the team bringing us <a href="http://www.mimesisonline.com" class=link2>Mimesis Online</a>:<br><blockquote><font color="cccc99">Most people prefer to get the bad news out of the way first, so here it is - the start of the Mimesis Online Beta Tests has been moved back - the tester selection, which was due to be done at the end of May, will take place in July, and the tests will start after that. The decision to move the Tests back wasn't taken lightly, and two major factors played a role.<br><br>One of them is the studio's expansion - coming up to the Tests, new staff were taken on, and there are currently over thirty of us working in the same studio we started out in. So we've moved the bulk of the studio to a new address, a move which will give us all space and a better atmosphere to focus on the game in.<br><br>Which brings us to the good news, which is the second reason for our decision. We know that the longer wait will be something of a disappointment to many of you; this might make the wait more worth it. We've decided to add a few things to the Beta version that we had previously not planned to introduce until later. When the Beta version "knocks on your door", you can expect to see it with the full trade system installed, for example. Not to mention the full range of grouping possibilities. And perhaps most importantly of all, we'll be testing the Player vs. Player system in its entirety, with four new options added to the arena combat rules, including plaver vs. NPC and party vs. party.<br><br>So, hang in there. The studio will be putting out quite a few things in those weeks before the Betas, and we promise that the wait won't be a day longer than we need to make sure that the version you get will be the best possible. Thanks for your patience, and we'll be in touch with more news as soon as it comes in. <br><br>The Tannhauser Gate team</blockquote></font><br>
