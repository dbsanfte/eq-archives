				This is my first attempt at fiction, so bear with me... <br>  <br> Cypes Silvertongue was not a man to be trifled with.  With shoulder length brown hair, and blue eyes the color of a deep mountain lake, he left an indelible mark on the people he met.  His blue armor shone brilliantly in the setting sun as he ran through the city of Freeport.  His drum, which he had pulled from the clutches of evil inside Mistmoore Castle, beat out a rhythm that made his feet fly.  He was one with the music, allowing it to flow through his body almost without thought.  The inhabitants of the city stopped and gawked at him, completely mesmerized by he presence.  Such a powerful person was rarely seen in this sea-side city. <br>  <br> Cypes did not have time to be amused with the thoughts of the people of Freeport.  He was in a hurry, and needed to be far away before the sun set.  In his left hand he still held a scrap of parchment. <br> 	&#8220;Come to the island of Kunark. Your assistance is desperately needed. <br> - Jaerl Hawkwing&#8221; <br>  <br> Such a small note from a good friend meant that something must be amiss.  Jaerl was usually one for flowery speech.  He could spend hours retelling the story of a twenty minute fight.  No, something must be terribly wrong. <br>  <br> 	The last time that Jaerl and Cypes had been together was deep in the ruins of old Guk.  What had once been an awe-inspiring city had been overrun by walking frogs, barely more intelligent than their hopping brothers.  After that exciting exploration, Jaerl had mentioned that he was thinking of heading to Kunark, to see for himself the Iksar he had heard about in elvish children&#8217;s stories.  Cypes had other plans however, and had gone to Freeport in search of good stories and better ale.  He felt he had earned a rest, and would spend a few of his hard won coin on the finer things in life.  After a long night of drinking, Cypes had awoken to the sound of footsteps running away from his room.  He threw open his door to find the hallway empty, and a note stuck to his door. <br>  <br> 	After gathering up his equipment and instruments, and buying provisions for the journey, Cypes took off down the coast towards the Oasis of Marr.  There, he could catch a barge to an island, and from there catch the boat that would take him to Kunark.  While the boat was usually only for the passage of evil races, Cypes was confident that he could use it to get to the northern part of Kunark with no problem and save him a lot of time that he could spend searching.  With dark rapidly approaching, Cypes would have to find a place to camp for the night.  When you tended to travel as fast as he did, a missed sand dune in the dark could have tragic consequences.  He had learned at an early age that while he amazing speed was a blessing, it also had a tendency of getting him seriously near death from nasty falls. <br>  <br> 	Cypes found a couple of abandoned tents right next to the docks that he found more then useful.  He planned to wake up at dawn to catch the barge to the island.  After a delectable meal of roast rabbit, foraged vegetables, and some short beer, Cypes settled down for the night.  While he would have rather had some elven wine, he found that the ruffians of Freeport could not even simulate a wine that came close to the drink of his hometown.  As soon as his head hit his pack, a loud thump jolted him awake.  He knew that sand giants inhabited this stretch of beach, but he had been hoping that they would have gone with the sun.  Another thump, closer this time, but from the other side of the tent.  Could there be two? For a bard, two monsters was a lot easier than one.  Cypes poked his head out of the tent.  To the east, the form of a sand giant silhouetted by the moonlight, running at him.  To the west, another one wielding a huge scimitar, just as ugly, and hopefully just as stupid.  Juggling his songs in his mind, Cypes began to sing his speed song.  The potential damage from falling off a sand dune was nothing compared to if one of the giants caught him.  As soon as he felt the speed kick in, he bolted to the west.  With an enchanting chorus, he began to weave his song magic into the mind of the fast-approaching giant.  The huge beast stopped running and stood at the side of Cypes, seeing the small bard as his long lost friend who desperately needed protection.  The sand giant took off after the other unsuspecting giant, defending his new friend his only goal.  Cypes&#8217; giant swung his scimitar in a huge arc at the oncoming giant, cleaving his leg to the bone.  The other giant screamed in pain and lashed out with his fists, pummeling Cypes&#8217; friend.  Cypes&#8217; giant swung again, bringing the huge sword down on the other&#8217;s shoulder.  The other giant fell from this unexpected onslaught, a look of confusion still on his face. <br>  <br> 	The newfound friend looked down on what he had done, shaking his head vigorously.  It looked as if the charm of the bard was wearing off, and he would soon have the biggest enemy in the world.  The giant thrust his sword into the air and bellowed, rage filling his body.  He ran at Cypes, who stood motionless, watching the giant.  The drum was no longer in his hands, it had been replaced by a pair of three foot long metal claws, both of which glowed with a magical aura.  As the giant ran, Cypes began to stalk towards the giant, something the giant was clearly unprepared for.  The giant had grown fat feeding on the seemingly constant flow of inexperienced humans from Freeport, but this blue clad elf was a threat.  As the distance between the two got smaller and smaller, Cypes began to hum.  Soon, the humming became more of a moaning, which developed into a haunting tune, one filled with sorrow and anger.  Fear flooded the mind of the giant.  This would not be an easy fight with a meal at the end.  He could get hurt.  He could die. Death. Death was coming for him.  Little blue death.  The fear overwhelmed the simple mind of the giant, and he turned and ran from the bard.  With two quick swipes, Cypes sliced deep into the ankles of the giant.  With a scream, the giant fell forward, landing with a force that made Cypes fall over.  The giant, still overcome with fear, tried to crawl away, but Cypes was too quick.  He jumped onto the back of the giant, dragging his claws slowly along the giant&#8217;s spine.  Blood poured in rivers from the wounds as Cypes advanced towards the giant&#8217;s head.  When Cypes reached the neck, he plunged his claws deep and twisted, ripping open the giant&#8217;s windpipe.  The giant&#8217;s screams stopped immediately, and the silence of night closed in as Cypes finished off his defenseless victim. <br>  <br> It's nowhere near complete, but I thought I'd post the beginning to see what people felt, and whether I should keep going on the rest.  Thanks in advance for any input <br>

				Well, I think it's a pretty good start.  Other than a few places where you have &quot;he&quot; where you should have &quot;his&quot; (minor nitpick), your first work of fiction is fairly well written.  I look forward to reading more of this tale.
