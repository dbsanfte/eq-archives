				(Please excuse me if this tabbing is messed up, I wrote this in Wordpad, as I do all of my larger posts.) <br>  <br> 	Much like the prohibiton on alchohal, the war on drugs has done more harm than good. The following reasons will be outlined in the following paragraphs. This is a huge topic to cover, with many facets, so please bare with me. <br>  <br> 	The war on drugs has been lost. Billions have been spent to fight to keep the drugs out of this country, but they still freely flow into it. Even worse than that, we have payed with civil liberties. With the accusation of a drug related crime happening on your property, with no other involvement from yourself, your property can be siezed indefinitely. Much like the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, the War on Drugs was the means to impliment many laws taking away your privacy and your constintional rights. The fourth amendmant gives you the right to be safe and secure in your home, from unjust searches and siezures. Your property can be searched and taken simply due to an accusation by the police that you aquired it through drug profits. <br>  <br> 	Beyond just the loss of your civil liberties is the loss of money. Billions have been spent to fight a losing war on drugs. For every shipment of drugs, intended to come to this country, that are siezed, many more slip by. The money is spent in vain. This comes directly out of the taxpayers pocket, who generally have no reason to, or straight out do not agree, with the expenditure. Some of this money is spent on ad campaigns about drugs, which completely lie to the public. Sure, you might let the baby you are babysitting drown when you are high on marijuana, because you aren't paying attention. But imagine how many times more likely it is to happen when, say, you are playing videogames. Sure, you might crash your car and kill your little brother when you are high, but it is much more likely that you will do so sober, for any number of reasons (mechanical failure, lack of attention, excessive speed). These ads are ludicrous. <br>  <br> 	Aside from our losses, there are many other things that make drug prohibition pointless, futile, and outright dangerous. The drug prohibtion raises crime. Just because something is made illegal does not mean it will end, it just means that those that have nothing to lose will take over the trade. Gangs, much like the mafia of the 1920's, make millions on the drug market. These gangs attain and hold territory through violence, violence in which innocent people are killed. This, in turn, makes the streets unsafe, more so than legalized drugs ever could. <br>  <br> 	Let's first look at the crime rate prior to, during, and after the alchohal prohibition. In the 1920's alchohal was made illegal in the same way drugs are today. When it was when towns went dry due to its outlawing, outlaws jumped to supply the thirst. Organized crime sprung up everywhere to bootleg and smuggle alchohal as well as setting up places to drink (speakeasy's). During todays prohibition, gangs grow/smuggle drugs and supply them, and, though not nearly as widespread (as distribution is much easier now), there are still speakeasy's, such as opium dens or crackhouses. When prohibition began, the homicide rate went up more than 70%. Since the beginning of the War on Drugs, our homicide rate has risen 200%. When the alchohal prohibiton was ended, crime returned to its previous levels, as the booze business was taken from the mafia. The same would happen today if the drug business was taken from the Bloods and Crips. <br>  <br> 	Crimes are often committed to support the users habit for these artifically inflated drug prices. Due to the drugs being illegal, and the demand being so high for the limited flow (and danger of sustaining this flow), drug prices are insanely high for even the smallest quantities. For a single marijuana cigarette, the price is up to 10 dollars. That's the price of 2 packs of cigarettes (40 cigarettes I believe), which are widely known for being very expensive. Prices for drugs like cocaine, heroin, and methanphetamines are even higher. To support their habit, users turn to crime such as robbery, auto theft and burglaries. It is estimated that 25% of all auto thefts, 40% of robberies and assaults, and 50% of burglaries and larcenies are attributed to drug users, feeding their desire for a price inflated product. <br>  <br> 	Half of police resources are spent attempting to stop drug trafficing. These are resources that could be devoted to stopping violent crimes, the crimes that actually plague our lives. <br>  <br> 	The solution? Legalize all drugs. There are many premises under which this could be done, but my personal favorite is government licensed rights to production. Due to the fact that, if the government was solely responsible for the creation and distribution of drugs, they would still be overly expensive and now watered down, licenses should be granted to pharmicutical and farming companies to grow and distribute the drugs. Not only would this keep drugs like exctasy, cocaine, heroin and meth from being badly made/cut, which causes deaths, it would also allow for a battle of prices between the company, which benefits the consumer. Adding sale of drugs, which would likely big as big a business as alchohal and tobacco combined. Another solution is a tax of 5-10 additional percent (on top of sale tax) to each sale of a narcotic. <br>  <br> 	What will this do? Crime will be GREATLY reduced. The economy will be boosted with the addition of a huge new industry. Tax revenue to the government will allow more spending on civil services, such as schools and police. So little bad will come from so much good that I am amazed it has yet to happen.

				While I agree with you in principle, it doesn't seem feasible. <br>  <br> Look at the debacle of the Tobacco Lawsuits.  Who in their right mind would invest in a drug business that is perhaps even MORE liable for public health concerns? <br>  <br> At least the Tobacco Industry had decades to make billions.  I imagine there will be lawsuits filed within days of a legal Drug producer marketing its wares. <br>  <br> And how exactly would you market Narcotics?  Talk about overcoming a negative image. <br>  <br> Prohibition was different in that it made illegal substances of things that the majority of people felt were normal and perhaps even used.  I have no doubt that Alcohol Use (not abuse) far exceeds drugs in as far as the percentage of the population who uses them or thinks they are fine. <br>  <br> I could see a legalization strategy working for marijuana.  But Crack?  Heroin?  No way.

				&quot;And how exactly would you market Narcotics? Talk about overcoming a negative image.&quot; <br>  <br> You don't. I agree that drugs should be legalized (Fancy that, me agreing with Rrail). With legalization, however, comes controls and regulations.  <br>  <br> First off, pretty much no marketing allowed. Manufacturers should be able to have a website (and the ability to distribute pamphlets to those who request them in writing), which can talk about the product without encouraging it's use (&quot;Laramie Marijuana is grown hydroponically in BC&quot;, not &quot;Laramie Marijuana, for a quality high&quot;), and should contain full details of the health effects of the product. Limit companies to plain packaging - white background, black text, limit the size of the brand name, require full information about effects and health risks on the inside, with some of the major ones on the outside.  <br>  <br> The stores where they are sold should resemble a pharmacy more than anything else. The products should not be displayed; a simple sign displaying what they have availiable and price should be all. This is essentially how it worked after prohibition was lifted, and still how it works in many places: You go up to a counter and ask for the kind of booze (or drugs, in this case) you want. Ontario Beer Stores work like that for the most part. <br>  <br> And if the manufacturers say from the begining: This is bad for you, then I don't think people could sue them...

				I think selling things like tobacco and other drugs could be feasible if the companies selling these products required their customers to sign a legal waiver at every purchase.  List every known or suspected health risk on the disclaimer form, then if someone decides to sue &quot;Big Marijuana&quot; because they got lung cancer, the company that they are suing could whip out a stack of signed waivers proving that the plaintiff was fully informed of the risks and potential risks before any transactions took place. <br>

				Easier to sell to the public maybe.  Easier to enforce?  No.  The harsher you make drug laws, the more profitable the business.  That's just the way it is, and the more you crack down, the more firepower we'll see in the hands of drug lords.  Tell me how much &quot;easier&quot; it is when police casualties become a guaranteed occurance in every sting operation. <br>  <br> At least legalizing drugs provides a source of revenue via taxation, not to mention better controls over the quality of the narcotics.  Without actually researching it, I have my suspicions that bad mixes cause more fatalities than the pure stuff.  And to anyone like Alanus who thinks they're billy badass because of their oh-so-heartless &quot;lock em up and throw away the key&quot; attitude, I suggest that drug abusers ultimately pay a much harsher penalty with no law enforcement involved. <br>  <br> Unfortunately there is simply no chance that this will happen anytime soon.  Its an idea that is way before its time.

				Making informed decisions requires reading things and looking things up.  Making sound judgements requires serious thought.  It's so much easier to join a dogpack and start barking at something.  Just let the pack leader choose the target and all you have to do is snarl and growl and bark at that target along with the rest of the pack.   <br>   <br> Sure, the pack leader chases butterflies instead of going after that cougar that killed all those pack members, but since he's become pack leader there have been NO butterfly attacks on any pack member!  Don't mess with the pack leader when he is making the pack safe from butterflies!  And only a small percentage of the pack's members have been killed or injured by cars while chasing those butterflies across the freeway!  Stay the course!  That's the only way we can win against those darn butterflies! <br>

				Alikat what did that mean? <br>  <br> As for leagalization of drugs the benefits go much farther than that.  Currently about 75% of the US prision population is behind bars for drug related offences.  How much money would we save if they were not there? <br>  <br> The lawsuits the Tobacco companies have had lately can be avoided by making the distributers of said narcotics put a percentage of their profits into education and rehab programs from the start.  Let them pay for it instead of the tax payer. <br>  <br> Law enforcement would not have to deal with as much as they do not.  Cut back on their workload some, so they can concentrate on other things. <br>  <br> One of the big deals in the news lately has been how terrorists organizations have been using the drug trade to fund their attacks.  Well if it is leagalized they are out a huge source of income.  Then again so are many of the Latin American drug lords who have been terrorizing their own countries for decades.   <br>  <br> Organized crime would take the biggest hit they ever have.  How much of their income would be lost if this happend? <br>  <br> Gang viloence rose sharply in the 80s when crack cocaine came on the street.  They started competing for territory to sell their drugs in, and anyone caught in the crossfire was killed.  Leagalize drugs and end their main reason for defending their territories.  This would make the inner city streets safer for the people and for the police. <br>  <br> Controll of the drugs:  Simple fact, you can not controll something that is illegal.  If drugs were leagal then the Federal and State Governemnts could finally controll them.  How they are distributed, ammounts people could purchase, price, etc. <br>  <br> Now the Federal Governemnt could not be in charge of the making and selling of this product.  That would give them a monopoly, and that is illegal.  They can give out contracts for other companies to produce and distribute them.  They can also set guidelines for the drugs produced. <br>  <br> Last but not least the anti-drug laws are basically protecting people against themselvs.  Since when is that the job of any level of government?  The FDA says they are illegal because these drugs serve no medical purpose, yet they allow alchol and tobacco to remain leagalized because the market for them was so strong before the FDA was created.  Atleast that is their excuse.   <br>  <br> BTW last I heard the Phillip Morris company was paying around $5 mil a year for the packaging rights to pot if it ever becomes legal. <br>  <br> Gralal Kindersoul <br> 65 Pally of Tribal Faith

				$10 for a joint? thats insane.  It better be damn fat, like Swishersweet blunt sized.  <br>  <br>  <br> The tax revenue increase due to a legalized marijauna market would be huge. Think about it, what would it cost to produce a pack of MJ cigs, 35 cents? sell them for $20 and people would still buy it like hot cakes.  Treat it like hard liqour production so its against the law for people to make it on thier own. The politicians of the US should learn from the past failures of huge empires.  The number one reason for most failed empires is its inability to generate a steady influx of tax revenue which usually was hampered by defense expenditures.   <br>  <br>  So what if you dont think its &quot;moral&quot;, dont smoke <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span>, laugh at the people who do when your paying 65cents for a gallon of gas because the Government dont need to tax the <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span> out of it anymore.    <br>  <br>  <br> Most of the people who oppose MJ legalization are the people who would benefit most, clowns that still work and live on farms.  These people are so ignorant, all they do is bitch to politicians for more money because they cant make a living growing corn or soy anymore.  What they hell do they want the government to do about it?  Regulate grain prices?  Well they can move to the Ukrain, Cuba or China if they want that.  I say put a new cash crop out there and let the whiney bitchs grow the stuff so they can make over 12 grand a year.

				I think that the government wouldn't legalize all drugs. Especially ones found to be highly dangerous. There are some supporting facts which make Marijuana the &quot;lesser&quot; of evils, however there are other more.. &quot;effective?&quot; drugs out there that could easily harm a user. <br>  <br> While you may think that having all drugs legal, there are some legal ramifications as well as financial ones I don't think you've considered. <br>  <br> As it stands now we are supporting drug user's rehibilitation and habits while it is illegal. <br>  <br> Now lets assume for a minute that all drugs were made legal. In this day and age you're going to have someone buy x drug from the government. Despite ANY surgeon general's warning or any &quot;warning you might die if you're stupid or become addicted like a moron&quot; if any person purchased drugs from the government and\or pharmaseutical company and suffered some kind of side effect, allergic reaction, overdose, or probably even just got the sniffles, the seller would be sued. <br>  <br> There would be many lawsuits going on and after the precedent was set with tobacco and how states like California and Florida have taken out just normal cigarette smoking, I have a feeling that no country in their right mind wants <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span> like that going on. <br>  <br> In the meantime the drugs become more widely available. You'd have people spending all their money on drugs, more people becoming addicts and <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span> their lives (Look how easiy it happened for just a few in EQ and how many regret ever playing.. And that is just out of a few hundred thousand people) Now imagine something so addicted is released to the entire US population. <br>  <br> Some side effects may be that we end up paying more tax money (or whatever is generated from drug sales) supporting the new addicts, their habits, and even hospital bills. Imagine how many people *may* be freaking stupid and commit their life to just doing drugs.  <br>  <br> Now you might say that just a few people here and there doing it won't screw up the system, but the system has to pay for it. <br>  <br>  <br> I personally don't feel drugs should be legallized. I can't even stand having to walk through that giant ball of smoke that hovers outside of stores where people stand outside smoking because it makes me feel like I am suffocating and cannot breath.   <br>  <br> I don't think I like the idea of having to drive through college traffic with crazy ass high mofos on the road with me, drunkards, rednecks, and old people are more than enough obstacles to avoid. <br>  <br> I guess to you Rrail, and even others the idea may sound good on paper, but the ramifications that could happen even in the tiniest degree are too much for me, and hopefully too much for our government to ever consider legalizing drugs.

				Like I said, I can see marijuana...  But I don't see companies lining up to seel crack.  It just isn't a 'win' for them. <br>  <br> Also, the majority of problems associated with Drug Abuse stem from how people's lives go to crap and they become petty criminals on the underbelly of society. <br>  <br> I don't see how legalized heroin could avoid that.  In fact, it is so dangerous that they would probably have to have a doctor freaking inject it for you. <br>  <br> Good idea in principle, but what it does is try to take the social burden off the Government's Plate and foist it on Business.  &quot;Hey, we can't do anything about this, why don't you guys try to make money off it in a half-baked attempt to remove the criminal allure.&quot; <br>  <br> Now, I don't buy or sell drugs, so I don't know the details, but I cannot imagine that a Legalized Product of Heroin could be produced and distributed more cheaply than the criminals can do it, which to me seems key to removing the criminal choke hold.

				Then you'd be wrong.   A very popular soft drink known as Coca-Cola had a coca leaf derivative in it.  Just about every patent medicine available had three ingredients in varying proportions:  Alcohol, opiates, and coca derivatives.  Most medicine cabinets had some laudanum or absinthe in them.  Any drug store in any town in the country would sell you cocaine or opiates over the counter just a few feet away from the soda fountain where they sold delicious egg creams and phosphate drinks.  And no, Rrail, that isn't from personal experience, you half-hatched egg!  <img src="/images/faces/silly.gif" border=0 alt="silly.gif" height=16 hspace=0 width=18 vspace=0>  <br>

				Crack is the unrefined version of the drug Freebase. Freebase only has 147 confirmed deaths across the country. So what's wrong with crack? Only that it is unrefined because it is a STREET DRUG produced in some trashy guys apartment. With the legalization and commercilization of drugs, crack would no longer exist, only freebase, and I believe 147 deaths is pretty goddamn low for any mind altering substance.

				Go with the system in the netherlands, decriminalize lighter drugs like Marijuana and offer treatment instead of prison time for the harder drugs.  Imprisoning someone who possesses drugs only serves one purpose.  Put them in prison so we don't have to deal with them in society.  While in prison, they get little to no treatment and are thrown into an environment that is likely MORE drug saturated than the one they came from.  When they get out, they're often no better, or are even worse than when they went in. <br>  <br> Our prison population is bulging at the seams with non-violent drug offenders.  End users of the drugs and in most circumstances, no more a detriment to society with the drugs than without. <br>  <br> If you want to slow the trafficking of drugs, you have to deal with demand.  Putting a bunch of people in prison with no treatment doesn't do that.  It just focuses the demand in one area. <br>  <br> Treat marijuana like alcohol or tobacco, regulate its' production, marketing and trade.  Make it illegal to be under it's influence while handling dangerous equipment like it is with alcohol.  Allow people to grow their own plants with the stipulation that they use it only for themselves and do not sell it.  (People who are too lazy to cultivate it would probably rather buy it commercially anyway) <br>  <br> The ad campaigns seem to be particularily aimed at marijuana use.  Stating that the drug makes you shirk your responsibilities and endangers those around you.  Which is designed to scare people into thinking that marijuana is just as bad as heroin and cocaine. <br>  <br> The stream of consciousness is brought to you by Ycarus Stoutfeather.  (and no, I'm not stoned)

				Legalizing drugs raises alot of serious questions. <br>  <br> 1. How much can a person buy? If they put a limit on it, people will still grow/buy their own.  A limit is also going to create the situation where people that dont use drugs will be buying them and then selling to the people that do.  The idea that people can buy as much as they want scares the hell out of me. <br>  <br> 2. Where are people going to go to buy?  I hear people say all the time it should be legalized and sold at liquor and convenience stores.  These places already get robbed alot as it is, and i think most people working at these places arent going to want to sell narcotics or even just dope. <br>  <br> 3. Where can you smoke/use at?  I cant stand being around smokers, i sure as hell dont want to go to a football game and sit behind some stoners. <br>  <br> 4. How much of a impact will it have on employers? <br>  <br>  <br> The war on drugs is a total failure, but thats because the government treats dealers and addicts with kid gloves.  Dealers should get a bullet in the head, not a slap on the wrist.  Addicts shouldnt be treated like they are victims.

				Since the federal government claims to regulate all American commerce, those two sentences are semantically identical.  They didn't get Al Capone for murder or bootlegging, they got him for income tax evasion.  It isn't illegal to buy or sell marijuana in this country, only to buy or sell marijuana WITHOUT A TAX STAMP, which the federal government refuses to issue for any price.  The federal government is not authorized by the Constitution to make laws outlawing any particular herb, so they use the &quot;commerce&quot; clause to regulate that herb so tightly that there is no way to buy or sell it without violating federal tax laws.  Yes, Virginia, the federal government treats marijuana dealing as a tax violation. <br>   <br> Learn a little bit about this country's laws, for Pete's sake. <br>
