				Thank you all that attended Sunday. Thou a failure, I see it a success in the knowledge that was gained by all. I will post an updated epic loot list later today. <br>  <br> This in mind, I am hosting a Raid on Lord Nagafen in Sol B on the Dates Indicated.  <br>  <br> Raid Leader: Axeminster  <br> Asst RL: Toado  <br>  <br> CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THIS POST!! PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE POST SO THAT YOU ARE INFORMED.  <br>  <br> WHERE: Meeting place is the Druid circle in Lavastorm. ** MAKE EVERY ATTEMPT TO BE THERE HALF AN HOUR EARLY - I WILL CALL THE RAID IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS AND GROUPS COMPLETED**  <br>  <br> LEVEL REQUIREMENT: Only levels 47 to 52 will be accepted except in extreme cases of class rarity, when we MAY take the following down to level 44: Enchanters, Magicians, Clerics, Shamans and Druids. We have had many attending lately that are level 45 - ***please understand that the RLs have the right to refuse your attendance if necessary.*** Using the phrase &quot;but so-and-so got to go last week&quot; does not hold water. Each raid is different.  <br>  <br> ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT: Naggy has indeed changed so our numbers must change with it. Less than 5 full groups used to cut it; not anymore. **We must have at least 30 people or I will not do this raid. Period. And no, the two people that are just in channel listening in don't count. The person coming down to buff us and then gate doesn't count.** We also need at LEAST 2 bards and I would like to go in with 1 enchanter. Charming giants is the key to success atm; I wish to take no chances.  <br>  <br> RESISTS: Everyone attending should have 80 (not 75 anymore)Magic Resistance and 100 Fire Resistance **unbuffed**. Nagafen can only attack one person at a time, his real damage comes from the 500 point AoE. If you do not have the gear you may not get grouped. **Get resist gear people!! - I will call the raid if the members do not have the gear before we even go into the lair. Group leaders will be checking, as will I.**  <br>  <br> SIGN UPS: Please sign up with character name, class and level if you can come. It will make assigning groups much quicker, and if you both sign up and show up on time you will receive preferential treatment for getting a group.  <br>  <br> COMMUNICATIONS:  <br> Raid Channel: NaggyRaid  <br> Pullers and Bards: Nagpull  <br> RL, GLs, Buffers: NaggyOps (2)  <br> Paladins: Pallychat (3)  <br> Bards/Warriors: Redscale (3)  <br>  <br> Speak in the NaggyRaid Channel ONLY. RAID SPEAK IS FOR THE RAID LEADERSHIP to use and it would be best if your /rs colors are brighter than your /1 chat channel colors. All your instructions will come from Raid Speak. Don't clutter it up with chat please.  <br>  <br> THINGS TO KNOW: READ THIS PLEASE - DO NOT ASK THE RLs ABOUT IT DURING THE RAID!!  <br>  <br> LARGE RACES must be able to SHRINK themselves. Please bring with you a shrink potion, as we work in tight quarters sometimes.  <br>  <br> THE FOLLOWING RAIDING RULES APPLY:  <br>  <br> 1. Please follow directions given in Raid Speak by MT, raid leadership, and your friendly buffers.  <br>  <br> 2. When in doubt about anything be it buffing, loot policies, etc. ask your GROUP LEADER first. If they do not have your answer they will get it for you. Just remember group chat is your friend. We will mix the groups so that you have people along with you who have dragon raiding experience  <br>  <br> 3. Do Not Send Tells to the MT/PULL TEAM/RAID LEADER or ASST RAID LEADER. By minimizing tells to raid leaders things will run much more smoothly and quicker.  <br>  <br> 4. Speak in the NaggyRaid Channel ONLY. RAID SPEAK IS FOR THE RAID LEADERSHIP to use. All your instructions will come from Raid Speak. Don't clutter it up with chat.  <br>  <br> RAID COSTS: To alleviate some of the raid costs any donations of plat or peridots would be greatly appreciated. There is no standard number, just if you can afford to bring a few, it would be helpful.  <br>  <br> BUFFING: Buffing is such a wonderful thing in the land of Norrath. Many classes are blessed with the ability to buff entire groups at one time. There is something that allows you to buff an entire group other than your own **without being in that other group.** It is called /targetgroupbuff. When you need to buff a group different than your own with a group spell, simply type &quot;/tgb on&quot;... you will then be allowed to cast on groups. USE THIS TOOL !!!  <br>  <br> LOOT RULES:  <br> First and most important rule is that epic pieces are given out as per lists. We will NEVER random an epic drop on one of our raids unless there is no other choice. They are entirely too difficult to get, and people work hard to get listed. These are the torn burnt book for paladins and the red scales for both bards and warriors.  <br>  <br> If an item is only usable by one class, it will be randomed to those of the appropriate class who have not won it on Nagafen before. Ex: Selo's Drums of the March - bard  <br>  <br> Items with additional limitations are as follows:  <br>  <br> Polished Mithril Mask - all pure casters (necro, wizard, mage, enchanter, druid, cleric and shaman)  <br> Polished Mithril Torque - paladins, shadowknights, rangers, bards, beastlords  <br> Orb of Tishan - Necros, wizards, mages, enchanters  <br> Crown of King Tranix - all pure casters (necro, wizard, mage, enchanter, druid, cleric and shaman)  <br> Dormant crystal sphere - Karana druids and clerics  <br> Crystalline orb - shadowknights  <br> Treasure Hunter's Satchel - monks  <br> **Cloak of Flames - SEE PARAGRAPH BELOW**  <br> Gauntlets of Fiery Might - melees  <br> Mithril vambraces and greaves - melees  <br>  <br> **Cloak of Flames will now be run using a point system. Everyone in attendance receives one point per raid. The person with the most points will receive the CoF. If multiple CoF's drop they will go to the next person on the list. All ties will be settled by randoming. At first we will be randoming a lot I would imagine but it will work itself out. Hopefully this will encourage more clerics and other neccessary classes to attend.**  <br>  <br> Except for epic or no drop pieces, loot that drops in multiples will have the second randomed to everyone on the raid who has not yet won it, even if it is normally restricted by us to certain classes. Also, if there is nobody of the restricted class in need, a piece of loot will be randomed to all who can use.  <br>  <br> Excluding the polished mithril mask, polished mithril torque, razing sword of Skarlon, and dormant crystal sphere, once you win a piece of loot at the raid you may not win another that night. We will let you know every piece to be rolled on before any rolling is actually done. We will roll best piece first. This way you won't for example win a gold plated koshigatana and miss out on a CoF. It is hoped that more people have a chance of winning something by doing it this way, but that those who want to roll on a no drop item (which must of course be dealt with immediately) will not be penalized later in the raid. If you have won an item listed above from us, you cannot roll and win it again at our raids.  <br>  <br> It may seem silly to even have to say this, but believe it or not the question comes up. If you are awarded an epic piece, you may not roll on any other loot. The epic pieces will be given out before anything is rolled on.  <br>  <br> Epic Lists Will Be Posted Separately.  <br>  <br> Hope to see you there!  <br>  <br> Axeminster <br> 52 Paladin <br> Kinghts of the Holy Blade <br>  <br> P.S. Raabyn, my apologies for not stopping by to get your piece on the way up. We will get it for you tuesday.

				Shassiash 51 possibly 52 by raid Bard, needs Red Scale for epic. <br>  <br> I will have my necro parked at the entrance, and at some point possibly move her in further and perma camp her there for raids. <br>  <br> Any-which-way we do it, I suggest everyone bring a Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin.  Depending on your charisma it can cost as low as about 70pp.  They should be given to Axeminster and he will keep track of who brings them and who's are used.  If you don't have a coffin you will not be getting your corpse conjured.  Remember, Necro CR is fast and easy, and 70pp is better than multiple wipes, or lost gear. <br>  <br> The only sad thing is that I cannot do a conjure corpse on my bard, someone will have to drag her to safety if all goes bad.  For the person who does my CR for Shassiash I will front the TJIC if they need a CR.

				Axe, sorry I didn't make it last night.  I wasn't feeling so well; won't go into details.  Needless to say, I didn't game yesterday other than to log on for 10 min around 5pm, and promptly camped. <br>  <br> If I had tried it would not have been a good idea, I can't concentrate when I'm feeling like this.
