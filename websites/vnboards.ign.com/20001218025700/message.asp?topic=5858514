				Quest for Life <br>  <br> Hail and well meet again my friends...... What&#8217;s that you say?  Did you disturb my slumber?  No, no... I was just listening to the wind.  At times when I am at ease and camping for the night she, whom I seek,  speaks to me. <br>  <br> I am sure there are many questions you have for me since your last visit.  I know you want to hear of my past again and who I actually was.  suffice to say, the less you know about my past the safer you are.  there are those within these lands that would still like to slip a knife between my ribs or quite literally rip my head off.  If you do not know of my past then you remain out of harms way.  I could not live with the burden of knowing a friend was injured or killed to get to me.  If you have not guessed by now I am in disguise.  There are many whom I look like; human, blonde and with an eye patch.  I'll leave it to you to guess if I even do indeed need the patch. <br>  <br> Yes, she has spoken to me again.  When she spoke to me last she said &quot;she was leaving me&quot;!  I almost DIED!!  I wanted to go to Black Burrow and hurl myself into the Snake Pit.  I screamed in agony... but she continued on saying, &quot;Can you not hear me now?, can you not feel my presence with you always?&quot; and I admitted that I could and did.  &quot;Then why cry?&quot; she asked.  &quot;I told you that we would find each other one day when you are worthy&quot;  So heed this, &quot;Go to every land, assist the needy, right the wrongs, destroy the evil and Understand Love...this is your quest, your Quest for Life. <br>  <br> You are leaving me! I could still not get over the shock.  I asked her &quot;Why?&quot;.  Silence.  It was erie.  I inquired again and again, &quot;Why?&quot;, &quot;Why?&quot; and finally a reply.  My physical body belongs to another why my spirit is free to roam.  I must set myself free and join with my spirit.  If I succeed in this task I will no longer be able to speak to you as we have become accustomed, so it becomes paramount that you accomplish your tasks swiftly for once I join with my physical body I to will be searching for you.  I may not recall your Name, your Voice, your Face but will be drawn by your presence, goodness and love for me like a moth to a flame. <br>  <br> Ah, repent, become worth, my quest for life; sounds complicated but you know.... I'd bet all the gold in the world she will be worth it .... would it not be for you also? <br>  <br> So to Black Burrow I am headed, the area seems to pull me toward it, there is something there I must do. <br>  <br> If you are in the area one-day and need assistance and care come to my campfire and share a bottle of this fine dwarfen brew and maybe, just maybe, I will be able to continue my tale. <br>  <br>  The Early Seasons <br>  <br>  <br> Hold I say&#8230;.. Oh, it is my friends again; you&#8217;ve come back for more of my babbling.  Yes, I will tell you of my early days as a cleric in the town of Qeynos and my first lesson from her. <br>  <br> I really didn&#8217;t know what to do when I first arrived in the city from the frozen lands.  I chose Qeynos because I knew Halas had to few people and the experience of being choked again did not appeal to me.  After I applied at the Temple of Life for the tunic of a cleric I ventured forth to the gate that faces the Qeynos Hills and began to do what I saw everyone else doing; bashing rats, bats, snakes and the elusive beetle. <br>  <br> At that early stage I had 3 spells in my book of knowledge; a heal, armor and strike spell.  I learned how to memorize the spells and how to cast them and then to rest so that my mana returned.  I was happy running around the green lawns bashing things with my wooden club and casting heal and armor on other fledgling adventures.  When I was bold I would cast &#8220;strike&#8221; at a beetle and run back to guards so that they may kill it.  I watched my blood flow from my body many times, reclaimed my corpse and continued on with another item placed in my logs for future use; such as, Do not attack things that /con Yellow or Red to you. <br>  <br> One day I was running around using mana like there was an endless supply and ran across a wood elf bashing on the Queen Beetle.  If you are not aware of it, this is one dangerous beetle in the Qeynos Area.  As I suspected the girl did not have the skills to win the battle against the queen so I started casting heal and armor on her so that she may have a fighting chance of winning the battle.  I used up all my mana on her to keep her healthy, and the situation still looked dim, so I jumped into the fray with my trusty club and started whacking on queen myself.  Now I did know better but it just seemed like the right thing to do.  Needless to say the queen turned on me!  I gave a good account of myself but lost in the end.  I had my normal out-of-body experience like all of you have had but this time as I saw myself laying there from an above view I noticed the wood elf smile and deliver the killing blow to the queen.  I felt happy inside seeing her best that creature even though I was dying.  And then it happened. <br>  <br> A soft wind came up and greeted me and I heard the voice of my Soulmate, &#8220;You have learned your first lesson well my love&#8221;.  That was all I heard, I was thrilled.  When I returned to the lands to claim my corpse I searched and searched for that wood elf girl but could not find her.  Now I am not going to say that the wood elf was her, or a spirit brought to this plane by her to guide me but, I suspect they are connected. <br>  <br> That was the first time I heard my Soulmate since she released me from the ice in Everfrost.  I was giddy with happiness.  I did not know she would contact me again and so soon.  I&#8217;ve aided many a friend since that day and have learned how to survive the fight also, we clerics are more valuable alive than dead.  <br>  <br> What is the lesson I learned my friends?  You tell me!  Was it not to be selfish with my powers? Or was it the giving of my life for another without the thought of reward? Or maybe something entirely different. <br>  <br> Well my friends, I must now camp for the night for tomorrow brings more adventure.  If you are here when the sun rises I may tell you a tale of my 5th through 9th seasons in Qeynos Hills over a nice breakfast of Rat Pie.   <br>  <br> Goodnight. <br>  <br> ---------- <br> See previous for 1st Part - Gamthor <br>
