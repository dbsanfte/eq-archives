				I am here to dispell all the rumors about Test Server. Its high time people are told the TRUTH and not the lies that are constantly spread througout the system.  <br>  <br> Lie #1: Constant Server Wipes  <br>  <br> False. There has only been ONE server wipe in the 28 month history of Test Server since Everquest has gone live. This wipe occured after dragon loots where dropping off common dogs as common loot in Sol B and the server went into a frenzy and farmed them like mad. But the real reason the server was wiped was due to the fact of Bad policy and GM abuse. After Kunark Beta, MANY players had full Kunark armor/weapons on personal Play accounts given by rogue GM's/Staff. Also, when the server had a reset or a long crash, the rollback of a few hours resulted in EVERY character you ever had on Test showing up in your account as duped. Resulting is huge amounts of extra items, (ie Rubi BP's, COF's, Kunark Armors etc etc). This has all since been corrected with the Player Item Wipe on June 20th , 2000. Before and since that time, there have been NO wipes. Verant also stated that there will be NO wipes, though they reserve the right that they will not exercise.  <br>  <br> Lie #2 Daily Crashes  <br>  <br> False. These 'crashes' occur during regular business from 9 am PST to 6 pm PST for the most part, to bring the server down for code updates. This might effect a few European/Asian customers, but the benefit is far greater to them (see benefit #3) For the past year, Verant has given server warnings of impending downtimes 98% of the time. In general these downs are no more then 15 min in length. During Peak Times , 6PM PST - 2AM PST, the server almost NEVER goes down, with the acception of MAYBE the night before a major Patch to live servers (again see benefit #3 for why this is a GOOD thing) The benefit, ALL mobs and UBers REPOP, explained later.  <br>  <br> Lie #3 Verant Does not want a large population  <br>  <br> False. Verant would be tickled pink if Test server had 1000-1200 regular players. As it stands now, offpeak is 100-200 and Peak is 400-600 at best. Not nearly enough to test new code accurately. Hence the addition of the testeverquest.exe icon tot he Desktop with the release of Ruins of Kunark. They WANT you here, thats why the made it easier to get here with the Icon  <br>  <br> Lie #4 You cant get anything done on Test so why bother.  <br>  <br> False. Just log on and see all the level 60 players. See how all are in FULL kunark and most are now partially in Kael. (majority of 55+ are Pro-Dragon on Test at the moment). Every Dragon has been killed on test pretty much but TOV and Sleepers. Sleepers Tomb has been breeched and people are hunting there now too. TOV is farmed regular. ALL gear on Test is now obtained Legit, NO MORE GM gifting, or the GM is fired !!!  <br>  <br> Lie #5 We dont want you here.  <br>  <br> False. Sure, the 55+ DO NOT WANT you there. Why, because of simple GREED. They have realized that Test is a Candy Store. They can Farm Farm Farm and not have to worry about competition. Of coure they dont want anyone but them there, it cuts into the Twink farming.  <br>  <br> Benefits of Playing on Test Server  <br> ----------------------------------  <br>  <br> Benefit #1 Low Population  <br>  <br> General Population today is 100-200 offpeak and 400-600 Peak. Most zones have 2-5 persons in it at any time, popular Zones have 20-30 at the MOST. Lower Guk stand EMPTY most days !! If you play on Test, you will enjoy unlimted choice of Zones and camps !!! Even if my post generates people to play on Test, it still wont be a crowded server like Live servers. At Best, I might convince 200 more ppl to play here, still leaving Peak poplation below 1000!!  <br>  <br> Benefit #2  <br>  <br> Verant constantly is changing and updating Code. But when they make a mistake on items, they generally just make a new one, leaving the mistakes in the game on test only. Hence, Test Player have been able to obtain items, armor, spells that Live Servers will NEVER see.  <br>  <br> Benefit #3  <br>  <br> UBers - Ubers - Ubers  <br>  <br> Would you like to play on a Server where Venril Sathir pops EVERY day, sometimes 5-10 times a day? How about Trakanon, or Vox/Naggy? Sleepers Tomb? WW dragons?  <br>  <br> A few weeks ago a code change made it so ALL mobs poped on Server up. SO Klandicar, Lodizal, Zlandicar, Severilous, Talendor, Faydedar, Gorenaire, VeeshanPeak ... they all Poped DAILY. Sometimes 5-10 times a day !! Christmas Time on Test !!! Whoohooo.  <br> Eventually this code was replaced but for 2 weeks it was Bliss. Good thing is, this happens ALOT, so be prepared for the next round of Dragon Lotto !!  <br>  <br> Benefit #4  <br>  <br> NO WIPES !!! Period!!  <br>  <br> Verant has stated time and time again to many test regulars that Verant has no intention to EVER wipe Test Again !!  <br>  <br> The previous wipe created MANY problems in testing due to the lack of players and equipment. THERE WILL BE NO WIPES !!!  <br>  <br> Why do you think the regular players have all come back to Test? If they were in threat of wipe, do you think they would play for 300+ hours to get that phat L33T just to lose it??  <br>  <br> Wipe Rumors are perpetuated by the Test Players as a means to keep the population LOW. Its purely GREED driven !!!  <br>  <br> Summary  <br> ---------------------  <br>  <br> Test is a Server in the system that has low population and easy gameplay to obtain Loot. There will be NO WIPES, Verant WANTS people to play here. Higher level Players will attempt to disuade you from playing on the server by filling you with lies about wipes, 5 day downtimes or general nonsense to protect their 'Farming rights' on the server.  <br>  <br> Test Server can be accessed either from the Seperate Icon on your desktop (FURTHER EVIDENCE Verant WANTS you here by placing the icon on the desktop with Kunark's release) or by going into your EQ Directory and running -- testeverquest.exe  <br> Pathes are small and not too troublesome. For ease, and if you have HardDrive Space, eename your old MAIN eq directory to something else temporary, re-tinstall EQ. This cretaes a SECOND copy of EQ on the computer. Once done, rename the NEW copy TestEverquest (or anything else you chose) and change the OLD copy BACK to Everquest. NOW you can keep Live servers updated and no patcing back and forth, just run testeverquest.exe from the NEW copy for playing on Test only. Simple.  <br>  <br>  <br> So COME play on Test, its UTOPIA !! Its high time the population grows and Verant gets the people it wants for a population on Test. No more 120 people in East Commonlands or Greater Fay. Last night EC had 12 and GFay had 3 people.  <br>  <br> Enjoy the Game the way it was MEANT to be played. Good luck and I look forward to all the new faces on Test Server.  <br>  <br> ps .. No doubt Test players will get wind of this post and try to tell you otherwise. DONT let them lie here, they are just trying to scare you away like a animal scares a predator from its den of goodies. ALL talk, no Reality !!! After playing on Test for 28 months, im sick of the BS, GREED and LIES.  <br>  <br> Tell ALL your friends about what I have told you here, lets stop the Lies and have fun.

				First of all, we 55+ people have a hard enough time getting ENOUGH together for a massive, uber, raid. <br>  <br> Second, speaking of uber raids, we go up against mobs that have been patched and have to learn new strategies constantly in order to defeat them.  For live server players, they get word of these changes before they go live and already have the upper hand on how to implement the strategy that they will need to embrace in order for a victory. <br>  <br> Third, on the topic of we 55+ trying to keep others from coming to Test, that's entirely false.  The ones of us that do the regular testing really could care less about who comes, and who goes.  They would most likely never come in contact with the &quot;uber&quot; crowd as it might be put with the exception of one of us heading into town for some supplies. <br>  <br> Fourth, most 55+ players on Test are actually split.  Half are on Dragon faction, while the other half are on Giant faction.  There are also a few on Dwarf faction, but for the most part it's a split world. <br>  <br> And last, feel free to come play on Test.  Just keep in mind that when you play on Test, the server can and will be brought down without any warning in any form or faction.  You must remember to constantly trade-save, zone, etc. to keep your experience, and even your items.  Zoning has been known to &quot;eat&quot; items that cannot be replaced.  Also, we don't have any toys that live servers don't.  We don't have lightsabers or Cans o' Whoopass floating around. <br>  <br> Nice post by the way.  You seem pretty well versed on the way Test works. <br>  <br> ~Fal

				1. It's an almost no economy proddie server with about 1/3 of the population that goes down from between a couple to a bazillion times a week. True, they have lately been warning before taking it down. They used to just pull the plug. I would blame the clumsy night janitor for tripping over the cord in Test chat waiting for it to come up hehe.  <br> 2. Lewt Phrenzy abounds on Test just as it does on Prods, with the added requirement that if you want something, you will probably have to go get it yourself. No sitting around in E commons trying to buy it.  <br> 3. Having the Ubers re-pop after server down is an added bonus for putting up with the no-warning drops, though it can mess up someone's plan for an epic piece if the spawns are linked to another later one.   <br> 4. The people on test (for the most part) are usually more laid back and much friendlier than the average proddie and use much less dewd speak. Most can actually spell out &quot;can you sow me please?&quot; or &quot;can I please get a port to n ro&quot;. For some reason &quot;u&quot; and &quot;plz&quot; turns me off in a big way... <br> 5. Your reputation will follow you around. In a small population such as this, screwing one person over can have huge repercussions for you. Especially if they are well-known on the server and well-liked.   <br>  <br> These are the differences as I see them. If that environment is what you want and you think you would enjoy that, it is the ideal place for you.   <br>   <br> I played there for about 20 months, and I have to admit I liked it. Even with the no-warning server drops. You quickly learn to hard-save, and very seldom does it screw you. It can be hard to get a group at times though. Not because no one wants your class, but because there is only you in the zone heh.  <br>  <br> My problem, and why I ended up moving, was that I got tired very quickly of the mad house loot politics at high levels. I moved to prod and joined an RP guild (no I did not move characters, that is not allowed from Test). I have goofed off with them on and off over the past several months, and had a lot of fun again. I even  experimented with the economy on Prods, finding it intriguing at first. Very quickly I saw how stupid it could get. 2pp for a stack of bat wings LMAO. And people actually SELLING CB belts and not turning them in or simply dropping them on the ground? /boggle  <br>  <br> Hehe and no, there are not any special goodies that fall through test loop holes. If anyone on test server has an item, it is available on a proddie and probably has been sold and re-sold numerous times in E. Commons or G Fay by the time anyone on Test gets it. Same world, same gear. They do throw the changes proposed in Test Server and test them, such as adding triple attack to rangers then taking it away. So it is possible you will get to play with an ability no one else on proddie will ever have before they nerf-bat you <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0"> .   <br>  <br> Oh and another thing. Some feel they are Test Elites. By this I mean you will encounter at one time or another a person who feel that because they are kissin some person at Verant's butt that they deserve some sorta kewpie doll. My advice is remember they are players just like you, laugh behind your hand at them, /ignore them, test what you want to test and pharm what you want to pharm. <br>   <br> I now play on the RP server, hoping that it does not become another proddie/test madhouse of people scrambling around to be level 60 first and have the first Uber_Item_001.  <br>  <br> This is a perfect world to and cows can fly. Oh wait, was that sarcasm... <br>  <br> Istvan Planedrifter (mostly retired) <br> /wave  <br> Falamon! Is that you, you silly half elf? Gathos here. Oops I just gave away my FV name!

				wow hehe sound like this server is the one I should have started in.  I have a 30 pally on the torvonnilous server and I would try out the test server but I'm the kinda guy that has to know some one on the server to play that way I can get a little help when needed.  I also like to share things with people kinda hard to do when your level 1 Everyone mistakes you for begging and trust me I HATE beggers. So why start a new guy now ?????  If I could find someone on the Test server to Twink me uber then I would join hehe just to learn some new stuff and play the game but for now my Main lies on the torvonnilous server.  I'll check this post later and hopeful someone has replyed to me and willing to help me! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> * FYI don't take me the wrong way I'm not always looking for help... I started with Jack SH*T on my 30 pally and I didn't start getting nice stuff til I found out my RL friend was on the same server ( 3 months after I have had the game)  and that wasn't till I was lvl 25. I have seem to learn alot about the game but I know there is a hell alot more to learn I just like to have help on the test server Twinking my char. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> So come on people how hard is it if your lvl 55+ and there are no people so you have all the good stuff why sell when you can help a pal out like me hehe <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> PS* my name is nottom soulbottom of the torvonnilous send a tell some time and tell me were you have heard of me I have a bad memory! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>
