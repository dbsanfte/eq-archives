				Im just curious to see what all eq exp people here have. Ill start. I started EQ a little after release, started on Povar with my barbie warrior Renxerox. My friends that played told me to play a warrior as they were the easist class to play, in order to learn the game. I leveled up to like.. 5-6 then made the scariest run of my life from Halas to  Freeport. I think it took is like an hour and a half and I died a few times, but we got there eventually. <br>  <br> Ren on Povar was &quot;uber&quot;, I had full bronze and a combine magic sword! woot! went on the first &quot;guk raids&quot; where you had 70 people in King trying to take a wack at him. Was on Povar for the great Triton/Harmonium wars and the great split as Povar was the last of original servers to split (if I remember right). My guild was devestated as half our members left for xev or what ever the other server was. Made various alts and tooled around for awhile... <br>  <br> Fast forward a tad, Im bored. I got bored with EQ the game probably 2-3 months after I got it, only thing that really kept me playing was in game friends, but I had a buddy at work that played and told me to give PVP a shot so I moved to Vallon Zek and started Renxerox the DE necro. One of the most memorable and fun times Ive had in EQ was going to a PVP server. The drama and intensity was unmatched on a blue server. By this time Kunark was out and Velious was looming in the distance. I leveled my necro on Vallon to 55 and PKed full time. At this time the xteaming was reaching an all time high and being a pure team dark player became pretty much suicide. Fighting off lighties while having evils heal against you that you couldnt kill sorta took the spark out of PVP for me. <br>  <br> Then they released Sullon Zek. Honestly the penicle of my gaming career. I started on Sullon day one and those were easily the most fun days EVER of playing EQ. Huge wars in the commons and a no rules, no holds bar server with no PNP and no GM interventions. Talk about dog eat dog world, every minute you logged in was simply INTENSE. Every dreg a-hole POS from every server in EQ filled up sullon zek (as well is normal and honorable players mind you, and it made for an interesting mix) and the war was on. Just leveling and the paranoya (sp) you had made the game exciting. No place was safe, there was no pvp free zones, they only way to escape was to log off. Even as a DE, noots and goods would do the wine quest and get ally faction and nek and we would have huge battles inside the city itself. (nothing better than pking someone and looting their coin at THEIR bank, then depositing the money right there lol) <br>  <br> Ive got 2 accounts only and characters on 5 servers, povar/AR/stromm/vallon/sullon, The characters Ive played to 65 are SK, Warrior, Shammie, rogue, necro, cleric, monk. Ive played almost every other class to at least 50, and the classes I have never played are bard and wizard. The 2 classes that are my mains that Ive played the longest and know the best are rogue and necro, those are really the only 2 I play now and I box them together (gogo dps classes!) <br>  <br> Ive watched the evolution of EQ, watched the &quot;balancing&quot; acts and the deterioration of EQ (in some regaurds) and also some great things happen for the game. Its been quite a ride =)  <br>  <br> So thats my history in a nut shell. Sorry for any spell errors I suck at spelling.. <br>  <br> whats yours?

				Well, I got the game xmass of 1999. Even though I played D&amp;D a little bit I was clueless really on how to start. But I knew I wanted to be a melee class so I choose warrior. Name was &quot;Rones&quot; Human and started in Freeport.  <br>  <br> lol the very first thing I did after entering the game for the first time was try to talk to a guard. Of course not 2 seconds later after I hit the &quot;a&quot; key I died. Didn't even realize what happened. Another funny thing I remember running around the newbie area for the first time was random people buffing me. Only I seen these symbols on me screen and thought they where attacking me. So I would hide lol.. <br>  <br> Anyway, after playing my warrior up to level 7 I decided that I liked the warrior but also wanted to cast spells. Some people suggested maybe I play a Paladin and by this time my wife had gotten interested in playing and started a High Elf Enchanter. So I made a Dwarf Paladin. We both started hunting together around Orc Hill and CB. Fun Fun times. The addiction had started. On weekends playing ALL day till sunrise the next mornings and calling out of work sometimes during the week to play. <br>  <br> Well, shortly after playing we made a few friends and I had a problem with my Dwarf Paladin during a server crash. He got deleted at about level 8. A Weeks worth of work gone.(yes a week to get to level 8) Well its at this time I started another Paladin. Diminion Half Elf Paladin named after Minion from Twisted Metal. Who was my main up until when I quit a month ago.  <br>  <br> Well one of the friends we had made got me and my wife into our first guild at about lvl 10. Dog Soldiers was the guild. It was created by 10 friends in college. Very small guild and stayed that way for years. We didn't recruit. The only way to get in was to be a RL friend or a really good friend in game. I made most of my long time friends from EQ out of this guild. Some I will be and are friends with even now out of game. <br>  <br> Ok, its at about this time we decided we wanted to really start exploring. We took a trip from Gfay to Erudin. Amazingly didn't die until the boat trip from Qeynos to Eurdin. We decided to get off at Wisp Island but decided late and had to jump off the boat. Lol well the sharks got us.  <br>  <br> Hunted in and around Qeynos, Halas and the Karanas for a little while and I have my best memories from being a newbie during this time. One I'll never forget was saving and trying to get a magical weapon from the gypsies in North Karana. I think I died 3 times and had to run from Qeynos each time befor I finially got one and safely back. <br>  <br> Well started meeting more people and making more friends at about level 19 my group headed to Unrest. What a great time we had their. That zone was scary. Then onto Permafrost then Cazic-Thule, then Sol A. We explored everywhere. <br>  <br> Kunark came out and then Velious. Me and my wife took some breaks from the game at this time off and on. I level from about level 26 to 40 during this time in Kunark and Velious later. I started making alts. My Cleric and Rogue specificly. Got serious again with my main and went to Lguk at lvl 40. It was time for an FBSS. Leveled in Lguk most of my 50's. Got my FBSS at level 48 I belive. Then after 2 years I finially reached level 50. <br>  <br> Well at some point around then Luclin came out. Dog Soldiers finialy spit up after about 2.5 years and 3 major leadership changes. Most of the originaly members where gone. I think I was level 54 I joined my second guild Rising Legacy(I was in another guild for about 2 weeks but it had a break up too) this was a bigger guild. One of the upper raiding guilds on the server for the time. I got to see Vox/Naggy the planes and kunark dragons. Then Velious dragons and kael. I had alot of fun and got to see so much during that year. <br>  <br> After a year this guild had a falling out which led me onto another bigger guild which I was able to hunt and see everything up till PoTime. <br>  <br> There was a point in time after me leaving my first guild and being level 51ish I got very bored. Started makeing more alts. Did the KV thing on Sullon with the regulars from this Message board. Think my Warrior is level 28 on Sullon.  <br>  <br> I almost quit my Paladin altogether around this time. <br>  <br> I feel I'm very lucky. I got to see 90% of the game from almost the beginning till about 2 months ago. Explored most everywhere, did many quests. Made many friends. Had many laughs. Played every class escept BST. Had so much fun most of the time you didn't want to log off. I wish I could get that feeling again. <br>  <br> I don't have many regrets. Bottom line what kept me playing so long is the friends I made. Its what made EQ great. The mature people you met and had to team with in order to do stuff. Unfortunatly the changes over the years have distroyed this atmosphere. Not that EQ isn't a good game anymore. Its just not the same.  <br>  <br> I think if these new games coming out don't focus on makeing a good game for a certain type of audiance that requires team work to succeed they won't have the lasting power EQ had.  <br>  <br>  <br>

				I played in open beta in 1999... I quit UO to concentrate on EQ. I started a warrior until beta ended. HAve many great memories, including kamikaze griffons attacking Freeport.  <br>  <br> On release, I wanted to try something new.. So I made a troll shaman, and proceeed to dump max points into Charisma. Her name was Fwok, which lasted a day or two until a guide made me change it. Frolak is now level 57, and the prettiest troll there is <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/4.gif" border="0" alt="grin" hspace="0" vspace="0">  <br>  <br> I have played a few other MMORPGs, but I always come back to EQ. In the past I began to two-box, to add more excitement to my game, and also more challenge. I started a barbarian warrior and a halfie druid and got them both up to 54 before the duo jjust became unmanageable.  <br>  <br> Then I started to three-box. I made a dark elf cleric, dar elf enchanter, and a dark elf warrior. Going was slow, dividing all experience three ways.. So I started 4-boxing, using my high level druid to buff the lowbies. <br>  <br> Playing multiple accounts is still my favorite avenue with EQ. Sometimes I play just two, like when Berserkers beame a playable class, I PLed a Berserker to 55 with my druid... I was the 2nd quickest to 50. #1 was run by a guild and that Zerker was on 24/7. At 50 I had to three-box, so I played my druid, a shaman, and the Berserker.. Got him to 55, before I wanted a new challenge.  <br>  <br> Now I 4-box 4 Beastlords. Going is REALLY slow, but incredibly safe. Four pets and 4 hybrid tanks is a damn fun, challenging experience for me. They are only lvl 31 so far, because I don't have as much time to play as I used to.  <br>  <br> Whgen EQ2 comes out, I might drop the EQ accounts, and just play 1.. But I will probably go back to 4-boxing at some point.. I love a good challenge!

				My second life started March 17, 1999. <br>  <br> Before that date, I had a faily normal, peaceful and prosperous life.  Recently graduated college and landed my first job as a software engineer.  Exciting times. <br>  <br> Then a good friend of mine was talking about this game we was beta testing called Everquest.  I was a huge fan of AD&amp;D ... still played it on occasion.   I loved computers and computer games, and fantasy, so this game sounded really cool.  I worked late the date it realeased, but the next day I went to the mall and bought it. <br>  <br> I never had an addiction before then.  Addiction is a strange thing really -- you are conscience of your addiction and how bad it is for you, but damn if it doesn't feel so good. <br>  <br> Kruin, a Dark Elf ShadowKnight on the Tunare server.  Probably the absolute worst choice for my MTV-generation lack of attention span.  Slow Slow level.  Never played a MMORPG before then, so I wasn't acustomened to this whole Grind thing. <br>  <br> The rest is a sad story you've heard a bazillion times.

				My first MMORPG was a text MUD Gemstone 3. That game was so screwed up that when word about a new game Everquest was floating on the net, I looked forward to it with great anticipation.  One of my Gemstone friends got into EQ beta, so on the day EQ opened, he took me to gnome city, and I followed him around, laughing my head off at the size of his huge ears while knowing I looked just like him.  We ran to hunt the newbie zone and I lost sight of him, turned around and saw these merry looking tents with some cute little bear-like creatures standing on their back legs, and thought to myself wow friendly merchants probably selling good stuff.  Ran toward them and boom they all lunged at me.  I died.  Loading&#8230; please wait.  I was level 2 and lost all of my items, and my friend sighed and told me there was no way we could get my body from beneath the feet of those kobalds. <br>  <br> Then I made a high elf mage whose chief trait that I wanted to roleplay was a daydreamer, living in his own world of conjuration.  Meanwhile another Gemstone friend came to EQ and picked druid as his class.  His half elf druid zoomed to level 16 because, as he said, leveling was easy in Paw where he could kill lots of gnolls (this was before Paw was revamped into being higher level.   Then he ran to visit us in Felwithe and frowned at our little island, and told us Antonica was a much better place.  He dumped us within a night and returned to Antonica. <br>  <br> While I was showing him around the dock of Butcherblock, an aqua goblin came out to attack us.  My mage was only 10th, and my big strong 16th druid friend healed my arse when I was about dead.   I trashed my mage, and copycat that I was, made myself a half elf druid too.  Moved to Qeynos and tried to grow up in Karana, and hated it.  I missed the little island and decided to reroll into a wood elf druid.  And loved growing up around Kelethin. <br>  <br> My friends from Gemstone became busy in rl.  I was always shy and soloed wit my druid.  By the time my druid was in his 30s, the long downtime in medding got to me, and I quit EQ to go to Dark Age of Camelot.  Big mistake.   Quit DaoC in about 2 months and took a long break from MMORPG.  One day I was browsing the EQ boards, and wrote a post about how I would never go back to EQ again unless the downtime for medding was reduced.  This guy answered saying, &#8220;If you grouped, there isn&#8217;t any downtime.&#8221; <br>  <br> Oh really?  So I went to try EQ again.  By God he was right.  This was my return to EQ. There is still so much to learn and to do in EQ for me.  I like doing things slowly.  EQ is a great time sink, but I think it&#8217;s one awesome hobby.  A friend of mine in rl told me she was worried about my &#8220;addiction&#8221; when she read about how a boy committed suicide.  I told her, &#8220;Hey, people who watch TV 4 hours a night are relaxing after work.  If one guy watched a sad episode and killed himself, do people blame TV watching for his suicide?  People who go golfing 2 hours a day are called sports enthusiasts.  If one guy got hit in the head by a flying ball and died, do people scream about how bad golfing is?  People like you who spend 4 hours a day gardening are called green thumbs.  You consider gardening a good, productive hobby.  But what about the gardening accidents?  Why is MMORPG getting all the bad rap?  I&#8217;ve run into countless intelligent players in these games.  These games are mathematical simulations of a fantasy world.  Discussing game mechanics has made me see how I can do mathematical formulas to simulate my investment portfolio, which is why I don&#8217;t have to work now.  And look at the political situations in the world.  The fantasy world is a venture into creating a new frontier that allows me to see earth like an alien from outer space might.  It opens up my eyes to a totally different system.  Many creative writers found an MMORPG the inspiration for their writing.  Many graphic artists created fantastic artwork based on these fantasies.  MMORPG is a wonderful hobby that broadens the mind and is much more intellectually stimulating than watching TV or gardening.&#8221;  She wrote me to apologize. Hehehe. <br>

				Heard about eq as a new upcoming fame in some magazine. Met someone in beta phase 2, when it was still 989 studios I believe, out of Menlo Park. He gave me a link to sign up, and I played on his until I got my own account in phase 3. <br>  <br> Started on Tarew Marr on release day, because it was 5th on the list, being least populated with 500 people, when the 4 above it already had 1000. <br>  <br> Got accepted as a guide the first week of release, gen 12, March 20 1999. Retired after 4 years on March 21 2003. <br>  <br> When Vallon/Tallon went live, I created a character on VZ, but still played on Tarew mostly, so just abandoned VZ. <br> When Sullon went live, I created a character, but was dismayed at how crowded it was, so never played it. 200 DE's trying to ks the single moss snake that had the misfortune to spawn. Then last year(?) created a good aligned monk there when others from this board started a good aligned guild. Lost interest again. <br>  <br> Now still on TM.

				I started playing shortly after kunark came out. My hubby had played for awhile and I hated the game.  One day while he was at work I decided to see what the big deal was.  I started a half elf war, got her to 16 and rerolled a druid.  I leveled her up to 36 and then started up a rogue on Xev and got her to 51 about the time luclin came out.  Luclin was so hard on my poor machine that I decided to quit and play DaoC which lasted for about a year and a half.  Then I bought a shiny new machine, came back and started a cleric on Tarew Marr with some DAoC friends and have been there ever since.  Got both my rogue and cleric to 65 and Time flagged.. yay <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">

				I first started shortely after Kunark came out.  I was playing AC at the time and wanted a change so I decided to see what all the hubub was about with this Everquest. <br>  <br> My first characters was a Dwarf Paladin.  I got him to about lvl 10 and went to Freeport.  Then I decided I wanted to go to Qeynos and ran all the way there with no problems.  This was when I found the Qeynos sewers and my problems began.  I accidently found the Necro guild and they didn't welcome me all that well being a paladin and all.  Had to have a necro loot my corpse and give me all my stuff.  Then I decided to run back to freeport.  On the way back I was running through the Karanas and was attacked by a ghoul.  It killed me and I gave up on EQ. <br>  <br> I came back about a year later.  Created a Barby Warrior.  Got him to lvl 19 and had alot of fun.  But I got tired of being stunned so I deleted him and created a Ogre Warrior.  He was a blast as well.  Went to Kunark and hunted in the Overthere.  Got him to 16.  Left EQ again to try a few other games that had come out.  ((Still playing AC this whole time)) <br>  <br> About a year after that I came back and recreated my Dwarf Paladin on Firiona Vie.  Got him up to about lvl 26 or so had joined a guild and was having a blast.  Then my guild one day just stopped logging in.  Got bored without a guild so I quit again and went back to AC. <br>  <br> About 6 months after that I came back and started playing my Paladin again.  Joined a new guild the Blackmaul Crusaders.  Had a blast and got him up to lvl 53.  At this point I got fed up with the forced grouping and always having to have a cleric in a group otherwise you were screwed or had huge downtimes.  Gave up EQ again. <br>  <br> Tried a new game but it sucked (Horizons).  Came back to EQ after about 6 months and tried recreating my Dwarf Paladin but my guild had been seriously gutted during my time off.  So I decided to created a Ogre Berserker.  Just hit 20 yesterday and joined a new evil rp guild House Sel'quar.  Been enjoying it even though the berserker does not seem to be all that wanted by groups.

				I started EQ a week after it went live. My friends kept telling me about this game, how much fun it was. So, I gave it a shot. <br>  <br> I still play to this day. During the 5+ years, I have quit about 4 times. Each time I quit, it was for a longer period of time. I would try another game (DAOC, AO, Shadowbane, AC1, Horizons) but would get bored and come back. I would level pretty fast on a new toon to 50 or so, then lose interest. The high end game just gets boring to me. I have had 2 accounts, one I sold to a friend, swearing I would NEVER come back to EQ (yeah, I know). <br>  <br> Barbarian Shaman was my first toon and a High Elf Cleric shall be my last. I play a ranger, too, sometimes. Mainly the cleric. I am putting a lot of faith in EQ2 making the high end game more to my liking...we shall see. If I play , then at least I will still be in the world of Norrath, just a few hundred years in the future.

				I am not in any MMORPG right now and still waiting for the next EQ to come out.  I hope EQ2 will be it. <br>  <br> Anyhow... <br>  <br> I can remember my first day in EQ like it was yesterday. <br>  <br> I made a Human druid out of surefall glade.  I had never really played many computer games and this was my first MMORPG.  I was absolutely awe struck!  I just stood there for several minutes going WOW!  My GF was with me since EQ was a birthday present and she was amazed also. <br>  <br> So I finally got moving and tried to find my way to this &quot;Newbie area&quot; I kept hearing about.  But nighttime in Surefall and being human meant that I kept running around the zone the entire night trying to find the way out.  It was quite an adventure but it was very fun stumbling around the area blind. <br>  <br> Day light finally came and I found the small cave that exited to the hunting area.  At this time I had made it to Qeynos and just scratched the surface of the huge Karana's.  My first group was sooo much fun.  I hunted for several days and finally got my druid to level 8 at which time I made the run to Freeport.  It was very scary and I got lost a few times.  I also remember dodging the giants in West commons that use to be outside of Befallen.  I dont think they are there anymore.  At about level 16 I finally decided that a druid was not for me and changed to a DE necro. <br>  <br> I got the necro to 44 and had a ton of fun with him.  I met a lot of friends who I still talk with today.  We had mud fights in L guk while waiting for matriarch to show her face.  We terrorized guards in Freeport and Rivervale.  I remember what a big deal it was when he got his first Damask Robe.  I camped in Befallen with friends all day to get it.  But I decided necro was not for me either.  I hated being a wimpy spell caster. <br>  <br> My first time in MMORPG and I could not get settled in to a class I liked. <br>  <br> Next I was in a sour mood so I made a Troll ShadowKnight named Bhone Nytblade.  I roleplayed this character as in a fun way and tried to be good but the situation always ended up bad.  He blamed Innoruuk for this, which was his god.  He would run in front of a wagon in order to save a small kitten only to have the  wagon vere off the road and then off a cliff killing all inside including the horses.  And of course only the guards saw a troll standing there scaring the horses into a paniced run.  He was also a gud cook for a troll and tried to invite people he met to Grobb to try his Goblin surprise or Minotaur eyeball soup...but could never figure out why everyone declined.  Gnomes seemed particularly quick to decline. <br>  <br> My fondest memory of Bhone was in Unrest.  I was fighting on the top floor.  That Hand thing had a force back spell and the fight took a turn for the worse.  My group was dropping like flies so I kept taunting like crazy to get its attention.  I did not realize it but I was backing towards the railing when the hand finally came after me.  I was nearly dead when it hit me with the force spell and I literally flew off the entire house and landed past the front porch and right on top of a poor low level gnome with a yellow robe.  I died as I hit the ground from fall damage and let out the typical trollish death rattle.  Can you imagine what that poor gnome was thinking when a huge troll in full plate armor drops from sky and died right on top of him?  It was my 6th death that night but I was laughing soo hard my stomach hurt. <br>  <br> Anyhow...at 54 I retired Bhone.  I was not very good at being evil and did not like it much.  I made a High elf cleric and took him all the way to 56.  Since my GF stopped playing with me I used her account to make a  barb warrior and used the cleric to help him level up.  I forget what level the warrior was, around 48 i think,  but that is about the time I quit also. <br>  <br> Cleric was fun because I liked helping people and healing, but I still like being in the pits like a warrior.  I think the next game I try, I will be a paladin.  It seems like a good mix of the two roles I enjoy. <br>  <br> So... <br>  <br> My friends had all left and I just could not seem to find any new good friends.  People all seemed to be greedy and only care about the loot they gained.  Starting a new character was tough for several reasons. <br> 1) I had already started 8 before. <br> 2) There was hardly anybody between level 1 and 55 to group with since everyone was level 55+. <br> 3) The thrill was just gone...I tried to resist twinking but it just seemed to happen.  I either gave my guy stuff when I got fed up with being killed, or some other person gave him stuff.  I loved the days when my troll was in leather armor and dreaming about a Dark Reaver. <br>  <br> So here I am waiting for EQ2 and hoping that I will have some great times like I did in the early days of EQ.
