				&#8220;One of these days we are going to have to do something about all of these damn orcs!&#8221;  Memnonestia heard her group mate muttering as he cast another spell at the orc she was trying to get to hold still long enough for her mace to connect with.  This was slow going for them, but they were holding their own against the two Centurions that had come at them from behind while they were traveling from the lifts to hunt.  They had intended to find some orcs, but not so soon, or quite so strong at first.  They had just met earlier that day and were still finding their places in the group, still getting used to each others fighting styles.  As the heaviest armored Mem had point while the others stood back and cast their offensive spells.  They had done much better when the ranger had been with them, but now was not the time to worry about that.   <br>  <br> &#8220;Hold still so I can hit you already!&#8221; she screamed at the orc that kept dodging most of her blows.  She didn&#8217;t really expect him to, but it made her feel better to yell at times like this.  Surprisingly enough her yell seemed to startle the orc enough that he didn&#8217;t dodge quite as fast the next time, allowing her to lad a pretty good blow.  Then she saw the third orc running over the hill.   <br>  <br> &#8220;Incoming!&#8221; she hear the enchanter yell. <br>  <br> &#8220;I see.  Can we take another?&#8221;  She replied. <br>  <br> &#8220;If you are willing, we can try.&#8221;  Was the wizards&#8217; response. <br>  <br> &#8220;Lets see if we can&#8217;t show them that elves won&#8217;t just lay down and allow them to overrun our land then, shall we?&#8221;  Was her responses.   After that she didn&#8217;t have the time or the breath to say anything. <br>  <br> The fourth Orc Centurion showed up just as Memnonestia realized that she was running out of energy.  Her whole body was starting to feel as if someone had been using it for target practice.   *Then again* she mussed *that&#8217;s pretty much what they have been doing, isn&#8217;t it?  I have hardly done any real damage, I&#8217;m just keeping them off the others while they cast.  Damn, I never thought to take the role of meat shield!*   When her group mates saw that they were being overrun they all agreed it was time to visit the guards that they knew were just over the hill.  They barely made it, but that was why she had taken so much time in her studies for the healing arts.   <br>  <br> Later they all agreed the original two orcs would have been a good fight, the third one they probably could have taken, but four centurions against a druid, an enchanter, and a wizard just really wasn&#8217;t something they wanted to try just yet.  It might have been different if the two of them were over fourth level in training, but they really didn&#8217;t have the firepower to take on that many at once.  It wouldn&#8217;t have been that bad if the one fighter in the group hadn&#8217;t had to leave so suddenly, but they were down to three and the odds were looking bad.    <br>  <br> *Aah, Kelethin at night!*  She thought with a smile, as she looked into the distance from her window.  Memnonestia couldn&#8217;t think of a more beautiful sight.  Admittedly she hadn&#8217;t traveled far yet, but she knew that the sight of her home would stay with her no matter where she went or whom she met.   Try as she might Memnonestia couldn&#8217;t resign herself to staying here, it would always be home, but she wanted more.  She wanted to see more, do more than what she could if she stayed in Greater Faydark.   <br>  <br> As she prepared to go, she kept thinking of her friends in Evoluxa whom she had been corresponding with for the last few months.  They always spoke of their guild mates as family, people to trust at your back.  Most of them anyways, she could think of three or four that might decide to take a bite out of an unsuspecting wood elf just for grins.  She had enjoyed the stories of fights won and lost, friends saved, and the fun everyone had while doing it all.  That was what she hungered for, people to be with, a family to be there for you, and to be there for.   She left her house with a light, but sad heart. <br>  <br> Later, as she looked at the huge doors in front of her she hoped that they wouldn&#8217;t think her presumptuous just showing up at their door like this, but she just couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.  She loved her friends and missed them dreadfully.  <br>  <br>  Then the thought came *What if they don&#8217;t want me?  What if I am too young for them?  I know that I don&#8217;t have a lot to offer, but surely they will at least consider me, right?  Of, course they will, no one ever accused them of being unfair!  What have I got to lose?  They will still be my friends no matter what, or else they weren&#8217;t my true friends in the first place.  I&#8217;ll do it!* <br>  <br> With that last thought still strong in her mind, Memnonestia raised her hand and gave the door what she thought was a firm steady knock. <br>  <br>  <br> &lt;edit&gt; Yes, I realize that this is a completely different approach than the one I just posted a few days ago, but I think that I am going to hang on to her for as long as I can. <img src="/images/faces/grin.gif" border=0 alt="grin.gif" height=16 hspace=0 width=18 vspace=0>  <br>
