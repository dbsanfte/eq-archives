				I wanted to post in the inny board, but it won't let me register. I only hope that she comes here and reads it. I hate whiners. I ordinarily only read this nonsense, but she posts crybaby shit all the time and I'm sick of reading her drivel. <br>  <br> Posted: 1/15/00 on inny.com <br> Forum: Rants <br> Topic: A Day in the Life <br> Author: LaeliaEnc <br>  <br> &quot;My game has gone like this lately:&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia logs on.&quot; <br> glad you could join us <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia sets LFG tag.&quot; <br> hmm noone ever looks at lfg tags didnt anyone tell you? <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia checks out friend and guild lists for available clerics.&quot; <br> so you only group with clerics.... kind of picky? <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gives tells to any clerics to start up a group.&quot; <br> better to do a shout in your zone, if they need you they will say so. Or do all clerics take orders from you upon getting the proverbial &quot;/tell&quot;? <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia is flatly rejected by 3 of 4 clerics.&quot; <br> isnt one cleric enough?? how many do you need?? Besides so what? they are not allowed to be busy or are they just supposed to drop everything once YOU give them a tell? What the hell makes YOU so special?? How does that equate to flat rejection? THEY WERE BUSY!!! SO FUCKING WHAT??? <br>  <br> &quot;-Cleric 4 is available and willing to group.&quot; <br> God help him <br>  <br> &quot;-Cleric 4 is in Sol B, Laelia is in Trakanon's Teeth&quot; <br> Lucky for him. To bad you don't know how to find a group in your own zone... <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia checks friend and guild lists for available wizards and druids.&quot; <br> ahh so you do need other classes if they can interupt what they are doing to port your dumb ass or some other dumb ass.. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gives tells: &quot;Hey want to join a group? All you have to do is port my cleric friend.&quot; <br> They would probbly rather group in zone they are in but....You dont seem to understand what is &quot;to much to ask&quot;... <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia receives tells: &quot;Sorry I'm in the Plane of Hate with my guild&quot;&quot; <br> Can you blame him?  <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia receives tells: &quot;Sorry I've got to log in 10 minutes&quot;&quot; <br> When you gotta go you gotta go <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia receives tells: &quot;No&quot;&quot; <br> PEOPLE OF YOUR DESIRED CLASS ARE NOT GONNA JUST JUMP OUT OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND TRAVEL HALF WAY ROUND THE WORLD TO GROUP WITH A HALF BAKED EXCUSE FOR A GROUP!!  <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gets ignored.&quot; <br> &lt;starts hearing violins&gt; <br> Sounds to me like they were busy and were not even rude. They just told ya the truth. Unless of course you'd have preferred a lie?? No response doesn't always mean they are ignoring you. Did it ever occur to you that maybe they were to busy fighting to see your dumb tell? Or maybe you just arent' special enough to get a fucking reply cause they think you are a whiner which you so vehemently convey in all your posts. And yes, I've read them all on the inny.com boards. Uggghh....You should do more and shut up while your at it. You make me ill with your crying. Lousy excuse of a player you are... <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia receives tells from Cleric 4: &quot;Did you find a port yet?&quot;&quot; <br> Cleric 4 wants to know whats going on..BFD <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia tells Cleric 4: &quot;Not yet but I'm trying&quot;&quot; <br> Well done!! good effort!! Maybe YOU could go to him/her rather than asking everyone to come to you?? or..... <br> Ever hear of shouts to find a group in your own zone that might want you? Why should others have to drop everything and run all over the continents just to be with you? What do you have to offer them that is so incredibly wonderful and better than what they have going right now elsewhere? <br>  <br> &quot;-Cleric 4 tells Laelia: &quot;I'm going to Fear with my guild now. Sorry&quot;&quot; <br> Sounds like he/she waited as long as they could. But then again, you failed in your endeavor so why should he keep waiting? I'd have done the same as him/her. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia auctions her last 100pp for a port to gfay to practice smithing.&quot; <br> Yes I hear enchanters are really strapped for cash <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gets ignored.&quot; <br> Did it not ever occur to you that there were no porters going in that direction that were not busy? Again you fail to see the concept here....people do things while they are in EQ. They have more to do than to sit around waiting for you to send your dumb ass tells. Did it occur to you to take a fucking boat?? or run?? Or hunt elsewhere when that isn't possible with time constraints? I do. /shrugs...you're just a cry baby.  <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia starts giving tells to random wizards begging for a port.&quot; <br> And you moan about newbies begging??? later on in your post here, you complain about that very thing. Sounds to me like you do your fair share of begging as well. How rude and annoying. I seem to remember reading that begging for ports annoys people. Guess you failed to notice that through all YOUR whining and begging. Maybe that's why you couldn't get one. <br>  <br> &quot;-Two hours later, Laelia notices that guild wizard logged on.&quot; <br> And you are guilded through all this??? I don't pitty you, I pitty them!! Poor wixard <br> 2 minutes later recieves a tell from Laelia and wishes he hadnt. Another point being, in 2 hours, I could have made it from Trakanon's Teeth to Gfay. You never even tried. You just sat begging of others. <br>  <br> &quot;-Guild wizard saves the day by running/porting way the hell out to Emerald Jungle.&quot; <br> Good man/woman, but it's a shame that you were incapable of getting anywhere on your own. That's to bad for you. You should practice the art of &quot;Self-reliance&quot; more often. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia goes AFK for 30 secs to get a drink.  <br> -Laelia is outa Mountain Dew and starts up a pot of coffee.&quot; <br> Thirsty work all this begging and whining. As if we really care. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia is slaughtered by a raging gorilla while AFK. Funny how this dumbass subspecies has the magical ability to see through invis.&quot; <br> Its funny how your so &quot;hard done&quot; by <br>  <br> &quot;-Oh wait invis stinks and it dropped 2 seconds after Laelia cast it with her 216 Divination skill.&quot; <br> GOOD - you deserved it for bugging people and begging. As well, you should of seen it fail before you left stupid. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia starts giving tells to random clerics looking for a 56 res to gain back 36 hours of hard fought experience.&quot; <br> MORE begging, MORE whinning and all for something that was your own damn fault anyway. LOOK, it helps if you like to be aware of what's going on. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia is repeatedly ignored.&quot; <br> NOT very suprising...again, MORE BEGGING!!!! Maybe you lack politeness? If your post on inny.com is any indication of your attitude in game, then it's no wonder people don't help. Or, if you are polite, again, maybe they were busy. Guess that group they are in and the mob they are killing should just wait till they can help you out. Give your whining a rest already. Woe is you, poor litte thing. /rude <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia goes linkdead.&quot; <br> Even your computer is sick of you as well as EQ, maybe you should take the hint that the community is a much happier place with you OUT OF IT you whining beggar. We all go LD now and then. BFD <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia spends 20 minutes rebooting and logging on through all those fun Everquest splash screens and gay music.&quot; <br> What an incredibly aduous and intensive task. As if nobody else has ever done that. Besides, in case you are to stupid to notice, &quot;esc&quot; gets rid of the &quot;mere 2&quot; splash screens, &quot;all those fun everquest splash screens&quot;, hardly, and the dumb music. DUH!! If you didn't know that, you deserve to sit and wait. Again, I say..&quot;Shut the hell up and stop your damn whining&quot;. You're not a victim to any more than anyone else is so STFU!! <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia finally gets back on and runs naked from Sebilis to Emerald Jungle with no sow....is attacked 4 times by spectral keepers on the way.&quot; <br> Guess they and me have one thing in common, they must like naked females who can't get away... /sniff <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia zones to EJ with 26 HP.&quot; <br> Whaaaaaaa!!!!! Shit happens. That was lucky you made it! Maybe EQ is just to much for your small mind to grasp. It happens to everyone now and then.  <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia is attacked and killed by an Erollisi bloodthorn while sitting and trying to recover HP.&quot; <br> BOO HOO HOO... guess your invis didn't work again? Or were you sending begging tells to others to come and cast a &quot;real&quot; invis on you since your skills apparently suck so badly. Remind me never to group with you.... <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gets extremely pissed off and considers throwing computer at walls or random people.&quot; <br> That's an excellent example of your premo self control. /sarcasm <br> do us all a favor and throw it at the wall. Then we needn't be bothered with your petty whining about regular game stuff that we all go through.  <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia finally gets back to Emerald Jungle and locates corpse.&quot; <br> What happened to throwing your computer against the wall? WHY ARE YOU BACK AGAIN?!?! <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia begs an LoD cleric who happened to port into EJ to res her.&quot; <br> Begging uber guild clerics for resses, great stuff keep it up. As if you are really going to make them look bad. Anyone would have ignored you like the newbie you act like. no shame in that for the LoD cleric. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia is ignored like a newbie.&quot; <br> BIG SHOCKER!! you act like a newbie. I'd have ignored you too. I've met newbie's who behave better than you have. YOU SUCK and deserve to have been ignored. Learn how to play the game and stop requiring everyone else to get you through and complaining and whining on the boards when they have other things going on. Self-reliance - live it - know it. As of now, you are as clueless as they come. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia auctions 100pp for a res.&quot; <br> That last 100 plat is really getting around <br>  <br> &quot;-LoD cleric acts pissed off and agrees to res Laelia for her last 100pp.&quot; <br> proof that begging and whining works, take note n00bs....I bet you didn't even thank him/her either. Sounds to me like they did you a favor and you come whine about it.....you breath new life into the word WHINER. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gets ressed, gates to gfay with guild wizard who has been waiting for over an hour now.&quot; <br> Bummer for wizard. But dont worry im sure he hasnt got anything better to do than wait around for you to get your shit together. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia sells a +3 wis earring for 20pp.&quot; <br> most people give them away, guess you really are desperate. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia attempts to craft another +3 wis earring with her 198 jewel craft skill so she can make some cash to cover losses.&quot; <br> Again, most people give them away. Further proof that your lack of self reliance and sheer and utter dependence on others is a frightful shame. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia fails twice on this trivial item.&quot; <br> ROFL, I guess your skills suck? Maybe a few more tears will improve them. Your whine skill is 200+. Trust me on that. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gets pissed off and decides to camp.&quot; <br> YIPEE!! <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia gets tell from random cleric: &quot;Hey we need you for group in Seb.&quot;&quot; <br> Dont encorage her shes going!!!!! Besides, isn't that how it normally happens? What's the problem with that?  <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia tells random cleric &quot;Sorry I'm camping&quot;&quot; <br> I guess normal EQ gameplay is enough to make anyone want to quit for the time, or at least those who are incapable of playing the normal way and actually putting some effort into it rather than sitting and waiting for everyone else to do it for them. <br>  <br> &quot;-Laelia does a /q because random newbies are begging for spare pp. Get out fast.&quot; <br> O NO!!! NEWBIES BEGGING LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST 4 HOURS BETTER CAMP!!! Hmmm, guess you can't take your own medicine, you can do all the begging you want but as soon as anyone asks of you, you leave. How lame. Why would anyone want to beg off of you? You can't even make a damn ear ring. <br>  <br> &quot;-I break out my Q3 Arena disk, log on, grab the rocket launcher and frag some unsuspecting fools, turning them into piles of tattered flesh with a healthy explosive sound in full 5 channel 3D Labs environmental sound....feeling much better about myself.&quot; <br> You shouldn't, you still suck at EQ. Let me suggest that you stay with Q3 Arena and stay the hell out of EQ. you can't take it. <br>  <br> I have a few words for you..Shit or get off the pot!! It's women like you who give them all a bad rep. There are plenty of women that I have grouped with who are stellor EQ players and none of them beg and whine like you do. There is nothing wrong with asking for things, but you are overly dependent on others to a degree that you have no fun without thier assistance and feel you are evidently &quot;owed&quot; things that you cannot provide yourself with. Get a life and give up EQ before you kill us all with your petty whining and crying. /hands you a diaper...BABY!! <br>  <br>

				This is probably one of the best break apart posts (the format etc) I have ever read.  Kudos to the guy with the big name that I dont feel like typing.  Pretty much on the money for the whole thing. <br>  <br> Shit or get off the pot!! has been added to my list of creative commentary.  Thank you. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> On another note - don't beggar's have any decency? I realize sometimes you get desperate , but for myself I have a certain feeling of pride in saying &quot;Yeah I road the damn boat from gfay to freeport, ran all the way up to permafrost, without sow - to CR my damn self cause there was no way I was gonna bug a guild cleric to res my ass for something stupid&quot;.  Of course this was cause some gay ass goblin killed me w/ his damage shield BS and LOOK AT MY ICE SPELL HIT THE RED LEVEL 50 WARRIOR (this was pre-kunark) while I was trying to get a damn frost totem for some crafted crap.  STUPID GAME CHEATS! <br> end rant <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> The ability to be responsible for fixing your own fuckups and solving your own problems is something to be proud of.   <br>  <br>  <br> The ability to con others whom are just overly helpful into saving your ass 'out of good will to a newbie' is shameful and pathetic. <br>  <br>

				5 rants a week eh?  Your ass.  I've posted 4 in my entire life.  Thanks to all you nice folks, I won't post anymore.  You've made your point and I hope it feels good. <br>  <br> I've been owned like a little whiny bitch here, indeed.  I don't think there's anything that can ever pull my soul out of the flaming mucky depths of hell after &quot;Dabigbadmancando&quot; put me there.  I wont explore the futility of trying to regain any self-esteem by attempting to destroy any of you with words.  Its not a battle I can win, since it appears many of you are in alliance against me on that. <br>  <br> I've had a couple bad EQ days lately.  I made some posts about it.  You've all made it abundantly clear that I'm not free to do so.  Ok fine.  I can live with that. <br>  <br> Actually...if you wanna know the cold hard truth...I never even knew of the existence of these message boards until last week.  I wish now I hadn't ventured out into the wild unknown. <br>  <br> You've done me a service here Dabigbadman or Cataclysm or Catastrophe or whoever the hell you are...you've forced me to reevaluate my gaming philosophy.  I guess I can only offer my thanks for that.  From levels 1-25 or so as an enchanter, I viewed EQ as a soloing game...a game where the individual could strive toward that very Ralph-Waldo-Emerson idea you have of &quot;self-reliance.&quot;  I thought I could accomplish everything on my own. At about level 25 or so I hit a wall..(And no, fuck you..I did NOT buy my account from some other dumbass like myself.  I'm the dumbass who wasted 1.5 years or so of real life to build up a single character to level 50ish so that I could interact with all you nice people on a higher level.)...the wall I hit was one where that noble idea of &quot;self-reliance&quot; came crumbling down.  I realized I had to group up with 5 or more other people in order to really prevail in the game.  I realized that Verant put the screws to me and made me become a social being. <br>  <br> But I liked the game and I liked my character...so I bit the bullet and went out and mingled with the masses.  Overall it was a positive experience.  I learned how the classes are interrelated and how we all must sort of depend on each other in some way.  Unlike Diablo 2 or Quake or god-forbid Civilization or any other game I've played...you've gotta be all nice and touchy-feely social to play the EQ.  It came as a shock to me at first, but I learned to deal with it. <br>  <br> Then something went awry in my head.  I formed an opinion that 90% of the other players in the game don't abide by the same social ideals as I do.  Its not a fun, well-balanced, groovy little Kindergarten world out there where all are shiny happy people singing, chanting, killing and looting until the sun goes down.  No sir.  Actually...90% of the people in the game are out to buttram you with a hot flaming cattle prod.  Don't you dare /consent someone to loot your corpse. You'll never see it again.  Better keep that wizard away from your dervish cutthroat too, or he may very well kill it for you.  Holy crap a runed cowl just dropped off the ghoul sage you've been camping for 32 hours straight?!!?  That little gnome necromancer will loot it for you...and he's only been here 5 minutes.   <br>  <br> These ideas festered in my head for another 20 levels or so.  Why is everyone an ass?  Maybe its me thats the ass?  Why do I have to constantly group with asses in order to &quot;have fun&quot; in my spare time?  Is this really what this game is all about?  These were the questions I plagued myself with.  Then at about level 45 or so I threw those notions out again when I found 5 or 6 others that didn't fit the mold.  Those people I would call friends now.  With them...the game is pure heaven.  The mobs die with wondrous rapidity and efficiency.  The loot is divvied up in a sane manner.  They actively seek out the moment when you log on so they can invite you to group for the Efreeti room or something.  You actively seek them out for the same reason.  The game became great again.  There was a certain  majesty in the idea that you could rely not only on yourself...but also on other people again.  The gaming intensity became an orgiastic experience.  Hell I had so damn much fun in the frenzied room at 5 in lower guk at 5 AM that I don't think I'll ever enjoy any other dungeon again. <br>  <br> Then a few more levels went by and I hit 51.  Kunark and Velious came out.  Then another horrid reality set in:  I can't be &quot;self-reliant&quot; anymore...and I can't be group-reliant either.  The only way to further advance myself now requires not 6 people...but 18-24.  As a matter of fact...now that I'm level 54...I realize that you can't rely even on 18-24 people.  You've gotta rely on the entire bloody server.  I've gotta &quot;reserve&quot; the Plane of Hate 2 months in advance if I ever expect to go there.  Oh shit I've gotta do that on www.innoruuk.com.  Wow!  I had no idea there was an extended area for interacting with my fun-loving peer group!  I better check that out. <br>  <br> Obviously my venture into the world of EQ message boards was not a well-thought out one.  I basically went at it without thinking.  I thought maybe others had been experiencing or thinking about some of the same things as I had.  Maybe they even call some of the same game principles into question.  Maybe I'll run into someone with similar ideas.  The ideas were there...but the approach was half-assed at best.  I opted to bitch and whine about the game rather than offer some sort of positive &quot;self-reliant&quot; anecdote which would foster friendship and community.  (Which, by the way, you folks seem mighty polished at. /sarcasm)  It was a mistake.  &quot;DaBigBadMancando&quot; or whoever made me pay dearly for it.  Thanks for teaching me a valuable lesson, and forcing me to reevaluate attitudes of the general population once again.  <br>  <br> Ok if you've read this much of my ravings, then you really must be a dried up schmuck...and even you're tired of listening to me whine by now...so I'll try to make my closing brief: <br>  <br> You don't know me &quot;GoofusandGallant.&quot;  Yet you call me a &quot;fuckin retard.&quot;  Thanks and Best Wishes to you. <br>  <br> &quot;Dabigbadmancando&quot; assumes I'm a female.  Thats pretty hilarious.  You're wrong.  I just play a female character.  Maybe its because I'm gay or because I secretly lust after my mother.  What difference does it make?  Maybe a female high elf makes a better enchanter. Maybe I had a sex change.  Maybe I just CAN'T WAIT for that Illusion: Gender spell to be implemented.  Maybe I'm just like you.  Either way, you're an ass to me and you know nothing about me...not even that simple detail.  Thats because you're a Big Bad Man  /cheer. <br>  <br> Anyway...I can see you've all got your own comfy cozy little world here.  This is officially my last post on any of these boards.  Laugh it up and have a good time.  I hope it was fun for you. <br>  <br>  <br> Laelia the Whining Retard Bitch <br> Level 54 Enchanter thanks to e-bay. <br> Guilded with some little bunch you don't know <br> The Kind and Benevolent Innoruuk Server <br>
