				Havok-  <br> On Point 1)  Nighthops is a retard.  The guy doesnt even know how to use his assist button and is the kind of paladin who only uses LOH on himself.  Yes I know this from personal experience.  His lengthy posts actually make my brain hurt with their lack of actual basis in reality.  But in the interest of fairness I will go back and reread them. <br>  <br> On point 2) It is a stretch to interpret Fynris's statement in that manner having been in that conversation with him. <br>  <br> On Point 3)  Do you have a chain of command?  Perhaps you should have someone more dominant in charge to prevent fuckups like this from recurring.  As I said before, we do not have these problems. <br>  <br> On Point 4)  So basically, if ROS did half the helm and we did the other half, KOF did like zero for Elfwind?  Evidently Sunlily &gt; Elfwind (or at least shes more cyberfriendly) And excuse me, if you wipe to Vox with more than 24 (and you had WELL above that number) while bind rushing and parking healers outside the rock and sticking her in the tunnel, nothing is going to win you a white scale.  Vox takes us 15 on average, and weve done her flawlessly with 13 (I am sure plenty of other guilds have too, CD has done her with 12 I know for a fact) so if you are crapping out using cheese tactics and massive numbers, I am afraid you DID need us to get you a white scale.  I defy you to prove otherwise.  And my point is, if we help retards who have been a total painin our ass like you, then obviously we help other people as well. <br>  <br> 5)

				Wow.. sigh.. another posting by Searyx favorite person. <br>  <br> OK.. let me start of by saying again that in order for KoF to attempt something like UDB, we have to have 25+ lvl 50+ members on willing to be on for 3+ hours with the UDB up and NO one making an attempt for it. As I stated before, and I believe it was taken right.. thats NOT often. Once again, people have forgotten this.. and want to belittle their actions for killing the UDB by stating the fact that he has been up X amount of times. Yes, true, he has been up X amount of times, but outta those times did KoF have the chance to organize a raid and kill the UDB? Answer is NONE.  <br>  <br> Next point. First VOX raid. <br>  <br> Both sides claimed the other messed them over while making an attempt. All I can say is that the FIRST screwing came when the Corps chose to run past us, ready or not, they chose to run past us (kinda big), then the next claim of fault was by the Corps that because we moved up, they lagged out, thus wiping out (people lag all the time, but can techniqually claim it was because of us in the area). Third claim to fault was by KoF due to the fact that you showed no regard to stay clear of the lair while we were making our attempt (at least we only moved up to the prep spot before moving in, you proceeded to come in at will repeatedly to get &quot;...6 corpse&quot;-jice). As for slandering us for our style vs yours.... big deal.. We tried once and failed.. I remember Corps trying it at least 3 times.. with failing results before we left. Either way, method, or stratigy produced failing results for both guilds. Ending... both guilds felt that each other screwed the other over. My thougthts.. yes.. both have valid claims, although with an open mind I would side with KOF, you may chose not to. <br>  <br> Second attempt at VOX. <br>  <br> I was not there for this, and only heard about it. But I know that this was shortly after the first attempt. I dont know what the reasoning was, nor do I see that it was only because both teamed up to get the Kill. Since the happening, I have been told by a KoF member that it was only to avoid the crap that they did on the first one. And, maybe for the Corps, it was of the same reasons. I dont know how many we had, or they had, or the loot awardings. If memory serves, BOTH guilds got a WHITE SCALE. So.. if there was only one that dropped.. we can NEVER assume where it would have gone (unless some deal/agreement was made before the joining that I dont know about.. feel free to correct me also). Ending result... BOTH guilds helped with the kill and the job was done. DONT make claims that KoF only got the scale because Jice showed us how it was done and that we would never would have gotten it without you. We killed Naggy with our alts, Vox is not much harder (as you have started by doing it was 8-12 now) so there is NO reason why we could not have sometime after if the guilds would not have grouped together. <br>  <br> ---- <br> &quot;'are in a different context'  <br>  <br> Ya know what, I could be wrong but if it was even in a way that COULD be taken wrong, then a better approach could have been used.&quot; -Merlin <br>  <br> My opinions on this matter are.. if it got to the point where it could have been taken wrong.. more then likely the better approach was already attempted. <br>  <br> Like I said before.. NOT many in this game approach someone with a demanding tone and a kick you outta the way attitude. It certainly was not Fynris approaching Jice as the first KOF member when he made the 'easy way or hard way' comment. Maybe it was the first tell sent by Fynris after the conversation between Sunlily and Jice produced a strongly negative result. That I will never know, neither will we that seem to have commented most on it. Since I havent gotta a clear understanding from Jice as to when it was sent, I assume no one else has either. <br>  <br> --- <br> &quot;I believe Jice and our officers when they say subsequently KoF lied, and sneaked past us in Chardok. &quot; Xendax <br>  <br> Xendax, we NEVER 'sneaked' past you in chardok. As for this, I was the ONLY one who knew about the conversation between Jice and myself. Like I said before, Jice knew our plans and I knew his at the same time. I DONT see how this is lying to the Corps, I NEVER used this information to benifit our guild or our raid. Since I knew that both guilds were planning on doing the same thing, I just let it play out. Happend to be that our guild moved down to the castle some 45mins after this conversation while The Corps continued to camp and clean-up after the almost wipe-out and clearing of agro. As for believing your other officers.. they ONLY knew what JICE had said to them. They DIDNT and more then likely now are only getting both sides to the story. If they made claims about Me lying at the time, they had NO interactions to base that claim NOR should they have said anything to begin with. <br> If you or anyone feel that I (or we) lied or sneaked past you in Chardok.. please point your reasons and just not make the claim without your basis of it. I have stated my conversation with a timeframe with Jice, although not exact words, the context is there. I have also stated the fact that both sides new of each others plans and that both sides had people of equal numbers in the zone at the same time. Please reply with your backing to the claim that we &quot;..lied.. sneaked past..&quot;. <br>  <br> --- <br> &quot;At least I can follow, understand, and appreciate Nightops posts.&quot;-Merlin <br>  <br> Thank you, we all know people get crappy and useless here. I have and will continue to try to be respectful to you and others in the future. <br>  <br> --- <br> &quot;As an officer of KOF were you completely unaware I was pissed about your cornhole from a month ago? If not, do the KOF officers have a fucking clue what each other are doing?&quot; -Jice <br>  <br> The interact that we(me and you) had a month ago, like I said before, was ONLY with me JICE. I DIDNT tell anyone about it, NOR did I want to swade the opinions of the members of KOF when it came to you and the rest of the Corps. As for Fynris knowing that you were pissed at at KoF, maybe he knew a little, maybe he didnt, I dont know. I dont feel to many people hold someone elses 'shit' agaist their guild or another person. Even the crap that you do that I have been a part of, I dont hold the rest of The Corps as being a part of it. You said something to the effect that 'you' chose to pull and kill the UDB... I dont and will not hold members of the Corps with that decission now that I know you claimed the actions, only you will I hold. The Chardok situation, you should have held only against me, but thats just my take. Are you now going to hold all KOF to my words and actions here on this board? I would feel thats even below anything that you or I would do. <br>  <br> --- <br> Now we are bringing up a &quot;helm of the Tracker&quot;. And you doing nothing but claiming KOF is whining about old things. OK there. Maybe your intent was to give an example.. much the same as what I have been doing. Jice, I dont want to bring up old shit that a guild has failed to help when asked... but... wasnt the Corps asked to join in a Cazic killing a while back and only 2 or 3 members showed up.. then you proceeded to throw a fit and deguilded and put someone else in charge? But once again, why should we bring up issues about old matters that are irrelavent. <br>  <br> As for KoF allowing for others to lead raids and plan/request raids. There are many reasons we do this.. to distrubte the burden of the game.. to give people experience in leading.. to insure that if the leaders have to take a leave of absence that someone else can step in.. and most of all, to give the since of pride when a raid goes off correctly (others too.. but those are the points I could think about now). <br>  <br> I wont try to deny that members of KoF sent you tells or the rest of your guildmates. But, If you would have just replied with something a bit more giving* instead of a strong NO responce, nothing would have happend. Now, I cant even promise that claim, but being a KoF officer, I have a pretty good feeling that it would have.  <br>  <br> giving*- I dont mean give us what we want when we want.. but rather responding with something we could have worked with.. maybe like.. 'you can come to the door area (before the Juggs/reets camp) and then ask again and when we are ready... whenever that may be.. we will contact you again.' Even that might have drawn negative reactions, but at least you would have made an effort to acknowledge our raid and its desires/intent while protecting your raid and your feelings of untrustworthy towards Me/KoF. <br>  <br> --- <br> In the summary of Screwings.. <br>  <br> -Both claim mutual screwing to the first Vox attempt. <br>  <br> -Both worked together in the second Vox attempt. <br>  <br> -Corps claims KoF screwed them in Chardok, I claim I didnt. You read my account and I dont think you will feel the whole of KoF screwed the Corps, even if you do feel I did for asking/telling both plans.  <br>  <br> -KoF claims the Corps screwed them with the UDB. Was amitted and claimed, however, I'm willing to put the blame on Jice alone. <br>  <br> -- ENDING-- <br> -Jice, its YOU vs ME... you can have the right to SCREW me as much as you LIKE.. and I can SCREW you back. However, I would request that SCREWING of each others guilds be put to an end, or the using of our respective guilds to do something to the other. This is not a truce.. nor a giving in.. this is me saying.. its Jice vs Nightops.. anything where its us and only us being affected is FAIR GAME. <br>  <br> &lt;ding ding ding&gt;  <br>  <br> ROUND 1  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> FIGHT! <br>  <br>  <br> Nightops <br> 59 Paladin

				&quot;On Point 1) Nighthops is a retard. The guy doesnt even know how to use his assist button and is the kind of paladin who only uses LOH on himself. Yes I know this from personal experience. His lengthy posts actually make my brain hurt with their lack of actual basis in reality. But in the interest of fairness I will go back and reread them.&quot; -Jice <br>  <br> I Just want to laugh at this whole comment Jice. yeah.. ok.. I dont know how to use an assist botton..and only uses LoH on himself.... and to top it off.. knowing this from personal experience. HAHAHAHAHA... thats like a Searyx comment about him not having to defend others without giving out a name of his player on Veeshan. This to me... and to only me.. just shows how off-base your words are. No one will know what I'm talking about other then you,me and maybe a few other Corps members with good memories. Well Jice, the only time I can remember YOU, and ME together on a Raid or a GROUP (never) was when I came with the Corps to Hate. Yes, there was someone breaking mezzes and not using assist. BUT it was not me. I remember you SHOUTing in the zone at this fool, and yes he was an ogre/troll and a member of your guild. My RL friend also was telling me it was Known in guildchat to who was doing it.. and it was NOT me. NOW if thats what your refering to as personaly experience and me with me lack of 'assist key knowledge' GO AHEAD... bring on more lies. As for using LOH on myself.. OK THERE JICE... the only time I use LOH on myself and with that intent only is when I'm solo'ing. Hell.. I have used LOH on people wondering by that ask for a heal.. just for the fun of it.. not knowing when it will be needed again. As for grouping with me Jice and actually knowing me or my playing style.. LIE.. I hardly ever have grouped with a member of the Corps.. mainly because I'm in a group someplace already when most of your members long on, or because the guilds have members doing something else. I CERTAINLY DONT group with JICE or JAZABELLE.. and if you want to make that claim that I do.. go RIGHT Ahead.  <br>  <br> HAHA&gt;&gt; &quot;lack of actual basis in reality&quot; -Jice (with reference to posts made by Nightops) <br>  <br> OH yes.. know I remember, I was the one that likes to try to make degrading comments about ren-fair people, chees dicks, and art fags... all the time claiming that had to fit the intended person. I was the one when asked, could only produce &quot;started with an F&quot; to a question. I however am not the person that has gotten respect from others on this board.. and of members from the opposing guild. The only respect that you have gotten was in your admitance to killing the UDB and from your guildmates backing your claims, NO ONE else.. well other then Searyx.  <br>  <br> But, I guess your comment is as fitting as me saying that 'your only beneficial uses of HT was on the NPC bankers in Thurg.. (Mort and Gage), otherwise you dont hit the hotkey. This I know from witnessing it in person.'  <br>  <br> Sigh.. nice try again Jice. <br>  <br> Nightops <br> 59 Paladin

				Just let it go, the valid points that are out there to be made have been made. The people that dont have a clue and are going to take everything wrong and twist words and throw them at each other have done so. Let it die. <br>  <br> Heh, that being said. Yes we have a chain of command that is fairly well followed. But, for CERTAIN, if we have someone along the lines of havok we would tell him to stay off the damn boards and stfu, or we'd kick him out. Once again an example of somebody that would help a guild most by not saying anything. Obviously the people that disagree have at this point agreed to keep disagreeing. Certainly rational reasoning disappeared somewhere (if it ever existed) so theres nothing left to aim for.

				Nighthops, just to enlighten you on where I draw my knowledge of your play from, you attended one of our numerous hate runs roughly 6 months ago.  Your consistant ability to attack the wrong target and not heal anyone, under any circumstance, stuck in my mind.  You caused a lot of headaches on this particular run, enough that I made a mental note to avoid ever grouping/raiding with you again. <br>  <br> On the topic of Vox, hmm ok I suppose the rest of us should waste the 6 hours while you work up the hardon to charge Vox (when I say charge, I of course mean stick in the tunnel with bound clerics at the rock door to avoid the AE).  There was a time I might have considered that, but there is too little to do in the game and no one wants to waste the time picking their asses while another group is still shouting for bodies zones away.  I'd also like to point out that the only failures we have EVER had on Vox occured with your people there fucking things up.  You like to make it sound like we hosed your attempt, but the only person dragging corpses was level 55.  Now tell me Professor Nightops what happens when a level 53+ hits Vox's hate list?  I specifically sent a level 53+ in to drag so it WOULD not interfere with your attempt in any way shape or form.  In any case, we were ready you were not.  I gave you 30 minutes to charge, you did absolutely nothing (except whine and cry steamroll) not even the lair had been pulled, which takes all of about 2 minutes. <br>  <br> If you want people to be all warm and fuzzy to you and let you delevel on a mob for hours on end, then I suggest you not pull the shit you did in chardok on people who agreed to a future of cooperation with you.  Im sure all the KOF conveniently forgot it, but that was one of the terms of us working together on Vox (and of course when I say us working together, I mean me leading you so you dont die horribly getting a white scale) the one we did.  I didn't forget it, but its obvious you did Nightops since you were present both times. <br>  <br> Irony here is, if KoF had simply fucking walked to Royals with us in the zone without sayign a god damn word, I would have only been pissed at myself for not being quicker on the draw.  You fucknuts decided it was a good idea to tell me you weren't going for Royals and it was ok for us to stay down in Herbalist while we waited for Comps to leave.  Thats what I get for trusting you guys, I guess.  Finally, if you had just walked down to the fucking lair without sending me a tell, just get off your asses and DO IT, you would have never had a problem (until it was time to Necrovac the lair) as we were long gone before you even got near lair, despite fucking around down there for two hours WHILE YOU HAD A FORCE IN THE ZONE capable of at least getting down there. <br>  <br> Oh well, I'm tired of repeating myself.  My statements have remained the same since my first post on this thread.  You guys collectively did not know what each other were doing or saying, as evidenced by your own posts.  If people in CT want to &quot;avenge the down trodden&quot; of KOF, feel free.  At least with CT I know they wont lie to me about their intentions to ass fuck me, they will just come on in and get right down to business.  In that aspect, they have my respect.  KOF will never have my respect.

				Wow I'm actually surprised this thread has made it to eight pages. <br>  <br> Just as a side note cause I keep hearing how we leapfrogged KoF at Vox... let me remind everyone that the reason we went past the horde was because after their fourth screw up on their buffing order Jice got frustrated and said &quot;Fuck it, we can have this thing killed by the time they figure out which buff goes where...&quot; <br>  <br> Even after we failed the first time because of LAG due to them rushing into the tunnel before Vox, we sat around waiting for them to get their buffs straight again and eventually they decided to run in with only half their ppl buffed. <br>  <br> I was there for the complete raid and even had ppl from KoF's party (who are friends of mine) bitching because they couldn't get simple buffing straight. <br>  <br> Yeah this is a game to be enjoyed but I'll be damned if I'm enjoying the game sitting around for three hours while you guys figure out the definitions and orders of the most basic buffs.  And if the UDB incident was anything like the banter that went back and forth at the Vox raid you can cut the &quot;Oh we're so kind, loving and willing to work things out&quot; routine because there were many of you who were a bunch of jackasses on that raid right from the beginning. <br>  <br> Those are the facts folks... take it like it is and let's be mature about this and own up to the REAL facts by stopping the horseshit cause right now this thread is swimming in it.   <br>  <br> As for the Corps being a bunch of brainwashed followers of Jice...  We follow Jice because he is a true LEADER, we don't always agree with everything he says or does but that man sure does know what he's doing when our asses are placed on the proverbial barbed wire electrical fence and I have the utmost respect for him.  At least I know he is going to tell me the truth whether I want to hear it or not, every time.

				&quot;You fucknuts decided it was a good idea to tell me you weren't going for Royals and it was ok for us to stay down in Herbalist while we waited for Comps to leave.&quot; -Jice <br>  <br> Well, I dont know who you are talking about here with this conversation, but I KNOW I never told you we 'weren't going for royals and it was ok to stay where you were'. If I did, then I could see your reasons for blaming us, BUT, Since I only know of me talking to you, and since I will take my own word over your fictional illusions... I know this NEVER happend. So, Jice.. I ask you this... We had a force of about 25-30 people in the zone at that time I first made contact with you.. What the hell do you think we are going to do with a force that size in Chardok? Even that fact alone is enough to prove to me that you are making false statments to justify something that didnt go your way. <br>  <br> As for that Hate raid I went on... blame me all you want.. but anyone that can remember that raid will tell you it wasnt me doing that and YOU were shouting at the fool, both in /gu and in /shout to stop it. Funny how his name was not spelled 'Nightops'.  <br>  <br> As for the Vox raid.. please read what I said Jice. I said potentially training us while we made our attempt. I didnt say to draw agro from Vox herself or to make Vox run all over the lair. I said we didnt want you to potentially train us while we were making our attempt. Now, you tell me Jice, what happends when someone brings in a mob from outside the lair into the lair while people are fighting Vox... If your 53+ person dies or FD's (whoever it was and their ability).. does that mob just happen to wonder back outside the Lair not joining in the fight... humm.. dont know that one.. please inform me with your wisdom of Vox raids Jice. <br>  <br> Searyx.. I said ATLs.. meaning alts of our mains that were below 52. We dont have alts with epics or with full resist gear. When we do VOx/Naggy, we do it with more then 12 because we dont have ragebringers on alts nor do we have them all around 48-52. Thats not ment to be negative to the Corps, I'm just saying that you have been at those types of raids longer and now have it down to a strict path to making the kill. Grats to you guys. We dont, and no shame there, we just have whoever is on get there highest alt below 52 and bring them along. <br>  <br> Please.. if your going to try to flame based on what someone posted.. please make it valid. <br>  <br> Nightops <br> 59 Paladin

				RE: Vox... <br>  <br> What potential train?  The only mobs left alive during that fight was the bears in the pit and they stayed down in the pit until your people got feared into the pits and your clerics decided to heal those unfortunate to fall in pit. Which of course warped in on your raid. <br>  <br> Under no circumstances were we ever in a position to train you or potentially train.   <br>  <br> The only training that went on was when we were trained because of your bind rush tactics pulling Vox into the buff hallway but other than that there was no training or &quot;potential&quot; training going on during that raid by us. <br>
