				&#8220;Malanai,&#8221; Zane approached his mother quite seriously, &#8220;nnsh'allien terestai?&#8221; <br>  <br> He was almost nine -- or would have been the equivalent in human years, were he human and not elven -&#8211; and it was good a time as any to start practicing. He knew that if he was to become a grand captain like his father one day, he should get a head start on his shaeyata: the most honorable style of Fier&#8217;Dal war. Zane wanted more than anything to be a brave and noble warrior; nobody dared tell him that he was too young. He took himself much more seriously than most children his age, that was for certain. <br>  <br> Aranthi glanced down from her sewing project and smiled at her son. &#8220;Siana, marara. Narwa ser'noth&#8230; Zane?&#8221; <br>  <br> The boy didn&#8217;t hear her answer as he was already distracted, on his tiptoes peering out the window to the other elven children playing and running around on the earthen floor below. They were squealing and laughing in their mock-battles, tempting him, and Zane was like a ball of pure energy just bursting to get out into the woods. He turned back to his mother with a slight blush on his face. <br>  <br> &#8220;Fai?&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;What do you mean, HUH?&#8221; his mother laughed as she tousled his soft brown hair. &#8220;I said yes child, you may go play in the forest. I assume your chores are finished. Oh but take your sister with you, please.&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Malanai! Laoine, shefaralach--&#8220; the little boy protested as his face fell. <br>  <br> His mother quickly interrupted. &#8220;--I won&#8217;t hear it, Zane! At least, not in Fier&#8217;Dal.&#8221; She tried not to break a smile. &#8220;We strive to speak Faydwer&#8217;s common language in this house little one, I don&#8217;t care what your uncle Jevry tells you. It just might come in handy for you some day.&#8221; <br>  <br> The small warrior wannabe sighed at his mother&#8217;s lecture. &#8220;Furthermore, your sister is NOT a nuisance. Don&#8217;t call her shefaralach. You will take her with you to play. Besides, I need somebody to keep you in line.&#8221; Aranthi winked at him. <br>  <br> It was then that Laoine bounded in. She had been hiding in the next room just around the corner. It was something she rather excelled at: both blending in with her surroundings &#8211; and eavesdropping on her twin brother. <br>  <br> &#8220;Soto-car laena sa Malanai, nyah Zane!&#8221; The little girl stuck out her tongue at him. Laoine began to skip around her less-than-pleased brother as she sang, &#8220;you have to take me with youuuuu, Mom said!&#8221; <br>  <br> Aranthi stood as she put her hands to her hips, and both children froze. Oops. They knew what THAT meant. &#8220;Eng talaenar!&#8221; she laid into them, &#8220;I mean -- that&#8217;s enough! Quit bickering, childrean. If you must fight, go outside and practice your dueling with broken tree branches which you seem to enjoy so much.&#8221; She put a palm to the top of each of the twin&#8217;s heads and gently herded her young ones to the door. &#8220;Now out you go!&#8221; their mother chuckled as she pushed the kids onto the porch. <br>  <br> Her shouting had been so loud that it awoke the childrens&#8217; father from his nap, and he rose from his chair in the reading room of their tree home. Evaun Jadestrike, mighty soldier of the Kelethin army, hardly looked the part as he blinked sleepily and shuffled in to see what all the noise was about. <br>  <br> He approached his wife from behind and wrapped his arms about her waist, putting a gentle kiss on her shoulder. &#8220;Where are those two off to?&#8221; he mused, waving out the window to his kids as they hopped on a lift and descended to the forest floor. <br>   <br> Through the window Evaun could hear Zane muttering to his twin sister about her being too little to climb the big dangerous trees with him. &#8220;Ela analalai galadhad deyash nek&#8217;tai, pira-pira...&#8221; <br>  <br> His father stifled a laugh. &#8220;Oh Aran, he&#8217;s gone and called her &#8216;pira&#8217;. She hates being told she&#8217;s too little.&#8221; His wife giggled, knowing Laoine would probably charge at her brother once they hit the ground level. &#8220;He&#8217;d better start running then!&#8221; she smirked. <br>  <br> &#8220;Gaya, geahren!&#8221; they could still hear their little girl verbally reaming her sibling, &#8220;Eng to ma na'ei pira negeth!&#8221; She did not believe she was not too little, not in her heart. YOU can just follow ME, she spat at him in Fier&#8217;Dal. <br>  <br> &#8220;Deyash eng nek&#8217;tai&#8230;&#8221; she muttered under her breath, &#8220;eshai&#8217;du.&#8221; <br>  <br> Up in the tree city, Evaun doubled over with laugher as Aranthi&#8217;s jaw dropped. She cupped her hands to her mouth and shouted out the open window before the children could get out of earshot. &#8220;And I DON&#8217;T want to hear you call your brother a dumbass ever again!!!&#8221; <br>  <br> ************************************************************* <br>  <br> Hours later the two were deep into the forest, still dueling with sticks and chasing each other in game after game of hide-and-seek. As elves they were active enough, but as children they were simply tireless. They were oblivious to the sun slowly setting in the sky. <br>  <br> &#8220;I&#8217;m sick of this Laoine, you&#8217;re too good at hiding. I can never find you,&#8221; Zane complained to his sister aloud while searching fruitlessly. <br>  <br> &#8220;Fine, fine&#8230;&#8221; She stepped out from behind a tree only a few feet behind him. <br>  <br> &#8220;Argh!&#8221; he frowned at her. &#8220;I hate that. Quit doing that, Laoine.&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Doing what? Hmph,&#8221; the little girl rolled her eyes, &#8220;if you like, I can seek you out, and you go hide.&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Yeah right,&#8221; Zane retorted as he shoved his twin&#8217;s upper arm. &#8220;The only thing you&#8217;re better at than being invisible, is tracking! Forget it.&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Let&#8217;s do something I&#8217;M best at this time,&#8221; the boy grinned at her. &#8220;I bet you can&#8217;t climb as high as me.&#8221; <br>  <br> Laoine put her hands on her hips, trying to convey the forcefulness of their mother. &#8220;Bet you I can too climb higher than you!&#8221; She glared at her brother, who looked less than intimated. Laoine huffed. &#8220;Pick a tree,&#8221; she told him. He pointed. <br>  <br> Zane was strong and nimble, but he lacked the stealth of his spry sister. In just seconds she had already monkeyed her way up fifteen thick branches of the ancient, sprawling pine. <br>  <br> &#8220;Look at me now, I&#8217;m something huh!&#8221; she shouted down to her brother, who was working his way to the fourth branch. The boy glared at her, and heaved his body up another level. <br>  <br> &#8220;I said who can climb higher Laoine, not FASTER!&#8221; He did not care for being outdone by his sister. &#8220;Bah. Showoff,&#8221; he mumbled as he reached for the next branch, not enjoying the way this was turning out. <br>  <br> Laoine was already around the twentieth level of the tree&#8217;s outstretched arms when she stood up, gaining great balance on a wide, sturdy branch. She shaded her eyes from the glare of the sun as it was beginning to set, and looked down the trunk of the tree for her brother. The young girl laughed to herself, seeing Zane was no further than halfway to her yet. She&#8217;d show him who was the &#8220;pira&#8221; elf. <br>  <br> From this height she could see the tops of shorter trees, probably a few hundred years younger than the one where she stood. Below her, she caught sight of a few birds flittering about on the breeze. The air was pure so high in the forest, and Laoine inhaled it deeply as she closed her eyes. She leaned her back to the immense center of the tree as she waited for her brother to catch up. Loving the feel of being at peace in the woods, she exhaled and smiled. <br>  <br> The wind picked up a bit, blowing stray strands from the little girl&#8217;s ponytail. She opened her eyes and sniffed the breeze. She caught trace of something, something that didn&#8217;t belong in the air. She glanced down and saw Zane still climbing, not too far out of reach now, but he was safe. What was it then? She looked up the tree and down it, and then around what she could see in the woods. Nothing. She knelt on all fours, crawling further out on the tree limb. She balanced herself quickly, sat upright, and listened&#8230; <br>  <br> &#8220;MADE IT!&#8221; Zane cheered exuberantly as he climbed onto the level where his sister had been waiting. She did not turn around. The boy dusted off his hands and steadied himself, looking to his sister. &#8220;Laoine?&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;I think something is down there,&#8221; was her quiet reply. <br>  <br> Zane wanted to ask her how she knew that, but remained silent and wasted no time drawing out his &#8216;weapon&#8217; &#8211; an rather unintimidating makeshift spear from a large piece of rolled-up worn oak bark. It previously had the intials &#8216;Z.J.&#8217; written on one side in boisonberry juice, but that had faded since the morning. <br>  <br> Straightening his shoulders bravely, he asked his sister &#8220;what do you think it could be?&#8221; She just seemed to have a good sense of things like that. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I thought I heard some sort of horn. Or a maybe a shout. It was very far off, real quiet,&#8221; she informed Zane, suddenly becoming serious, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know.&#8221; <br>  <br> An eastern wind blew a little harder through the treetops, and Laoine turned her face in to the current. The sky was slowly becoming lilac around them, and vision in the opposite direction was difficult because of the descending sun&#8217;s glare. The child squinted her eyes and scanned the ground, picking up on sounds being carried on the air towards them. <br>  <br> It was a voice. Their mother&#8217;s voice, coming from the east. Even Zane heard it this time. &#8220;Oh by Tunare, Laoine &#8211; it&#8217;s just Mom!&#8221; The boy put away his pretend weapon and relaxed. &#8220;We&#8217;re up here, Mom!&#8221; he waved and shouted down. <br>  <br> Turning her back to the sunset, Laoine finally saw her mother&#8217;s figure, looking something like a dot from her place high in the treetop. Aranthi had come all this way to collect them for mealtime. She did not like her babies going so far off into Greater Fay, especially with night coming. <br>  <br> &#8220;You kids have been out here a long time!&#8221; she yelled up into the trees, searching as she tried to place her son&#8217;s voice. They were closeby, and stories high in the air, no doubt. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for dinner now!&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Be down in a minute Mom!&#8221; shouted Zane, never one to miss a meal. Laoine stood, and grabbed him by the wrist. &#8220;Hold on,&#8221; she said, her eyes darting about their surroundings. Zane whined, &#8220;you&#8217;re always thinking I&#8217;m rushing into something Laoine, come on, it&#8217;s time to eat!&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Hold&#8230;&#8221; Laoine repeated in the same tone, not looking at her brother but still gripping his wrist. She heard it again, the horn. It was definitely there this time, but coming from the West. One, long, low trumpet. Something like a water beacon in the fog, but deeper and more distorted. <br>  <br> There it was again. Zane obviously heard it too the second time, and he turned to his sister with uncertain wide eyes. Another long, low trumpet, and closer this round. Like the sound of pain being drawn out unwillingly. The sound of impending gore. It was the call for collection to battle. <br>  <br> It was the call of the orcs. <br>  <br> &#8220;GAYA FALADAR, FALADAR ORC! ORCS!!!&#8221; Laoine screamed at the absolute top of her lungs, to anyone who could hear. &#8220;THERE ARE ORCS APPROACHING!!!&#8221; <br>  <br> But no one else was there to hear. Stupid. Utterly stupid, she thought. Why did they stray so far from the city to play in these trees? They were not in orc territory, not by far, but orcs had a way of coming to you&#8230; <br>  <br> &#8220;Mother!&#8221; Zane cried out to her, his young voice screeching from more than a hundred feet above. The little boy&#8217;s yell was not a plea for help, but a battlecry of protection. The night had surrounded them already, and despite his elven vision he could not spot Aranthi below. &#8220;MOTHER!!!&#8221; he wailed and began scrambling as fast as he could down the pine, branch by massive branch. <br>  <br> Laoine assumed, she hoped, that her mother was making her way into some trees already, wherever she was. &#8220;Zane, please!&#8221; she shouted to him, desperately attempting to catch up, &#8220;It&#8217;s safer to be high up where they cannot reach us!&#8221; She felt the shaking ground reverberate through the tree as she climbed; orcs marching, running, making their way through the forest at top speed. Again the ground shook, waving the established pine as if it was a sapling. The orcs were many, and they were closing in. <br>  <br> Her brother was stubborn though, and rushed to reach their mother to ensure she was defended. &#8220;Please wait Zane!&#8221; Laoine yelped, the next jolting shake causing her to lose grip of the tree&#8217;s trunk. She began to fall. Zane stopped climbing in time to see his sister shriek and tip backwards. <br>  <br> The branch directly below her jutted out and caught the back of her head as she fell, snapping her neck forward and bouncing her small body down a few more levels on the tree. The girl landed on her back, her limbs thrown outwards as her body tangled around a thinner, gnarled branch that was barely wide enough to support her weight. <br>  <br> &#8220;No! By Tunare,&#8221; cursed Zane as he helplessly watched his sister fall far below him, &#8220;I&#8217;m coming to help you, Laoine!&#8221; In a haze of terrifying darkness and noise, his sister did not hear him. A stream of blood spilled down her neck from the back of her skull, some of it trickling into her mouth as she lay prone, her head tilted painfully. <br>  <br> She teetered in and out of consciousness for what seemed to her like hours, but was really just less than a minute after they had first heard the horn go off&#8230; She neither noticed nor tasted the blood now seeping onto her tongue. She did not see the swarm of leaves falling around her from the trembling woods. She could not smell the telltale stench of seething orc fury coming closer, surrounding them. But she began to hear her mother. <br>  <br> Aranthi screamed like a banshee taking on an army, swearing and cursing unrecognizably on the ground, promising the impending orcs death first before they would ever come to harm her babies, and telling her son and daughter to stay in the pines, stay in the pines... their mother ran, flying almost faster than the wind, leading the horde of ravaging orcs away from the trees where she had heard her childrens&#8217; voices. <br>  <br> Laoine&#8217;s eyes fluttered as Zane&#8217;s body weight shook the branch they shared. He had leapt down a great distance from above, racing to her side, but stopped. &#8220;Laoine&#8230;&#8221; He stepped closer, the arm of the tree bouncing and weakening at the thin midsection. It began to make cracking noises, growing louder as he got closer to his sister&#8217;s body.  <br>  <br> Some measure away and below them, orcs were howling but their noise was becoming softer as they traveled off. But over it all, they could hear their mother&#8217;s horrific scream. Laoine shot up in place. <br>  <br> *RIIIIIIIIIIIIP, CLUNK* <br>  <br> In the instant the branch snapped and fell away below her, Zane grabbed hold of his sister&#8217;s grasp, jerking out his reach as her body began to hurtle down. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you!&#8221; he yelled, laying himself flat against the sturdy surface of what remained from the pine&#8217;s branch. <br>  <br> Had their places been switched, she could not have rescued him. But the boy was immeasurably strong, and heaved up his sister as she clung to him. Zane had saved her from falling. <br>  <br> He reached his other arm over the edge quickly to grab Laoine&#8217;s dangling hand and pull her up. As he did so, he grunted in agony as a jagged shard of broken wood sliced deep into the tissue of his forearm, snapping off from the tree as it split between the bones. He cried aloud and forced all his will to pull Laoine up with his other arm. <br>  <br> Though she was weakened and barely coherent, she managed to grasp his slipping hand and struggle up again. With her brother&#8217;s help they made it to the inside branch, collapsed and huddled together. <br>  <br> Again somewhere far off, they could hear Aranthi&#8217;s tortured scream. Laoine bit her lip and squeezed her eyes tight, enveloped in fear as she began to chant half-memorized prayers to their goddess Tunare. <br>  <br> Zane inhaled a giant breath and pulled his sister to him, holding her tightly. He was torn up inside, as every fiber of his person wanted to rush to his mother&#8217;s defense. Though the child had inherited enough of his father&#8217;s military wits to know this would be a futile war to wage, he could not live with himself if he didn&#8217;t go after her. But he was frozen with fear. <br>  <br> Laoine was so petrified there in the blackness of the high trees that she passed out in her brother&#8217;s arms. After tearing part of his tunic off to bind up the gash on his forearm, Zane wiped the blood from Laoine&#8217;s face and neck, and shivered. It was then that the screaming stopped. No sounds could be heard anymore, from anywhere. There, holding his broken sister in the silence of the night, he began to weep. <br>  <br> His mind was frenzied and disbelieving. They would have to wait til morning to come down, or until someone found them. It was so quiet now. As quickly as they had arrived, the orcs were gone. Nothing was left but a deep path of footprints below them, and an even deeper trail of tears ahead. <br>  <br> ************************************************************* <br>

				&lt;raises her hand&gt; Hi, my name is Deyorra, and I have a shameful secret identity... I'm actually an ELF... &lt;sob&gt; <br>  <br> Okay so this is my new alt, Laoine the ranger. =) I've never really tried to write anything before (or if I have I've been too scared to post it, hehe) so this is just for fun. I have two more parts after this in mind, to take place when she is 16 and again at 24 -- or the human equivalent, that is -- so we'll see if I get around to it. =P Thank you for reading and I appreciate any helpful critques, etc!
