				For those who know me, you know my light-heartedness and eagerness to make you smile. For 3 and a half years I have played EQ and always found customer service to be...while slow at times... always fair. But when does this end, when does the internal bias and the focus of service turn to the personal will of the inner circle of verant employees and their friends.  <br>  <br> At 8:49pm est Ledian From the everquest coordinating staff sent me a tell regarding a character I had on my account which was a comical spoof of my ex-guildleader Ranadin.  <br>  <br> This character had been in existance since the period of time I was in Ranadin's guild &quot;The Dark Exile&quot; and was known to Ranadin. The character was logged on a private channel on Thursday July 11, and never sent a tell to Ranadin nor made slanderous comments directed to him. However, using whatever ties and whatever means it was brought to verant attention and escalated to the scale that my account was banned. <br>  <br> The irony of the situation lies in due process... if the name was so offensive... why 6 months later. And what of the other countless ranadin spoofs constantly being created... some even leveled, why do they go unpunished. Why on the nameless and other servers, do stalkers and spoofs go by with a simple soulbound warning and I get a suspension? Why when a certain special individual says jump, the VI Customer Service asks how &quot;high&quot;?  <br>  <br> We pay our money each month, to play this game and recieve customer service where neccesary. One would hope for your money's worth you would recieve an unbiased and just treatment from those individuals representing the company you are paying.  <br>  <br> But my question stands, Is it just to ban the account of someone with no previous standing soulbound markers? Is it just to ban the account of someone so directly and so personally slighted by the individual being mocked and yet leave the true guilty party unpunished?  <br>  <br> My challenge to everyone, and the verant staff who will subsequently be recieving this in your email, is to reprioritize what a major offense is. A definite and clear look into your policies should be taken.  <br>  <br> The person you hold in such high regard and place a halo on his head is no angel. He has unwritten policies in place regarding loot in exchange for account and personal info, and while you will defend yourself with the legal bullshit of &quot;never give out your personal info&quot; you will still continue to defend your own best interests... including those of your favorites. You will toss blind eye to the multiboxing of accounts under different names (Account sharing), toss blind eye to the item duping, pathing cheats, and clipping abuse. But yet... a name carries so heavy a penalty?  <br>  <br> Forget the abuses suffered daily in a high pressure and highly competitive environment... Your angelic dictator offers salvation...&quot;just say your account name and password and you get the items&quot;...the exchange of a few words for the status symbols and items a person desires...but wait, banish the thought of saying &quot;yes&quot;... because in a realistic world a normal human being would &quot;never give out personal info&quot;. The sheer notion of someone saying no, when such a choice is presented is laughable at best. Quite simply put... the will to achieve and be &quot;the best&quot; is inate in human nature.  <br>  <br> In the end I am left dissapointed and curious. Curious to what depths the corruption extends. Who knows what sorts of gm favors are going on under the table all the time, assistance killing mobs, character twinking, and more all come to mind.  <br>  <br> If you are as disturbed with the system as I am... voice your thoughts acrosby@soe.sony.com ... that's ledian's unnamed supervisor who dictated this. Please be so kind as to share your thoughts with him.  <br>  <br> As for me I dont know if I will come back once my suspension is over, no sense wasting my money to fuel the will of someone I hate so much. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Oh one final question Ledian, when you login, do YOU click &quot;yes&quot; to the Policy Agreement? <br>  <br> -Tovaxx  <br>  <br> oh and mrmagoo... pull your hand out of your pants when you flame this... you know who you are.

				CS in EQ has always been kinda shady since early beta. <br>  <br>  <br> I could go into stories about ganking characters when they we're zoning or hex editing peoples weapons into &quot;I BUTTFUCK GMS&quot; to get them banned or even hex editing a stack of rubies to have unlimited Spirit Tap charges so I could solo Lower guk not to mention using the old trade window dupe  BUT I don't see any reason for nostalgia so I will just say that some people get away with tons of shit (I'm reformed now thx~) while other people use something as gay as a speed hack and get banned the first 5min they are loged on with it. <br>  <br> I know your not talking about exploiting but it's kinda the same comparison as I have also had my own choice name for mules, not really to mock just something to do. <br>  <br> What it really boils down too is the fact that I am irish (YA HOLY SHIT IM NOT ASIAN~~~~ ^___^) so I'm naturaly lucky when it comes to not getting caught. <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;Your angelic dictator offers salvation...&quot;just say your account name and password and you get the items&quot;...the exchange of a few words for the status symbols and items a person desires...&quot; <br>  <br> I'm assuming your talking about Ranadin here because I've heard this argument about him before and when I was in TDE which was along time ago, almost 2 years I dono, but I never had to give up my PW/login to him to win loots or get my epic or anything like that, granted I would have because he did a shit load for me and gave me a few 2nd chances when I fucked up but like I said he never asked, maybe it's because I wasn't level 60 but regardless he never had my info and I'm sure he doesn't want everyones info who joins TDE, maybe he does have the info for some people but I can see in some cases this would be important and I don't think the first thing you get asked when your guild invited is &quot;login infoz plz! -_-;;&quot; atleast I didn't. <br>  <br> &quot;You will toss blind eye to the multiboxing of accounts under different names (Account sharing), toss blind eye to the item duping, pathing cheats, and clipping abuse. But yet... a name carries so heavy a penalty?&quot;  <br>  <br>  <br> I 2 box multiple accounts with EQW and some of them aren't mine but like who fuckin cares~ account sharing has been part of EQ for a long long time and especialy in the uper tier guilds, you don't think Furor doesn't have the login infos for alot of his guildmembers? I'm sure he does, and it's not a real hard thing to figure out why and about the name thing ya it sucks you got busted over something stupid like that but what I find confusing is you question Ledian about clicking YES to the agreeement but you know theres a naming policy that pretty much says HEY DONT MAKE OFFENSIVE NAMES OR BAD SHITS GONA GO DOWN YO~ right? <br>  <br> Really though what I say about drama that goes on in the 7th hammer doesn't matter to much as I'm more of a ghost now that I sold off my account and started playing on a differnt server, maybe I will be back... some day. <br>  <br> However I will say that this msg board is dead compared to what it used to be so if you want people to hear what you have to say i'd try over on the 7th hammer EZboard msg board, dono the URL off hand but just search for it on like google.

				Customer service is a group of people who are suppose to be fair and just. But let us face it, life is not that, in fact we are all at the mercy of someone else.  People can and do get away with a lot of things and the short story is Verant is still making their money.   <br> If people stopped paying and playing this game until verant fixed everything that needed to be, then we would all be much better off, but people are trying to camp that item, get that urber gear and will not stop playing this game even with bugs and unfair practices. <br>  <br> Good luck though!!

				Oh yeah, you forgot to mention that you told gm to &quot;FUCK OFF&quot; when gm told you to delete the character.(Ranadinhashiv I heard, right?) Who the fuck are you blaiming for your own faults lol. Pathetic.  <br>  <br> The Vn vault post you made, all that flames without any specific example are almost funny. After all, you didn't get banned for ebaying did you? (hey, I got ss of you telling me the pvp no drop transfer bug to get primal and me saying &quot;no&quot; ^^) <br>  <br> Stop trying to cover your fault by blaiming me or TDE. <br>  <br> I had no idea of how this happened(got better things to do then getting your lame ass banned) nor had anything to do with it. <br>  <br> ps: Just because others got away with doing something illegal don't mean you can do that without getting caught and punished does it?  You broke the rule, you told Gm to fuck off when he caught you.   <br>  <br> WHOS FAULT IS THAT? <br>  <br>

				i didnt get banned for ebaying...it's b/c I never did... you on the other hand...dirac...now stfu. <br>  <br> And in regards to your saying you hadnt been on for a week. it only verifies the multiaccounting in tde, b/c ranadin was on to post the petition.  <br>  <br> As for telling the gm to fuckoff when he asked me to delete....thats funny because I was never asked to delete... the gm's took action 19 hours after the character LOGGED off after I got tired of playing. Funny how you think you know everything. <br>  <br> As for screenshots..... Ranadin tells you,'Would you object to giving your password to a select few officers if you were allowed to loot (sontalak) talisman?' <br>  <br> Or perhaps the one where you were telling me to put velium swiftblade and glowing black sword on dain so that sanc would fail. <br>  <br> there's more of those SS's than you can ever match. <br>  <br> So mark, need I continue the proof? I think not, talk to me in game. <br>  <br>

				I usualy just surf the Boards for a laugh and this made me fall out of my chair.  <br>  <br> Ranadin your so fricken easily taunted and predictable.  <br>  <br> First why would a GM be giving you feed back about a simple name violation? I have turned in several names over the years and no GM has said &quot;hey so and so said fuck off&quot;. You basicly confirmed what he was probably fishing for. That you are indead in bed with some GM's.  <br>  <br> Sometimes you win by not saying anything at all.  <br>  <br>  <br> Binpus  <br> Ex used TDE member  <br> (growing everyday) <br>  <br>  <br>
