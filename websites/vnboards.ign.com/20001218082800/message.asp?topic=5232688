				This is just what I had emailed to Gordon, and what I posted on both the Wishlist and Gameplay forum in the official everquest boards. I decided you should all see what I had said. <br> Note that since then I could have made plenty of additions to this, stating what really we could do with an 'ENFORCED' roleplay server. By means of what new rules would be made present. We can all work together and make a better judgement on this. <br> -------- <br>  <br>                I would first like to begin by pointing out on the box label it says that EverQuest is a  RPG, role playing game. This, like Ultima Online and others has been confused with different types of  'Role Play'. A definition of Roleplay is to play out your characters 'role' in life. You speak, act and feel what your 'character' should be feeling. This would be confused with games like Final Fantasy Seven, that has been called an RPG, as well as many other console games. The RPG label is too wide of an area to work with, many people would buy it because they like to roleplay, others might buy it because it looks like a cool new type of Final Fantasy Type game.  <br>  <br> 	Creating a server with a requirement to roleplay would not be denying others the use of the server. There are so many games with multiple servers, with different rules. For example, Ultima Online has its orrigional servers, and it also has the Siege Perilous server. Anyone can join that server, it would just be much more difficult to play there if you cannot co-operate with other people in the game. A server based upon 'real' roleplay would only be a different type of choice available to the thousands of people playing on EverQuest.    <br>  <br> 	I understand you cannot deny service or a server to people because they cannot perform the simple task of roleplay. Nor am I asking that you make a server that bans people who do not roleplay. Somewhere I remember reading a signature on a message board saying. 'Powergamers can ignore Roleplayers, Roleplayers cannot ignore Powergamers' That is a very true statement. We cannot /ignore someone, why? Because it does not achieve anything except remove their speach and spam from your screen. They can still attack and kill you, even harrass you. This also brings up the fact that to ignore someone would be a downside to roleplaying, a Dark Elf cannot mute out the foul slang of the level 50 gnomish necromancer killing the Neriak guards. <br>  <br> 	As it is known, all the roleplayers are spread out on different servers. All attempts to locate a majority to a particular server have failed because everyone wants others to come to theirs. We need a server that just has an outline saying it is 'mainly' for roleplayers. This way people that enjoy the same thing can come together and actually have a decent roleplay, and even social or political issues happening with the affairs of the races.  People would come to this server not because it is a new server and attempt to move in 'hope' of roleplay. But they would come here because of the knowledge that it is free of the silent abuse of the powergamers and general non-roleplayers. It would be a place to be in peace if you choose, to remain in your home town and make a living off of tailoring. Or to become a warrior, train hard and seek out fights with evil, or good. <br>  <br> 	Meanwhile, every shard EverQuest has is for the public in general, which we all must admit is mainly consisting of non-roleplayers. I hear that you cannot say that a server is designated to roleplayers, but you can say that one is mainly designated to the general population. They far more then a dozen servers to themselves, we have none. <br>  <br> 	It is not hard to figure what an enforced roleplay server would be like. You would have the choice to roleplay, or not play. There are over a dozen other servers to choose from, creating a server for roleplayers would only make people happy. I do not see a downside to saying non-roleplayers cannot go in this shard. They would be able to play in the shards they are currently on, while we would play on the shard we would have received. A motd that pops up before character creation that explains the server, and the tweaked rules of the server would work fine. It would strongly suggest roleplaying, due to the hostile world. This would be worked as if it were a pvp server, so that any player who doesnt know what he or she is doing on the shard might meet an untimely fate by the hands of another player of a different alignment, even if he was the same race. <br>  <br> 	To say what a general Idea to roleplay is, without infringing on any rules or to deny use of a server to any particular group of people might be wrong or difficult. But we do not want to say that people were tricked into buying this game, in hopes it might be what we have always wanted, that the label told us this was perhaps finally a RolePlay game. We do not want this to become another Ultima Online.  <br> ----- <br>  <br> There you go, for your reading pleasure. <br> Please get all your friends and or guildmates to check out this board.

				[[[It would be a place to be in peace if you choose, to remain in your home town and make a living off of tailoring. ]]] <br>  <br> I wish they would let that work. =( I sooo wanted to be a tailor and nothing but a tailor, but when you start the game broke, you need to hunt for some money. Well, ya hunt for that then you buy the sewing kit. Then you hunt more to get patterns. Then you need to kill the animals for the pelts. So, finally you start to make stuff. Well, very few players want to buy it and sells back to the merchants for a horrible cost. And you are forced to keep hunting and killing more than tailoring just to keep enough money to work on the skill. <br>  <br> Jewelcraft. I have a high elf enchanter that is a jeweler (currently have 65 in it! woohoo!) and has lost a good 700plat just getting to where he is now in the skill. I can see some money loss, but when you create a ring, jade for example, and pay six gold for the bar and four plat for the gem, then enchant the bar and make the ring. Well, the merchants think those +5hp and mana rings are pretty much as useful as the gem itself, because the only give you the cost of the gem plus a couple silver back when selling to them. *sigh* I doubt they'll ever do anything for us roleplayers. They haven't yet, so why would they now? <br>  <br> -Dret Delurthan <br> Halfing Rogue of Xegony <br> Proud member of The Doom Guild
