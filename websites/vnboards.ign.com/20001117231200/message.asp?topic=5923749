				This started out as a thank you e-mail to a kind warrior that had encouraged a shaman and high lvl cleric to Watch over our new group as we fought Dervish Cutthroats in WC...So never mind the flipping in and out of character, hope you enjoy...!!!  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;Gormley,  <br>  <br> Hail and well met big brother... As I put quill to parchment, I'm reminded of a kindness payed from a night not long ago (e.g. last night) to a stranger you'd never met who shared but one thing with you - the blood of countless Dervish Cutthroats coating our angry blades like the bitter snow upon the plains. I've seen many a blade swung in my time, some in anger and some in fear, but the legendary Nathsar Greatsword clasped in your hero's hand sang with a deafening battle cry as it danced from Cutthroat to Cutthroat ringing their death knell as it exacted it's retribution with merciless fury.  <br>  <br> As infused with the will of the gods as you were, even you finally succumbed to the siren song of sleep (or work the next day hehe). But as your body grew weary, still your heart burned with a deafening fury that would not allow you to leave the group you had so valiantly protected without some measure of safety. So with a gentle /shout you proclaimed to all the lands that you would bestow a gift of platinum to whomever would ensure your group was kept out of harm's way. In this land, legends follow legends, and as it was, 2 more of Norrath's heros answered the call to arms and watched over your adolescent group as they continued to fight the good fight to rid Norrath of these Braveheart rejects and ganja smokin casters.  <br>  <br> And as Gormley nodded in askance to the 2 heros, and as the babes swaddled in leather and armor wept their goodbyes, Gormley vanished into the shadows as a quietly as a wisp is engulfed by night's murky darnkess. With that, the stalwart group of which remained an Iksar Necromancer, a Dark Elf Cleric, and a Human Paladin of Light, glanced nervously at each other when suddenly they were surrounded by brilliant flashes of light accompanied by cool breezes and a sound that mimicked angels playing in the distance. One by one, each member of the group felt their minds become clearer, felt their muscles become stronger, and their reactions and awareness heighten to a level previously unknown to them.  <br>  <br> Quickly realizing the gift that had been bestowed on them, they glanced once more at each other, not with the nervousness upon Gormley's departure, but now with a devilish grin of understanding, an understanding that the Dervish Cutthroats were about to engage in the fight of their lives. Without another moment passing, the group turned to face the Cutthroats and launched themselves into a frenzied attack cutting a swath through the stalwart defenders making their way to the spell casting mage. Bursts of flame, wind, lightning and ice buffeted each of the newly minted heroes, but their enchantments held, and continued to deafen the blow inflicted by the caster.  <br>  <br> Misjudging a Derv's swing, the Paladin felt a sword connect ever so briefly with his arm inflicting a horrible pain and a bloody gash where a bracer once offered protection. To his sudden surprise, he felt the pain almost immediately vanish and then watched in amazement as the wound began to close until smoothe undamaged skin lay where a gash once was. It was at that moment that the Paladin looked up just in time to see the Cutthroat coming in for the final kill. As the Cutthroat's blade descended on the hapless Paladin, he deftly maneuvered out of harm's way with a swiftness known only to wolves, and the blade bit into grass where his body lay only moments ago.  <br>  <br> In a split second, the Paladin was on his feet and countering with his own death blow, a death blow that quickly found it's mark as it plunged into the side of the Cutthroat. As the Derv felt his life slip away, he muttered the words, &quot;I will be avenged!&quot; and slipped into darkness. Vengeance came swiftly as the Paladin suddenly felt himself flying through the air, as a blast of energy hit his back and exploded with the fury of a meteor crashing into a planet. Had this been a normal man, he most certainly would have been killed instantly, but his magical enchantments protected him from the otherworldly force as he met the ground and rolled to regain control.  <br>  <br> He quickly stood up and renewed his charge on the mage and when he was almost in striking distance, an angry glow began to emanate behind the hatred of eyes burning red as blood as the Paladin felt energy pulse through the air in waves like ripples in the ocean. He had only moments to react to this new threat, and glancing down at the ground, he noticed a simple shield that had been dropped in the battle. He jumped on it, rolled as he picked it up, and then threw himself into the energy wielding mage effectively knocking him over. The angry glow quickly subsided and before the mage could regain his concentration, he had a sword sliding its way through his chest to stab the ground beneath him.  <br>  <br> Watching the life slip from the mage, the Paladin heard yells of help behind him and to the right (hehe) and noticed the cleric and necromancer were fighting for their lives against clearly superior opponents. Somewhat bruised but otherwise unbeaten, he let loose a mighty YAULP as he launched into the fray and quickly dispatched the tattered remains of the Camp defenders. Standing there surrounded by the bodies of their foes, heaving and panting from the exertion, the Paladin met the tired gaze of his battle hardened group with a look of recognition, and with his last bit of strength he hefted his mighty sword into the air, and proclaimed to all - &quot;Freeeeeeeeeeedooooooom!!!!&quot; (whoops wrong fantasy) I meant, &quot;For the Glory of NORRATH!!!&quot;  <br>  <br> sort of the end...  <br> &quot;  <br>  <br> Funny how these e-mails get out of hand sometimes...  <br>  <br> :)  <br> <p>
