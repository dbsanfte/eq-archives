				Not my post. But very good summary <br>  <br> The post was written by Wolfshead... <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink target="_blank" href=" http://forums.gucomics.com/viewtopic.php?t=2057&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=315"> http://forums.gucomics.com/viewtopic.php?t=2057&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=315</a>  <br>  <br> Open letter to all who are attending the EQ summit and those who love EverQuest,  <br>  <br> The problem with EQ is not Word of Warcraft or City of Heroes. The problem with EQ is not the hundreds of thousands of loyal players who've paid the bills for EQ for over 5 years. I submit to you the problem with EQ is SOE. All of the major problems of EQ find their genesis in SOE and in their subsequent mismanagement. How then did the most successful online game in history go so wrong?  <br>  <br> Let's examine some of the problems and how we got to this point:  <br>  <br>  <br> THE PROBLEMS  <br>  <br> DOMINANCE OF THE RAID CENTRIC MENTALITY and THE RISE OF THE UBERGUILD  <br>  <br> EverQuest was never designed to be a raiding game. It was designed to primarily focus on group interdependence in a persistent online world. The EQ Devs were caught off guard by the tenacity of the uberguild phenomena. These guilds consumed content like locusts and in many cases actually tested major encounters. Uberguilds were also consuming content faster then the Devs could create it and they complained quite vociferously to SOE on their websites. Somehow the uberguild members got elevated to superstar status given all of the attention from SOE. Wanting to see the latest exploits of the uberguilds players would live vicariously through them by visiting their websites. Imagine gamers in a fantasy world fantasizing about being Furor and killing creatures they could only dream about killing? It&#8217;s perhaps the ultimate irony of online gaming.  <br>  <br> Somehow as EQ morphed into a &quot;raiding&quot; game and the little guy with a job and a family got forgotten and left behind. With people like Furor and other guild leaders complaining the loudest, the squeaky wheel got the proverbial grease and EQ expansions starting with Planes of Power officially became raid centric with 80% of its zones only available by completing trials and flags. If you wanted to truly succeed and see the content in EQ you had to join a uber guild and raid 6 hours per day in a quasi-military like fashion. Despite being a small minority of the playerbase all of EQ's resources were focused on keeping the uberguilds satiated with content at the expense of normal and casual gamers.  <br>  <br> No longer is EQ an online game about grouping to solve quests and adventures. It is primarily about raiding. As many have pointed out the gap between the normal/casual gamer and the powergamer/uberguilds has never been wider. At one point in Norrath we were all just players. We all had the same chance to go to Lower Guk and Nagafen's Lair. No longer is that the case. EQ has become a caste system of the pampered uber vs. the great unwashed normal gamer. The EQ playerbase has become polarized and it's destroying the game.  <br>  <br>  <br> THE DEATH OF EPIC STORY TELLING AND THE RISE OF THE WAYFARERS  <br>  <br> EverQuest was always a game about humans, elves, dwarves and dragons. That is the stuff that high fantasy is made of. Many on this thread have brought up this point. Scars of Velious was the pinnacle of epic storytelling with the battle between the Dragons, the Dwarves and the Frost Giants. Online gaming reached heights unseen with the massive battle of the Ring War and the ultimate quest of the Coldain Shawl. EverQuest was at its finest. Then Luclin was released with the introduction of something very un-fantasy: aliens from space and cuddly cat people living on the moon. Luclin also heralded the dreaded concept of timesinks and guilds that would &quot;own&quot; content by keeping smaller guilds out in zones like Vex Thall.  <br>  <br> With the release of Planes of Power at least the designers focused on EQ's previously successful lore with it's tale of the gods despite its obvious pandering to uberguilds with 80% of content closed off to the normal gamer.  <br>  <br> Enter Morden Rasp and his band of followers, the Wayfarers Brotherhood. These characters are the new salesmen of Norrath. Got a new expansion? Who you gonna call? Why Morden Rasp of course. No longer would epic figures of Norrathian history like Firiona Vie and Lany's T`vil make history with their deeds. The Wayfarers have been the worst example of epic storytelling I've ever seen in an online game. They are a clever, convenient device used to market and sell an expansion. EQ used to be a game about slaying powerful dragons and entering the planes of the gods. Now it's about working 9-5 for Morden Rasp and his Wayfarers. Instead of being a part of unfolding history we are subject to monthly snippets of text from Morden. Never has the dream of EQ been so betrayed by such a shabby storyline.  <br>  <br> Finally you have Gates of Discord, with a plot that makes no sense. You have unpronounceable zone and NPC names that sound more like exotic food then Norrath lore. More loot, trials and flags for the Time enabled crowd. Again the normal player is left behind but expected to buy the new expansion and foot the bill for the fun of a few.  <br>  <br>  <br> IGNORING THE PLAYERBASE  <br>  <br> For years the EQ playerbase has been posting on the problems of EQ but their cries have fallen on deaf ears. The cancellation of the official EQ Forums was the beginning of an isolationist, bunker mentality of the SOE. In time Yantis would start buying out all of the various class and community forums. Delicious irony since it backfired in their faces. Now we had Dracula (Yantis) in charge of the blood bank (the player forums). Five years later SOE has re-opened the Forums and seems to &quot;care&quot;. Somewhere at the SOE office in San Diego a light bulb finally went off and they realized that supporting the community of players is essential for success.  <br>  <br> Even at FanFaire the attitude of the EQ Devs has grown more defensive and obstinate as they refuse to discuss many legitimate issues raised by players who've spend thousands of dollars to travel there. SOE has squandered the advice and suggestions of it's customers for years now. Why? Because they were the only game in town and could get away with it. No more.  <br>  <br> For deeper insight read this illuminating article authored by SOE&#8217;s Raph Koster and Rich Vogel entitled &#8220;How to Manage a Large-Scale Online Gaming Community&#8221;:  <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink target="_blank" href=" http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/gdc_2002_community_files/frame.htm"> http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/gdc_2002_community_files/frame.htm</a>  <br>  <br>  <br> WHAT HAPPENED TO GAMEMASTERS, QUESTS, EVENTS, and the BOTB?  <br>  <br> Shortly after SOE took over Verant, one of the biggest deceptions ever perpetrated on the EQ playerbase was introduced: the Legends premium server. Players would now be treated based on how much they were paying for EQ. No longer would dynamic GM events ever happen on regular servers as server assigned GM's were removed. If you wanted live events and GM's then you had to pay the big bucks on Legends. This was the beginning of the end of EQ as we know it.  <br>  <br> The Quest Troupe was also dissolved so that Legends would appear more attractive. Around the same time SOE decided to eliminate the Questmaster positions. The Best of the Best Events were also cancelled. The spirit of EQ which was that anything could happen and that gods could visit Norrath was over. Gone were the altered datasets for zones during Halloween and other occasions. With all these changes, it seemed the very lifeblood and magic of EverQuest had been removed just to save a few bucks.  <br>  <br>  <br> PROFITS BEFORE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME  <br>  <br> SOE has always put profits before the integrity of their product and now the chickens are coming home to roost. GoD is easily the least popular of any EQ expansion to date and SOE in their typical &quot;money grubbin&quot; style has yet another expansion waiting in the wings to extract more cash from the players. The problem is the players have finally caught on and have drawn a line in the sand. Enough is enough.  <br>  <br> EQ has never been more profitable with the myriad of services that SOE now charges for such as character transfers, first name changes and Legends. Smedley loves to brag about how many subscribers EQ has. Why then has SOE cutback on so many of its staff like developers, testers, and Gamemasters? Why have they outsourced GM jobs to India and the UK?  <br>  <br> Things were not always this way at SOE as this Business 2.0 article points out:  <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink target="_blank" href=" http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,514908,00.html"> http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,514908,00.html</a>   <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink target="_blank" href=" http://www.adamparnes.com/archives/00000091.html"> http://www.adamparnes.com/archives/00000091.html</a>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;EverQuest also relies on 47 staffers to continually add items and quests to the game; another 128 &quot;game masters&quot; function as customer service reps and patrol the world answering questions.&quot;  <br>  <br>  <br> SOE now has just a handful of in-house staffers and GM's compared to the numbers they used to have. No wonder game instability and lack of Customer service are some of the biggest complaints players have with SOE.  <br>  <br> EQ has been a cash cow for SOE and its only profitable venture so far. In fact EQ subscribers have been subsidizing the development of EQ2 for years now at the expense of the very game they are paying for. Most of the problems with EQ can be attributed to lack of funding for proper testing of expansions that end up released unfinished and full of bugs. It&#8217;s also common knowledge that there are only a few actual employees left working on EQ live. They are overworked and overburdened and the results show.  <br>  <br> Consider how understaffed SOE is at this moment and then read the bravado from Smedley from the same Business 2.0 article:  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;Would you believe we've generated over $1 million in revenue simply from moving characters?&quot; Smedley marvels.  <br>  <br>  <br> It&#8217;s not too late to fix EQ. They need to listen to the whole community not just the voices of a privileged few. Here are a few suggestions many of them similar to what has already been posted:  <br>  <br>  <br> THE SOLUTIONS  <br>  <br> FIX THE BUGS and STOP IGNORING YOUR CUSTOMERS  <br>  <br> Before you release any more expansions fix the bugs first. Make EQ stable before you add one more iota of content. Address the concerns that various class boards have been raising for years now. Learn some humility and start to listen. No more excuses.  <br>  <br>  <br> POPULATE OLD UNUSED ZONES WITH NEW CONTENT  <br>  <br> No more expansions! Less is more. Most zones are empty across Norrath. Use the existing geography to realize the dream of a living, thriving Norrath complete with political and factional intrigue.  <br>  <br>  <br> STOP PANDERING TO UBERGUILDS and FOCUS ON CONTENT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE  <br>  <br> The gap between uberguilds and normal players has never been wider. This is the number one problem facing EQ. For all the attention you have lavished on them, the uberguilds are leaving EQ fast and furious. Focus on content for the great majority of normal to casual gamers before it's too late. Start supporting small guilds that are non-elemental. No more flags or trials. Create alternate pathways for success in this game that don&#8217;t involve 72 person raids. Create amazing dungeons that everyone can use like Lower Guk and Nagafen&#8217;s Lair.  <br>  <br>  <br> FIRE MORDEN RASP and CREATE A MORE COMPELLING EPIC STORYLINE  <br>  <br> Bring back the spirit of old EQ with a return to ancient struggles between the Dragons, the Giants and the various factions of Norrath. Morden Rasp and his band of merry Wayfarers need to go. Morden&#8230;you&#8217;re fired!  <br>  <br>  <br> HIRE MORE DEVS, QA and GAMEMASTERS  <br>  <br> Start using the profits of EQ to hire more Devs, Quality Assurance and Gamemasters. The poor quality and instability of EQ is directly proportional to how much money has been spent on staffing.  <br>  <br>  <br> PUT THE QUEST BACK INTO EVERQUEST  <br>  <br> EverQuest needs a complete revamp to its Quest system. Make quests meaningful and worthwhile. More live and scripted events too. Create quests worthy of the name EverQuest!  <br>  <br>  <br> MAKE EVERQUEST FUN AGAIN  <br>  <br> Somehow EQ stopped being fun. Everyone has said this over and over. EQ needs a serious does of fun injected into its lifeless body. The problem is that there are so many pressing issues that need to be addressed the fun/cool factor of EQ has long been neglected due to inadequate staffing and resources. The 5th Anniversary was a step in the right direction with the Fabled drops. Every month in Norrath should be a celebration of adventure and quests!  <br>  <br>  <br> Can EverQuest be saved? It seems very unlikely with SOE at the helm. Just like the Titanic took hours to do a 180 degree turn I seriously doubt that SOE can turn the ship around and put it back on course. The iceberg of WoW is looming ahead and many will abandon ship when the time comes. The real problem is the culture of corporate arrogance and chronic under funding at SOE which created this terminal patient known as EQ. At least Smedley has finally realized there is a problem. Perhaps that is a start.  <br>  <br> I urge Woody and everyone that has the good fortune to attend the SOE guild summit to please stop and think about what's good for everyone who plays EverQuest not just the privileged few. It seems that SOE has again pandered to high level guilds and have invited many of their guild leaders to attend in an effort to stop the hemorrhaging. Maybe next month we can have a &#8220;player summit&#8221; where average players get to speak to SOE. Let me remind them and SOE that casual gamers subsidize the powergamers in this game. Soon there may not be any left to pay the bills for your fun.  <br>  <br> In the final analysis all that SOE understands is money. They feel entitled to your hard earned dollars despite releasing substandard expansions. Those of us that still love EQ need to stand firm and resolute. Boycott the new expansion. Vote with your dollars and send a strong message to Smedley and SOE: the status quo in EverQuest is no longer acceptable. Business as usual will no longer suffice.  <br>  <br> I'd like to close with a gem of a quote from John Smedley from a 1999 interview with Gamespot.

				I agree with the following statements: <br>  <br> &lt;&lt;STOP PANDERING TO UBERGUILDS and FOCUS ON CONTENT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE&gt;&gt; <br>  <br> &lt;&lt;Start supporting small guilds that are non-elemental.&gt;&gt; <br>  <br> &lt;&lt;Create amazing dungeons that everyone can use like Lower Guk and Nagafen&#8217;s Lair.&gt;&gt; <br>  <br> But I feel Lost Dungeons is where these amazing dungeons should be located, along with a better developed story and quests that a single group can make happen. <br>  <br> The problem with LDoN which supports normal players is a lack of good story telling.  We do the same mission every night without a fascinating story.  Combine Lost Dungeon with the author's suggestions on how to stop pandering to ubergilds, then we may have a winner. <br>

				P.S. To set up stories for LDoN, I think it'll be fun to have a series of small components that will drop for people to collect and make their weapon, armor, and spells. <br>  <br> For example, the rogue, the warrior, the knight may allneed a hilt for their sword, thenn they can try to collect a different type of blade for each class, short blade for the rogue, broad blade for the warrior, long blade for the knight.  The spell components will help the casters to have something to look forward to. <br>  <br> Make these components relate to stories that can involve fighting some bosses in a LDoN dungeon, so that a single group of adventurers can have fun helping each other accomplish epics in minor steps of collecting items that can take many trips to these fascinating dungeons. <br>  <br> I would love to be hunting in a group one night when the rogue in my group is so happy his hilt dropped that his eyes gleam.  I will feel like I have just helped a rogue with his dream. <br>  <br> Make it so that we are helping each other win their own class specific items, and not compete in items as much. <br>  <br> I realize winning a roll can be fun at times, but the loot fights can be unpleasant.  It's one reason I no longer hunt in BoT.  I don't know what story there is in BoT aside from people twitching whenever a boss spawns and running there to farm.  The place just seems to be a lot of greed to me.  Then people cheat on NBG rules, etc.  Bicker bicker bicker.  Anyway, occasional shared pieces are fine, such as the hilt of a sword all melee classes can use. But over all I prefer to see class specific items which can make story telling more fun, because then the rogue will tell us what the piece that just dropped for him means to him.  It'll be one way to get the players to tell stories to each other.

				Couple more thoughts: <br>  <br> 1) The key thing for players is they need to feel a small accomplishment had been made.  So the hilt of a sword can even have different materials such as wooden, silver, gold, platinum; and a player can collect all wooden pieces of a sword, or need to keep the wooden one in order to trade in for the silver.  This way a sense of progress can be felt through many small steps.  I'd love to be there when someone says he's just got the refined wooden hilt (wooden hilt #9) so he's closer to corse silver now.  I think EQ2 has already stated they will have quests that make players feel a bit of accomplishment at a time, so pardon me for repeating the idea. <br>  <br> 2) Also, EQ itself has many quests like this in the past in the traditional areas, except it usually involved one party to go to a specific spot to camp for something for someone, then go to another spot to camp for someone else.  I ran into this with my druid when he wanted a better shield.  My druid wanted to camp for something like 9 skulls in Luclin, but my warrior friend wanted to camp for the Iksar ceremonial bp which was in a different spot.  We were really close friends, yet we never did get to camp either spot because we didn't have that much time to play, and taking time to camp for mine, then for his items meant our leveling was going to take a hit.  And we'd be bored spending weeks at the same camp with only one of us having prospects of gaining a new item. <br>  <br> Lost Dungeon is fun because it allows every class in the group to work together and get what they need.  I'd like to see the skulls drop, and the components for a bp my warrior friend can use drop--both in the same dungeon.  So we can both have fun without feeling like one of us is sacrificing time for a whole week.

				Well SOE destroyed the old zones that were good, to get people to buy all the expansions. There can be no other reason than an economic one. I can only assume that is why Everfrost has only a newbie area, and an ice giant farm now. It went from one of the best of the old zones to the worst. <br>  <br> The level 6-15 area in front of Bandl is gone. The mammoth population that used to support multiple groups of 16-25 has been reduced to the point that one level 30 can keep the place completely cleaned out with ease and still be sitting around bored. waiting for a spawn. <br>  <br> Why would SOE bother to fix the older zones in the game when it will not make them any money and they purposely wrecked them in the first place?

				Umm... what about the rest of us Siabra? Im one of the &quot;uberguilders&quot; or what ever they are called, what am I supposed to do?  There is a ton of content in EQ for casual players. Casual players dont seek it out, they want to be spoon fed (which is EXACTLY why they sit in LDoN day after day after day after day after day) instead of doing quest or raiding older content. Most older content can be effectively raided or farmed with single groups, and 9 times out of 10 you will find the mobs you want up. (this being old world/kunark/velious stuff, even some SoL stuff). What do I do? No new content, no new gear? AAs? I can just scrap my characters that I put so much effort into I guess, now that they cant get any better and are effectively obsolete. Reroll a twink and start the grind over? I think not. <br>  <br> Not good enough right? People think because they paid 13 bucks a month and put down the 30 bucks for the expansion that automatically gives them the right to the entire expansions content. They complain about &quot;uberguilds&quot; but rejoice in how gimped out EQ has become. It takes people a month to get to 65 now istead of a year to get to 60. You can farm 2-3-4-5+ AA a DAY (normal people) instead of maybe 1-2 a day like the old days.... but its not good enough. <br>  <br> I dont blame SOE for listening to uberguilders, I blame SOE for listening to the constant whine from casual players that play 1 hour a day every other day, and yet think they should have the same gear and abilities as me. Everyone is working towards time, or forward towards what ever goal. Ive never met a person, ever, that is fine to sit by the side farming crap out of LDoN and using EQ for a glorified chat room. <br>  <br> They have been doing polls for years and years asking what players wanted. Answer?  <br>  <br> END <br>  <br> GAME <br>  <br> CONTENT <br>  <br> everytime. EVERY time. People wanted to see knew zones, new loot, EVEN if they were never going to get it themselves they lived through those boards and stood in awe looking at furors armor. <br>  <br> Best thing SOE did? instanced zones. Now you cant bottle neck guilds, any guild at that level can complete the content. It takes out waiting list and raiding schedules. The majority of EQ is now high level players. Run through our noob zones and see how man noobs are there. Then run through POT and see how many LFG. or pov. or hoh. or pos bot pon etc etc etc etc etc. The game is evolved well past single group questing. And you know who did it? us. All of us, this is exactly what we asked for. <br>  <br> Point blank, EQ is filled to the brim with spoiled LAZY people who want to be spoon fed, who dont want to go to the spoiler sights and find quest, and think they have the right to all content, but wont raise a finger in effort to get there. <br>  <br> I found it amusing in that guys article he spoke of naggy raids and going to guk, but when people first went into guk there was &quot;guk raids&quot;. The first king raid I went on has 70 people. 70 PEOPLE in LGuk!! Naggy and Vox, lets slay the dragon! 70-100 people! nothing has changed in EQ, it just got more advanced. When you raid time how many can you take? 72. Look familiar? <br>  <br> the only thing I agree with is bring back BToB, GM events and holiday events (and support staff of course). The rest of EQ has evolved like it was supposed to, just like we wanted.

				Yes, but I think the point was you didn't need 70 people for guk. You could do it with less. You didn't need 70 people for Permafrost. For Vox yes. You didn't need 70 people for Sol A, For Naggy you do. Same with Sebilis and Trak, Velks Lab and Vel, Kael and Vindi/AoW etc. NToV, VP the Original Planes those are raid large force zones. <br>  <br> Bottom line they could have added end game content without requiring a full raid force to gain access too. Like PoP. But also have those full raid force encounters. <br>  <br> Luclin has things to do for everyone. But the storyline, faction/Quests and layout all suck. <br>  <br> They could have made the higher levels of this game depend less on the big guilds for advancement without dumbing down the rest of the game or trivializing the large encounters. But it didn't go that way. <br>  <br> LDON was an attempt at giving the casual player something to work towards to without depending on the larger guild. But LDON is so screwed up with its set up is crazy. Poor storyline, Crappy point system and poorly designed dungeons. Its just not what is needed. <br>  <br> I agree Renxerox they also did liston to the whiners. So things are dumbed down. Not that all the changes are bad. But some are a dam shame. <br>  <br> The game is beyond repair at this point. The feel it once had is gone. <br>

				If you recall Caks, when guk first came up it required a lot of people for king, using your won arguement though, in POP it doesnt take 70 people to enter POV, you can exp there with a group. Guk didnt require 70 people to exp, but the first few times people raided lord and king it did. You have to remember what crap gear (or god like gear) we had back then. My barbie warrior was one of the best on my server back then, and I had a COMBINE magic sword. See how far the game has advanced? lol. <br>  <br> The game advances as people/levels/gear/AA advance. POF when we first started raiding was 90 people. Babs slaughtered whole 100 man raids. Fenin? lolz. bring in the body bags.

Do they? no. their heads are stuck up their arses in POV seeing all the phat l33t coming out of Time and GoD. They farm LDoN for all its worth instead of going to POG for thrug level armor (much faster, easier, and better stuff). <br>  <br> they are the little kids sitting behind the glass: the see the candy, they want the candy, but the dont want to have to pay for it.

				&quot;The game is beyond repair at this point. The feel it once had is gone.&quot; <br>  <br> I agree with this statement. The game does not play like the original EQ. It is actually very inferior today. The content that people point out is actually a joke. Why would anyone try and do 95% of the quests in the game, when the newer expansions drop so much more powerful equipment? The majority of the quest/content in EQ is worthless now.

				POV not for the 1st 6 months or so. You needed to pass a trial. A unbalanced trial at that. Then they made it level dependent. Which is just dumb should have kept the trial requirement or open to all. <br>  <br> Actually I think the LDON armor is better. Thats why people crank out the adventures. <br>  <br> The game should advance as people level etc. I just think if could have been done differently. Another reason why some of the older zones and drops should be re-balanced. <br>

				PoP IMO was actually perfectly done. Including POV trial. POP was meant (if you remember) to not only seperate level 60-65 characters, but also GUILDS. People werent supposed to get past PoV easily. You had to have a very solid DPS group back then to get past POJ trials, and it kept a lot of people out of POP (that wasnt supposed to be there). <br>  <br> How many times have you seen people complain on these very boards about people in POV/BOT/HOH etc that shouldnt be there? they should still be back in PON etc? That is exactly what POJ trial was for. To keep out people that didnt belong in higher end zones, and it worked out well.  <br>  <br> People really didnt understand POP at all, and really didnt read the print. It wasnt even fine print, but big bold print. SOE came right out and said that POP was the ultimate high high end RAID zone. <br>  <br> and I TOTALLY agree with revamping zones, thats something Ive literally been saying for years. Take the exp bonus out of PC and stick it in Befallen or runnyeye or something like that. Make people work a little for it.

				I actually like PoP aswell. But disagree on the PoJ trial. Your right its just that, DPS. If none of your regular grouping friends are DPS classes your abit gimped. Doesn't matter if you've played together for years and know what your doing. But then IDIOTS who play wizards and rogues or have people push them through get to go on and you miss out...but anyway over all PoP was done pretty well. <br>  <br> The only two expansions I've liked since Velious is PoP and LoY. Luclin sucked and LDON is the worst. Alot of people like LDON for some F'd reason. I guess cause its easy. LoY has character, nice laid out zones, is challenging and for the level is pretty good exp. But people don't like it because its &quot;hard&quot;, far away and there are no GY's or clicky port books close.  <br>  <br> GoD I have no opinion on other then the storyline sucks. Haven't played enough their.

				I liked kunark, velious and POP. Every other expansion to date has really sucked. VT key alone made me want to quit the game out of frustruation. POP I really enjoyed, it was and still is a fun expansion for me. <br>  <br> LDoN people like, cause any gimp off the street can and will spend 500000 hours a week grinding those stupid missions so they can get ele level gear with out raiding. Which is actually sorta backwards since I can guarantee that you will waste way more time in LDoN getting points then if you just joined a raid guild and got the armor that way. Personally I hate it, its like farming points and is quite boring. But some of the augs are very nice. <br>  <br>

				&quot;and I TOTALLY agree with revamping zones&quot; <br>  <br> Well SOE doesn't. The only reason SOE delayed the next expansion was because of the complaints about the last expansion. Once those are resolved in a half as*ed manner, the next expansion will be out. It's all about generating revenue. SOE managament does not care about content or game play, the ONLY issue is how they can convince people to give them more money. <br>  <br> The ethics of SOE make me wonder about the viability of EQ2. SOE is really not focused on making the next great MMORP, based on the history of implementation of the companys apparent philosophy in EQ1.

				Rexerox you've always had the attitude that casual players are &quot;lazy&quot; while in reality they are hard working people who don't have time to sitt for 8 hours in a stretch to raid.  LDoN only allowed them to break those 8 hours into 2 hour increments.  They put in just as much time &quot;grinding&quot; in LDoN as you do in &quot;grinding&quot; the yard trash in raids.  Raids are fun, but the reality is EQ is a business that is starting to find out the majority of the players who can not sit for 8 hours in a stretch may soon go to other games. <br>  <br> Many people in uber guilds are &quot;spoon fed&quot;.  They get the latest spell, item from gifts from their guildies.  They sit afk while the guild is raiding and gain flags.  I was in LDoN with some people from a Time guild on my server that could not find Upper Guk, and we had to guild them.  Hehehe.  We roll our eyes at them. <br>  <br> My bud who just joined the uber guild on my server has moved his FT from 13 up to 18, and int from 335 up to 412, and gained 1000 hp in 3 weeks of raiding.  He didn't have to do much different from what he used to do in LDoN with me.  Hehehe.  I just went to a raid the other day as a guest and it was amazing how easy it was.   So don't try to fool people into thinking raids are the most brillaint things you need to do. <br>  <br> I was told by 2 top Time guilds people that I was &quot;great&quot; when they saw me in LdoN, and &#8220;did an excellent job&#8221; in GoD trial.  People ask me why am I not in those uber guilds.  The answer is I can't log on during raid hours.  I only play at midnight.  I can work for many many hours to earn 1150 AP to buy an aug that will gain me 40 hp.  Do I even want to buy that aug?  No.  Right now I'm sitting on a pile of LDoN points just enjoying having fun with people.  I don't really care about uber loot.  What's the point of having 412 int when the cap is 355?  What's the point of 18 FT when the cap is 15?  I have fun in the game interacting with people. <br>  <br> Your attitude that casual players are &quot;lazy and dumb&quot; is a bit amusing. <br>  <br> I know you and I will never see eye to eye.  This article states it's time to stop catering to uber guilds, and many people agree with it.  I just saw this same article posted on other sites.  I'm not going to debate you much on this.  In the end what hapens to EQ is decided by market forces.  You can call people lazy all you like.  Just remember:  Unfortunately money is king.  The #1 guild on my server has many toons up for sale, and in fact, their MT has been sold 3 times so far.  Right now it's being played by a guy who bought it just to apply to the guild.  What skill does he have?  We don't know.  He's going to jump right into raiding and no doubt enjoy the raid context that most of us LDoN people can never see.  Did he &quot;work hard&quot;? <br>  <br> On the other hand: One of my friends who solo owned the MT for 4 months and you know what he did?  He sacrified the MT down to level 58 so he could use it to make his own 6-boxed LDoN group lower in level and do the normal level 60 LDoN to gain 200 AP an hour. He was making $1 million pp every few days selling points.  This will of course make you sick to the stomach with the sentiment that a &quot;soloing&quot; guy can do this.  Well, he worked very hard at it.  You try and 6 box and tell me if it isn't skill. <br>  <br> I tried to ask him to group with people.  He would not.  His chief purpose for playing in EQ was to meet challenges.  He was not here for grouping.  He prided himself in what he could accomplish alone.  But he sold all 6 of his accounts and left EQ when he saw GoD was too hard for him to handle. <br>  <br> I feel sad for him that all of his work--and he did work for months 6-boxing.  He owned Time equipment for his main character.  In the end he just quit.  but what's the difference between his quitting and the original top guild MT going EBay?  Not much.  They both got all the loot they wanted, then they were both bored. <br>  <br> Talking about this makes me laugh a lot, which is probably good for my health.  But I think you take this game very seriously, and you may get upset, so I will not argue with you.  Only to say: Good luck and sorry in the end it's rl money and Sony's bottom line that will decide the outcome.  In the past the casual player didn't really complain. Sony would lose uber guild players if it did not have leading edge content.  The future may not be that way anymore.  The days of uber guilds may soon be over.  This is why 4 top guilds left EQ, and it may not be a bad thing for Sony at all when you consider 98% of the players are not in uber guilds.  They don't have to listen to the &quot;whinings&quot; of uber guilds anymore.  Sorry to use the word &quot;whining&quot;.  But if you call casual players voice &quot;whiniing&quot;, the coin must have 2 sides to it. <br>  <br> You don't think you are here whining, but many out there probably think you do, friend.  You have been very helpful on this board on many occasios. I respect you.  And I really don&#8217;t have anything against uber guilds.  You guys want to have fun, too.  I get that radiing is a different kind of fun.  In fact, many do work hard in raiding guilds.  Many uber guilds do spend hours figuring out puzzles.  I love those kinds of players.  I have nothing against these people. <br>  <br> I have something against a game that does not offer me fun.  What's fun for me?  Grouping with people.  Lately it&#8217;s been hard to form groups.  Whereas it used to take me 15 min to put together a group, now it's quite often an hour or 2.  I sense Sony is losing many accounts and the revenue is starting to decline.  This is why Sony is trying to lock revenue with the recent offer of free expansions for one-year pre-paid subscription.  This is why Sony asked in a poll yesterday if we want EQ to handle trading of rl cash for characters and items.  It all has to do with Sony&#8217;s revenue.  There are signs in the winds, smells of stormy weather coming up for EQ.  I am just hoping to halp EQ live long and prosper.  I myself could not care less about uber loot.  Like I said again, what&#8217;s the point in 412 int and 18 FT? <br>  <br> My chief purpose in posting is make sure the majority of the people are having fun.  That's where the bread and butter is for Sony, and for the best of EQ.  Sadly, while the casual players used to put up with a lack of content, now it may be the other way around.  But we shall see.  Hopefully you will be happy.

				&lt;&lt;It's all about generating revenue. SOE managament does not care about content or game play, the ONLY issue is how they can convince people to give them more money. &gt;&gt; <br>  <br> Agree.  And in order to do so, Sony must come up with expansions that will sell.  Quality of the game does matter as well as audience.  GoD is probably one of their low revenue expansions.  It's not a good quality expansion.  It just smelled like Sony decided expansions were good cash cows and if they could just put out a bit of bait each 6 months, people would keep buying.  But they've learned by now many people have wised up to it.  They won't buy low quality production.  Instead, they are leaving to other games.  This is why Sony is trying to fix GoD now and delay the next expansion. <br>

				I don't get it. <br>  <br> Noone here gives one example of what they would like to see changed other then &quot;revamp zones.&quot; How? what content would you add? What do you think would draw players to the old un-used zones that are abandoned currently? If you like 95% of the players in EQ spend the majority of your time playing a level 50+ character why would you care if EQ revamps all those level 15-45 zones? It would be just like with all the other zones that were revamped, it is crowded with people above the level of the zone who farm it for loot for a week then is abandoned once more. <br>  <br> All this hand-wringing about the EVIL of Sony being a corporation and trying to earn the best profit they can is meaningless. They are all here to make money, in fact those MMORPGS that are not spewing out worthwhile expansions at a rate of at least 1 a year are dying. As was said above if you dislike the product do not buy it, if you no longer enjoy EQ then take a break or stop playing entirely. I don't listen to whiners in real life and I definately don't want to read it here, if you have suggestions about how to make EQ &quot;fun again&quot; please do share them as I would read those with interest. <br>  <br> The majority here writes that EQ has been devoting far too much time and content devoted towards the high end raiding &quot;uber-guild&quot; crowd and neglected the casual gamer. But the last 2 expansions were 90% devoted to what a casual group of 6 friends could do at their own pace? There are only 2 coherent complaints I've read above. The first, that is just plain silly, is how much longer it takes that casual group of friends to accomplish what a 60 person guild can do in one extended raiding session. But where is the logic in 6 people being able to accomplish the exact same results of what it took a raid force in less time? That just reads like pure ugly jealousy. The 2nd I will agree with, that LDON and GoD lacked a coherent lore, &quot;atmosphere&quot; and engaging story. Previous expansions to EQ felt like new lands or worlds being opened up to explore and adventure in with interesting races, their homes, their enemies, factions, dungeons and so on. LDON, GoD and to a somewhat lesser extent PoP were all about setting out specific goals for the players to challenge and overcome with specific rewards.  <br>  <br> Time is what makes all the difference in all these games ultimately, just like any other hobby. Those who can devote more to it get the most back in return, if what time you can spend in Norrath is no longer even entertaining merely for the sake of spending time with the friends you have made here, then I think you need a new hobby (like I am realizing for myself, nearly done with medical school and I about to kiss all my free time goodbye). <br>  <br> The main problem with GoD was how remote and difficult to reach most of it was, you basically had to struggle with a full group to reach the zone or goal you were after in the first place. This was especially troublesome in GoD trials as if someone was lost or disconnected it can mean having to refight your way back to the entrance with 100's of respawned mobs at your back to pick them back up and then turn around and do it all over again.  <br>  <br> In comparison to the ease of entry with even 1st through even 3rd tier PoP zones and LDON why bother with GoD- an expansion that was intended for casual players but required a minimum of an hour just to reach your starting point and worse still frequently required you to retrace and refight the areas you have been in multiple times to continue making progress? <br>  <br>

				Riktor you want sugestions? Ok <br>  <br> -I want to see all the lvl 20+ old world zones(old world, Kunark and some of Velious) redone. Mobs abit harder. Loot tables redone to reflect the current age of the game. <br> -I'd like to see the whole expansion of Shadows of Luclin redone. A good faction system between the 4 major cities and the smugglers(whatever they are called) some good quests associated with it and the VT key quest removed or made easier. <br> -After the zones are all redone I want to see the ZEM adjusted accordingly. Hard Far away zones give the good better exp. <br> -LDON, trash the point system and replace it with quests and rare drops from the dungeons. Add some non-timed adventures. Change the timer on the current timed adventures to not be this red message that flashes accross the screen. Add a medium difficulty level. Fix the actuall physical locations of the camps so they don't look like someone just threw them and whereever they landed they stay. <br> Add some more unique dungeons. <br>  <br> -Future expansions should be without flag or key requirements to enter any zone. If it is keyed then it shouldn't be that hard to get. Something more on the lines of the Seb key. There should be a good storyline and good faction system along with it. Quests associated with each faction along with others. <br>  <br>  <br> Summary: <br> 1. ZEM modifiers changed to really reflect risk vs reward. <br> 2. Loot table redone to bring them up to the times. <br> 3. Ultra Rare drops added to every mob <br> 4. Some older zones redone <br> 5. LDON redone <br> 6. Most of SoL redone <br> 7. Quests added to get people to tavel all over. But having the reward worth it. <br> 8. New content should have a good storyline,faction system and quests. Content for everyone that doesn't require a Key/Flag <br> 9. More spawnable raid encounters. <br> 10. Epics redone (oh I think they are doing this) <br>  <br> ...I can go on and on.  <br>  <br> oh...and yes I did stop playing <br>  <br>  <br> One more thing...I'll give and example. Sebilis. <br> Keyed to get into.(but fairly easy key) Large raid encounter deep within the zone. Exp and good drops throughout the zone. With ultra rare items that can drop off mobs throughout the zone.(ie. ODS and RBG) If more of the new content released after SoV where more like sebilis I think they would have keeped alot more people happy and playing.

				That is not 100% true and YOU are naive if you think it is. <br>  <br>  <br> If you put out a marginal product, there will always be people dumb enough to pay for it, but your revenue will be marginal at best. <br>  <br> If you put out a great product, it will take more money to create it, but you will make more money in terms of revenue. <br>  <br> Having a choice between a game that is &quot;just good enough&quot;, or a game that is &quot;great and revolutionary&quot; which one would a sane person choose?

				Totally unrelated note: If nothing else the constant spam of this Riddick movie's ad here will insure I do not see that movie. <br>  <br> -I want to see all the lvl 20+ old world zones(old world, Kunark and some of Velious) redone. Mobs abit harder. Loot tables redone to reflect the current age of the game.  <br>  <br> Why? what point would that serve other then to make actual new player's lives more difficult as high level players came to camp the new loot or have a harder time killing these new tougher low level mobs with their newbie quest gear?  <br> People level out of the 20's within days now as is, I agree they could add new content to aid people this level, like upgrades to the &quot;newbie&quot; armor quests, quest to restock supplies like bandages, food, more bags. Instead of throwing out the old loot I would have it be consumed as turn ins for these new quests. Or maybe minor quests that would add maps to their EQ folder as many do not realize where and how to download them. If you are talking about temporary events to make the low level areas more interesting like the dark elf invasion of west commons, sure, all for it. <br>  <br> -I'd like to see the whole expansion of Shadows of Luclin redone. A good faction system between the 4 major cities and the smugglers(whatever they are called) some good quests associated with it and the VT key quest removed or made easier.  <br>  <br> Luclin suffered from the fact they tried to do so many new things in that expansion and didn't really do any of them well or to completion. Standard for the computer gaming world- a bloated, rushed, buggy product, there is interesting content here however but again, unless you are talking about something similiar to the giant-dwarf-dragon competing factions in velious not sure what point this would serve after all this time. <br>  <br> -After the zones are all redone I want to see the ZEM adjusted accordingly. Hard Far away zones give the good better exp.  <br>  <br> They are somewhat implementing this now with the &quot;hot zone&quot; feature but I agree a good many of the ZEM make little sense. <br>  <br> -LDON, trash the point system and replace it with quests and rare drops from the dungeons. Add some non-timed adventures. Change the timer on the current timed adventures to not be this red message that flashes accross the screen. Add a medium difficulty level. Fix the actuall physical locations of the camps so they don't look like someone just threw them and whereever they landed they stay.  <br> Add some more unique dungeons.  <br>  <br> Add quests sure, more dungeons, sounds good. I agree an untimed adventure option (I suggested an &quot;explore&quot; type several times) would be fine for those most casual players so long as the untimed adv gave no points as a reward. The rest just sounds like nit-picking or that you actually think LDON is too hard for the average player. I could agree they should rebalance the rate at which points are awarded for successful advs, basically from level 20 to 50 you go from earning a meager 1 pt to about 15pts per normal adv. Then suddenly jump to 50 pts per normal adv by 65 this could definately use some smoothing out.  <br>  <br> -Future expansions should be without flag or key requirements to enter any zone. If it is keyed then it shouldn't be that hard to get. Something more on the lines of the Seb key. There should be a good storyline and good faction system along with it. Quests associated with each faction along with others.  <br>  <br> I agree if a flag or key system is purely there to force players to spend time camping drops to earn the privilege of camping the next zone it's needless aggrevation (see: the entire Luclin expansion). The idea that a zone that requires a raid force to succeed in would require each individual player to aquire 1 or more items that MIGHT drop ONCE every 20-30 minutes (at BEST!) and you would therefor need 30+ of these individual drops doesn't inspire anyone but those with way too much time on their hands to proceed. <br>  <br> On the other hand certain very high level encounters should require some steps. Like if you want to challenge that god in his home plane it makes sense to me you have to aquire item/key/flag X to enter, the difference I would make was that only 1 person per group would need to aquire this entrance fee, that way people who came later or missed the initial event are not locked out of participating with their friends and multiple people working together could aquire this key or flag for all group members at completion.  <br> Secondly, I would make the aquiring of that entrance fee a tangible reward in it's own right, so that there is an incentive for others to continue to complete or help others complete the task or quest, this could be faction that leads to other quests, or an item, or AA, etc.

				&quot;Why? what point would that serve other then to make actual new player's lives more difficult as high level players came to camp the new loot or have a harder time killing these new tougher low level mobs with their newbie quest gear?&quot; <br>  <br> I didn't mean make them super harder. For example Castle Mistmore. Newbies now have it alot better. They can get a weapon in the bazaar for 100pp that was god-like back in the day. Revamp, add some HP/AC to these mobs slightly and add some drops that might actually be usefull for a level 30, 35 or 40 level player for awhile. When its new for the first 2-3 weeks yes every level 65 player will be slaughtering the zone but that won't last. You may actually see players going to these zones again. Maybe not. <br>  <br> &quot;unless you are talking about something similiar to the giant-dwarf-dragon competing factions in velious not sure what point this would serve after all this time.&quot; <br>  <br> Thats exactly what I meant...and unfortunatly after all this time no I don't see the point really. <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;They are somewhat implementing this now with the &quot;hot zone&quot; feature but I agree a good many of the ZEM make little sense&quot; <br>  <br> Yes I guess its a start. But they need to take it away from other places and the fact that they refer to it as &quot;Hot Zones&quot; makes me want to vomit. One more example of why the &quot;R&quot; in MMORPG does not apply anymore to EQ. <br>  <br> &quot;that you actually think LDON is too hard for the average player.&quot; <br>  <br> Nit-picking I guess and no the &quot;Normal&quot; adventures I think are too easy. &quot;Hard&quot; ones are about on the money. They are Hard for most. The point system I just see as a arcade style gimic. The game is ever&quot;quest&quot; and in reality there is no reason anyone under say...level 60 should waste time on adventures. Very little reward from them. <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;I would make the aquiring of that entrance fee a tangible reward in it's own right, so that there is an incentive for others to continue to complete or help others complete the task or quest, this could be faction that leads to other quests, or an item, or AA, etc.&quot;  <br>  <br> This is an excellent idea.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

				lol Sorry Siabra, Im not saying that the &quot;casual&quot; gamer is in any way lazy. Techincally Im a &quot;casual&quot; gamer. My beef is with people who rarely play the game but feel that just because they pay the monthly fee to play the game (of which.. they still get to play the game) they should be able to walk into any zone, have free reign of all the loot and get the best of the best. <br>  <br> Where as I think and agree with the devs that you should have to work, at least to a certain extent, to gain it. Dont you agree? <br>  <br> Its the two ends of the spectrum and the two extremes. One side says to make the game easier (which SOE has done, example AAs, level increase, exp bonus, exp nerf etc), the other side is screaming for high end content (inc VT, POP, GoD) and not to trivialize the game (to late!) <br>  <br> So Im sorry for the misunderstanding. The casual player makes up the base for EQ, but the normal casual player also knows there are zones that he/she will probably never see and accepts that. <br>  <br> As for me? Im a &quot;casual&quot; player too. Im in a raid guild, but I only log in anymore to hang out with friends, which is really what this game is about.
