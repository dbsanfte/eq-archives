				Tera, you bring up some interesting points; so lets examine them one by one. <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;Any lawsuit along these lines is a huge waste of time. It will only benefit lawyers.&quot; <br>  <br> There are a lot of bad feelings when it comes to lawyers and lawsuits.  The comes from the fact that most people just do not understand our legal system.  This is a society of laws and there is NOTHING more sacred and important in our society than the laws.  In other countries, laws only apply to the common man.  The wealthy and those in the aristocracy are no subject to most of the laws or they have their own set of laws (in England, for example, the Magna Carta was written for the aristocracy, not the common man).  In the United States, however, the laws are the same for EVERYONE.  Whenever there is a disagreement on how something should be interpreted (such as the application of a EULA to limit the activities of software subscribers), a lawsuit is the proper means of dispute resolution.  This allows those educated in the law to present their arguements before and judge and/or jury and allows a decision to be rendered.  In cases where their circumstances are unique or on the forefront of a new area of law, these cases often establish important precedents.  So, a lawsuit would not just benefit the lawyers in this situation. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;The EULA does clearly state that you can't do such a thing. For whatever that is worth. Illegal restricitions in a license can be over-turned, but IMO there are none here.&quot; <br>  <br> First of all, the End User Licensing Agreement is nothing more than a fancy &quot;shrinkwrap license&quot;.  Shrinkwrap licenses are invalid in some states and extremely limited in others.  Also, is it within Verant's authority to dictate to you or I how we can spend our time?  According to the EULA, we are not permitted to let ANYONE use our account for ANY reason.  Yet, it is a well known fact that friends and certainly family members share accounts.  Should Verant be able to dictate to these people that they can not do that?  As a former guide, I witnessed situations where players were banned because of weak circumstantial evidence.  In one case, it was later discovered that a game bug was actually to blame for what looked like a player attempting to cheat.  The account, however, was not reinstated since the EULA basically says that Verant can terminate anyone's account at any time for any reason.  Is that fair or right?  I know people with level 60 characters who have well over 100 DAYS invested in that character.  That is 2400 hours!  If you use minimum wage to assign a value to that time, then you're talking about over $12000!!  Would you be so supportive of Verant if they terminated you account because they suspected you of cheating or maybe you joked about selling something on eBay and a GM heard you and banned you.  They can do it--it's in the EULA.  But is it right? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;You do not, in fact, own any of the virtual items, nor does your time invested in getting them mean anything. They are being rented to you in consideration of your membership fees.&quot; <br>  <br> The fact that you purchase the software and then pay a subscription fee entitles you to certain considerations under the law.  I'm sure Verant likes your attitude about people's time being meaningless in-game; but I'm equally certain a judge would see things differently.  In fact, courts tend to look very unfavorably upon companies which treat their customers in such a callous fashion.  If anything, this new facet of the gaming industry needs to be regulated or at least some form of consumer's (player's) rights needs to be implemented. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;There may not be direct financial loss, but I feel Sony can argue with some success that continued EBay type sale undermine the integrity of the game, and therefore reduce the value of the game in the marketplace. Indirect loss due to IC infringment is quite valid (Ask Disney - they know ALL about that).&quot; <br>  <br> That arguement was beaten to death by the music industry when they tried to drive stores that specialize in used records, tapes and CDs out of business.  The courts didn't buy it then (no pun intended) and I doubt they will buy it now. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;You MAY NOT sell something legally with an illegal item being added 'for free'. That has been judged and denied. Don't count on the 'only selling my time' arguement to mean squat before a judge - it won't.&quot; <br>  <br> Very true.  Only problem is, a Ghoulbane does not qualify as an &quot;illegal item.&quot;  That would be like saying it is illegal to sell the pieces of my Monopoly game on eBay (not the whole game, just the Monopoly money and the little pieces).  If you look at it in that way, Verant's position seems silly at best. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;As a concept - I support EBaying items - but EQ is not designed to support that. Future games might be, and I imagine some will integrate auctions into the game ala UO.&quot; <br>  <br> Who would have ever thought that comic books would find a post-market demand?  Some of the most valuable comics in the world are the first comics that were printed.  The reason being is because they were cheaply printed and never intended to last beyond a few months.  Certainly we can say that those comics were not &quot;designed to support that.&quot; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;Bottomline - it is up to the game company to decide. Verant must figure that those offended by auctioning are a greater concern then those profiting from it.&quot; <br>  <br> No.  The bottom line is that it is up to the COURTS to decide.  I have been hoping that someone would step up to the plate and sue Verant on this issue.  We need to establish once and for all who is right in this matter.  If the courts decide in favor of Verant then action needs to be taken to stop users from abusing their rights; however, if the courts decide against Verant, then action needs to be taken to stop Verant from abusing it's customers by presuming authority they do not have. <br>

				By hitting &quot;accept&quot; that does NOT make it legally binding.  Let me give you an example. <br>  <br> I was a limited partner years ago in a business called &quot;Photon&quot;.  It was a 10,000 square foot &quot;lazer tag&quot; arena maze where you would fight it out with other players for 6 minutes a pop.   <br>  <br> Well, before playing, everyone had to sign a form that stated our business was not responsible if you were injured during play. <br>  <br> The president of the company informed us however that this was a very weak protection.  The lawyer we were consulting told us that the form's only use would be as toilet paper.  It would not hold up if it went to court. <br>  <br> So the lesson is that just because Verant has us hit an &quot;accept&quot; button on some bogus aggreement, that does NOT mean it has any merit in a court of law.

				In regards to the issue at hand, the bottom line is this:  from a legal perspective, the action that Verant has taken against eBay auctions is illegal.  This is plain to see; there is no room for interpretation in this case, and I will explain why. <br>  <br> First of all, there is the question of the legality and validity of the EULA.  As someone mentioned in an earlier post, restrictions are placed on these types of agreement, which vary slightly from state to state.  In some states, they are prohibited by law.  In the great majority of the other states, severe limitations are placed on these agreements.   <br>  <br> For a moment, let us assume that in your particular state, there are no restrictions on the EULA.  This is quite likely *not* to be the case, but let us assume this for the moment.  The EULA states that no &quot;selling&quot; of &quot;items&quot; from the game will be allowed.  This does *not* apply to the selling of a person's &quot;time&quot;.   <br>  <br> If, in your state, the applicable terms of the EULA are legal, using eBay to conduct these transactions would *still* be legal, *IF* the person doing the auctioning states within it that they are selling their &quot;time&quot;.  No laws exist on the selling of a person's &quot;time&quot;.  If, in your auction, you state that the bidders are bidding on merely your &quot;time&quot; to acquire an item, then you are technically not selling the item itself, but the time that it took you to acquire said item.   <br>  <br> Within the game, trading of items is perfectly allowed.  No selling of the physical item is taking place, and the intellectual property still belongs to Verant even though it is now possessed by a different player.  Using eBay to sell your &quot;time&quot; to acquire items, and then simply providing the item in question to the winning bidder, is *not* a sale of the *intellectual property*...it is still owned by Verant.  It is a sale of the seller's &quot;time&quot;.   <br>  <br> This is a legal viewpoint on the subject, and when this matter goes before a court, these will undoubtedly be the findings.  I do not use eBay for Everquest-related auctions and so forth, but I find the issue very interesting from a legal standpoint, and wanted to share some thoughts on this, relative to the law. <br>  <br>

				Lunidar, which illegal action are you referring to?  From what I've read, Verant has done nothing more than write a letter to Ebay. <br>  <br> Nor is it illegal for Ebay to refuse to allow such auctions. The legality of the auction is irrelevant, as Ebay still has the right to set and enforce its own policy on the matter. <br>  <br>  <br> Psicop, the concept of adding an item &quot;for free&quot; is fundamentally flawed. If a purchase is required to get a &quot;free&quot; item, it's not &quot;free&quot; in a legal sense. This sort of thing has been through the courts many times. <br>  <br>  <br> I also have to comment on the concept of selling time. If the time has already been spent before the contract is made, it's no longer time you are selling, it's the PRODUCT of that time.  <br>  <br> Now if you make an contract to spend 5 hours next tuesday camping the alchemist in permafrost, then you are selling your time, not yet converted into product. <br>  <br>  <br> Lastly, until someone actually files a court case, and puts their legal name out in public, this is all a big joke. <br>

				Has anyone considered that the items being 'sold' are never really sold? Technically Verant owns your account and all items on those characters. This is the basis for their argument that selling such items on ebay is illegal, and the basis for their argument that you cannot sell your account. You are paying to play it, but you do not own it. Ebay has complied with Sony's wishes under the assumption that some sort of intellectual property infringment is going on, that people are selling items that do not belong to them. Well when you sell an item on ebay, you CAN ONLY SELL YOUR TIME. Why? Because the item cannot leave it's virtual environment, and therefore is STILL the property of Verant/Sony. The game item has not been sold (since selling something by definition includes a transfer of ownership). I assume some would argue that you have transfered possession, but even arguing that you can have possession in a virtual sense, when the data representing this item exists only on Verant's server seems rather weak to me. The real problem is that Verant lacks the tools to keep track of their own items, in an environment completely of their own makeing. I would say that all along these people have been selling their time (as they have no other choice) and Verant cannot infringe upon this. However, I thinkn they are well within their rights to ban accounts they suspect are selling items. This is covered by the license agreement.  <br>  <br> From another point of view, this move will not slow demand. People have time and cash to waste on such pursuits (as is evident by EQ's success). All they have done now is taken the single largest market and fragmented it into many smaller, harder to regulate markets. They should have setup their own item exchange long ago, at least then they would have most of the buyers and sellers in one place where they could regulate this in a way that affects their game content. <br>  <br> And finally, I would point out that the economic benefits of having sellers owning multiple accounts is being ignored. If they succeed in stopping these sales (and I don't believe they will), they will lose these accounts, and many of the casual gamer was able to enjoy this game by purchasing these items on ebay. Their definition of 'fun' is and always has been far too narrow. Of course I knew this the moment I realized I had to slaughter hundreds of animals to level my Druid. <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0">  <br>  <br> just my 2cp, <br> gamerx <br>  <br>

				Unfortunately, states like Virginia which have adopted UCITA have given more punch to Verant's position.  With a Republican administration on the way, we will more than likely see a unification of laws dealing with it, but no regulation of the industry per se. <br>  <br> The way to solve this is not in a court of law, but in the marketplace.  If you cannot accept the terms that you are under in order to play, then don't play in the first place. <br>  <br> One thing that truly baffles me is the duality of the EQ player's mindset.  You complain that the EULA's are unfair &amp; yet you still support the company with your fee so that you can continue to play. <br>  <br> Every EQ player out there has the power of currency if they choose to use it.  Boycotts &amp; non-proprietorship seem to be alien concepts in this discussion. <br>  <br> Lawsuits will only line the pockets of the litigators.  If you don't like Verant's policies, don't play EverQuest.

				I think the whole debate is moot.  When you look at the argument (selling my time, and giving the account away for free), if this ever got to court, I'm sure nobody would care if someone wants to give you money for time you spend playing a game.  However, they will have issue with you giving away the property of another, whether it is free or not.  As an end-user of a service, we are paying for the right to access the service.  By doing so, we don't gain any rights or ownership to that service.  Any value we add to the service is done voluntarily by us.  We cannot re-sell (or give away) that service to another without permission from the provider. <br>  <br> The only way to truly sell your time in EQ would be to have a person actually pay you to spend time doing something for them in the game.  i.e., they buy a new EQ account and pay you in advance to help them for a certain amount of time.  During that time, you help them make level X or gain items A, B, and C.  Only at that point you are you actually being paid for your time, and not for a transfer of Verant's property (data within the verant databases) or investment in their service.

				The supports of Verant's anti-eBay position keep saying things like, &quot;selling or giving away items that don't belong to you&quot; as justification of their position.  The fundamental flaw with that arguement is that NOTHING is being given away or sold except the person's time.  You are correct when you observe that these items belong to Verant.  They exist on their servers such as they are.  HOWEVER (and this is the big part), those who sell on eBay are legitimate subscribers who have legitimately aquired said item.  The person buying on eBay is a legitimate subscriber who is legitimately allowed to own that item.  All that is happening is that data is being shift around inside Verant's system by two people who are authorized to shift data around in the first place (eg. drop items on the ground, give them away or sell them).  How or why the two people decide to make the exchange in the first place is really none of Verant's business.  THAT is the focus of this entire arguement.  Whether I give something away, sell it for platinum or sell it for some other form of remuneration is my business.  This does not infringe upon their intellectual property rights anymore than sites like Alakhazams where they compile massive databases detailing the stats of all of the items in the game and how to obtain them.  Most of you anti-eBayers are only beating your drums because you are cheesed that some item is always camped.  You automatically assume that it's some eBay farmer to asage and justify your feelings that YOU have more of a right to be camping item X than the other person.  Well, the FACT of the matter is that the camping hasn't gotten any better; that's because most people farm for twinking or for sale in-game.  This issue is much bigger than such a petty concern and it's something you should consider before launching into another poorly-composed, knee-jerk tirade (I'm talking to you, vaalik).

				Come on now, Psicop.  Take a very good look at what you are saying. <br>  <br> The fact of the matter is that all you do is give your character a name &amp; run him around the world.  The generation of said character, the items he aquires &amp; the enemies he fights all takes place on Verant's servers. <br>  <br> Sites like Allahkhazam's are little more than glorified cheat sites &amp; fans go to them just as someone would visit any other site to get cheats on any other game.   <br>  <br> Allah doesn't make a profit from EQ intellectual property by charging for downloads of EQ MP3 files, EQ program hacks, or something like that, so intellectual property laws really don't apply.  <br>  <br> If anything, it may cost Allah money because he may be paying to have that huge site hosted by someone;  Allahkhazam is making no cash whatsoever on his EQ involvement. <br>  <br> He runs a fan site visited by fans.  If Verant thought that he posed a threat, he would have gotten a &quot;Cease &amp; Dissist&quot; order by now. <br>  <br> Using your logic surrounding why you should be able to make money via the use of your time would allow me to write a book using Drizzt Do'Urden as my main character &amp; expecting not to be sued if I try to make money from the sale of my stories without paying royalties &amp; giving credit to R.A. Salvatore. <br>  <br> I &quot;took the time&quot; to write the stories &amp; people pay to read them.  So what if the concept isn't originally mine? <br>  <br> Money isn't an entitlement to do whatever you wish.  Your $30 a month to join the YMCA doesn't allow you to secretly sell their exercise equipment to Victory Lady or pork your girlfriend in the sauna.   <br>  <br> There are rules you must follow after you pay your money &amp; if you cannot follow them, you are not allowed to participate in the first place. <br>  <br> That is the crux of the matter &amp; what anti-eBayers have been saying all along.  <br>  <br> Your comment about selling items on eBay being your personal business is laughable.  You got the items while playing EverQuest &amp; will make your delivery while playing EverQuest. <br>  <br> All of the actions beginning &amp; finishing this transaction are taking place on Verant's time &amp; on Verant's servers.  You would not be able to provide this &quot;service&quot; if EverQuest did not exist as your medium. <br>  <br> What you are doing is very much their business, my friend.  You are generating revenue via the service that someone else provides and/or the concept someone else has created.   <br>  <br> If that isn't IP infringement, then what is?    <br>  <br> If you are against the EULA as it stands, Psicop, then don't give Verant the satisfaction of your continued business &amp; tell your friends to follow your lead. <br>  <br> Speak with your money, bro.

				That intent is total bullshit, It is funny that people want to sue a game maker because they cannot make profit from it. If that is the case, go write your own fucken game. <br>  <br> Verant has rules to the way they want you play the game. You can whine all you want for ebay sales.

				I would like to applaud Gamerx on a post VERY well written.  Both professional and very relavant to the topic which is being discussed.  I enjoyed reading it very much. <br>  <br> The ideas that you mentioned about a person not selling the copyrighted intellectual property, but rather selling one's time, is the point that I was attempting to make in my first post.  You are quite right in that the property is not leaving the virtual environment.  And furthermore, nobody who is doing Everquest-related auctions is actually purporting to own said property.  Nor are they making claims of selling the rights to this property to another individual.  They are selling their time, and the intellectual property does *not* leave it's virtual environment.   <br>  <br> Therefore, no violation of copyright law has been committed.  The item has not been reproduced, altered, or stated to have been &quot;sold&quot; to another person.  The property (the items being ebayed) do not leave the virtual environment and therefore they are still owned by Verant and a *different* character playing the game happens to be in posession of the item *on his character*, also *within the virtual environment*. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

				Again, I say that the concept of &quot;selling your time&quot; is ludicrous &amp; moot. <br>  <br> The &quot;time&quot; you are &quot;selling&quot; is spent accessing Verant servers via the EverQuest client in pursuit of intellectual property on the aforementioned servers. <br>  <br> If EQ did not exist at all, you would have no medium to get the product that you are selling.  Point blank. <br>  <br> The &quot;selling of time&quot; arguement is merely a crutch to justify blatant disregard for the EULA.  The items you say that haven't been &quot;sold,&quot; have indeed been &quot;sold.&quot; <br>  <br> The item has switched from one &quot;owner&quot; to another for a sum of money (RL currency, not plat) that has also changed hands.   <br>  <br> That makes the buyer the greatest goof of all as he has paid for an intangible amount of time &amp; an intangible item he will lose if his account is banned for eBaying. <br>  <br>  <br> You obviously don't agree with the EULA's section on Verant's opposition to eBaying, so the next time you are online &amp; want to play, click &quot;I disagree&quot; instead. <br>  <br> Watch &amp; see what happens next.  Did you get to go to Kunark to get another Froglok Bonecaster's Robe to put up for auction? <br>  <br> I didn't think so... <br>  <br> If anything, the only reason I am opposed to the shut down of eBay is that at least eBay was an organized medium of exchange with rules &amp; punishments.   <br>  <br> Now, the pharmer's market will be segmented &amp; driven underground with no way to seek remedy if you are scammed or taken advantage of. <br>  <br> Of course, you would not be scammed at all if you simply obeyed the EULA in the first place &amp; did not use eBay. <br>  <br> Keep your hands in the roller coaster car at all times &amp; enjoy your ride.  The rules of the park are there for your protection.

				Khonshu, (I'm going to borrow your favorite phrase here) using your logic, people who create programs using a commercial C compiler shouldn't get anything for their time either.  After all, &quot;The 'time' you are 'selling' is spent accessing [someone else's compiler].&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;If [that compiler] did not exist at all, you would have no medium to get the product that you are selling. Point blank.&quot; <br>  <br> Are you now going to tell us that this situation is true only for EQ but not for the compiler example?  The fact of the matter is that nothing illegal is being done.  People have made weak attempts to invalidate the idea of selling your time because courts have rejected that notion where it comes to selling contraband.  Contraband is, of course, illegal items such as drugs, munitions, fully-automatic weapons, etc.  So, clearly that doesn't apply here (so all of you who keep pulling this arguement out of your arse, keep it in your pants).  Now, the flip-side of this is that there are a LOT of examples of cases where people sell their time.  Basically, that's all you have to sell in the first place.  Whether you work at McDonald's (like vaalik and fugger) or you're an independant consultant, you are selling your time. <br>  <br> Ok, so what really is the issue at hand?  Well, probably the biggest issue at hand is establishing the ownership of your character.  This may seem like a no-brainer; but if you stop for a moment and think about it, it's not so clear.  Let's say you have a level 60 character on your account.  Verant accuses you of cheating (you weren't really cheating, but for some reason they thought you were) and immediately terminates your account.  Are you just going to throw up your hands and say, &quot;Oh well, according to the EULA they can boot me anytime they like.&quot;  If you say that is what you would do then you are lying through your teeth.  No, you would be pissed!  You would be calling Verant's technical support and trying to get friends to page GMs in game (which, incidently, can get them banned too).  After trying for days, you finally get to speak to someone up the ladder, Thom Terrazas for example.  You will tell him how hard you labored to build up your character and how you've been playing since day 1 and how you've always been honest and never exploited any bugs.  Of course, your account would remain banned and you would sit there lamenting the loss of your character and how all that time had been throw away.  Do you still think time doesn't matter?  Do you still cling to the idea that the characters belong to Verant, or do you feel that this character is what he is because YOU made him that way (within the parameters of the game, of course)?  You see, that is ultimately what this is all about and why I think it's important for this to go to trial.  Yes, they could pull the plug tomorrow and EQ would cease to exist; people could stop playing D&amp;D tomorrow and all of those books, manuals, dice, and what-have-you would be equally as useless.  However, WHILE the game remains in operation, people should have certain rights where it comes to the characters that THEY have worked so hard on.  Verant doesn't give you anything, YOU are what makes your character who he or she is.  YOU are the one who spent countless hours leveling and aquiring gear and accumulating wealth.  Is it not YOUR time that is at the very heart of this issue?  How can you, then, sit there and say that the time doesn't matter?  Honestly, who are you really kidding?

				Let's expand the topic a bit.  Since we're talking about intellectual property rights, what about strategy guides?  There are whole hosts of strategy guides out there; some are official, most are not.  Does this infringe upon the company's IP rights?  Nintendo seems to think so.  They have brought a lawsuit against a company that puts out an unofficial Pokemon strategy guide and hosts numerous gaming websites.  Head on over to www.gamespy.com for full details.  If companies are allowed to claim as their exclusive domain anything that pertains to their product, then we must agree that ALL of these websites and message boards and such are illegal.  Where does it end?  Is Consumer Reports no longer allowed to rate products because use of pictures and names of products violates trademarks and copyrights, etc., etc.?  Of course, now you are sitting back thinking, &quot;Well, that's silly, of course they are allowed to rate products; that's a far cry from selling EQ items on eBay.&quot;  Well, *YOU* may have a clear distinction in your head, but that doesn't mean one exists within the context of the law.  So, we get back to the fundamental argument of ownership and time.  No one can say that camping the Glowing Black Stone isn't a considerable effort.  The question remains, then, that once you've obtained the item, is it yours by virtue of the work you've put into obtaining it?  Let's take a broader example, you build a character up to level 60 and decide you're tired of EQ.  If you have a friend or family member who would like to play that character, shouldn't you be able to give it to them if you so desire?  The fact is that most people do share accounts with friends and family even though it is expressly forbidden in the EULA.  For every other piece of software out there, you care purchase it and then sell it to someone else if you wish (same thing for tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc.)--why, then, is Everquest exempt from this?  The fact is that the only thing that makes them exempt is that they put it in the EULA.  The only problem is that other companies have tried that and were defeated in court.  The FACT is that consumers have certain rights and considerations where it comes to things they've paid for.  THAT is at the very heart of this issue.   <br>  <br> Vaalik, if you want to demonstrate that you aren't just a knee-jerk reactionary, try responding to my entire post rather than just a single line taken out of context.

				Taking down ebay auctions is an idiotic move. Now black market sites are popping up like crazy. Even yahoo has more than 1000 EQ auctions now. Also a few newcomer auction sites like playerauction.com and egamesauction.com, which seems a little shady, probably like ebay 3 years ago. Some enterprising dealers even set up their own sites using ezboard , like this one that I ran across: pub48.ezboard.com/beqstore - what was verant thinking? I bet they're getting even more complaints now. As long as the market is there, it'll be business as usual for everyone, shutting down ebay won't stop anything. So anti ebay players think they won eh? Think again.

				Let's examine this logically &amp; calmly.  <br>  <br> First of all: <br>  <br> &quot;people who create programs using a commercial C compiler shouldn't get anything for their time either. After all, &quot;The 'time' you are 'selling' is spent accessing [someone else's compiler].&quot;  <br>  <br> Your case here is flawed because even though I am using someone else's compiler, the code is still mine because I am the programmer. <br>  <br> The same thing can be said of licensing game engines.  Sure &quot;American McGee's Alice&quot; runs on the Quake III engine, but the engine license was legitimately purchased &amp; proper credit given to the Quake III team.  The code to &quot;Alice&quot; itself was created by the original programers &amp; them alone.  As a result, &quot;Alice&quot; is a unique product &amp; they are the creators. <br>  <br> At no point in time are you creating a module for EQ by merely raiding Guk, nor can you because it is against the EULA to alter the program as it stands. <br>  <br> The cold fact of the matter is that no one creates anything by playing EQ; you are merely generating what is already in the data tables. <br>  <br> What you believe is yours is already theirs &amp;, in some cases, has been since beta.  It existed before your character walked Norrath &amp; it will be there afterwards. <br>  <br> &quot;Well, probably the biggest issue at hand is establishing the ownership of your character. This may seem like a no-brainer; but if you stop for a moment and think about it, it's not so clear.&quot; <br>  <br> I am afraid to say that it is indeed a no-brainer.  What you describe as &quot;ownership&quot; is merely an unhealthy fixation on a virtual self.  Being a former DM in the tabletop genre, I have seen players fly into rage when their characters &quot;die,&quot; &amp; have felt it when one of my favorite characters bites the bullet. <br>  <br> You have put so much of your persona into the character that it becomes a part of you in a sense.  You think you &quot;own&quot; it because &quot;Badaxe, Lvl 60 Shaman&quot; reacts a lot like you would in some situations (but what situations in Norrath resemble real life?) &amp; in a sense, reminds you of yourself.  <br>  <br> No one auctions D&amp;D characters scrawled on a piece of paper regardless of how much time they spent leveling that character or how large the stronghold of your 20th level fighter is.  They are concepts with no real value &amp; your auction would get laughed off of eBay. <br>  <br> The only difference between that &amp; EQ is that there is a market for the data &amp; you can &quot;use&quot; eBayed items to an extent; it is more &quot;tangible&quot; than some character record sheet. <br>  <br> However, these concepts are too similar to be ignored.  Beating a dragon &amp; getting a +5 Holy Avenger makes you no more a creator of D&amp;D than camping the GBS makes you a creator of EQ. <br>  <br> You are a paying participant &amp; subject to the rules when you are allowed to play.   <br>  <br> &quot;The FACT is that consumers have certain rights and considerations where it comes to things they've paid for. THAT is at the very heart of this issue.&quot; <br>  <br> That is very true, but consumers also have a responsiblity not to MISUSE the things that they have paid for.  Ammonium Nitrate use as fertilizer is productive &amp; used as bomb formula will get you time in prison. <br>  <br> I can't use my apartment to make adult movies just because I pay $300 a month in rent.   <br>  <br> If I break the rules, I suffer the consequences regardless of the time or amount of finances I sink into something.   <br>  <br> Time spent &amp; money invested does not equal ownership in certain cases, including this one.  THAT is the primary issue. <br>  <br> The burning finality is that you do not have ownership over something that was never yours in the first place.   <br>  <br> You played a game, some random numbers were generated by Verant's computers, the simulated outcome ended in your favor &amp; the database generated a random number resulting in a nice piece of treasure for your character. <br>  <br> Time &amp; how it is spent is indeed the crux of the matter.  The time you spent looking for the GBS could have been spent getting a better job, meeting the woman of your dreams, or even getting some sleep. <br>  <br> I am not saying that EQ is a waste of time, because the game is still fun to me.  I am only saying that I am not so wrapped up in Norrath that I have deluded myself into thinking that I am lord &amp; master because my 60th level Warrior has been around since beta. <br>  <br> I am a paying rent to run my warrior around Norrath &amp; the lease is the EULA:  if I break the &quot;lease&quot; &amp; the &quot;landlord&quot; finds out, I can get &quot;evicted.&quot; <br>  <br> Painting a room red in my apartment doesn't give me ownership of that room, despite the COST of the paint or HOW LONG it took to paint it.  The space still belongs to the landlord.   <br>  <br> It baffles me how eBayers can refuse to accept this simple concept because it suits them. <br>  <br> The only regrettable thing about the loss of eBay is that now the threat of fraud is greater because the trade has been driven underground. <br>  <br> I completely agree that not allowing item exchange is bogus &amp; sad, but if it is part of the rules of the game &amp; I want to continue playing, I will follow the rules. <br>  <br> If I don't agree with Verant's stance on eBay, then I wouldn't give them my business &amp; would persuade others not to do so as well. <br>  <br> Why attempt a lawsuit to change the policy of a company that is unwilling to change? <br>  <br> The answer is simply not to buy or play EQ if you find the EULA distasteful.

				Forgot to address one issue. <br>  <br> &quot;Verant doesn't give you anything.&quot; <br>  <br> My good man..  They gave you EverQuest in the first place. <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">    <br>  <br> It pains me to hear people bash Verant in that way.   <br>  <br> I hate their customer service &amp; think that their testing methods leave a lot to be desired. <br>  <br> EverQuest seems to be NeverReady because of the umpteen million &quot;improvements.&quot; (aka: fixes)  That tells me that obviously EQ hit the market because someone needed to make money &amp; not because the product itself was ready. <br>  <br> That is another issue entirely. <br>  <br> The fact remains that Verant has contributed something.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here debating the validity (or lack thereof) of eBay... <br>  <br> The floor is now clear for your rebuttle, psicop.. <br>
