				Please sign up below with:  <br> Name:  <br> Class:  <br> SS Armor: (Pieces you HAVE quested or un-quested)  <br>  <br> NOTE: If you are KoS to CoV, please do not sign up!  <br>  <br> REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br> **** Beginning this week if your not there at 7:45 EST and in group I will mark you absent. Too many people are waiting until 8 PM to login and it holds up the whole raid. No more! Be there no later than 7:45 EST ***  <br>  <br> The following are 14 facts about how the Monday Public ToV Loot Policy works and how it has been implemented.  <br>  <br> REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br>  <br> -------------------------------  <br> Loot Policy Facts:  <br> -------------------------------  <br> 1.) Your raid point is calculated for each raid.  <br> 2.) Only SS armor count. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you have something better.  <br> 3.) You get bonus points for being level 60 (3pts), 59 (2pts), 58 (1pt).  <br> 4.) You get 1pt for each SS armor you have.  <br> 5.) You can NEVER have more than 10pts, EVER. 11pts = Complete SS Armor Set.  <br> 6.) Your attendance is kept track using RMT, but is NOT used unless there is a tie.  <br> 7.) Dice is ONLY used if both armor/level points and attendance are tied.  <br> 8.) Only your attendance and the armor you passed on are remembered raid after raid.  <br> 9.) You will get penalize 1pt for every 30 minutes you are late for the raid.  <br> 10.) If your LP is BP, you need to attend 3 raids before being eligible for it.  <br> 11.) If you are second-piece to LP, you need to attend 3 raids before you can loot.  <br> 12.) If mistakes are made in loot awarding, they WILL be corrected in succeeding raids.  <br> 13.) Beginning on Monday November 4, 2002 we will start with negative (-1) point for no show attendance if you were signed up and grouped unless you have posted to the group listing by Monday 5pm EST stating you will not be able to attend. In order to make that point back you will have to actually be grouped and attend the very next raid you have signed up for. You will spend that entire raid (-1) point. The following raid you will have your total restored providing you show up. After 2 no shows I will not even take your sign up seriously anymore.  <br> 14.) Beginning Monday March 3, 2003 if you forget your peridots you will get a 7 day grace period to make up for it. If you lose out on your grace period you lose 1 loot point per set of 4 peridot you forget to submit (I know it's a redundant scenario with clerics since we give peridot right back to you, but to keep things fair we will make this uniform for everyone). What this means is you can accrue negative points for forgetting your peridot. This may be a harsh example, (but fortunately most of the LP folks remember their peridots) you can go from LP at 10 points to falling behind the other LP folks due to losing points. I hate to have to implement such a policy but having to put out peridots from my pocket because 1/3 of the raid can't remember to bring them is getting rough. I figure I'd rather not boot you from raid, but rather keep you on raid with incentive for you to remember your peridots.  <br>  <br> Key Point: If you understood Facts 1-14, you will then realize that the raid point is on a scale of 0 to 10 (not including penalties that can incur negative totals). Furthermore, Attendance has nothing to do with raid points unless you sign up, are grouped and don't show up. Attendance and Dice are METHODS of tie breaking, which ultimately affects who is ahead on the loot list when there is a tie on raid points.  <br>  <br> REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br> ********* KEY POINTS IN DETAIL *******************  <br>  <br> LOOT POLICY - RAID ATTENDANCE AND DICE  <br> * When there is a tie on raid points, attendance will be the deciding factor on who is higher up on the list;  <br> * If there is still a tie, a dice will be the determining factor.  <br>  <br> LOOT POLICY - PASSING ON ARMOR  <br> * You can pass on an armor if you have something better ONLY if you were awarded it;  <br> * You will then receive 1pt for passing on the item and will maintain your position on the loot list.  <br>  <br> LOOT POLICY - BREASTPLATE  <br> * Whoever has the most SS armor pieces when BP drops gets the BP. (Read this 3 times.);  <br> * You must have attended at least 3 prior raids.  <br>  <br> LP will always be honored using above criteria for BP. If more than one player is tied for number of pieces determining factor is &#8220;RAIDS ATTENDED.&#8221; If there is a tie of raid attendance and pieces when BP drops it is broken by roll. Points for level are NOT a determining factor in BP award and there is NO BENEFIT to being over level 60 on this raid. If a person makes LP on this raid and that piece drops and they have the required raids attended it is awarded no matter which piece it is.  <br>  <br> Level for this raid is 55 for all classes.  <br> Unbuffed resists for Cold and Fire no less than 80  <br>  <br> REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br>  <br> ********* Symbols and Tears (NEW and fleshed out) ********************  <br>  <br> Only those who have completed their armor are eligible to roll on symbols and/or tears. They are there to support the raid and this is their only potential reward for attending.  <br>  <br> Each full armor person is required to select which quest they wish to pursue out of those that the symbol might be used for. They must inform the Raid Leader (RL) in charge of loot of their choice by posting to this board prior to raid start.  <br>  <br> Symbols that are not a part of a posted quest will be randomed to those in FULL ARMOR for future quests. As you all know I maintain at least one group every raid of those in full armor. They are an important part of this raid and it&#8217;s success.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> -------------------------------  <br>  <br> REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br>  <br> ******** THIS IS A (4) HOUR RAID ***********  <br> If you have time restrictions not allowing you to stay the whole raid it is not fair to the others that sign on for 4 hours. Please keep that in mind signing up. I do realize RL situations happen on occasion and people must leave. When it happens every week you are telling me you should not be on this raid.  <br>  <br> NOTE I will group as many as I can from this sign up list. I will NOT fill no show spots at the zone. I do NOT guarantee anyone a spot on this raid. I work hard to keep those that have been on nearly every raid moving to complete their sets. Those that send me tells prior to the raid wanting to dispute my not filling no show spots at the zone or that they have not been on a raid although they signed up, aren't furthering their cause by trying to strong arm me. I have said repeatedly I am not starting new people until I can move some on that have made this raid 8 plus groups a week. When I do begin filling spots I will do it on needed classes first. I do all of this so lists can be prepared before the start of the raid and less errors occur. Those that attend these raids know we rarely start more than 5 minutes late. This makes for a much faster, more productive raid for everyone.  <br>  <br> THIS IS A MOVING RAID. If your not on time message me, if we have left the hall we can not get you to us. I won't hold people up that were on time.  <br>  <br> REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br>  <br> *********************************************  <br>  <br> NEW SECTION! NEW SECTION! NEW SECTION!  <br>  <br> Some DO's and DON'Ts for the raid:  <br>  <br> 1) If you are separated from the raid by way of a door, please PLEASE 'knock' and wait for clearance to enter.  <br> 1a) DO NOT OPEN A DOOR UNLESS CLEARANCE HAS BEEN GIVEN  <br> 2) IF YOU ARE NOT A MONK YOU SHOULD NOT DRAG YOUR CORPSE. Loot your corpse on the spot.  <br> 3) DO NOT SIT DOWN WHEN MOBS ARE INCOMING! The mobs hate it when you sit and they will let you know it. When you sit down you create ping pong aggro and as you noticed the mobs were hopping in the cubby making it difficult for the MT to control them. So please stay awake and stand up on incoming pulls. If you will be afk, go afk standing up and autofollow someone.  <br> 4) NO NUKING UNTIL ASSIST IS CALLED. I can't believe I have to post this, but I figure I will give you the benefit of the doubt and now you have been warned.  <br> 5) BALANCE YOUR POSITION IN BATTLE. That means only the tank in the front, rogues to the back and melees pushing shoulder into the wall.  <br> 6) DO NOT EVAC UNLESS A RAID LEADER (myself or Bloodygecko) CALLS FOR IT.  <br> 7) In times of crisis, please everyone just SHUT THE HELL UP AND WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS. Chances are BG, Lamoeb and I are coming up with a recovery plan so unless you have something to say that is important to the raid, keep your chatter off the channel and await your instructions. The sooner and more efficiently we recover, the quicker we are back in raid mode.  <br> 8) REMEMBER YOUR PERIDOT! ELSE THERE WILL BE A LOOT POINT PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING PERIDOT (SEE RULES REGARDING THIS IN POST).  <br>  <br> That is what I have for now. I am sure in the future I will need to add some more, but for now based on last night's 'learning experience' this is what I have. Based on the DO's and DON'Ts posted, consider yourself informed. First offense is a warning, second offense is a TL to Nexus.  <br>  <br> See you at the raid.
