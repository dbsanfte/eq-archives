				I thought for a good long while about doing this.  And the more and more I do, the more and more I believe our server Innoruuk deserves to read this.   <br>  <br> So I present to you, several posts off the &quot;Members Only&quot; section of Legions of Darkness ezboard. These go to show you their elitest attitude and how they believe they own the server...just wrong. <br>  <br>  Enjoy these and may a new light be shined upon Innoruuk. <br>  <br> -Jill <br> The Phony Kagana <br> The Old Nelweni <br> &quot;The fucking bitch&quot; <br>  <br> P.S.  Ezboard security really sucks.  All you have to do is guess a person's login and their password and you have access to all their private message boards they have logged into the past few days.  Also fun to listen to lod when you have all 6 of kags twinks still in lod <br>  <br> P.S.S. OBS  - Anartik of LoD is reading your private message boards now (or maybe they aren't private dunno, all I know is he has a lot of quotes making fun of your posts there) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> ------------------------------------------------ <br>  <br> Scarfase   <br> Global user <br> (3/2/00 4:55:47 pm) <br> Reply Dragons, Last Night, and Us <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Well the inevitbale happened. Some other guild finally threw enough gimps and Nag to kill him. Ok so what does this mean and more importantly to me what should we have done. <br>  <br> First let me say that I hate the fact that another guild got to &quot;our&quot; loot. BUT, I think we need to handle things differently if this ever happens again. for those of you who were there you know that after Nag was slain the ooc taunting/flaming started. <br>  <br> The fact is we need to be above this. LoD is the best guild- everyone knows it and the slaying of one dragon doesnt mean shit. So, we need to focus on not being drawn in to petty bullshit. Specifically, I think we need to not go in to shouting or ooc and trash talk or accuse people of exploiting. <br>  <br> NOW WAIT. before you get angry, I'm not sayin exploiting is ok, or that we shouldnt complain about it (if its done), I am sayin lets to it in a mature manner. The one thing that defines LoD in my opinion is that we are a mature group. We may screw around with each other, but to outsiders we are nothing but elite killing machines. So if you have a beef do a petition or send it in tell if you really have to. The fact is all that did was make LoD look bad and like jealous biatches. <br>  <br> OK, so now lets talk about the future. Obviously other guilds are getting stronger. Eventually someone will slay vox and Innorruk- Just count on it. The only thing we can do to delay this is beat these people to these spawns. In order to do this i think we need to do several things. <br> 1. Find out the Gms policy and getting to something 1st <br> 2. Find out when patches are being done so we can schedule stuff for that day. <br> 3. Get more daytime members to hold the fort. <br>  <br> I know the last one means having to share with them as inevitbaly day timers will play at night. The way I see it better a new member in our guild get lewt than another guild get it. <br>  <br> These are merely my thoughts. I am not here to say we are in deep shit, I am here to keep it so that we own our server. Im a greddy mofo and sharin with others sucks ;P.  <br>  <br> Oh and I will take this opportunity to announce the marriage of scarrlett and sydsloot. He has finally agreed to settle down!!!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br> Romtom2   <br> Global user <br> (3/2/00 6:09:24 pm) <br> Reply Re: Dragons, Last Night, and Us <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>  <br> no one else will be killing innurook for a while id suspect <br>  <br> no one has even touched him before he got beefed up, now he is like 5 x as hard <br>  <br>  <br>   <br> Saradeline   <br> Global user <br> (3/2/00 6:10:10 pm) <br> Reply Re: Dragons, Last Night, and Us <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Just a couple things... <br>  <br> &quot;3. Get more daytime members to hold the fort.&quot; <br>  <br> *sigh* This is NOT going to fix problems; it will only create other problems by having 253245 people in the guild. On top of that...we do dragons because people need more items from them. Well, every additional person we add is ANOTHER person we need to get dragon items for. Take Minie for example. She's a twink. She'll NEVER get a dragon scale if we're always adding other primaries to the guild. I guess my point is...adding more people (over the 2/month limit) isn't going to &quot;catch us up&quot; in terms of dragon loot; it will only keep us behind or at the same spot (such as Minie still patiently waiting). ---- Stick with 2/month....exception is an obviously short class (such as clerics in February). <br>  <br> Btw, hope you don't mind using you (Minie) as an example...I could have easily used Jeyana, Dengping, Loklok, etc, or the plethora of lvl 40 twinks that are soon to be 50. <br>  <br> &quot;Oh and I will take this opportunity to announce the marriage of scarrlett and sydsloot. He has finally agreed to settle down!!!!!&quot; <br>  <br> What?!!?!?!?!? Syd!! Who's this Scarrlett?? Do tell.  <br>  <br>   <br> Scarfase   <br> Global user <br> (3/2/00 6:18:27 pm) <br> Reply Re: Dragons, Last Night, and Us <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Sara I think you miss one of the points. <br>  <br> If others are killing the mobs and getting the lewts then no one in LoD is geting a thing. The need for day time members is based on the fact that we apparently dont have enough peep sto go kill ice/fire giants during the day to hold claim to the spawns. <br>  <br> Yes that means more people, but the way I see it we got a big ZERO last night. That sucks. Would rather have to share with LoD memebers and wait longer then not have a shot at it. <br>  <br> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <br>  <br> Avarus   <br> Global user <br> (2/23/00 9:56:53 am) <br> Reply Vox tonight? <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> I think we had decided on Nag before I logged last night but it looks like Storm is planning on giving it a shot. They're going to be all pissy if we move in ahead of them as stated in this post: <br> &quot;Well I know of only one guild who has a problem scheduling dragon attempts. I think pretty soon we will have to do something or you will have multiple guilds racing to get the dragons and lagging out the zone.  <br>  <br> Frankly I will be suprised, not to mention furious, if a guild jumps the dragon, as all the guilds know we are going to try and that we actually might have a chance at killing it. So if someone goes in &quot;early&quot; then I can assume it is a true free-for-all from this point forth, which will not benefit anyone.&quot; <br>  <br> Might as well just avoid the whole situation, let them have their shot and go do Vox. I suppose someone should <br> &quot;reserve&quot; Vox on the board huh? *sigh* Also, is it going to come down to us reserving dragons way in advance much like Pantheon does PoF?  <br> Anyway, not much else to say on this matter other than this server better get split soon. With so many people competing for limited resources this game is rapidly moving toward being unfun.  <br>  <br>   <br> Nantik   <br> Global user <br> (2/23/00 10:43:57 am) <br> Reply Re: Vox tonight? <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Fuck that, Storm doesn't have a chane at killing Nag, their egos which should have been deflated after the 91310823018 failure they've had should tell them that. I say we go kill Vox, if they're not done with Nag by the time we get there, go kill Nagafen. Fuck them, I really could care less about them. They'll probably just say &quot;We were testing it out, when they die&quot; then go on with &quot;You guys are just afraid we'd win&quot; after they die the second time and we move in. C'est la vie. If you can't handle your side of the alley clean, let the dog pound move in. <br>  <br>   <br> Nantik   <br> Global user <br> (2/23/00 10:50:51 am) <br> Reply Re: Vox tonight? <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> If we can get done with vox tonight, I'm really interested in trying out Salty's theory about PoS. Get some peeps up there and start busting on some azrack's maybe finish a couple quests. Won't need to be longer than a couple hours.  <br>  <br>   <br> Junx   <br> Global user <br> (2/23/00 12:56:55 pm) <br> Reply Re: Vox tonight? <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Not gonna reserve dragons. We go when we want (provided he is up). Order of the black staff tried this and we walked right over top. The only point at which I would &quot;schedule a dragon&quot; would be if a guild besides lod actually killed one, and then I would only schedule with said guild (if that) ignoring all other schedules by those who have yet to be successful. <br>   <br> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <br> Wooo racist remarks <br>  <br> Equies <br> Global user <br> (2/21/00 4:32:56 pm) <br> Reply <br>  Canning Nigpally. <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> GG.

They want Vox either tonight or tomorrow (is she up yet? if so, let's ask them to try tonight, so we have tomorrow to kill her), and Nagafen on Wednesday (which means we kill him Thursday). It would _ really _ suck if Unbidden insisted on waiting til tomorrow (assuming Vox is up tonight) and did not leave us enough time to kill her before patch.  <br>  <br>  <br> Miriana  <br>  <br>   <br> topekk   <br> Global user <br> (2/14/00 11:06:09 am) <br> Reply dragon reservations <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> we never agreed to that  <br>  <br> if they're up and were there and they're (gimp group X) not, we spank dragon.  <br>  <br> unbidden forfeited their reservations with going for nag last friday neway  <br>  <br>  <br> Edited by topekk   at: 2/14/00 11:06:09 am <br>  <br>   <br> Bamur   <br> Local user <br> (2/14/00 11:08:10 am) <br> Reply Re: thoughts on this week... <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> cant reserve a dragon without our permission since noone has killed one yet.

I cant believe I actually tried to get you back into LoD. Metreus was right, you are a bitch plain and simple and I wouldnt trust you, ever. Dont fucking lie about how you got the password to the our board, you didnt guess any pass or any shit. The REAL Kagana told you the pass, the REAL kagana and former LoD is your real life friend. How fucking low can you go? I dont usually read this board but this sick shit was brought to my attention a few moments ago.  <br>  <br> Zune <br> 50 Ranger <br> Legions of Darkness <br>

				I wish I could say I was suprised by the contents of this post. I'm not. <br>  <br> I'm a bit miffed that they'd congratulate us to our faces but demean us behind our backs; but again, it's not suprising. <br>  <br> There are some technical problems, however, and I feel a need to correct them: <br>  <br> [Quoting Bamur] <br> Bamur   <br> Local user <br> (2/14/00 11:08:10 am) <br> Reply Re: thoughts on this week... <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> cant reserve a dragon without our permission since noone has killed one yet. We do which dragon we choose. Vox it is.  <br> [End Quote] <br> [Quoting Junx] <br> Junx   <br> Global user <br> (2/23/00 12:56:55 pm) <br> Reply Re: Vox tonight? <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Not gonna reserve dragons. We go when we want (provided he is up). Order of the black staff tried this and we walked right over top. The only point at which I would &quot;schedule a dragon&quot; would be if a guild besides lod actually killed one, and then I would only schedule with said guild (if that) ignoring all other schedules by those who have yet to be successful. <br> [End Quote] <br>  <br> The Pantheon killed Vox over a month ago, as a guild-only event, and shortly before that with a larger outing. You may recall someone making a &quot;Voxownzu&quot; to be parked in the IGD room before we took her down? We used no pathing bugs and killed her in her lair. <br>  <br> [Quoting Sydsloot] <br> Syd   <br> Moderator <br> (2/17/00 9:57:36 am) <br> Reply <br>  Re: Caz slain... <br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> Did they bother thanking us for clearing Cazic's playground for them? Oh, pooh. Either way, Fear is getting upgraded, just rather sad that other people got the loots. <br> [Enq Quote] <br>  <br> No we didn't, because LOD had nothing to do with his death. We got the zone at like 98% pop, and by the time we got to the unpopped sections they'd popped. There was one MOB we didn't kill - draco. If this requires a thank you, then I'd like to see one for the last time you killed CT, since we killed draco for you. Not coming? Not suprised. You shouldn't be suprised when you don't get one because you offed draco earlier. <br>  <br> And maybe LOD was, in some mysterious way, a pivitol factor in his second death? Please, elaborate - I'd love to hear. <br>  <br> I feel the need to break away from facts for one moment: <br> 2 robes the first time <br> 1 robe the second <br> 3 robes for us <br> 0 robes for you <br> nyah nyah nyah <br> *points at Semara and laughs* <br>  <br> Well. That was cathartic. I feel a lot better now, how about you?

Youd think lod would say good someone else killed nagafen maybe we wont be thought of as monopolizing dragons instead they are saying 'OH no what can we do to stop this NOONE should be aloud to kill our dragons they must of exploited!! they Stole our loot WAHHHH!' STOP FUCKING WHINING goodgod i hope gms tell you to fuck off. Now ill admit i dont know if storm exploited or not but I DO KNOW if Lod ever got the chance theyd of done the same thing.. this holier then thou trip is simply jeolousy at losing what they considered to be theirs. IMHO i think the only way to fix this is for 3 or 4 of the larger guild to combine so they can compete with lod... eventually once lod no longer monopolizes everything they will  get sick of not getting enough loot to satisfy their member base and break up leaving dragons, planes and whatever the expansion holds for ALL players to enjoy.

				&lt;blinks&gt;  Um.   Thanks guys? <br>  <br> I'm still not sure what disappoints me more here. <br>  <br> 1) The person who posted private messages in a public forum. <br>  <br> 2) The &quot;friends&quot; in that guild who /tell'ed me in deluge of &quot;Congratulations!! <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> &quot; after 2 Vox kills and 2 Cazic kills from one side of their mouth, then turned around and posted that garbage from the other. <br>  <br> 3) The others in that guild who can somehow continue to associate with them in clear conscience. <br>  <br> Of all of them, I think it's the last one that troubles me the most.  With one exception... <br>  <br>  <br> On a more personal, historical note - Semara.  Yes.  It's true.  There was a reason that you didn't get into Pantheon before you petitioned LoD.  You were rejected by the majority of the guild, who apparently saw something in you that I didn't. <br>  <br> Atreides considered you such a close friend.  I just didn't have the heart to tell you. <br>  <br> I do now. <br>  <br> Thank you - I no longer feel like I may have made a bad decision.
