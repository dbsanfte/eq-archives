	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl1_MessageView_bcMessageBody">Drizzit appoached Maetron Baenre in a fast and agressive advance. Leave me alone forever! he said, his fist was clenched so hard that drops of blood hit the dark and dusty cavern floor. No! You will suffer same fate as Catti-brie if you dont join us! Baenre sounded as wicked as ever ,her hand made a slit throat gesture at Gwuenwyvar who snarled back but there was fear in it and Drizzit detected it. He knew now it was time to choose between these wicked as spider drow, his own brethen or the surface dwellers like Wulfgar, the stern barbarian who above all else had the bravest of hearts.<br /> <br /> No! The caverns echoed and birdlike creatures rose though the tunnels making screeching noises. Drizzit narrowed his eyes and looked straight into Baenres and thus inspired courage in Gwuenwyvar who walked in front of Drizzit to protect him.<br /> <br /> You cannot deny our nature ,we will rule wherever we want or see fit. For how long has the Harpers poisoned your heart? Your love for the weak will be your greatest mistake, Do&#180;Urden have but one last chance to return to its former pride and strengths. You dont have a choice , havent I made my self clear! Baenre screamed in anger.<br /> <br /> Suddenly out of the shadow a cloaked figure appeared rushing towards Drizzit. A glimpse of steel blinked,Twack! Drizzit had drown his left scimitar so fast and following the slip and slide that avoided the deadly drow throwing knife, he hurled him self through the air at his opponent he so well knew. For it was Artemis Entreri his arch enemy. Entreri had gained time to hurl one more drow throwing knife, ching! It repelled Drizzit mithril chain armor, had it been just one inch closer to his shoulder joint he would eventually been hit by the poisoned knife. Drizzit looked quickly for Gwuenwyvar ,to his surprise see him rolled on his back, letting out a groan. One poisoned knife wore deep in his chest.<br /> <br /> Entreri had pleasure shown in his evil eyes filled with excitement for all he knew was by killing Drizzit he would rise into the higher society of the drow and without doubt killing him would be his greatest accomplishment and satisfaction of all time.<br /> <br /> The clash of steel and and hissing from them both echoed in the tunnel in front of Baenres mansion. <br /> <br /> Guards! Baenre cried. Gwuenwyvar tried to rise but stumpled about.<br /> <br /> A swift stroke avoided by Drizzit would have landed deep in his chest. Quickly the ranger drow knocked the hilt of his right scimitar in Artemis forehead so hard that he fell three yards behind and landed in the dirt uncounscious.<br /> <br /> The strife would never end, he would forever be wanted dead by the drows. <br /> <br /> Footsteps becoming louder and louder, by the sound of it 20 or so guards . He pointed his left scimitar at Baenre but had nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Gwuenwyvar was dead. He had nothing to do but escape now. <br /></span>

Drizzt wood probably go bezerk and kill all the guard with only a two swings i bet.<br /> <br /> Oh and Drizzit would have plate armor bcause Rangers could wear it if they wanted to.  And he killed some gnomes and tons of drow in the stories.  I bet u didnt even read them.  THey r the best and most original stories!  I wish they would have made the Drizzt series instead of that Lord of the Rings garbage.  That guy Tolken Jr. was ok but Drizzit is way more awesome.</span>

	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl3_MessageView_bcMessageBody">Heyas,<br /> <br /> For my 14year old birthday my brother gave me 3 R.A.Salvatore books. I read them all but that was 15 years ago, so I must admit I dont remember them too well.<br /> <br /> I agree those are great stories. I think the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting was the most original and rock solid world TSR could come up with at that time. It is 1000 times better than the Eberon world that is featured in DDO mmo today.<br /> <br /> My dear father read aloud the hobbit by JRR Tolkien, when I was 11 year old. I thought that was one hell of a story aswell. As a 12 year old I read the Lord of the rings and I cant think of a time in my life ever since, that I was in another world!<br /> <br /> My old buddies I used to play PnP RP with ,all moved from the island, got great jobs and wifes and some of them kids. I dont think PnP is dead but it sure aint as popular as it used to be. Heck, I havent seen Dungeons and dragons in a book store in my area in a decade. Now they are in special stores in my capital city.</span>

	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl7_MessageView_bcMessageBody">I was having ale with Ligol&#225;s and Gindalf, then suddenly a great figure stood in the doorway. It was an orc from Orgrimmar he startet dancing and got a groove going in the whole tavern called The weary dwarf. We danced in our own styles, jive,jittabog,hip-hap and Gindalf was stage diving from the bar. <br /> <br /> We started singing all together in common. Oh, this was a great party indeed. Then suddenly we noticed an undead who had started a stunlock on Gindalf. Gimlei the short dwarf who was a warrior started to charge the undead from his battlestance. The rogued vanished quickly and didnt come back. The orc had something in his travellers backpack. Tassalhofe the Kendar had already looked. It was gold and spakling diamonds. The orc explained he had got them from grinding but Gindalf didnt believe him and pertitioned a gm. Much to his surprise this orc had surely got all this treasure from grinding in 3 years. The fun loving orc started to toss around diamonds and gold every where in the tavern. And everyone was happy! <br /> <br /> The next morning the fun loving orc was gone. We looked for him and asked around, he was last seen at the fp. Many had great headaches from drinking and sore feet from dancing so I healed them and buffed them before I continued my journey. Ligol&#225;s was crying because he missed him so soon. Gindalf had told me I had to get level 70 soon and he was having some issues and concerns he was investigating in. He told me he would need my help. I saddled up on my cat mount and rode towards the forest edge. Just as I entered the woods, right behind from a tree a figure stepped out. It was that undead rogue from last night. <br /> <br /> He laughed a deep dirty laughter. He wanted my gold and diamonds I got from the tavern. He was quite clearly a lvl 70. I knew he would kill me. He was already stealthed so I popped up my shield and went running.Suddenly I went chack! He was right behind me hitting me, I screamed but soon he was just back hitting me again.I stopped to heal but he kicked me, so I could not concentrate on it. <br /> <br /> It would have been just one more hit from him comming right at my throat and I would be real done for. Right behind the undead was the biggest red gorilla pounding him in the back of his head. Some marking arrow was pointing down at the rogues head. Twack! Twack! Incomming arrows from Ligol&#225;s hit the rogue in every limb of his foul flesh. Kersplat! The rogue staggered about , the gorilla finished him off right on top on his head. Gonk! <br /> <br /> The elf from Loorie&#232;n explained he had a far sight and had watched for me the whole time. We departed and promised we would take care. He gave me some lembas bisquets and ale. I gave him a broche I had found on the streets in Telsamar. <br /> <br /> As I rode deeper into the wood I wondered if I ever would meet the orc again and if Gindalf was getting himself in trouble.</span>

	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl8_MessageView_bcMessageBody">Days had passed since I left the woods, the weather had ben fine. Now the clouds where getting dark it was only noon. I was at a farmstead, it began to rain. I took shelter in a shed and waited for a time for it to clear. <br /> <br /> Now suddenly I heard someone talking. It was gutterspeak, a bloodelf and a undead talking. From what I could understand the bloodelf was a paladin he talked about the undead owing him a big favor. Just then I realised the undead was the rogue from the tavern who almost got me killed in the wood. He had been resurected by the bloodelf. They started to laugh their hysterical laughter, talking about killing a lonely druid in Ashenvale. <br /> <br /> I sat dead still, they moved on. And soon they where gone. <br /> <br /> I mounted and rode toward the next village I had on my map. After awhile I noticed pillars of black smoke in the distance. I entered a village that had been attacked and set a fire. All the quest givers where gone and I heard some sound of a battle going on in a tavern. I ran in and saw some alliance, a night elf warrior and a dwarf priest. The dwarf was healing the warrior who was in a tough battle against a bloodelf paladin. The warrior was being hit real hard as he was around my level too. I began to heal him aswell. Chack! Char-Char! The undead rogue was attacking the dwarf! <br /> <br /> I healed them both as well as i could and put up some shadow word:pain on the hordes, but knew it would end in misery. I had little mana now, the dwarf moaned in pain and the night elf began shouting for heals! I had to choose who to save. I cast my last heal on the warrior and looked after the dwarf. He was gone instead there was a big white angel casting heals. As I feared the rogue went for me. I popped my shield up but he tore it apart. He kept on hitting me and the angel was running out of time. <br /> <br /> A figure now stood in the doorway. Clack,clack,clack! Totems all over the place! I could see the hordes bound to the earth.I ran for it! Swoosh! The rogue was frostschocked and walked around not knowing who he should hit. I looked past my shoulder and saw the paladin surrounded by his divine shield. <br /> <br /> It was a draenei shaman who had come by. He smacked around the bloodelf and undead so bad because they where so low already. Whatever tricks they had left was not enough to beat that good shaman. <br /> <br /> Later that evening we celebrated around a campfire, and had ale and lembas. They told great stories of their journies and the shaman had resurected the dwarf. We began to sing an old song we all knew from Stormwind. <br /> The night sky was clear and the stars were bright. We ran out of ale and had enough of lembas. I fell asleep and slept hard that night, knowing I was in good company. <br /> <br /> I woke up and stared in to the embers of the camp fire. The dwarven priest and I went to a building to pray for salvation. We heard the sound of the shaman calling the natures spirits. The warrior had his ritual of combat practice and polishing his armor. <br /> <br /> As we exited the building the shaman sat on his elekk, waving goodbyes. We told him he had the bravest of hearts and wished him safe journeys. The remaining two had been good friends for a decade, they invited me to come along. They were going to fight for justice in Arathi Basin. Almost as I agreed I remembered Gindalf telling me to hit level 70. Somehow I just knew something was happening of greater importance. <br /> <br /> I gave them some of the diamonds and some gold and wished them a happy life. The dwarf smiled and pulled a handfull of blue vials from his robe and gave them to me. He told me they could help me save others when things got hot. The nightelf who was the leader of a guild called Temperance offered me an invitation and said I was more than welcome to visit him in Stormwind where he lived. I told him I would think about it but I would certainly visit him and his guild the next time I came by Stormwind. <br /> <br /> I looked behind my shoulder and they waved to me their goodbyes. <br /> <br /> Later that day I stopped at an inn. I wanted something else than lembas and was thisty for a pint of ale. I entered and it was rather crowdy. I found an empty seat at a table where a hooded figure sat. He was smoking pipeweed and the embers glowed in his mysterious eyes. As I sat down he said something I didnt understand, some old noble language by the sound of it comming from the far north. <br /> <br /> I could not detect if he where hostile. Quickly I ordered two pints of the finest ale. I presented it to him. He drank it all in just a few seconds. I then tried in all languages of Azeroth to get a conversation going. He nodded a couple of times and laughed abit. He walked away from our table and threw a coin right in front of me. <br /> <br /> I stared at the coin it was an unknown currency. He must have been from the far north. <br /> <br /> That night I could not get any sleep. I had two many thoughts about the mysterious man.</span>

	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl9_MessageView_bcMessageBody">Early morning I went down looking for the inn keeper who might knew something about the man who was haunting my mind. I couldnt explain to myself or give a reason for this curiosity. He told me he knew he had arrived a week ago in a strange looking boat by the docks. <br /> <br /> There where no boats by that description parked in the dock. I went to look for a mailbox. I mailed the strange coin to Tassalhofe the Kendar who had travelled very far. I wrote a short notice to him and asked if he also had seen Gindalf and how Ligol&#225;s and Gimlei where doing. <br /> <br /> It wasnt until noon I had mail incoming. I had spend my time looking for the man from yesterday. Tassalhofe had written a long letter and of course forgotten to return the coin. He explained it came from the icy north in the lands called Northrend. He had been there once but had been accused of thievery and so on. He told me Gimley and Ligol&#225;s had begun crafting. However the Kendar had not heard from Gindalf but he was expected to arrive later this day. <br /> <br /> I wanted to have a look at the sea and went down to the docks. Now I certainly noticed a magnificient sight. One boat at the far end was parked. It sails wavering in the air. It had some astounding carvings and a galeon figure of something that could have been a sea witch. On the side of the boat was some carvings on a sign. The letters looked like the ones Ligol&#225;s would use but much more square than fine. It read something in common aswell. The boat was called Virtue. It wasnt any bigger boat than the rest in the docks. <br /> <br /> I had a mail incoming. Almost rushing to the mail box I bumped into a man. This was him again. This time I smiled all over my face but tried to hide it as I wanted to act cool. <br /> <br /> He made a gesture as if explaing he was sorry and real busy at the same time. <br /> <br /> I went to check my mail it was from Gindalf and it had some items attached to it. <br /> <br /> There was four items. Very much to my surprise that same broche I had given to Ligol&#225;s where one of them. As I came to realize this was, as Gindalf wrote, an old guardian badge used by some foul army in the north. But this one was abit special as it was that of a secret spy. There where no explanation to me, why it had ended in Telsamar. Gimlei had craftet a trinket from gnomish engineering, it was for me. I didnt understand its function though. Ligol&#225;s had made a special wand for me from enchanting. The last thing was a sealed box that Gindalf wanted me to deliver in the docking town called Temerity on the continent of Northrend. As I picked it up I found it unusually light. It was either clothes or papers. <br /> <br /> I wanted to help my old friends so I had to do it. I was sure Gindalf would come and help if things got dangerous. <br /> <br /> Now these things got me all nervous and I wished me back to the day in The weary dwarf tavern. I wished the fun loving orc was there and we had a great party all night again.</span>

	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl10_MessageView_bcMessageBody">I knew what I had to do. Gindalf had explained it to me. I was to give the sealed package to the man I met at the inn smoking pipe weed. He would then reconize the seal. It was for his employer he worked for in Temerity. The pipe weed man was a sailor who was trading with some cargo. But somehow I thought he was just abit more than a sailor. The sailor would take me across the sea. His empoyer had a mission for me. <br /> <br /> The journey was long. The sailor was quiet often some times he started singing in his beautifull language and at one time I started dancing to it, but then he stopped. I couldnt figure out if he was rude but he had some different manners. There was a small crew a mates aboard always busy cleaning the deck and cooking. One day I got real sick because of the waves rising to high. The others didnt show much compassion as I had to throw up alot. One of the mates just shaked his head. <br /> <br /> They had ale though it was much sweeter than I was used to it made the journey less painfull. <br /> <br /> One day we saw land. Icy mountains rose in the air and seagulls had appeared. <br /> <br /> As we entered the docks of Temerity I saw buildings and some figures walking around. <br /> <br /> They looked taller but they where too busy with their lives to notice my different looks. I saw another elf leaning against a building. He had dark skin and white hair, equipped with two deadly swords at his side. He wore mithil armor. He was tossing a small figurine into the air and confidently cathing it again. By the looks of this elf, he was level 80 atleast, his appearance left such strong impression on me I got scared. <br /> <br /> This elf was the employer of the sailor. As we got in a building the elf employer tore the box open with one of his swords. I got a glimpse of pipe weed. <br /> <br /> Soon they had lit up their pipes and was smoking Gindalfs special blend. They looked alot more relaxed now. <br /> <br /> The elf started in common with no accent to explain who they where. <br /></span>

It had many wooden containers piled on top of eachother. In the middle was a square table. Some colorful cards laid on it, almost as in a certain system. I studied them for a time. <br /> <br /> Dreeezt noticed my interest and explained with insane enthusiasm that it was called Wow trading card game. He said they where abit fanatical as many of the wooden containers where loaded with these small cards. He explained the rules to me and I got a deck for free. We sat down and started playing. It was easy to get into and made me use my brain alot. <br /> <br /> We made a small tournament. I only won against Thoar because Dreeezt where so good at it. He said that the winner could pick one card from the looser. But as a friendly gesture he offered me one instead. The card was named Frostmourne. I took good care of it. <br /> <br /> Suddenly Dreeezt jumped up and asked if I wanttedd to see something real cool. He showed me a jade figurine, he started to polish it with his fingers. <br /> <br /> Roaaar! Suddenly a big black panther from stranglethorn vale was looking at me. It was called Gwenvar. It lived in another dimension but Dreeezt could summon it with the jade figurine. <br /> <br /> He told me Gindalf had asked Dreeezt to take care of a few things and Dreeezt asked for my help aswell. He said If I would help I could either choose some trading cards or a the wow pen and paper roleplaying game. <br /> <br /> Dreeezt showed my an old tome with a page. It pictured what was called a Pallenthir. They where scattered about the universe on every planet and where made by the old gods. If one day a world would be on the brink of extinction they would call to eachothers aid and they would gather an army so big and strong that it would shatter any evil force threatening the free poeple who above all else lives for fun and taking good care of their worlds. <br /> <br /> Gindalf had studied many tomes in Gwondor and Stormwind library and located one to be in castle Lightwolf to the north in northrend. We now had to travel there and use it to warn others that Azeroth is in dire need of help. <br /> <br /> Dreeezt had lived in the cold north for many years. Recently an insanely huge army of undeads and necromancers have been gathered to the north and already had begun marching to the shores. All lead by the undead King Arthas who hates everyone for no good reason. <br /> <br /> Dreeezt didnt knew where castle Lightwolf was but I knew what to do for once.</span>

He was sixhundred years old and was a true explorer . No one loved discovering new things more that him. <br /> <br /> We agreed that Zardax the warlock should be convinced to summon him to Northrend. Dreeezt had explained that Zardax owed him a favor as the dark elf once got him out of trouble. The warlock lived in his tower near Temerity. <br /> <br /> Thoar who always where silent had equipped him himself with a giant hammer and wore a well polished plate armor. I knew I was right he wasnt just a sailor. He was a noble paladin. <br /> <br /> The tower was made of black granite like rock. It had four floors. But Zardax was at the door at the tower locking it as we approached. A black steed with burning hoves turned around as it heard us coming. Zardax spun around and stared at abolutely nothing . <br /> <br /> Dreeezt explained the situation but without telling him anything of a Pallenthir and Arthas. <br /> <br /> Zardax started to laugh then it died and he became thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Zardax became eagerly pleased as I gave him some diamonds and some gold. He started doing his ritual of summoning. <br /> <br /> I was getting nervous that Tassalhofe wouldnt enter the portal as the Kendar wasnt informed. <br /> <br /> But suddenly he jumped out, he had his sling staff with him and looked very excited and curious. <br /> <br /> Zardax mounted and rode in to the distance. <br /> <br /> As we got back to the warehouse we spoke secretly for some hours. We explained Tassalhofe the whole situation but as a Kendar he didnt know fear so he just jumped up and motioned us to follow. <br /> <br /> The Kendar told us a story on how he had discovered a secret trail leading to a monastary for an old paladin order. He told us it was called Castle Lightwolf.</span>

Dreeezt had slain some beast, he had lived in the cold for many years and knew the beast strenghts and weaknesses. We never met a friendly soul and was often ambushed by giant ice bears and crazed wendigos. <br /> <br /> One evening the moon had startet to shine. The snow was sparkling like deeb blue diamonds, we came to a small abandoned mine. <br /> <br /> There was an elevator going into a pit. A scream rose from its depths. It was clearly not in need of help. Tassalhofe said they were lost miners when it collapsed and now where ghosts. He knew exactly where to go from this landmark. It wasnt soon before midnight before we came upon the castle Lightwolf. <br /> <br /> It was built on a mountainside, its gates where wide open. <br /> <br /> As we ran though the hallways of the old buildings, we saw old paintings with inches of dust covering them. This place had been lost for many years. <br /> <br /> We rushed into a room. It was very clean and one figure sat in a marble carved chair. An incredible orb at a pedestal in the center was the Pallenthir. <br /> <br /> The figure rose from the chair. He was undead and was covered in black plate. He had a dirty golden shield and a scepter of great might. He had long hair hanging out from his decorated helmet. He was a guardian of the Pallenthir. <br /> <br /> Dreeezt just knew it was gonna be a fight, he called Gwenvar. The figure rose his hand and startet a spell right at me! Suddenly I ran screaming by fear down the hall. Thoar swung his great hammer at the guardian, a big growl from the panther as it leaped at the guardians face and dreeezts eyes began to glow as he went to a berserker rage. The guardian went for the Kendar as he blocked the panter and and ignored Thoars blow. I ran to heal the Kendar who suffered a crushing blow. Suddenly Dreeezt was behind the guardian and WAMMO! The guardian was defeated by the dark elf ,who was frothing a litlle in his berserker craze.</span>

	    <span id="_ctl0_cphMain_rptMessages__ctl14_MessageView_bcMessageBody">Through hours we had some serious conversations with, golden dragons, elves from Loore&#232;n and secret orders. We saw their compassion in the Pallenthir and called for their aid. As we ran outside we saw the open field, an army marching ,singing and shouting in a horrifying melody. They where as far as our keen elven eyes could see. They had burning torches and banners wore high in the air. Great siege machines came rolling with great noise. They where screaming DEATH! <br /> <br /> A white figure came riding on a light grey horse in a great speed and haste. It was Gindalf on his favourite mount. He carried with him a banner of light that illuminated the snowy field with glory and bravery. <br /> <br /> With his other hand he pointed his staff towards the heavens and tore open a rift between all worlds. He was an Istareee, one of five beings created by the old gods who had the ability to do great magic things of unbelievable power! <br /> <br /> Golden and silver dragons came circeling from the heavens carrying noble paladins with long lances. Elves from Loore&#233;n and dwarves who had ale and secret orders came charging forward on an incredible rainbow. <br /> <br /> We too rushed in battle not carying if we would die or not. <br /> <br /> Dragons spew fire, lances pierced bodies and evil spells hurled back. The battle lasted til the sun rose high on the sky. Thousands of dead bodies laid scattered everywhere.. <br /> <br /> We had not seen Gindalf for a long time. Sad that he might have fallen and didnt know what to do we gathered the dead bodies and honored them in our minds and hearts. <br /> <br /> A few hours later me and Dreeezt and Thoar and a couple of new friends from other worlds sat and played a tournament of Wow trading card game. All of us who knew gindalf, didnt felt joy. And there had been no sight of him nor Arthas dead on the field. I looked at my wand from Ligol&#225;s that killed many last night and started to wonder what the trinket of Gimleis was good for. <br /> <br /> Suddenly Tassalhofe came in and laughted aloud. Following him came Gindalf and he told us of his victory against Arthas. He also announced that since he almost died he henceforth should be know as Gondalf! <br /> <br /> Dreeezt rewarded me as he promised, 3 booster packs for wow trading card game. The dragons where kind to carry us all the way home to the old town. We entered The weary dwarf tavern and ordered free ale for everyone! We bid farewell to the dragons who had to go home to their own wolrd again. <br /> <br /> We laughed and was in great relief. Then suddenly a figure stood in the doorway, he had big heavy bags and he laughed aloud. It was the fun loving orc and Ligol&#225;s started to cry out in happiness. Thoar suddenly kneeled in front of me and proposed! <br /> <br /> -------------------------------------------------------------- THE END-----------------------------------------------------------------</span>
