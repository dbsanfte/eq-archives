This document is a short introduction into modifying these files to customize your interface. Customizing the interface is a very technical endeavor, and you should not attempt it unless you have a good working knowledge of XML and Lua.  <br>  <br> There is no official support for modifying the WoW interface. If you break it, you get to keep both pieces. <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">   <br>  <br> To start fresh, unpack Interface.zip in your World of Warcraft folder, so it creates a new directory called &quot;Interface&quot;. This directory will override any built-in user interface. To remove all customized UI, just remove the Interface directory. Be sure that you never remove the Interface directory in Data\, only remove the toplevel Interface directory you created when you unpacked Interface.zip.  <br>  <br> When the game is updated, your customized files will not be modified, which means that you'll need to get an updated version of Interface.zip and apply your changes to the new files.  <br>  <br> Before you report a bug in the interface, move your custom interface directory out of the way, to make sure the bug occurs in the unmodified game.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">XML Layout</span>  <br>  <br> The files containing the layout for the game user interface can be found in Interface\FrameXML  <br> The file &quot;FrameXML.toc&quot; contains a list of XML files to load when you enter the game. The files listed are loaded in order. Any errors that occur when loading the files are written to FrameXML.log in the toplevel directory.  <br>  <br> Each XML file typically describes one element of UI on the screen. To get a feeling for the syntax, take a look at the files provided. The XML files strictly adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For those lucky enough to have access to a syntax checker, the file UI.xsd contains the schema used by the WoW interface.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Lua Scripting</span>  <br>  <br> All of the functionality in the interface is provided through Lua scripting.  <br> The manual for Lua 5.0 is available online at:  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/">http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/</a> <br>  <br> The best way to become familiar with the way Lua is used to script the interface is to look at the scripts in the XML files, denoted by the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag, and to browse the lua files. The lua files typically contain functions which are used by the corresponding XML files.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Started</span>  <br>  <br> A good place to start getting familiar with the interface is the file BasicControls.xml  <br>  <br> At the top of this file is a script block which contains the function _ERRORMESSAGE(), which is called whenever an error occurs in your script. This function pops up a window with the error message. Another function is defined there, message(), which just pops up the error window with the argument to the function.  <br>  <br> Further on on the file a few textures are defined in XML. They have the &quot;virtual&quot; attribute, which means that they are not actually created, only stored definitions to be inherited later. After that a frame, or widget, called &quot;DialogBoxFrame&quot; is defined. This frame is also virtual, and contains an anchor which defines how it's positioned relative to its parent, a background, and a child button which just hides the dialog when it's clicked.  <br>  <br> Each frame consists of a number of layers, each of which can contain any number of textures and fontstrings. Each texture and fontstring must be anchored and sized so they are visible. The numbers used for anchor offsets and sizes are values in pixels.  <br>  <br> At the end of the file we define an actual frame called &quot;ScriptErrors&quot; which inherits the dialog box we defined previously. This is the frame which is shown in the message function at the top of the file.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">How Does It Work?</span>  <br>  <br> The very first frame that is created is the WorldFrame. This frame is required, and is where the game world renders. The next frame that is created is the UIParent frame. This frame manages all the rest of the user interface, and allows it to be hidden separately from the world. This is how we get screenshots without the interface visible. <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">   <br>  <br> Whenever a frame, texture or fontstring is defined in XML, its initial attributes are defined and it is added to the lua namespace as an object of the appropriate type. Each type of object has member functions that modify that object. This is how we show the error dialog frame from script.  <br>  <br> Each frame has a set of script handlers which are called under certain conditions. For example, UIParent has OnLoad, which is called immediately after the frame is loaded, OnEvent, which we'll get to later, OnUpdate, which is called every time the world is updated, and OnShow, which is called whenever the frame is shown.  <br>  <br> The OnEvent handler is special. This is the handler that allows the game to communicate with the interface. World of Warcraft is designed so that it needs to know very little about the interface. Instead of calling directly into the interface, whenever something interesting happens, it generates an event. Each frame registers for events that it is interested in, and when those events happen, the OnEvent handler is called for that frame.  <br>  <br> Having the UI respond to events wouldn't be very useful if the interface couldn't affect the game in return. The game provides a wide array of functions to query information and change game state. Examples of using these functions are throughout the provided lua files.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tips and Tricks</span>  <br>  <br> World of Warcraft supports dynamically reloading the user interface. At any time you can modify the XML and Lua files and then reload them by bringing down the console (pressing ~) and typing &quot;reloadUI&quot;. If there were syntax errors in loading, you can just edit, fix, and reload.  <br>  <br> If you're not sure what's happening in the script, use the message() function to print a message and view variables. Once the dialog is shown, your script keeps on executing, but no other message() calls will show anything until you click the button to dismiss the dialog.  <br>  <br> Feel free to experiment. If you break something, starting fresh is really easy. If you have questions, look on the forums to see if other people have already figured out the answers. Occasionally, Blizzard staff will be available to answer scripting questions - we value your feedback!  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span>  <br>  <br> The interface files are provided for your enjoyment, and are not supported in any way. That said, we hope that World of Warcraft provides a robust and flexible system for custom interfaces. <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">Make Shift &#8226; OverSoul &#8226; Atticus &#8226; McBane &#8226; Threepio &#8226; Wyatt Herb  &#8226; Apoch &#8226; Tom Sawyer <br> Just because your paranoid doesn't not mean I'm not after you <br> Follow the Cult | <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.cultofxen.com">http://www.cultofxen.com</a> <br> Ner'zhul PvP - Pacific Server <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/post.asp?brd=22852&topic=79108902">Post Reply</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=79112037" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=195775">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=195775">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/Phryer_Tuck?boards=vn " style="color: Orange;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;background-color: DarkBlue;text-decoration: none;border-top: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-bottom: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-right: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-left: 1px solid DarkBlue;">Phryer_Tuck</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star4.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="3,280 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/Phryer_Tuck"><font size="1">collection (7)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/Phryer_Tuck"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</span> <b>WoW Vault Staff</b> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 3,280<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Jun 01<br></span><img border=0 hspace=8 vspace=8 src="http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/dexter2.gif" width="80" height="80" alt="5264" name="5264" id="5264" class="IconImage"><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;11/21 7:20am&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Custome UI's:  How to, Examples, and Resources. </td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight:bold;">(Intro) UI Scripting Tutorial/Walkthrough &#8211; Nevir</span> <br>  <br> Lately there's been a rather... large... influx of players into the WoW community, including myself, many of whom have some coding experience and wish to test their skills and create UI AddOns for World of Warcraft. As with any programming language and interface, there's a bit of a learning curve, so hopefully this will help reduce that (and the headache of digging through various resources for that perfect function) <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0">   <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Preparing for the Plunge</span> <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Weapon of Choice</span>  <br>  <br> The first order of business is to get a general understanding of what&#8217;s going on here. But in order to do that, it might be best if we armed ourselves with an arsenal of tools to use throughout our coding (modding) saga.  <br>  <br> I&#8217;m sure at some point we&#8217;ve all been on the search for the holy grail of editors (or IDE&#8217;s as a slightly more specific term :P), which is often a rather frustrating and long search. (Hell, I have yet to find my &#8220;perfect&#8221; editor for many of the languages I code in). Anyway, since our scripting language is LUA, we would probably do best with an editor that&#8217;s geared towards it. So here&#8217;s a list of possibilities, choose well&#8230;  <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://blua.sourceforge.net/">http://blua.sourceforge.net/</a> <br> B:Lua &#8211; This looks like it is going to be our true holy grail right here. Emil is cooking up a fully featured IDE for the single purpose of coding for the World of Warcraft UI. Even better, it&#8217;s java, so regardless of what operating system you use, you&#8217;re going to benefit from this application! Unfortunately, however, he&#8217;s not quite done with his first version. So keep your eye on this one, it&#8217;s going to make things a hell of a lot easier on us! So big thanks in advance, Emil!  <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.ideais.com.br/luaeclipse/">http://www.ideais.com.br/luaeclipse/</a> <br> Lua Eclipse &#8211; here&#8217;s another java IDE to use. I haven&#8217;t used this particular editor yet, so I can&#8217;t comment very much. It is based on the Eclipse platform, which is an extremely feature-rich framework for any IDE, so I&#8217;m sure it is a great editor to use. (might be a bit bulky, however)  <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://editplus.com/">http://editplus.com/</a> <br> EditPlus &#8211; Here&#8217;s a great notepad replacement, and currently my LUA coding application of choice. It&#8217;s got all the basic features you need, and even has a syntax scheme for LUA code (http://www.editplus.com/files/lua2.zip). However, there&#8217;s a 30 day evaluation period with EditPlus, and then you need to pay for it.  <br>  <br> Those are just three suggestions &#8211; and I think once B:Lua is released, there&#8217;s not much of a choice left &#8211; I&#8217;m switching! <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">   <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">b. We Have Our Weapon, but What Shall We Target?</span>  <br>  <br> Once you have your editor, that&#8217;s only the beginning. We&#8217;re going to want a few tools specific to WoW as well. The first of these is WinMPQ, which you can find here:  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://shadowflare.gameproc.com/dwnload.html#WinMPQ">http://shadowflare.gameproc.com/dwnload.html#WinMPQ</a> <br> Grab the first set of files (you&#8217;ll probably need both of the runtime file packs &#8211; it&#8217;s a visual basic 4 application). With this, you will be able to dig around in the game&#8217;s various MPQ, or MoPaQ, files. MPQ&#8217;s are Blizzard&#8217;s proprietary format to store game files (think of it as a glorified zip file). If you&#8217;re interested in the nitty gritty, as well as the history behind MPQ&#8217;s, I suggest you check out &#8220;Inside MoPaQ&#8221; (http://www.campaigncreations.org/starcraft/inside_mopaq/index.htm).  <br>  <br> With WinMPQ, you can now extract the contents of the interface and patch MoPaQ&#8217;s, (stored in the data folder in your WoW install) which contain everything you&#8217;ll ever need (and more) for your World of Warcraft interface modding saga. Interface.MPQ stores the base interface, and thus a majority of the interface files that you can use as examples. Patch.MPQ stores the contents of *all* the patches up to present, and basically is an override for all the base MPQ&#8217;s.  <br>  <br> So, open up WinMPQ, as we&#8217;re going to pull out all the base interface code for you to use as an example. Plus I&#8217;ll show you how to keep up-to-date with any changes made by patches. So, with WinMPQ open, click on &#8220;open&#8221; and then select Interface.MPQ (again, in the data directory of your WoW install) Scroll down a ways, and you&#8217;ll start to see files in a FrameXML folder (there&#8217;s also a GlueXML folder, but you really don&#8217;t need to worry about that &#8211; I&#8217;ll explain in a bit), so select all the FrameXML files and extract (hit the button) them somewhere outside of your WoW folder.  <br>  <br> We&#8217;re going to do the same for Patch.MPQ, so open that up too. You&#8217;ll notice that Patch.MPQ stores any files updated by our patches, and not just interface files. No matter, we&#8217;re only interested in anything under Interface\FrameXML &#8211; so grab all those and extract them to the same place as where you previously extracted the FrameXML files from Interface.MPQ (older files will be overwritten). So now you&#8217;ve got an up-to-date copy of FrameXML to base your code off of and to use as a reference!  <br>  <br> (as a side note, you might want to extract the music, all in mp3 format, to a folder somewhere as it makes for some relaxing music to code to :P)  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Target Acquired</span>  <br>  <br> Now that we&#8217;re all ready, it&#8217;s time to make your first AddOn!  <br>  <br> But, I think first, you need to understand where files are located, and which ones do what. So, let&#8217;s take a look at our World of Warcraft install. Inside it are various folders, but the one we&#8217;re going to be mucking about in is the Interface folder (create it if it doesn&#8217;t exist). Inside the Interface folder are (or will be once you start modifying things) three folders:  <br>  <br> FrameXML: This contains all the Blizzard-supplied interface code. The bulk of what you interact with is stored here (though the art is stored elsewhere).  <br> GlueXML: This contains all of the &#8220;out of game&#8221; interface, such as login, server selection, character creation, etc. You really shouldn&#8217;t need to play around with this, nor want to.  <br> AddOns: This is where you come in! Every player-made module is placed in here.  <br>  <br> Now, inside the AddOns folder, each module has its own folder and a table of contents inside that.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Commence the jiggling!</span>  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">a. Initial Setup</span>  <br>  <br> So we&#8217;re at the point where we&#8217;ve gotta do the obligatory Hello World. So start off by making a folder called hello_world under your AddOns folder. Aka, you need it to be placed here:  <br> World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/hello_world  <br>  <br> Inside this folder, create a file called hello_world.toc. This is your table of contents, and subsequently where you specify what files that WoW should load. A basic Table of Contents looks like this:  <br>  <br> <blockquote>## Interface: 4062  <br> ## Title: Hello World  <br> ## Notes: The obligatory hello world script &#8211; WoW-style!  <br> ## OptionalDeps:  <br> ## Dependencies:  <br> hello_world.xml</blockquote>  <br>  <br> So this needs some explaining. The first line is a relatively new addition to the UI coding scene. Basically, every time Blizzard puts out a new patch, the &#8220;current&#8221; version number is going to change. If your script does not have the latest version, it *will not* be loaded (It would be nice if we could specify &#8220;version equal to or greater&#8221;). This is why whenever there&#8217;s a patch, all the AddOns break.  <br>  <br> Note that you can find the latest version by extracting the file: Interface\FrameXML\FrameXML.toc from Patch.MPQ and opening it in your favorite editor.  <br>  <br> I think Title and Notes are pretty self-explanatory. As for OptionalDeps, you can list off any &#8220;optional dependencies&#8221; that your AddOn may have (you list off other AddOns, separated by spaces). The same goes for Dependencies, except these aren&#8217;t optional :P I believe, but I am not sure (I haven&#8217;t really tested it) that your AddOn will *not* load if its dependencies don&#8217;t exist. In any case, it&#8217;s a good idea to stick in any dependencies, optional or not, to help anyone trying to read your code (including yourself :P).  <br>  <br> Past the initial declarations, you place a list of xml files to be loaded *in the order that they are written*, one file per line. Note you can also store these in sub-folders to keep things a bit cleaner (for instance you could have the line &#8220;core/hello_world.xml&#8221; if you wanted a core folder in your AddOn)  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">b. Adding Some Meat</span>  <br>  <br> Now for the fun part! Let&#8217;s start out with something pretty simple here, nothing fancy. Create a new file called hello_world.xml (which you specified in the table of contents), and open it up in your favorite editor. Stick this in it:  <br>  <br> You can find the XML file here, as well as the rest of the project (as it seems I cannot post it, for some reason)  <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://wow.nevir.net/tutorial/hello_world">http://wow.nevir.net/tutorial/hello_world</a> <br>  <br> Oh dear, it just got a bit more complex&#8230; So, you can safely ignore all the junk up top (the &lt;Ui&#8230;. tag), but pay attention to the line: &lt;Script file=&quot;hello_world.lua&quot;/&gt;. This tells WoW to load the file, hello_world.lua, which is where the body of your AddOn will reside.  <br>  <br> Now&#8230; every part of the interface is contained within a &#8220;Frame&#8221; Here we have a frame to simply handle any events our script should be aware of, but you also stick all your buttons, windows, etc within frames too (more on this in a bit). In our frame tag, we define a name &#8211; this *must* be a unique identifier for this frame. It is recommended that you prefix the name with the name of your module, followed by an underscore. So in our case, we&#8217;re calling this our &#8220;core&#8221; frame, and thus prefixing it by hello_world to make sure that no other module steals this frame name.  <br>  <br> Inside our frame, we have a &lt;Script&gt; tag, which really is the events handling section of our frame. In here you can have various events, but &lt;OnLoad&gt; and &lt;OnEvent&gt; are going to be the ones that you probably use the most often.  <br>  <br> As its name indicates, any code inside the &lt;OnLoad&gt; tag is executed when your AddOn loads (this occurs after you choose a character to log in, but before the loading screen ends &#8211; in other words, your AddOn does *not* load for the login screen, etc).  <br>  <br> In our OnLoad event, we register &#8220;this&#8221; for an event called &#8220;VARIABLES_LOADED&#8221;. &#8220;this&#8221; is the frame that we currently are in, so &#8220;this&#8221; really refers to &#8220;hello_world_core&#8221; (frames are variables/objects of sorts). The colon ( : ) after signifies that we are running a function that is inherit to that frame, in this case, the function RegisterEvent, which tells the game to notify your frame whenever the &#8220;VARIABLES_LOADED&#8221; event happens.  <br>  <br> This leads us to the &lt;OnEvent&gt; tag. A variable by the name of &#8220;event&#8221; is *always* defined here, and contains the name of the event that is being triggered. So we check to make sure that the event fired is the one we want, namely VARIABLES_LOADED, and then perform some operations when it is fired.  <br>  <br> Now, this brings me to another important point, so pay attention. Recently, the guys over at Blizzard gave us an awesome new feature: saved variables. However, in order to implement this, things got a tad more confusing. You can use the function RegisterForSave(&#8220;variable_name&#8221;) to specify that a variable is to be saved across game sessions. However, if you set a value to that variable before the VARIABLES_LOADED event is fired, it could be overwritten by the saved value.  <br>  <br> In other words, set your default settings before VARIABLES_LOADED is fired, and then make any changes/initializations *after* it is fired.  <br>  <br> Finally, in our case, when VARIABLES_LOADED is fired, we call the function hello_world_initialize(). Ah crap, but we haven&#8217;t written it yet <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/2.gif" border="0" alt="sad" hspace="0" vspace="0">   <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">c. Fleshing it All Out</span>  <br>  <br> So, this brings us to the actual coding that goes on around here. Create a file called hello_world.lua. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to stick in it. Nothing fancy:  <br>  <br> <blockquote>function hello_world_initialize()  <br> -- add our very first chat command!  <br> SlashCmdList[&quot;HELLOW&quot;] = hello_world_command;  <br> SLASH_HELLOW1 = &quot;/hellow&quot;;  <br> SLASH_HELLOW2 = &quot;/hw&quot;;  <br> end  <br>  <br> function hello_world_command(msg)  <br> -- this function handles our chat command  <br> message(msg);  <br> end</blockquote> <br>  <br> I&#8217;m not going to comment on the actual syntax used, as the actual LUA documentation describes it far better than I could ever hope to. You can read about that here:  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/">http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/</a> <br>  <br> Bear in mind that the input/output library, operating system library (and possibly the coroutine and reflexive debug system - I haven't gotten around to testing them yet) are *not* included in the blizzard UI. So basically you've got access to the math, string, and table functions.  <br>  <br> For a list of Blizzard-defined functions and events, you can check them out here, courtesy of the excellent effort put forth by the Cosmos guys (and many untold hours of research):  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.cosmosui.org/texts/BlizzardCommands.xml">http://www.cosmosui.org/texts/BlizzardCommands.xml</a> <br>  <br> Anyway, back to our code. In our initialization function, we define a chat command. This may seem strange, and indeed, it is &#8211; as we are modifying the &#8220;table&#8221; (these are basically associative arrays) SlashCmdList. The explanation of *how* this works exactly is out of the scope of this article, just for now, take my word &#8211; this adds a chat command where you can type either /hellow &lt;message&gt;, or /hw &lt;message&gt; - which will then call the function &#8220;hello_world_command&#8221; when a user types in said command.  <br>  <br> Which is why we defined the function hello_world_command to handle our chat command (one variable is passed to all chat command functions, which is everything typed after the initial command, the &lt;message&gt;).  <br>  <br> So in a nutshell, this simple AddOn adds two new chat commands. To test them, start up the game (if you already have it running, simply type &#8220;/console reloadui&#8221; into your chat to reload the interface). Once you log in as one of your characters, try typing:  <br> /hellow Why hello there!  <br>  <br> You should get a popup window with &#8220;Why Hello there!&#8221; Joy!  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">5. Finishing up&#8230;. For now&#8230;</span>  <br>  <br> So that&#8217;s it for our rudimentary example. I&#8217;ll whip up some more advanced examples (perhaps with some real interface components, like&#8230;. buttons! and&#8230; and&#8230; animation!) when I am slightly less exhausted, and slightly more sane.  <br>  <br> But if you made it this far, I applaud you! That&#8217;s a lot of reading.  <br>  <br> For the overzealous lot, here&#8217;s a bit of homework. Read through the LUA manual (found at <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/),">http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/),</a> and skim over the Blizzard-defined functions (found at <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.cosmosui.org/texts/BlizzardCommands.xml).">http://www.cosmosui.org/texts/BlizzardCommands.xml).</a> Finally, in your copy of the Interface folder (where you extracted FrameXML) &#8211; check out the file:  <br> Interface/FrameXML/BasicControls.xml  <br>  <br> This handles the message() function you saw earlier, as well as a few other things. (you may want to check out Fonts.xml as well, and see if you can find a better font for the ScriptErrors frame &#8211; perhaps a smaller one, and maybe a different color, that&#8217;s easier on the eyes)  <br>  <br> Anyway, that&#8217;s it for tonight.

There was a similar (shorter) thread posted by Blizzard in the Alpha forum but it doesn't seem to have been repeated here... yet!  <br>  <br> Here are some basic steps for getting started, followed by some tips that would have helped me when I stareted. I hope some of the more experienced modders out there will share their thoughts as well.  <br>  <br> Once you're started modding (whether or not you read the rest of this post), PLEASE read and follow the guidelines in Rav's &quot;Interface Modification Guidelines&quot; post. Not only they will help you avoid bugs, but they will help modders better understand each other's code and also make your script easier to integrate into the everything script, should it turn out to be popular.  <br>  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Getting started</span>  <br>  <br> Probably the best way to learn is to read existing scripts. They show the power and flexibility of the UI scripting engine, and can help you find out what functions are provided to you by the back end code.  <br>  <br> Once your eyes hurt or you're ready to actually do some coding, here's what's next.  <br>  <br> The first thing you need to know is how scripts and frames get loaded.  <br>  <br> There are 3 basic file types that are involved. The two files you will deal with most are .xml files and .lua files. The .xml files define the structure of the windows/panels/frames and buttons, set up various event handlers, and make references to the .lua script files. The .lua files are the scripts/code where you provide any new core functionality that you need. Finally there's the FrameXML.toc which contains a list of all the files that the interface will try to load at startup or reload time. There's also a bindings.xml file that has a semi-special structure and you can use it to add your own key bindings for your mod.  <br>  <br> When the UI engine loads, it looks for the Interface\FrameXML\FrameXML.toc file. Each file listed will get loaded. Lines beginning with a &quot;#&quot; are commented out and those files are not loaded.  <br>  <br> For each file the UI loads, including the FrameXML.toc file, the code appears to do a search starting from multiple locations. First it looks for the file using a path relative to the WoW root directory. For example when it looks for Interface\FrameXML.toc, the first place it really looks (on my computer) is f:\World of Warcraft\Interface\FrameXML. Then it searches other places for built-in or Blizzard-provided versions of this file. All this really means is that you make an Interface\FrameXML directory, and stick your files in there, and life is peachy. What this file searching algorithm means to you, though, is that since you have to override the defaults on a per-file basis, there is some ugliness when you want to download and run multiple mods on the same machine since almost every mod overwrites FrameXML.toc and/or bindings.xml. This was the whole impetus for putting together EverythingScript; to avoid forcing people to manually merge the most-commonly-used mods together.  <br>  <br> So if you want to create a new UI panel, you should make a new .xml file and put its name and path at the end of the FrameXML.toc file. Order is not important to the code, but everyone should put user mods at the bottom so that it's easier to see what has changed and how to merge your changes with the changes for another mod.  <br>  <br> To get a new .lua file to load, you need to reference it in a .xml file. Add a child node to the main &lt;Ui&gt;&lt;/Ui&gt; node that looks like this (or change an existing one to point to your own file)  <br>  <br> <blockquote>&lt;Script file=&quot;myMod.lua&quot;/&gt;</blockquote>  <br>  <br> That should get all your files loaded.  <br>  <br> UI element structure  <br>  <br> UI elements defined in the .xml file follow a recursive structure. At each &quot;main&quot; level of the structure you have something that looks like this (some elements may be optional)  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <blockquote>&lt;Frame name=&quot;...&quot; ...&gt;\ <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>     &lt;Size&gt;...&lt;/Size&gt; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>     &lt;Anchors&gt;...&lt;/Anchors&gt; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>     &lt;Layers&gt;...&lt;/Layers&gt; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>     &lt;Frames&gt;...&lt;/Frames&gt; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>     &lt;Scripts&gt;...&lt;/Scripts&gt; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> &lt;/Frame&gt;</blockquote> <br>  <br> Buttons and checkboxes follow the same format but the node is named &quot;Button&quot; or &quot;CheckButton&quot; rather than &quot;Frame&quot;.  <br>  <br> Size Pretty much self-explanatory. Sets the size of this frame/button.  <br>  <br> Anchors Contains a list of &lt;anchor&gt; nodes that control how this frame's position relates to other frames. An Anchor describes 2 reference points (well not literally points), one point on the frame/button you're defining and another one either on another frame/button or a global reference point. Then the anchor describes how the two points should relate, and the UI engine plops your control down in the right spot for that to happen.  <br>  <br> Layers This is where you define your textures for the window edges, backgrounds, etc. There are typically up to 3 layers, BACKGROUND, BORDER, and ARTWORK. Each one is displayed over top of the preceding one.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Frames</span>  <br> This is where the recursive nature comes up. This node's children are all frames (or buttons), and each of them has the same structure as I'm describing here. Sadly, this recursion makes the XML file pretty tough to read in a text editor, but is necessary in many cases.  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Scripts</span>  <br> This is where you put your event handlers. The most Common handlers are OnClick, OnEnter, OnLeave, OnLoad, OnEvent, and OnUpdate. The first three are mouse-related handlers. OnLoad gets called when the frame is loaded at UI startup or restart. OnEvent happens any time a game event occurs (chat message received; a unit's health or mana changes; and many, many more). OnUpdate is the &quot;idle&quot; event and it gets called almost continuously, presumably about once per rendered frame. arg1 tells you how long it has been, in seconds, since the last time it was called. There are many more events, just read some sample scripts. The contents of each event handler's node is fully interpreted each time the call is made, so if your event handling is very simple you may not even need to have a LUA file.  <br>  <br> One important thing to note in this section is that the &quot;small&quot; or single-line comment (&quot;--&quot;) does NOT appear to work correctly under all circumstances inside script handler blocks. You must use the &quot;large&quot; or multi-line comment syntax if you want to comment any of this code out. (&quot;--[[ comment ]]&quot;)  <br>  <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tips</span>  <br>  <br> Here's a few of the tips that I think will help you get up and running quickly, and/or avoid the biggest pitfalls I've run into.  <br>  <br> <blockquote>&#8226;	The last line of FrameXML.toc must end in a carriage return. If you add a new line, and don't end it with a carriage return, your file will not be loaded. I swear this gets me every time.  <br> &#8226;	You don't have to reload WoW to reload your UI files. If you open the console and type &quot;reloadUI&quot; (case-insensitive), the entire UI reloads from scratch. This way you can just alt-tab, edit your files, then alt-tab back and test them very quickly. For frequent minor edits this saves SO much time.  <br> &#8226;	Check out the official LUA 5.0 user manual at <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/.">http://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/.</a> <br> &#8226;	If you program in C or C-like languages, watch out for the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;do&quot; keywords you will invariably leave out of if and for statements. I can't count the number of times I've forgotten to put these in. Don't be like me. It gets old fast.  <br> &#8226;	Be very careful to avoid typos (or capitalization errors) in variable names. Because lua is an interpreted language, when it runs into this typo it will just make up a new variable with that name but with 'nil' as its value, which is almost never what you want. This gets old fast, too. And it's harder to track down. So don't do it.  <br> &#8226;	Boolean values: Don't use 0 and 1 as if they were true and false. Any numeric value (even if it's 0) is treated as &quot;true&quot;. The only values treated as false are nil and (obviously) false. It takes forever to debug this the first time you accidentally do it.  <br> &#8226;	Comment syntax. There are 2 kinds of comment syntax in LUA. One is the &quot;short&quot; comment, started by the string &quot;--&quot;, which goes to end of line (like C++'s // syntax). The other is the &quot;long&quot; comment, which is started by &quot;--[[&quot; and goes til the end-of-comment marker &quot;]]&quot;. Don't end the comment with &quot;]]--&quot; unless you really mean to comment out the rest of the line that the comment-end marker on. (The LUA manual does not decribe this especially clearly. Eschew obfuscation!)  <br> &#8226;	Remember that only the last error that happened has a popup. You may be having multiple errors happening in a row and not know it. This means that syntax errors can be &quot;masked&quot; by later load-time errors.  <br> &#8226;	The first time you add new files or replace existing files with modified versions, you may have to reload WoW from scratch to get them to load properly. Typing reloadui in the console reloads the exact same versions of each file that was loaded when WoW was first launched, except for FrameXML.toc which is not re-read.</blockquote> <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> If you've got an experience or tip to share, please add it to the thread!  <br>  <br> Happy scripting!  <br>  <br> -Evan  <br>  <br> (Edited to add some info on comments, in the Scripts tag and Tips sections.)  <br>  <br> (3/21/04 Added tip on masked errors because that one had me completely stumped for hours last night. Added info on where the elapsed time comes from in the OnUpdate handler. Added note about boolean values vs. integers)  <br>  <br> (4/7/04 Added tip about reloadui not reading brand-new files)  <br> [ post edited by chitinous ] <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">Make Shift &#8226; OverSoul &#8226; Atticus &#8226; McBane &#8226; Threepio &#8226; Wyatt Herb  &#8226; Apoch &#8226; Tom Sawyer <br> Just because your paranoid doesn't not mean I'm not after you <br> Follow the Cult | <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.cultofxen.com">http://www.cultofxen.com</a> <br> Ner'zhul PvP - Pacific Server <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/post.asp?brd=22852&topic=79108902">Post Reply</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=79112062" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=195775">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=195775">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/Phryer_Tuck?boards=vn " style="color: Orange;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;background-color: DarkBlue;text-decoration: none;border-top: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-bottom: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-right: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-left: 1px solid DarkBlue;">Phryer_Tuck</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star4.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="3,280 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/Phryer_Tuck"><font size="1">collection (7)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/Phryer_Tuck"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</span> <b>WoW Vault Staff</b> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 3,280<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Jun 01<br></span><img border=0 hspace=8 vspace=8 src="http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/dexter2.gif" width="80" height="80" alt="5264" name="5264" id="5264" class="IconImage"><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;11/21 7:22am&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Custome UI's:  How to, Examples, and Resources.  - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Edited:</span>&nbsp;11/21 9:36am (1 edits total) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edited By:</span> <a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/Phryer_Tuck?boards=vn " style="color: Orange;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;background-color: DarkBlue;text-decoration: none;border-top: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-bottom: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-right: 1px solid DarkBlue;border-left: 1px solid DarkBlue;">Phryer_Tuck</a></td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight:bold;">From the Creators of Cosmos &amp; CT Mod: &quot;Sea&quot; or better known as wowwiki.com</span> <br>  <br> A little while ago, Cide and I got together to discuss the future of WoW UI Modding.

You can find the WOW API here: <br>  <br> <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.cosmosui.org/texts/BlizzardCommands.xml">http://www.cosmosui.org/texts/BlizzardCommands.xml</a> - This is an old list, please refer to <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.wowwiki.com">http://www.wowwiki.com</a> for a more up todate listing of API commands. <br>  <br> And here is a good example of how to use a few of those functions inside a macro. <br>  <br> <blockquote>/script TargetUnit(&quot;player&quot;);   <br> /script UseContainerItem(4,4);  <br>  <br> On the UseContainerItem, the (4,4) specifies that I want to find an item in the last bag at slot 4. Figure out where you want to put your bandages and use the grid slot in the macro.  <br>  <br> The bag numbers are 0 - 4 (0 being the big 16-slot bag you get by default). 1 - 4 are the number of the bags that go from right to left from that big bag.  <br>  <br> This simple macro works well for bandaging after a battle. If you are looking for an in battle macro, you could add this to the end of it:  <br>  <br> /script TargetLastEnemy();  <br> /script AttackTarget();</blockquote> <br>  <br> This is by on means the end all be all of the WOW UI and all its functions, but this does give you a good idea what is possible. <br>  <br> I have tested this, and for some reason the last line does not have me go back into melee with the LastTarget. But it does provide a one button First Aid, which is all I really needed. <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">Make Shift &#8226; OverSoul &#8226; Atticus &#8226; McBane &#8226; Threepio &#8226; Wyatt Herb  &#8226; Apoch &#8226; Tom Sawyer <br> Just because your paranoid doesn't not mean I'm not after you <br> Follow the Cult | <a class=BoardRowBLink href="http://www.cultofxen.com">http://www.cultofxen.com</a> <br> Ner'zhul PvP - Pacific Server <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/post.asp?brd=22852&topic=79108902">Post Reply</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=79112763" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=195775">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=195775">Post History</a></td></tr>
