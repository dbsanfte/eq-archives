				where to start... <br>  <br> 1. &quot;Blaykz...you seem like a nice kid and all, but you're a fucking idiot.  <br>  <br> Wow, im a kid, and an idiot, nice comback I would of never thought of that. Yeah, im only 16, and your point is ? I dont care what anyone thinks about my age, if you dont like it, then put me on ignore i could careless. <br>  <br> 2. &quot;how do you know they need as many ppl or more then you ?&quot;  <br>  <br> &quot;-Because you hadn't engaged, kinda makes it obvious you weren't ready.&quot; <br>  <br> uhmm..i asked HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY NEED AS MANY PPL AS YOU, WTF does that have to do weather or not they have engaged it, someone said they didnt have enough ppl there, just because thiers not enough DD thier DONT mean thiers not enough of ppl WITH THEM <br>  <br> and maybe just MAYBE they had the force, and just needed a little time to buff and figured why they were buffing, wth why not tell others to come, if thier late oh well we dont need em. <br>  <br> 3. &quot;---They started to kite him to buy a min or two, you would of tried to buy time somehow too if a guild started showing up at the same time you did KNOWING you were there.  <br>  <br> -Another reason you would have engaged had you been able&quot; <br>  <br> you missed the whole point of that, i didnt say &quot; You would of tried to hurry and kill it too if another guild showed up knowing you were there&quot; <br>  <br> I SAID &quot;you would of tried to buy time somehow too if a guild started showing up at the same time you did KNOWING you were there.&quot; <br>  <br> maybe they needed to buy a min to buff without having to worry about you rushing him <br>  <br> 4. &quot;-/shrug, we ported in, buffed, ran to the area, saw you kite him away (it was obviously NOT a pull, we're not stupid), ran after, and killed him.&quot; <br>  <br> hmm I didnt know the raid party summoned rage to them, how else could they get him away from his spot without attacking him and backing away so he chased them ( which strangly looks ALOT similar to kiting) .I do understand that it wasnt a pull i was simply saying that at the time you had no proof it wasnt a pull. you ASSUMED it wasn't because of the way he was being kited, &quot;we're not stupid&quot; no but you must a mind reader if you can tell that was a kite and not a pull cause they sure look alike to me, for atleast the first second or two anyways, which you said <br>  <br> &quot;we ported in, buffed, ran to the area, saw you kite him away (it was obviously NOT a pull, we're not stupid), ran after, and killed him.&quot; <br>  <br> so unless you stated that wrong, then im sorry, but sounds like you didnt give them time to show weather or not it was a pull or kite. <br>  <br> 5. &quot;-Why the fuck would we say &quot;Hey, you gonna eat that pussy? Or just look at it.&quot; To a guild that pissed us off? Why do we WANT to give this epic to YOU?&quot; <br>  <br> There is so many ways i can show your a moron on this but i dont feel like typing that much, you said you would of gave them time had they asked, however if you would of had to ask, then screw them esspecially since ( somehow they made you mad ), well either your lieing about just getting there or you cant get your story straight cause Didn't you just say you just ported in buffed and ran up to him ?.. thats not alot of time to do anything wrong to make you mad...what did they do ? start getting to ppl to show up KNOWING you were there?.. well if thats a crime your both guilty.  <br>  <br> now you wanted this tell before they started kiting, from what i read you started wanting to just rush the mob from the begining cause you thought u had enough ppl there and they didnt. it dont seem like you gave them a chance to ask nicely. this could of been what had made you mad which you could of just said that but wait, that would of proved you wrong by saying you would of gave more time if they had asked cause if you were so mad...&quot;-Why the fuck would we say &quot;Hey, you gonna eat that pussy? Or just look at it.&quot; As you put it. <br>  <br> I could go on but im not your not worth it. <br>  <br> 6. &quot;-If by &quot;better&quot; you mean we were in the right place at the right time, then you're right. Do we like to steamroll people (as it was a steamroll in so far as DD felt flattened by it)? Shit no. Hell if memory serves me...didn't Ix members like, aid in WoF's attempt at Ragefire and actually help turn the tides of your close fight?&quot; <br>  <br> WoF has nothing to do with this, we just helped DD when they asked us for help with rage, so Your relationship with WoF is completly different, im (that i know of) the only person from WoF saying anything here,and my opinions are MY opinions, not WoF im sure some of WoF think DD was wrong too, and some think IX was wrong. thier not taking any sides, I am. so please dont think im speaking on behalf of my guild.  <br>  <br> and when i said that i meant. Were you trying to make it sound your guild was all holy and perfect enought to just give away a dragon if asked, not the bigger guild as in better, cause I dont know which guild has more or more powerful ppl, i could careless. <br>  <br> 7. &quot;Look. The cleric epic is a kill or be killed situation. It sucked, and sucked bad for DD to lose yet again on it. The thing to note here, is that we're actually (gasp) not a bunch of assholes who run around getting our kicks out of making other people miserable in life like some other guilds I know.&quot; <br>  <br> yes the cleric epic does suck and needs to be changed. <br>  <br> and  <br> &quot;The thing to note here, is that we're actually (gasp) not a bunch of assholes who run around getting our kicks out of making other people miserable in life like some other guilds I know.&quot; <br>  <br>  I'm sure it wasnt like that at all. im sure just between tells ooc's and frustrated guildies on both sides everything got confusing and turned into a big fight <br>  <br>

				Have we won the longest average post award yet?  This thread should get locked soon, nothing new has been added in a while. <br>  <br> I will say this however the reason we &quot;knew&quot; that kiting rage was a stall tactic, and not a pull, was that it was kited north of the camp.  What would you be pulling it to?  The middle of nowhere? <br>  <br> In fact, it was pulled about 3k units north, then kited all the way back down 3k units by the ragefire spawn, then finally 1k units further south, where we stopped rages in flight movie, and decided enough was enough.

				we had people there but we was still getting the rest there so we was not group or buffed or not have resist gear on so its ovious that we were taken dmg from aoe but i did not die from it i was still standing at end of it.Also the druid was not kitting when i got there she was dead i draged her body our monk took over on rage and was taken hits of rage till we were ready in my book thats melee engagement as last i looked a monk is a melee.And Ixltan never once sent us a tell to ask if we was going to kill rage yes our cleric ninjaed heart but at time he had died so he never knew who got kill as there was a few groups there so in heat of moment he looted heart its a honest mistake that any human could make and now hes paying for it im righting this to tell person in charge this board to close this end of its over and gratz nylith on epic.

				&quot;This should be simple enough for even the mental giants among you that can't read past 4 lines in a post. &quot; <br>  <br>  Don't be such a fucknut. It's not a matter of being able to read past 4 lines it's more a matter of what's the fucking point? Everything new was said in the first 50 posts. Everything after that is more of the same (think any CT vs FoH thread and you get the picture). I'm not going to spend precious minutes of my life reading your lame whining. You didn't have the force, you ninjad someone elses items and you were suspended. See you in a week! And you know what? Most of the server wouldn't have been the wiser if it wasn't for your guild coming here and bringing it up. You didn't get any sympathy from the GM and guess what? You're not getting any fucking sympathy here either. Shoo! <br>  <br>  <br>

				Hmmm...  From reading most of the constructive posts and looking at the logs, it looks like Ixtlan beat Dark Dynasty to the punch on pulling enough members to the zone faster and killing the mob. <br>  <br> Although In EQ the game creators love to pit player vrs player, guild vrs guild, they once again didnt take the players complaints, and just made it easier to steamroll more unfortunate guilds because the SF is a port in with easy access... <br>  <br> In EQ the gamer creators tell us the first to have sufficient force can claim the mob.  Well we know that from first hand experience that the word engaged is a Ixtlan &quot;quote&quot;.  I remember a night when 13 Ixtlan got wiped on Rage and blamed us for Lazac's interferance because he stole the aggro from all the dead melee and casters alone.  We in honor accepted critizism and made an effort to assist the cleric with their missed opportunity and did indeed get that cleric their epic.  What is intersting enough is the relationship between that event and this one...  the roles were reversed and this time Ixtlan was the aggressor... <br>  <br> I cannot blame the players involved as &quot;this addiction&quot; does damper both a good conscience and judgement...  I firmly continue to believe the creators inability to serve the game populous will continue to insure these issues continue.  Just insert new and different guild names. <br>  <br> Although my opinion matters little to any reader of this post, I ask everyone not to point at each other but vent your continued frustration at a extremely poor GM service, and the programmers inability to fix the issues we bring to their attention. <br>  <br> As we are on the verge of a new CS related x3 cost juggernaut legends project I say to you....  Tell verant NO, not only will we not buy your new product but we will rage at those responsible for our true frustrations until they are corrected.. <br>  <br> Cool minds can avert these issues, but contested mobs will never go away and Verant's elitist will continue to LAUGH at us as we bitch at each other for THEIR failures... <br>  <br> Children squabble and never deduce the true issues behind their discontent until they grow up, and then its too late... <br>  <br> Verant is the problem, lets make them fix it....  Everyone send them an email complaint once a day for a month, and say &quot;listen to the players, fix our problems..  or lose our business&quot; <br>  <br> Lata

				You don't really want to open up that can of worms again, do you?  If memory serves me (and it does), GMs sided with us on that event as well. <br>  <br> In this case we were not the &quot;agressor&quot;, we were the swifter.  They had people camped out there and on call to give themselves the advantage when he popped.  We just happened to be already on the move, and redirected to there.  They hadn't started, so we did.  Could they have won given time to prep and bring in all their people?  Probably.  &quot;Should&quot; we have waited?  Maybe.  We didn't though.  Any doubts we had were banished pretty quickly when Nyltih told us about how you brought up PnP when he talked to you. <br>  <br> &lt;removed inflammatory comments about PD&gt; <br>

				So, I see from 9 pages of messages (that anyone with a life isn't going to bother reading through) that Verant has indeed fixed Ragefire. Happy happy joy joy! <br>  <br> 1. You can't camp Ragefire on Veeshan. There's no such camp. <br>  <br> 2. First to engage owns the mob. <br>  <br> So IMO Ixtlan was wrong for thinking they owned the camp, because there is no camp to own. And they were wrong for taking a mob that someone else was engaging. Even if it was only kiting it around, it was engaged. Dark Destiny was wrong for ninja-looting it. They should have petitioned, let the GM check the logs to see who engaged it first and then had the item xferred to the proper person. <br>  <br> People don't seem to remember the days when you'd be camping a room somewhere and as soon as a mob popped an invis wiz jizzed.. err, an invisible wizard appeared and nuked the mob before you could even hit it. Guides wouldn't do anything back then either. First to aggro/engage wins.

				Wow! I love you guys, I really do! Love how you just read what you want to and how you twist things. Who are you or anyone else to say we didn&#8217;t have the force in zone? Do you know this for a fact? If Ixlian thought we didn&#8217;t have the force they why didn&#8217;t they at least let us get him to our force and let us die trying and take Rage after we were dead instead of KS&#8217;ing? <br>  <br> Kiting the mob to the killing force is not allowed now? Then they best make him unkitable and while they do that they best make Talendor and every other dragon unkitable.  <br>  <br> Big hand to Rekaar for admitting you ks&#8217;d! Thanks. <br>
