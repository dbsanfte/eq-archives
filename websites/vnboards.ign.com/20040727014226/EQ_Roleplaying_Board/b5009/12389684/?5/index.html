				Day 1 <br>  <br> Well, I have never done this in all my 200 years, but I have decided to keep a journal of my travels into the unknown.  Perhaps I shall find my beloved, as I've prayed to Tunare for guidance in doing. Perhaps I shall meet others in search of loved ones. Then again, I may find nothing at all save this young elf's broken heart. I do know, along my way I will help all I meet if they so need and or want my help. This I have vowed. I shall miss my beloved sisters Qerowyn, Reina, Kerodru, and Lyrae. So too shall I miss Imogen and her brother, my dearest friends and cousins. And, let us not forget Dedrick, my son. Aye, Journal, I say son for that is what he has become. When I found the lost man, my heart went out to him. And so, even without my beloved by my side, and no child of my own, I have adopted him.  <br>  <br> All that is said, felt, and heard will be recorded within these pages. I do this so that any who care to know of my adventure may learn of them here, in these pages. I must go now and say a final farewell to those I will leave behind. Now, I shall only sign off... <br>  <br> Ever devoted to Tunare, <br> Essence fae'Iridium. <br>  <br>  <br> Day 2 <br>  <br> Last eve was sad and yet... it was a happy occasion. It is not often that all my sisters and I have a chance to see each other in a single group. That is how it was. Reina, Qerowyn, Kerodru and even Lyrae was there. It made my heart glad to see them and say my farewells in person. I have promised to return as soon as I am able, and Tunare willing, I shall keep that promise. <br>  <br> I have also decided to leave at dusk for the sole purpose of writing down the events leading up to my departure. To start with, I am a Cleric of Tunare. My path was chosen for me, and yet I came upon it honestly and with hard work and devotion.  I was told that at a young age I tended to show a concern for small animals that were wounded. Perhaps that is why I am such a poor hunter of meat.  But I am wandering, as you may soon find out this is a natural occurrence with me.  <br>  <br> I have recently found a spell which will make a portal. Unfortunately, I know not where I will end up. Or, even, if I will survive the trip through. As a cleric, I have not the skill to make portals, but I must do this so I can, if nothing else, die knowing I did everything I could to find my beloved.  <br>  <br> Who is this &quot;beloved&quot; I speak of? Tis none other than Warsong Lightheart, Paladin of Mithanial Marr. He was the most handsome creature I have ever set eyes upon.  He was sent on a mission to unknown realms. I believe his God has called him, but he has been gone for a very long time. Well, for a Human and a woman in love, it is a very long time. I want very much to find him. and Because of this want, dare I say need, I must go in search of him. If for naught else, to ease my heart. <br>  <br> Looking out the window I see dusk has arrived, and so I must set about casting this spell. May Tunare guide and protect me. <br>  <br> Ever devoted,  <br> Essence.

				{I know it has been awhile since the first entry, but life tends to sneak up on people...as it did with me. So here we go again.... Enjoy.} <br>  <br> Day 2 evening <br>  <br> Journal, It appears that my first, and I will say now my last, attempt at making a portal was successful. I am very tired, but I must put in what has happened. I have found myself within a small clearing in the middle of some woods. The tree's look as any other so I have no idea where I am. When first I arrived, I had found my self to be utterly alone and prayed to Tunare for guidance. I was saddened and a bit unnerved at being here. Away from my loved ones and yet, from what I can tell still no where near finding Warsong. But what has me completely surprised is that I have heard Her! I cannot believe this. It s most wondrous indeed. I know, as a spiritual being, I hear Her in my heart all the time, and I know she guides me, but I felt so alone and lost. This time She was around me in the clearing.  Surrounding me with her love and beautiful voice. I wonder if anyone else has had this happen to them. Tunare is with me. I shall never again doubt my faith in Her. <br>  <br> I believe with all my heart I will find a clue as to where Warsong has gone. Perhaps I may even find him. I headed through the forest and eventually became aware of a small glade with an Inn. as I enterd it I felt a great tension coming from a Teir'Dal. After finding an empty table withn I sit and tell my tale to you. I do not know how this place will aide my quest, but I know something is going to happen......  <br>  <br> and soon. <br>  <br> I drink to Tunare this night,  <br> Devotedly, <br> Essence. <br>  <br>  <br>

				I awake to find myself still in the chair I sat in when I arrived. The Teir'Dal is still projecting such venom. I believe I now know some of the reason for this... He spoke quietly, but his voice seemed to vibrate throughout the room. He spoke to another within residence of Love and how it is false. But, I know he felt love once. I can feel his loss of  a loved one emanating from him like a wave. He has a deep seeded hate , which I know is only his God speaking thru him, but isn't love nothing but the other side of the coin. I believe with my heart it is. They even have a saying that states love and hate are divided by a very thin line. I cannot believe the followers of Innoruk are so ill informed, as I see it,  on the subject of love. But, then again, perhaps it is we that are mistaken and ill informed? NO!! I will not believe this! I even said as much to the Teir'Dal known as  Lladerek. If what he believes is true, then how does one explain the feelings I have within my heart? if it was only lust, or something of that nature, then would it pain me deeply to be without my beloved Warsong? Or would I only go and seek another to warm my bed? I believe it is the former.  <br>  <br> Enough of this. It pains me to even think of this. Perhaps later I will inscribe more on this subject, but for now it is put to rest. I believe I shall remain at this inn and await my next sign.
