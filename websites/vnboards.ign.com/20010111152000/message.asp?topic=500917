				 The Dredger wears a beatific, distant expression as he gazes into the softly shifting coals, recalling another time he had witnessed the Indigo Rogue surrounded by wreaths of shifting gentle cloud. The reverie is slightly disturbed by an insistent nagging, a dim and unheeded warning in his subconscious that registered Rakash's disparity of demeanour, the stutter in her usual studied air of unconcealed contempt. Homunculus chose to ignore it. Invigorated by the warm meal and the company, he disregarded the ebb in the tide of antipathy, so screamingly contrary, and talked. <br>   <br>  &quot;I am, of course, under no obligation to explain my motives,&quot; Here a glance and an ironic half-smile, &quot;Anyway. Much as I loath reiteration; it was hardly my intention to mislead. Ruse? Hardly. That would infer aforethought, premeditation. I genuinely believed my demise was at hand, and considered it better to release the Troll from any lingering compunction when faced with more, ah, inimicable members of my species. Now, it would seem there is need for you to collude in this deception, lest Gutrot is instilled with any such doubts. Slight as the chance may be. I would prefer not to be the cause of any jeopardy of position within the Army for him.&quot; <br>  <br>  The Angler had cause to pause. <br>  <br>  &quot;Particularly considering his freshly elevated ah, status as Councillor.&quot; <br>  <br>  Homunculus cooly held the triple-stacked blaze of Rakash's eyes; the carmine of their irises, the reflected radiance of the hearth, and the seething megawatt hatred that shone out, that was her essence. Had a gnat flown between the two locked gazes, there was the distinct possibility it would have been incinerated. What was the source of this inferno of passion? Fervoured fanatical fundamentalism seemed too abstract for this level of intensity; the hostility seemed too personal. What lay behind it, and why did he feel drawn time and again to it, like a moth to an inevitable, but willing, incandescent doom within a torch? <br>  <br>  &quot;And you do me far too much credit, Lady Tz'nash, in referring to my subsistence level of existence as any form of  'adventure'.&quot; <br>  <br>  The small, scruffy man shrugged within his loose, faded raiments. There was a lot more room for the maneuver within the shabby clothing nowadays. <br>  <br> &quot;I suffice.&quot; <br>  <br>  The bench they shared creaked softly as he shifted position slightly, to alleviate the pins and needles beginning to accrue in his leg, and so he could turn slightly to study Rakash's delicate, child-like, but by no means childish face.  Her countenance represented a microcosm of the rest of her appearance; the paraphernalia of her Rogue's profession now offset by the trappings of Status. Where once her alabaster hair was tied into functional bunches, it now streamed loose and free. Where once her slender, peaked ears had remained unadorned, they now carried exquisite examples of a skilled jeweller's craft. He had had opportunity to study her at such quarters once before, whilst she was unconscious from an attempted poisoning, the perpetrator of which was still unknown. She had seemed so thoroughly...peaceful then. Peaceful, until resurgent repressed memories of  her childhood had snuck in to perturb her recovering slumbers, causing her to inadvertently give the Dredger insight into her formative years. <br>   <br>  Once more he found himself feeling the slight trembling of the soul that seemed to set in when within close proximity to the Ebon Mask, as if an inclement breeze was soughing through his very essence. He had to remind himself that he was regarding a being at least six times older than himself, and with an indisputably alien perspective (although, whispered a treacher thought, it wasn't as if he experienced time subjectively quicker merely because of his comparitively truncated lifespan...). He blinked once, then smiled his ameliorating half-smile and coarsely cleared his throat. <br>  <br>  &quot;To return to the previous topic: I would also rather Gutrot didn't have to witness the marks of entropy upon me, and my ultimate decrepitude. Far better that he live amongst those whose longevity more closely matches his own.&quot; <br>  <br>  Homunculus felt the warming effects of Lothannon's anxious brew begin to seep in, and captured Rakash's gaze again. His deep-ice eyes seemed to contain a tiny heart of eternal flame sealed within, the reflected image of the hearth. He bobbed his head once in deference to the tiny Teir'Dal, and transferred his gaze to the Troll hulking in a recessed area of the Common room. <br>  <br>  &quot;Now. Councillor Tzg'nash, allow me to introduce you to Cyst, a Shamanic Big Brudder. Apparently, he has forsaken the teachings of Innoruuk's and Cazic Thule's followers, and found his own path.&quot; <br>  <br>  The Fisher's eyes sidle in their sockets to regard Rakash, as he angles for a reaction. <br>  <br> Homunculus, <br> Asinine Angler

				Our indigo rogue narrowed her eyes ever so slightly at the thought of a follower of Innoruuk deserting his beliefs.  Her hand instinctively went for the hilt of her dagger as the rumor sank into her gray matter of brain.  Her eyes casually found what would be the mark for her blade upon the troll, yet she stayed from hurling her blade into a large sleep violet eye. <br>  <br> &quot;What matter is it to me if he denounces Our Father's greatness?  I'm not the one he'll have to answer to - Innoruuk is.&quot; <br>  <br> She holds a burning gaze upon Cyst. <br>  <br> &quot;How is it that you, a mere troll, have denounced the following of Innoruuk?   <br>  <br> What has made your simple mind forsake the rightful god of Norrath?  <br>  <br> Do you wish to be enslaved to the lightdwellers who pollute the lands that are by divine right property of Innoruuk's spawn?&quot;  <br>  <br> Our indigo rogue shows her strength in staying her quickness of temper and fervor of devotion.  Her association with the clerics and necromancers of Neriak have made her wise in the ways of Innoruuk yet no more patient with the lesser races of the realm. <br>  <br> &quot;I pity you, troll.  Our Father shall not be merciful to you on the day of your judgement.  Aye, in undeath you shall be cursed to serve us as your masters.&quot; <br>  <br> With that being said the lean indigo rogue resumed her study of Homunculus.  His eyes a calm and serene icy blue sea of mysteries to be yet fathomed.  What was it about this scraggly human that fascinated Rakash so? <br>  <br> Odd the contrast of fire and ice in this neutral place of feasting and drinking.

				Tying the small pouch back among its brothers on his belt, the shaman rests his softly glowing gaze once more upon the Tier'Dal rogue before the fire, staring back into her blazing eyes.  His scaly face devoid of any emotion, he begins to speak in a low rumble. <br>  <br> &quot;It wuz Kaglari, teacher of da Dark Wuns in Grobb, dat pushed my face in da dirt before a altar an' made me speak da wurds of wurship to Cazic-Thool an' Innoruuk.  It was only t'rough dose gods, she sed, dat I wud be able to use da spirits, an' comman' dem.. she wuz wrong. <br>  <br> &quot;I is no stoopid troll who wurships gods cuz sumwun else told me to.  I watch da inkies as dey torture da lightdwellers.. an I watch da lightdwellers in der hate for da inkies an' my bruddas.  I do no choose eeder side, but I can no wurship da gods dat cause all dat pain aroun' Norrat'.  I forsook Cazic-Thool an' Innoruuk; no matter whut you tink, dey hold no sway over me.  I is followin' da Six Hammers, now, an I can still control da spirits.  Nuttin changed dere; I is still a shaman.  An you can talk you wurds of hatred for dose not followin' da Prince of Hate blindly, an dat's hokay wit me; you is his child.  But do no expect dis troll to fall on his knees an' beg dat Prince to forgive him, cuz I is on a diff.. diff'rent road now.&quot; <br>  <br> His piece said, the troll folds his arms over his chest and leans back once more in his chair.

				Barely acknowledging the troll while continuing her feast of roasted meats and hot mulled wine our ebon rogue ponders then speaks nearly laughing. <br>  <br> &quot;The Six Hammers?  That concept of 'justice' by a bunch of unwashed and unkempt Barbarians?  Oh, you are in good company dear troll, dear pet. <br>  <br> I have heard them espouse their concepts of 'justice' to those who would listen and I have found them to be misguided children and flawed in their logic. <br>  <br> How can there be so-called 'justice' when the three races of dark elf, ogre and troll are so hated by the other nine races of Norrath?  How can we, the so-called evil races of Norrath, expect 'justice' from the pales?   <br>  <br> They take the lands that are rightfully ours and despoil them.  They murder our men, women and children on sight and call it 'cleansing the lands of vermin'. <br>  <br> Are we not like they are?  If we are in battle do we not bleed when struck?  Do we not commit our fallen dead to our god with reverence and care?  Do our hearts not beat with desire for our homes and lands when we are far from them? <br>  <br> In our daily lives we are just as they are, and yet we are reviled and hunted to extermination as vermin in their eyes.  What 'justice' is there in that?&quot; <br>  <br> Rakash performs a classic displacement action by taking the poker by the hearth and stirring the ashes of the warm fire with it.  In her eyes the flame of Innoruuk's hatred for the pales burns just a little brighter, burns just a little hotter.

				*Her facial tattoos are partially hidden in the shadow of her helm, but the firelight sparkles in her eyes and glints darkly off her mail as she steps carefully, gracefully cat-like in motion, toward the great troll.  Her staff is held easily at her side and, though obviously terrified, she bites her lip then holds her chin higher and moves steadily toward him.  She stops and swiftly lays the staff between them on the floor, then seats herself at his feet with lowered head* <br>  <br> &quot;I have heard your words and am moved to speak with thee, sir.  Many of my brethren have denounced me because I will give freely of my gifts to any in need... not only of the so-called races of light, but to all.  I sat at the feet of my elders and learned of the Tribunal and I cannot relate their teaching to the hatred of any individual.  And, for this belief, I have chosen to walk with, and fight beside, and even die for those of your race, and the Tier'Dal, as well as those of my own and all the others. <br>  <br> *She looks up at him with an intent expression on her face and places her hand over her heart.* <br>  <br> Evil, I have found, is in the heart of an individual... and justice must be, as well.  Light is a relative thing, and dark is never totally so.  We all walk the land alone... and we will answer to that which guides our hearts.. whichever god or goddess or ... or whatever that may be.  I do not have a god, but only have my heart to guide me.
