				I have a brief commentary to make on the treatment that one of the most honorable people I have ever met received from members of several guilds as a result of a Fear Plane raid that took place on December 18, involving many members from KEG, MFH, and some from Shining Thread. <br>  <br> Felron Majere has been playing on the Rathe since May of this year, and is currently a level 50 Wizard.  I&#8217;m sure that most, if not all of us who are over level 40 know exactly who he is.  We have grouped with him, died with him, and I have never ever seen anyone have a bad thing to say about him.  He has sacrificed himself for the good of his group countless times, and I&#8217;m sure that most of us owe him our lives at least once, if not many more times than that. <br>  <br> During the Fear raid on December 18, he was grouped with several friends.  They arrived at the gate to Fear with very few other people present.  The raid had been in progress for quite some time, and it was his first trip to PoF.   <br>  <br> When his group zoned in, they were all killed at the gate.  When their group reassembled to try for corpse recovery, Felron volunteered to go in and attempt to pull their corpses to the west wall camp.  After 4 deaths by shiverbacks and scarelings, he had pulled most of their corpses to the south wall.  Note:  deaths by shiverbacks and scarelings &#8211; nothing else.   <br>  <br> On one of his attempts to get corpses, he asked those in the zone for assistance, and was flatly told that he was on his own.  Not, &#8220;We&#8217;ll help you when we have cleared that area&#8221;, or &#8220;Contact Snaggle and we will organize something&#8221;, simply &#8220;No &#8211; get out of the zone.&#8221;  I doubt any one of you would have accepted this and written off your corpse as lost, and I defy you to say anything contrary. <br>  <br> On a subsequent attempt to retrieve corpses, Cazic was aggro, and killing players, shouting their names across the zone.  As a matter of fact, we thought it was kind of exciting to see Cazic talking to the zone.  As I understand it, when Cazic goes aggro on you, he summons you and beats you into a bloody pulp, or he simply kills you with a spell from across the zone.  At no time was Felron ever summoned or attacked by Cazic-Thule.  Not once.  And at no time did he receive a /tell that he was causing problems. <br>  <br> It was after about his sixth death (we lost count) for the good of his group that players started popping up at the gate in the Feerott.  Apparenly, Cazic-Thule was racking up a few kills.  We don&#8217;t know who had aggroed him, but it was certainly was not Felron.  If anyone has a screenshot or an unaltered /log of the event showing different, I suggest you publish it.  But since such a thing does not exist, I&#8217;m not worried about it. <br>  <br> Despite this fact, someone got it in their head that Felron was the one who had aggroed Cazic, and the /shouted accusations began at the Feerott gate.  It was a feeding frenzy of the entire zone deriding him for trying to help his friends.  A feeding frenzy by those whom he had considered his friends.  A feeding frenzy on an innocent man.   <br>  <br> To those of you who participated in this disgraceful event and attacked this innocent man with no proof of his guilt, you should be ashamed of yourselves.  I was utterly disgusted with the bullsh*t that was thrown at Felron in the ensuing maelstrom of /shouts.  I thought your guilds were based on honor, fair play, and justice &#8211; apparently not. <br>  <br> To the one player in the entire zone who defended him, I salute you.  Hammerlove, you are the most honorable player I have ever met, and I&#8217;m proud to have played on this server with you.  To those of you who called Felron your friend and didn&#8217;t stand up for him, you should be even more ashamed of yourselves. <br>  <br> Felron deserves a public apology from everyone who took part in this public execution of an innocent man, particularly Magiana, the one name that stands out in his mind from the event.   <br>  <br> All this being said, the fun of EverQuest is mostly based on the fun you can have with the other players.  This situation has destroyed all of the respect Felron had for all of you, and your guilds in general.  He has decided to stop playing on this server, and move to a different server.  I am going with him.  Nevertheless, this man deserves much better than what he received, as he was doing the only thing that he felt right &#8211; attempting to help his group.  Felron leaving is a great loss for The Rathe, and I&#8217;m sure many of you will agree. <br>  <br> Some of this may fall of deaf ears, and I understand that.  Personally, I don&#8217;t give a sh*t if it does.  But I know that some of you will read what I am saying, and take it to heart.  Felron was innocent of every accusation that was made.  If you feel like responding to my comments, or apologizing in private, you can reach me at medding@mail.com.  I will forward any appropriate apologies to him. <br>  <br> He asked for help from more experienced players in the zone, and was flatly turned down.  Put yourself in his shoes: <br>  <br> What would you have done? <br>  <br> The end of the story is that most of the servers crashed later that night, and Felron got all his corpses back when the server came back up with Fear empty.  For those of you who lost your corpses there, I hope you got your corpses back.    <br>  <br> Aymen Tadat <br> Dwarven Cleric

When we got into trouble he even volunteerd to get a corpse in a dangerous place and succeeded in it although he died once. I see it as a great loss for the rathe to loose him, for those responsible for this, shame on you! <br>  <br> A fellow wizard

				There are several things to take in consideration here:  <br>  <br> 1. Fear is ULTRA hard. Just to break Fear requires extraordinary tactics of veretan players that know exactly what is supposed to be done.  <br>  <br> 2. Most of the time nowadays, we break fear using the North wall tactic (look in tactics area - you'll also see that shiverbacks and scarelings ALL SEE INVIS), and then work our way South. This leaves the portal area still very dangerous for players to zone in - and us unable to assist them until we clear then area. The 18th, I don't think we had a chance to clear that area - the servers went down several times that night.  <br>  <br> 3. Tagging along. I am afraid that yes, you are taking chances. When a group organizes a raid several days in advance, die several times just to &quot;break&quot; in, and then later see the zone invaded by non-invited peeps, and the number of people in the zone double , some players can become non friendly and unwilling to help. As I mentioned before Fear is HARD, often uninvited players cause trains and the death of our groups. Rescuing peeps can put the existing parties at great rick.  <br>  <br> 4. Corpse recovery: normally we don't wait for the server to reset. Here again, we use extraordinary tactics to perform CR. That night we had to perform CR for several hours before we actually had the camp &quot;secure&quot;. In the past, we have had CR's that have lasted 10-15 hours. Getting trained by uninvited players can be traumatic, or for the least something we try to avoid. We were trained that very night by uninvited players. We are not Gods, 4-5 fear mods can put us in a very difficult situation.  <br>  <br> 5. The desire to go to Fear. It is very understandable that high level players want to go to Fear, but there are established protocols. Being 47+ is unfortunately not enough. Fear, like hate ot the dragons require multiple group tactics - that coordinate with each other. I was not aware that any efforts were made to coordinate with us - nor that peeps were in troubles at all. First read our tactics and maps, then inquire to get a sponsor - then if you are sponsored you may well have a great time in Fear. Otherwise, feel free to organize your own groups and atempt to break in yourself - even using our tactics.  <br>  <br> I feel that it is unfortunate that Felron or you are offended by this type of thinking, but understand that it has come at a very high price for us (deathwise, hours spent ect...)to learn to break Fear.  <br>  <br> Note: this was posted on www.nagafen.com <br>  <br> Aegirson Thorgal <br> Clan Icewind.

				I am not going to go into detail, but id like you to know a few things: <br>  <br>                             1) The triad is extremely upset, and tired, of people waiting for us to do the break ins, and then crash the <br>                             zone. Our own CRs after a break in can take hours upon hours. Other people make going into a zone almost <br>                             not worth is, sice by the time all CRs are done, everyoen has to log. <br>  <br>                             2) The zones are extremely buggy. People that do not spend time studying the maps are casuing massive <br>                             problems for everyone else in the zone (IE: Cazic). <br>  <br>                             3) People are training to the camp sites established by the triad after a break in, and causing massive <br>                             deaths. <br>  <br>                             Ill wait for one of the officers that was there to go into detail, but your claims and complaints are not valid <br>                             in my eyes. <br>  <br>                             For referance, i am always asking my family to help those in need, and they do on a daily basis.  <br>  <br>                             If you want to go to the planes, spend the days beforhand trying to set up enough people to do the job. Its <br>                             a daunting task, and its close to the point that nobody wants to go to the planes anymore, becuase <br>                             everytrip has people crashing the party, causing everyones deaths, resulting in hours upon hours of CRs <br>                             again. <br>  <br>                             And during that night, there was massive CRS going on for our OWN people.  <br>  <br>                             At what point do the people that are known throughout the land get to sit back and have soem fun? At <br>                             what point do you draw the line? <br>                             Lately we have discovered that line. it is the planes, and i will not ask the fine people of the triad to help <br>                             people that come uninvited to the most dangeous places in norath.  <br>  <br>                             Dont tell me that is not the case, your own post points out the fact that the break in was well underway. <br>  <br>                             It is a testement to the people that do these break ins, that others are watching their every move. Yet it is <br>                             more like that actions of Hyenas, waiting for a Cheetah to make a kill, and then come in for the easy dinner. <br>  <br>                             I am doing my best to get to the point of joining my companions on these trips, and i will tell you, that if <br>                             people train on ME while im there, i will not be as nice as others. I have been watching my poor family and <br>                             cousins get wronged over and over on each trip. I have watched in guildsay as they turn the other cheek to <br>                             all the people that EXPECT us to kill their trains, and save them from their own follies. <br>  <br>                             We are not guards. We are noble warriors, and we enjoy helping others when we can, and when its <br>                             warranted. we have NO obligation to do so, and will NEVER do so after being used. <br>                             (Ok, NEVER is a harsh word, and have infact helped people who dont deserve it many many times) <br>  <br>                             You have quite an ego to assume that the triad drop everything to help someone else my friend. Did the <br>                             thought of what we were in the process of doing ever cross your mind? Did you consider it before trying to <br>                             enter the zone? Did you consider it before asking for a CR?  <br>  <br>                             I meant this to be small.

PoF is a dangerous place to be, unless you know exactly what you are doing. <br>  <br>                             2. Felron and his group were not invited to the join the The Triad in the assault. <br>  <br>                             3. We asked Felron repeatedly to not to zone into PoF while we were doing Corpse Recovery. <br>  <br>                             4. When someone zones into PoF and riles up roamers in the area, there's no telling how the rest of the <br>                             mobs in the zone will react, since their aggro radius is huge. And oftimes a mob you can't see that is far <br>                             away, will be riled up when one of his compatriots close to you decides to make lunch out of you. <br>  <br>                             5. Felron ignored all of our requests and pleas to stop entering PoF, and made us abort a CR mission at least <br>                             4 times. Roughly 36 people had to wait until he was done with his suicide mission. <br>  <br>                             6. I care not if Felron respects us or not. As a representative of CIW, I can honestly say, that we were <br>                             extremely disappointed with his actions and his attitude. If the feeling is mutual, then there is no love lost. <br>                             Take care to the both of you, and enjoy the game as you wish. However, don't come here accusing us of <br>                             slandering and berating Felron, when he repeatedly held up our operation to do CR.  <br>  <br>                             7. Not only did his interruptions prove to be an annoyance, he also prevented us from ressurecting all of the <br>                             necessary bodies in the 2 hour res window that all bodies have. This forced us to create new bodies in PoF <br>                             again, at the expense of time, and other people's experience. <br>  <br>                             8. If you want proof of his guilt, then read over yer own post. He entered PoF many times, I have no idea <br>                             how many, but he disrupted over 36 other peeps. Not only did we ask him not to zone in initially, which he of <br>                             course conveniently ignored, but he continued to zone in even though we were trying to do CR and asked <br>                             him not to. <br>  <br>                             9. Magiana is one of the sweetest peeps that I've had the pleasure to meet in the game. Although at times <br>                             she can be a lil flighty &lt;watches Magiana run around and around and around and around for the 100th time  <br>                               &gt;, she is not prone to public displays of violent temper. She was rightfully upset, that many of her guild <br>                             members had bodies decaying in PoF due to one person or a small group of peeps disrupting our operation <br>                             without consideration or thought. <br>  <br>                             10. What would i have done? I wouldn't have tried to crash an event that I was not invited to in the first <br>                             place. If I was thickheaded enough to do that, I would have spoken to the leaders of the current event and <br>                             made a plea for assistance when it was possible. Neither of these courtesies were observed, and hence, <br>                             what happened happened. <br>  <br>                             In hindsight, could this have been handled better? Absolutely, perhaps on both sides. However, once a <br>                             person steps over the line of civility and starts to disrupt the actions of a greater ent

Snaggle comes with you guys to ease the tension, but I guess thats not how you see it. If we knew your guilds tactics why does Snaggle still go with you guys? I think its funny that you guys think these tactics are your own, when all you did was get the information from someone who left their guild and joined yours. <br>  <br> Kenadin

Let me remind you that the rules on the planes are quite DIFFERENT than that of normal zones. What if I told you that Cazic Thule will turn agro on EVERYONE in the zone if x amount of mobs in the zone are agro. By turning say 6 mobs agro at the portal, Cazic Thule in turn goes agro and starts killing people by death touch.

				I'm relieved that most of the responses to this haven't been flames, but reasonably well thought out responses to my original post.  While there are many issues of fact that can be disputed here, there is a more important issue of philosophy that can be brought up for you all to consider going forward.   <br>  <br> For those who are not involved, the Triad seems to be rather exclusionary.  In other words, for those of us who are not members of one of the guilds, it is plainly posted (somewhere - I don't remember where) that you are not entitled to participate in the loot from successful high risk encounters.  This projects the image that the Triad is claiming these high risk areas as &quot;their own&quot;.  Indeed, comments like &quot;Don't come if you aren't invited&quot; seem to contribute to this perception. <br>  <br> It is this perception that will continue to cause people to &quot;crash your parties&quot;.  I find it very hard to believe that a group of level 48 - 50 characters who arrive on the scene can't be easily integrated into a fear assault, even if they are told &quot;Wait for an hour, we are in a CR cycle.  What are your classes and levels?  Has every person in your group read the tactics?&quot;   <br>  <br> If it is truly your intent to exclude the rest of us from participating in these types of adventures, and this type of treasure, just come straight out and say it.  Otherwise, I think you would be well advised to reconsider your policies, because they will continue to cause trouble for all of you.  Perhaps you could add a &quot;Mercenaries&quot; group into your dragon loot cycles.  Otherwise you will continue to generate comments from people like the ones I have heard:  <br>  <br> &quot;I don't remember seeing it posted anywhere that they own the zone.&quot; or &quot;Who do they think they are?  I can go anywhere I damn well please!&quot; <br>  <br> Leaving everything as it is simply will lead to more problems for you all, since it will look to everyone in Norrath that you are giving us all the big middle finger. <br>  <br> Again, I'm not flaming anyone here, just telling you what reactions your policies and actions are generating.  It's up to you to decide if that's the impression you want everyone else to have. <br>  <br> The fact still remains:  Felron deserves an apology.  Whether or not he ever gets one is irrelevant. <br>  <br> Aymen Tadat <br> Dwarven Cleric

				This is true, CT's new airmail death touch is stemmed from the amount of mobs that are agro and his victims are generally based on luck/misfortune. If you are not properly prepared for entry into the portal and are greeted by a few +400 backstabs you end up agro'ing all in range of the portal (a HUGE range btw). After the mobs own you at the portal they tend to stick around your body for a few minutes before continuing on their merry way and normal pathing. If you foolishly decide to reenter soon after, mobs hanging out by the portal will agro link a few more in the area. This causes an absolute nightmare for people trying to pull in the zone especially if they are doing their own CR. To make things even more complicated, all these agro'd mobs magically cause CT to go ballistic, death-raying whom ever he chooses. So the moral of the story is, if you are fully aware that there is a large group already in the zone, and epecially after youve been told to wait till the portal is clear by them, DONT COME IN. I was not there last Saturday when this particular event occured, but I speak thru experience from several other similar foolish acts by people who just dont have the patience or will to listen. <br>  <br> HAGG, <br> Gurney----)Freeport <br> Brotherhood of the Spider--&gt; <br>

				To see exactly what happens when greed attacks.  I have to admit i think the &quot;triad&quot; as they like to be called have a point.  And if what they say about cazic's argo is true, then they have a legitimate reason to be upset.  However no one deserves to be bashed by 100 people, no matter how big a bonehead move it was.  If he did not know just how hard it was then im sure it was an accident.  I understand the anger behind setting up for a raid that takes 7 hours and many deaths, and know how angry it can make people.  Maby the solution would be in allowing others to enter this alliance besides the three guilds.  After the learning curve, im sure you all would be better off with several bands of groups attacking form different posistions.  Would also help to spread that dreded harm touch around a bit.  At the very least it would make it easier to plan waves of assault, veterans first to bust a whole in caz, then when the gate is clear you can bring in the newbies and train them properly.  All ideas mind you, i can not make good recomendations till i can actually see for myself what horror lies behind that portal.  All in all, no one party can be blamed entrly, for wrong was done on many levels here.  Learn to love a bit more all.

				Incorrect Kenadin and Mr. Anon lets look at the facts. <br> a) Post patch fear had not been done by ANY guild other than Bots (LS was inactive and falling apart at this time). <br> b) Bots had done fear successfully several times and the Guildmaster of KEG got wind of this and Subsequently came bounding over the hills alone and nakid with all the mob's around the portal that we had not yet cleared. <br> c) In our subsequent raid Snaggle asked to tag along.  Sure no problem Snaggle seemed to be a classy guy and we'd never had any broblems with him. <br> d) After 2 or 3 raids our Tactics are posted on keg's site giving us credit for them. <br> e) As of a few days ago thos credits have been removed and the &quot;Triad&quot; is taking credit for something everyone knows they didn't do. <br>  <br> Mr. Anon. Yea I'm sure you do have alot of discussions you can show me... let me guess they go something like this? <br>  <br> Mr. Trainitero &quot;Wow Bots is doing good in fear before I trained them... we need to find out how they're doing this!&quot; <br> Mr. Snaggle &quot;Sure being they trust me I'll group with them a few times and see...&quot; <br>  <br> As always Kenadin I'll respect your right to be wrong (of course from your past posts we can all tell your always right in your own mind).

				Alright. <br>  <br> Gonna keep my little wood elf ranger rear neutral or as close to it as possible. <br>  <br> 1) The Triad was in CR mode.  That means (and yes, this sounds bad) that Fear was, for all intents and purposes, &quot;theirs&quot; until CR was completed. <br>  <br> 2) He asked people currently doing CR for friends and guildmates to assist him and his lone group in CR. (the logic of one group into fear when it takes two groups per mob (or so I hear) escapes me) <br>  <br> 3) Felron proceeds to aggro *JUST* Shiverbacks and Scarelings (in your own words).  Of course, the number of mobs was probably higher than 6.  Which seem to be the magic number to set Cazic off with his Airmailed Package 'o Death (tm) <br>  <br> 4) Nasty things are said on both sides. <br>  <br> Now, I wasn't there.  I'll probably never make it into the Triad, much less Fear/Hate/Dragon Raids (I level far too slow :P) <br>  <br> However, it seems to me that Felron owes the Triad *more* of an apology than they owe him.  He caused deaths, he made CR take MUCH MUCH longer than it should have, and much harder, since the two hour window expired for some, if not the majority of, the people who had rotting corpses. <br>  <br> You say he was an honorable man. <br>  <br> An honorable man wouldn't have done this.

				I read your post twice over, and I'm still trying to figure out what your trying to say, and what BotS has to do with it (other than another unwarrently mudslinging statement from a Triad ass-kisser who probably knows little about the situation). <br>  <br> The fact of the matter is, I've been in fear Post-Patch with as many as 3 of the uber guilds holding their own camps.  A lot of times this results in people getting the feeling that they are being trained/having their pulls stolen etc etc etc.  For the most part, the guilds that have been in Fear for a while respect the space of eachother.  If KEG and friends are doing fear, We'll do it the next day, and if we're doing it, they'll yeild to us.  Same goes for Hate, and dragons, no matter how bad our luck has been with them.   <br>  <br> I wasn't there the day Felron tried to go into Fear with 5 other uninvited people, but usually the people that &quot;break-in&quot; are enough to finish the job, and not only is it dangerous for some time for other people to zone in and try to run to camp, but honestly, no one that took the early deaths building a foothold, clearing the mobs that don't drop jack, want others rushing in as they get to the mobs carrying the loot.  We've adopted turning on /anon or /roleplay when in the planes, to cut down on this problem, might be wise of other people to do as well, to avoid these sorts of things. <br>  <br> A few answers to questions about Fear brought up in this thread.  No, it doesn't always take a lot of people to do fear, and more people doesn't always equal less pc deaths.  More people always equals more lag (video lag making it hard to cast, or lag that makes key people go LD at bad times).  It also creates problems of people not used to following very simple rules like, always /assist, and, if you get ported, make sure nothing is on you before running back to camp.  Take a death for the team when you have to.   <br>  <br> One last thing I want to say.  A lot of people are still trying to create shit between the Triad and BotS.  No one posts their name anymore, but I get the impression a lot of it is people not associated with either alliance.  Their has been a lot of cooperation between the guilds, I can't remember a trip to Fear with BotS without at least one KEG member a long, Snaggle a while back, and Lork recently.  Drakna on the other hand goes on a lot of KEG trips.  The last Fear raid was MFH and BotS.  There is recent talk on the message boards of the guilds working together on a dragon.  Why do you people not in the guilds have to try to start fights?  So retarded.   <br>  <br> Araceli <br> Council of Darkness <br> Allied with BotS and KIC <br> AND CAN WORK WITH THE TRIAD <br>  <br>
