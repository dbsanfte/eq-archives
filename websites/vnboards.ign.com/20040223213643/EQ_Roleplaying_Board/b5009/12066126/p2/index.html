				The bard was weary, despite being exceptional at traveling.  And she had just made a mistake that might prove to be her undoing.  She knew that soon she would be dead if she could not get free of the great beast that followed on her heels.  She absentmindedly sang the song that gave wind to her feet, and searched the horizon in vain for some hope of aid.   <br>  <br> There, an outbuilding of some kind!  Perhaps an inn.  Once, in her travels here, she remembered that a gaurd occasionally passed near one of the inns here, and so she headed in that direction, her footsteps lagging.  She hovered near death, and she knew it.  So near to death was she, that she heard the breathing of the griffon she had foolishly tried to kill, as it swooped towards her. <br>  <br> Within moments, she realized her mistake.  Upon the ground at the inn were the corpses of a guard, and a griffon.  And, nearby, stood a troll, facing off with a warrior, who turned and walked away as she sped towards them.  Surely, it must have been the troll who killed the guard, and there would be no help for her here, as the warrior was leaving, and she heard cries echoing from within the inn.  Amris recognized them to be cries of suffering.  What strange things transpired here? <br>  <br> Her elvish features, marked with a deep sorrow, grew taunt as exhaustion, fear, desperation, and confusion warred inside her.  Cry for help, or keep running?

				From behind faceted glass, coloured lights shimmered.  Tinkling sounds, interspersed with roaring explosions, filtered down to Rigi from the Library Mechanamagica.  The sonorous bell, calling the initiates to begin their learning had tolled 10 times.  On the twelf peal, the ancient, ornatly carved doors of the library, presently great, welcoming portals would close forever for her. <br>  <br> A dark, sinewous voice whispered in her ear as she leapt up towards the doors: <br>  <br> &quot;Run, my pretty, you can make it yet.&quot; encouraging words, twisted with sarcastic inflection. <br>  <br> &quot;You know what will happen if you fail. Heh heh heh!&quot; Horrible wheezing laughter boomed around the cavern, it was the eleventh bell's toll. <br>  <br> Back in the inn, Rigi struggled against an evil inside.  The dream held her fast with a clawed, decaying grasp; a self enforced insomnia had spared her from torment these past two weeks, but now it made escape impossible. <br>  <br> Rigi half ran, half scambled in her desperation.  The walls of the cavern glowed a sickly green.  Pebbles tumbled down the gravely path behind her, her feet slipping on the treacherous surface.  The bell swung back, slowly and deliberately.  Rigi ran harder still, though her throat burned like Veeshan's fire. <br>  <br> &quot;You're nearly there!&quot; the evil voice proclaimed, &quot;you might even make it...&quot; the voice paused dramatically, &quot;as long as you don't...&quot;  <br>  <br> &quot;trip.&quot; Rigi's foot caught on the hem of her oversized cloak, and she fell.  She hit the ground with the crash of bell.  The great doors slammed shut.  The silence that proceeded was broken only by Bertuxxulous' rasping laugh.  <br>  <br> &quot;You will be mine, my pretty,&quot; the plague lord crooned.  There was a blast of purple light, &quot;body...&quot; Rigi's felt her face wrinkle and her skin become pocked, &quot;and soul!&quot; Rigi screamed in anguish, as the joy in her heart began once more to seep away, replaced by the bitterness and self loathing that had their seed at this day.  She struggled to stop it, battling its encroaching invasion, but still it took more from her.  She buckled and writhed, beating herself with white knuckled fists.   <br>  <br> Lenore looked on in horror as new welts appeared on Rigi's disfigured face.  &quot;I must wake.&quot; the gnome screamed. &quot;Wake me, or I shall loose my soul!&quot;

				The Warrior's footfalls fell determined, his unseen face grim, a jaw seemingly set in steel. Sethix knew the pain of battle, he could feel the agony of the Griffon's evil talon upon his torn chest, it was like coals of fire and jags of ice driven into his chest. <br>  <br> He knew that time was running short, he had no Cleric at his side, for Alefrothe had remained behind with the rest of his companions in the underfoot, seeking the Queen. Nor could he turn his gaze upon his always smiling friend Arick and request the Druid's healing touch.  <br>  <br> He was on his own, a determined Warrior, with none of the companions he so needed. He knew that the final whisps of adrenaline would soon fade, leaving him in a pain-induced stupor, vulnerable to the attacks of even the weakest of beasties that skittered about in the night. <br>  <br> With a growl, the proud Warrior began to question his wisdom in leaving the Inn and the Casters there-in.  <br>  <br> His determined step faultered as yet another lance of agony pushed it's way through his barrier of adrenaline and discipline. He shrugged off the pain as only a hardened Warrior could and continued his now pain-laden march. <br>  <br> Darkness and starbursts tickeled the edges of his vision as he slithered to a hault and fell wearily to one knee. His gauntleted hand pressed the flawless plate covering his wound. Through the pain and fog of battle damage, he slowly came to see that this was no normal wound, this was the work of something evil, something horrible. <br>  <br> Sethix had seen and felt the curse falling over the splendor of the Karanas, had felt the itch and the dull ache of it's ailment. This tasted the same, with sudden shock, a question popped into his cottony thoughs, &quot;Had Bertoxxulous come to the Commonlands, to his home of Freeport? Would the god of horror and disease lay his fetid hand down on his people as he had started in the Karanas, where even the clensing rains brought a eery green mist?&quot; <br>  <br> Even through his confusion, he knew that it could be. Bertoxxulous was not so powerfull, Marr watched too closely the people of Freeport, would never let the lord of plagues a step on their lands. <br>  <br> Still the fear nagged at him as he limped, stumbled and crawled his way back towards the inn, fading from reality fast as his mind let go, seeking the calming abyss of darkness.

				As the cleric walks alongside her friend into the inn, she turns as a sharp pain enters her soul. She knows Lenore can handle her patient inside, but there are others here in need of help. Which are they, she wonders to herself. Could the troll need help? The warrior? There is another here in dire need...here but not here, where are they? She looks around frantically. Walking slowly but determinedly she passes each person testing her instincts and abilities. The warrior needs a healing touch. With a wave of her hand, and a touch to his shoulder they are both engulfed in a soft blue light and as the light fades so do his injuries. <br>  <br>  &quot;Be well and still friend, I am only here to help&quot; she tells the warrior after he turns toward her angrily. His anger leaves just as quickly as it came leaving a small smile upon his face. Missing his expression she walks toward Cyst, feeling he has but a few minor wounds she leaves him to his own, knowing he can heal himself she searches for another with greater and more serious wounds. <br>  <br>  &quot;Was there another fighting with you? Is there someone below this great beast?&quot; she asks the assembled people. Then she turns, feeling the pain of someone within the woods, she starts toward the treeline slowly.

				Cyst stands transfixed. <br>  <br> Before him, the spirits writhe most unnaturally... he knows the signs; trouble is afoot.  But so much, and in so many places at once!  His violet eyes scan the empty air before him following spirit patterns only he can see, trying to make some sense of the pained dance before him, to gain some insight, some direction... <br>  <br> ...eventually his gaze follows the dance to Lenore and the gnome.  Wordlessly he approaches, charms rattling with every movement.  He looms over the pair, looking downward, eyeridges furrowed in concentration over an intense stare.  He crouches and takes the tiny gnome's shoulders in his broad hands, his staff lying forgotten behind him. <br>  <br> &quot;Wake up,&quot; he growls in a slaughtered version of the Gnomish tongue.  He shakes her a moment, not too roughly, but enough to attempt to jar her from sleep. <br>  <br> A snort of frustration escapes him before he can stop it.  Taking a deep breath, he begins to speak the syllables of disease abolishment, letting the spirits wash over the little gnome's form.  All the while he shakes her lightly, trying to awaken her from whatever nightmare caused her to cry out so, caused the spirits to be mired and pained..

She see's that this young one is also an elf, but there is a troubled expressioin on her face, as she turns to leave the way she came the spell is cast over her, healing her but not completely.

				Deeper sank the poisonous tendrils as they hunted for good to destroy.  They were the colour of bruises and they oozed yellow pus.  Rigi fought weakly now, her will exhausted by attrition.  The baleful reach of Bertoxxulous slithered around, and corrupted all it could, but what it truly seeked it could not find.  Hidden in the deepest corner of Rigi's subconsiousness was something fragile, yet desperately important, a glowing crystaline sphere, her love of life.   <br>  <br> A suckered feeler rounded the corner, and swelling with glee, slipped and slided towards the cowering sphere.  As it approached it sweated clotted blood and bile, that hissed like acid when it dripped to the floor.  It reared up bfore its prize, like a viper, ready to strike, and impregnate the sphere with its utterly despicable venom.  The sphere trembled with fear and expectation, its corruption certain.   <br>  <br> The strike came impossibly swiftly, but then slowed pulled away by some external force.  A trollish arm, chiselled with straining muscles, gripped the beastial appendage.  The corruption still pushed forward however, ever more slowly, its probing tip tensed and ready, but the spectral arm pulled relentlessly, its grip growing stronger.  The tendril pushed closer and closer, mere inches away, but then fell limp; suffocated.  It steamed, emitting a foul stench. melting, disolving away, leaving nothing but a slime trail that glistened in the light of the sparkling sphere.  Rigi awoke with a start. <br>  <br> Her eyes, upon opening immediately focused on the two massive arms that held her down!  A great, green, leering Troll peered down at her lopsidedly, his mouth, the size of her head, half open in a wide gaping grin.  Before Cyst could speak a word, he recieved a punishing punch to the groin.  <br>  <br> &quot;Ooooph!&quot; he exclaimed as Rigi did a forward roll across the room and under a table, where she croutched momentarily before darting away in the direction of the door.

				/ooc  <br>  <br> Sorry, kinda confused by the cleric, the flow seems to have shifted a bit and I'm not sure where my character has been placed? Last I left him, Seth was in sight of the Inn, but not standing nearby. He's half delerious with pain and some form of disease (I know, I know, Grifs don't DoT or Disease, give me a break!).  <br>  <br> Anyways, you lost me Peacebyrd. <br>  <br> Generally, it's considered...polite...not to take too much control of another's character while weaving your section of the story, pointed suggestions and open ends are always best. <br>  <br> Anyways, I lost track of Flow here. Can someone please point out where Seth is currently? From what I understood of Peacebyrd's post here, he was still with Cyst when the Cleric arrived? <br>  <br> /ooc

				/ooc  Hmmm..The way I am reading this, probably, is since our poor little Gnome friend is in peril, the disease seems to have found her, and has spread to the others.  So far, only Cyst and Lothannon, as he has yet to post, seems to be unaffected.  As to you being back at the inn, maybe you were brought back, but no mention was made that you were brought back inside.  /shrug.  <br>  <br> ooc off <br>  <br> Lenore stands horrified at all the disease around her.  She had seen it in her beloved Karana's and recognized it now.  Karana's own immortal foe, Bertoxxulous, was involved in here somehow.  As new welts appeared on the Gnome's face, and Cyst chanting, she knew there was something truly evil at work here. <br> She places a hand on Cyst's shoulder.  She had watched him, as if following some shadows only he could see.  <br> &quot;Cyst, what do you see? What can I do to help?&quot;  and before he could answer her, a painful expression crossed his face as the Gnome landed a swift kick and staggered towards the door. <br> &quot;Blessed Karana! Has the world gone mad?&quot; she asked in elvish.  She chanted and watched as vines tangled around the Gnome's feet, enough to halt her escape, but not to harm her.  She chanted again and a soft haze surrounded the Gnome, calming her momentarily. <br> &quot;You are not well enough to be moving around, my litle friend.  Your wounds will open again and you are fevered.&quot; she glanced back at Cyst, as he seemed to be recovering from his little attack.  She knew Trolls were sturdy folk, but a well placed kick can drop one to the ground, as she just witnessed. <br> &quot;Do not let the troll worry you, for he is a trusted friend here.  Something has transpired here, and you seem to be the recipient of that attention,&quot; she said flippantly. &quot;and not a welcome gift I can see.&quot;  She looked down into the Gnome's eyes and saw a semblence of comprehension, as the grasp of the fever seemed to release her for the time being.  <br> &quot;Please, let us help you heal, and maybe you can shed some light on as to why the Curse of the Karanas has seemed to follow you to The Commonlands.&quot; <br> Just as the Gnome was about to speak, Lenore heard a faint whisper, and recognized it as Peacebyrd.  Panic filled her as her friend seemed in anguish.  Desperate to reach her friend, yet anxious for the Gnome and the other injured occupants, she was torn as to what to do.  Sensing her distress, Cyst told her to go find the cleric, as he had things in control here.  Lenore complied. <br> Transforming into a wolf, she sniffed the air, and howled as she raced toward her target.  Her padded feet moved swiftly and silently across the tall grass.  Finally, she found Peacebyrd.  And another elf, a wooldland cousin this time.  Both were unconscious.  Lenore knew she could not drag both of them back to the inn, so she quickly raced back.  <br> &quot;I found Peacebyrd, and another, and I need help getting them here, as I cannot do it alone.&quot;

				Even as the cleric cast the spell that soothed her wounds and healed her, Amris felt the clutch of the griffon take her, its mighty talons ripping deeply into her.  But suddenly, it turned, it's deadly attention gone from her.  Her last vision as she faded away was of the cleric laying near her, and the thought raced through her mind, &quot;What trick is this that a creature leaves us broken and bleeding, and yet does not finish the kill?&quot; <br>  <br> Oddly, as she lost consiousness, Amris's awareness did not fade away.  Instead, she walked again in the great woods around Kelethin, the city of her youth.  The scent of the familiar woods made her smile, so clean and pure, slightly musky.  The cool shade that dappled the clearing touched her gently, caressing her skin.  The rough bark of the tree nearby felt oddly comforting, and the sense of peace that flooded her was deeply comforting, wiping away the grief that had tortured her for so long. <br>  <br> The air shimmered before her, an unseen prescence was there, quietly radiating calm and unimaginable power.  Softly, the voice whispered through her mind like a caress, &quot;My child, all is not what it seems, and I have not forsaken you, as you believe.  Do not give up on me, as I am with you.  A mother does not abandon her children, no matter how angry that child is.  Remember, all is not as it seems.&quot;  And the woods and the presence were gone. <br>  <br> The ache of her wounds took over then, and all she knew was the agony writhing through her body.  Then once again, her surroundings changed, she stood again in the same woods, and HE was there beside her once again.  The day, though bright and sunny seemed layed over with darkness, and she knew that, although he was there, he was not real.  She turned to him, and remembered his familiar touch, his beloved smile.  The sorrow and rage grew within her again.  The promise that had been in place since all the time she had been alive had been broken.  The spell that connected all to Norrath had been broken,and his spirit would never find its way to her again.  Tunare had created the spell that summoned a lost spirit back to Norrath, but she had allowed the spell to be broken this time, she had let Amris's beloved pass into the great beyond, irretrievable. <br>  <br> And yet, here he stood before her.  How could it be?  Suddenly, he grasped her, his hands angry, his face twisting in anger.  &quot;No, nothing is as it seems.  I walked with you, and you did not know who I was.&quot;  Then he laughed, and walked away.  He turned, and with one twist of his wrist, lightening came from the sky, striking her, screaming through her cruelly.  Unbeknownst to her, the lightening strike was visible to all around her, passing in a wave in all directions around her, yet seeming to eminate from her.  She knew that in an instant she would be dead, and that this time, there would be no call to return her spirit to Norrath.  Suddenly, she wanted to live.

				/ooc (I hope no one objects if I move everyone back into the inn! Then we can begin the process of confusing each other once more!) <br>  <br> There was a brief, futile struggle against the vines that wrapped fast around Rigi's aching legs.  The cloudy haze of sleep dispersed, clearing Rigi's vision somewhat.   <br>  <br> She touched the fresh welts on her face; Bertoxxulous's evil residue; and winced in pain.  No clerical magic could cure these wounds, (unlike that Griffin's terrible blow)  for they were only tears she would ever shed, the tears of the damned.  Rigi cursed bitterly.  She had fallen asleep again. Although she felt perfectly normal, how much much more of her mind had been corrupted, ready to betray her, whispering abhorent thoughts into her ever receptive ear?  How much longer could she hold back from certain fate, she knew not.   <br>  <br> She surveyed the chaotic scene visible through the tavern door, as calmly as she could.   <br>  <br> The paladin, her 'customer' from earlier, was dragging an dead guard's corpse into the trees.  Rigi swiftly reappraised the knight's  skill at arms, as well as his honor. <br>  <br> &quot;Perhaps he is a knight of the shadows, not as true as he seems?&quot; she mused.  No, that theory, did not seem right.  <br>  <br> /ooc (i know you didn't slay him Loth, but Rigi doesn't!) <br>  <br> The troll shamen that had thundered past her, jangling with trinklets, was now rapidly returning, a couple of unconscious bodies scooped up in his arms.  She feared him less now, since he obviously had a preference for elf, rather than gnome chops!  He had stopped clutching his groin, but Rigi's fist still smarted from the blow she struck.  Luckily, he did not look the type to bear grudges. <br>  <br> The druid followed more slowly, not far behind, supporting another unconscious body.  The elf maiden had been having a trying time.  Rest and good company was what she had sought in the inn this night, not yet another blood bath.  She seemed to be taking it with good grace however, as her kind often does. <br>  <br> The beating of a griffons wings were also disturbingly audible.  A searching, somehow moarnful, screech was heard from somewhere above the tree tops.  Rigi swiftly concluded that it was searching for its mate. The bloodied corpse that lay not ten yards away seemed the most likely candidate.  Rigi was not sure what would happen when it was found, but she was certain it would not be pretty.  <br>  <br> The Troll entered the room, hardly out of breath from the exertion, and laid out the two elves side by side on the floor.  He smiled at Rigi, still helplessly trapped, before tending to their wounds.  <br>  <br> Lenore flopped through the door a moment later, breathing heavily, and lay the third patient down. Only the knight was missing. <br>  <br> Rigi peered into the gloom of the forest. <br>  <br> &quot;What could he be doing with that corpse?&quot; she wondered darkly, trying to block out the horrific, diabolical ideas that had been prompted by that thought. <br>  <br> There was a flash of silver armour between the trees, and the Paladin emerged, walking purposefully towards the door to the inn.  A shadow passed over, something was circling far above.  The griffin. <br>  <br> Rigi warred inwardly with herself: No one else inside the tavern had seen, they were too busy recovering, or tending to wounds.  No one else could give him warning. <br>  <br> &quot;let him die, be carried high into sky and dropped like a rag doll&quot;, dark voices whispered in Rigi's head.   <br>  <br> &quot;Let him be crushed under foot and trampled&quot;, they crooned.  Rigi ignored them: <br>  <br> &quot;Run!  The griffin has seen you!&quot; she shouted hoarsely.   <br>  <br> The paladin reacted swiftly, sprinting across the remaining distance.  The shadow was growing in size.  Rigi could now clearly make out the rapidly decending griffin, in a terrifying dive.  As Lothannon approached the door, the griffin landed right behind him, its sharp beak open wide, ready to invite another little morsel into its vacuous stomach.   <br>  <br> As Loth crossed the threshold he swept his great sword in a frighteningly swift arc, The griffon, travelled at such speed that it was unable avoid the blow.  It was struck mightily, flinging its head to the side and causing it to trip over itself.  <br>  <br> The massive body crashed into the side of the inn.  The building creaked and groaned like a sinking ship under the strain.  Pictures fell with a crash off the walls, and a great cloud of dust filled the room, causing all to cough and choke.  The griffon, injured and surprised, staggered sideways.  Two foot long feathers floated to the ground at its feet.  <br>  <br> /ooc (I'm sorry I took over your character, just for a paragraph or three, Loth.  You don't post all that frequently, so I didn't want to leave it with all of us unable to post until you do.  I hope I did not make him do anything too out of character.  DM.) <br>  <br>

				Cyst stands slowly after settling the elf pair in, still moving a bit carefully due to sore spots.  As the little gnome shouts her warning, he whips around and looks outside, trying to discern where the attack is coming from... his efforts are momentarily thwarted, however, as the griffin slams into the inn, causing dust to fly into his eyes and up his prominent nose. <br>  <br> He stumbles out of the inn, sneezing and rubbing his eyes furiously.  He cracks open one watering eye and sees the griffin floundering, wounded and off-guard.  He gestures with one hand and growls the arcane words of the shaman, sending the spirits of frost slamming into the griffin.  He watches a moment as it begins its death throes, then stomps back into the inn. <br>  <br> He pulls out a chair near the door and sits heavily, the wood groaning underneath his weight.  With one last, roaring sneeze, he slumps forward, exhausted from commanding the spirits.

				&quot;My thanks Lady for thy warning.  T'would have been an inconvenience to be set upon by such unprepared.  Though where yet another Griffon came from in these parts is a matter that is beyond mine simple understanding.  Perchance they were a mated pair or some such.&quot; <br>  <br> The Knight turns to survey the Inn and takes in, seemingly for the first time, the saddened state of its occupants. <br>  <br> Cyst sits slumped near the battered doorway, obviously exhausted and possibly ill, though it is difficult to tell when a Troll looks ill. <br>  <br> A Bard lies unconscious near the hearth breathing but shallowly along with Lady Essence who seems exhausted but appears to be sleeping soundly recovering from a profound exhaustion. <br>  <br> &quot;'Twould appear a stiff drink would be in order now.  Lady Lenore might I interest thee in that drink I offered earlier?  Better late than never 'tis true.  And Lady um..&quot; <br>  <br> Lothannon stops in utter embarrasment his pale High Elven face turning a bright shade of crimson for a moment as he turns once more to Rigi. <br>  <br> &quot;Ah Lady how positively human of me, why it appears one's manners hath been totally deserted.  Honoured to meet thee, and in thy debt of course.  I have the honour to be Sir Lothannon Spiritlight, Paladin of the Mother Tunare, at thy service.  Wouldst thou care for a drink Lady, after thy ordeal outside?&quot; <br>  <br> Lothannon bows once again to Rigi and then moves to the bar and slips behind it to mix a drink for those who want it. <br>  <br> A furrow of concentration crosses Lothannon's brow and he pauses a moment in mixing the drinks.  The Knight raises his voice a little, yet careful not to disturb those who rest, and calls out to those yet awake <br>  <br> &quot;Wasnt there another fellow?  A Roundear I believe, fighting the first Griffon with us?  Strange creatures humans to travel so far to find and Inn and then never stop for a rest or a drink.&quot; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> /ooc  Um its ok no harm no foul but I'd deliberately left Loth doing something apart from you all so he wouldnt hold you up.  I mean how much help can a Paladin need to bury a roundear Guard anyway?  I dont mind too much if someone sees the need to weave Loth saying something into their own part of the tale but he'd  never run.  He'd stand and die first.  And he'd certainly never bring it closer to someone who may be hurt or to the Inn which he has personally invested the distasteful (to him) effort of actual manual labour into fixing. <br>  <br> But no worries, we'll sort it.  Live and learn and all that.  It really is ok. <br>

She calls upon the power of nature, and a pale green glow surrounds the warrior, regenerating his skin back to normal.

				Lenore beams a smile at the troll. <br> &quot;And it is good to see you too, Cyst.&quot;  she stands and walks over to the troll and wraps her arms around him in a friendly hug. The troll grunted a small sound of pleasure and hugged the tiny elf back.  <br> &quot;Let me go back and see how my meals are doing.  I hope that none of my pies have burned in all this excitement.&quot; <br>  <br> The smells of the food caused many stomachs to rumble hungrily, and mouths water in anticipation.  The savory aroma of soups, stew, hearty meat and vegetable pies, bread, berry pies, cookies and muffins filled the air.  One by one, Lenore brought the steaming dishes out to the commonroom and told everyone to help themselves.  She dished a couple bowls of steaming vegetable stew and brought them to the recovering Peacebyrd and the petite bard.  She looked over to the warrior, moving slowly in order to sit upright. <br> &quot;Tell me your meal request, and I shall bring it to you.&quot; she said with a soft smile, <br> to him. <br> She watched the others begin to fill their plates and smiled when the little gnome took a tentative bite of a meat pie, then consume it in very short time, as if she hadn't eaten in ages.

				Oddly enough, it was the smell of food that brought Amris out of the unconscious state she was in.  She came out of it instantly, jerked rudely to her feet.  She lurched unsteadily for an instant before sitting heavily back down.  The world seemed surreal to her, an instant ago, she had been near death, and now, she sat among strangers, with one handing her a meal as calmly as any daily scene.  She felt peculiar, as if she were slightly out of things, set aside in some way.  She watched the druid serving food calmly.  The distinctive earthiness of the druid calmed Amris, a reminder of safer times, of youth.  Still, the feeling of being outside held her firmly, unready to relinquish its hold. <br>  <br> Accepting the food, she ate quietly, her movements slow and measured.  Standing slowly, she invited the injured to join her in the magical grouping that would allow her songs to weave around them.  When those who wished it had joined, she began to sing.  Her song was soft, her voice compelling and gentle at the same time, weaving intricate notes that danced and sparkled in the air around her, soothing injuries, encouraging muscles to mend, bones to knit.  Calmly, she bandaged herself, using the silken bandages she always carried to pull the worst of the wounds together.  She was lucky that the Cleric had cast the healing that she had, as the last blows of the griffin would have claimed her surely, otherwise. <br>  <br> Reminded of the great beast, she jerked to her feet, instantly changing the beat of her song, weaving notes that would carry her swiftly.  She fairly flew out the door, suddenly sure that it lurked outside waiting to attack again.  Her heartbeat roared in her ears, her stomach knotted, and she felt suddenly anxious.  The others jumped, startled by her sudden movement.  As she reached the door, she realized that the wreckage was the body of the griffon that had pursued her.  Just as she relaxed, she saw a figure lying in the path, barely discernable to her in the shadows of the nearby trees.   <br>  <br> She didn't hesitate.  Hastening to the stranger's side, she began to bind his wounds, just as she had her own, moments ago.  She raised her voice, crying out for aid, hoping that one of those inside might have within them the reserves to cast a spell that might keep this stranger from losing his life.  <br>  <br> She busily staunched the blood that poured from greivous wounds, grabbing a nearby treelimb to carefully hold a broken limb still, all the time speaking softly to him, warning  him to be still, comforting with her voice even as she saw him wince from the pain that the bandaging caused.  She was afraid that, as hard as she was trying, she might be too late to save him.
