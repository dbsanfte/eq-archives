				&lt;OOC&gt;This is my character background for my DAoC character. I thought the board needed an RP story so I posted it here. &lt;/OOC&gt; <br>  <br>  <br> The smell of stale ale permeated the dimly lit common room. God didn&#8217;t even know how long the thrushes had lain on the floor of the room. Countless mugs of warm tasteless ale had been spilt on it along with a healthy amount of human blood. A single tired and used prostitute sat alone at an empty table to tired to try and score another john before retiring for the night. Hopelessness hung on her like an old oversized coat. On a normal night she would be the sorriest creature in the building, but not this night. <br>  <br> A man sits at a table not for from the prostitute. An unreadable blank expression on his face, no one cared or had noticed how long he sat there motionless. If someone were to care enough to guess his age they would easily guess ten to twenty years his senior by his haggard unkempt looks. But no one did as all in this Tavern had their own problems. The man sat there staring into his mug of warm hours old ale not noticing the unknown detritus that floated in it.  <br>  <br> The man was in a world of his own making. A world crafted by his shattered will and ale numbed mind. Life hadn&#8217;t always been that way for this man. At one time he had been a Mercenary and part of a company of like-minded men and women training to fight the godless hordes of invaders that troubled his people. The company had long since vanished and with it his will to fight. Unconsciously his hands strayed to his weapons at his sides. One hand falling on the well-worn hilt of a scimitar the other on the head of a time dulled hand axe.  <br>  <br> His mind raced back to a time long since passed. He was standing before a tall willowy Avalonian woman with shocking white hair wearing chainmail a sword and a key over a checkered black and gray background stood out on her shield. In his minds eye he saw himself, his chainmail gleamed in the afternoon sun, his kilt was clean its tartan bright and vivid and a pair of cheap overused longswords hung from his belt. He could see the woman&#8217;s lips move as she said something to him but what ever they were had been lost in the depths of time. Their meaning became clear as she handed him an axe and a scimitar of exceeding beauty and quality. Weapons that she had made with her own hands. Coins of gold and silver went from his hand to hers and they parted ways. He knew pleasantries had been exchanged but he remembered not her name.  <br>  <br> His mind jumps to a few short weeks after that encounter, his last good memory, to a bloodstained battlefield. He could hear the screams of his comrades shouting for his help followed by the sickening crunch of bones meeting the gigantic hammer of the troll his troupe faced. He beat his weapons against the armor of the troll ineffectually, it was not the make of the weapons that failed him but the lack of skill of the man who held them. The troll having just dispatched the last of the mans friends turns his attention towards him. A deep booming laugh emerges from the depths of the creatures chest mocking the mans futile attacks. The troll lifted its impossibly large hammer as if it was as light as an empty mug of ale swinging it viciously at the man. Somehow the man dodges the blow that would have surely killed him, as he did so his foot touched something. The man spared a look at what impeded his foots travel. The cleric, even in his mad wakened dreams he couldn&#8217;t bring her name up from the grave, her neck was twisted in an odd angle that could not support life. Her slowly glazing eyes stared up at him saying what her blue life less lips could not, &#8216;why did you lead us to our deaths, its your fault we are dead&#8217;. At that moment something snapped in the mans mind and he turned and ran. Leaving his friends to rot on the battlefield. He knew not whether the troll gave chase for he never looked back.  <br>  <br> Cold sweat covers him, a single tear leaves a glistening trail down his cheek. He runs a hand through his greasy unkempt hair. Finally the man&#8217;s mind returns to the here and now. With his mind returned from the abyss of long past memories he realizes that the warm ale in front of him represents the last of his money. The Tavern keep won&#8217;t let me stay here for free, might as well clear my head outside. The man stands looking down at himself noting the various stains that mar the tartan of his highland clan. He also dejectedly notes the rust that seems to have found a hold on his once well kept armor. From a bright-eyed farm boy, to an aspiring warrior, to a drunken lay about. How far I&#8217;ve come to get no where.  <br>  <br> No one notices as the man leaves the Tavern stepping from the morose pall that hangs in it to the cold night air of Albion&#8217;s Highlands. The smell of the nearby stables mixed with other common village scents rides along the wind to the mans nose. The smell is almost refreshing to him after so much time spent wallowing in self-misery in the Tavern of the hopeless.  <br>  <br> The man pulls his cloak tightly about him in a vain attempt to fight of the icy wind as he begins walking out of the village in an attempt to leave his past behind or regain a piece of hope he once had. <br>  <br> Part II <br>  <br> The icy wind of the Highlands angrily bit at the exposed flesh of Riese&#8217;s neck and face. He trudged on through the uncharacteristically cold autumn wind ignoring it. On he went walking in the cold night air with only the pale light of the new moon to guide his steps. For a long while he did not know where he was going or what he would do when he got there he just walked largely oblivious to his surroundings. Thus he missed the footpad hunkered down in the dark along side the road. He saw another man approaching him from up the road but paid him no head. Riese was but a ghost walking, he had died in spirit on the harsh battlefield with his comrades. <br>  <br> Behind Riese a voice dripping with the cockney accent of the lower class halted him, &#8220;Looks &#8216;ike this one thinks he can travel the road at night withou&#8217; payin&#8217; the toll.&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Aye, a fool he is if&#8217;n he thinks that&#8217;. Now be a good lad an&#8217; hand over yer money and we may let ye live,&#8221; the man standing in front of Riese said as he revealed a dagger he had hidden under his cloak. <br>  <br> Riese turned so he could see both of his accosters. Noticing that the man who mysteriously got behind him was armed like the other casually brandishing a dagger. Riese said nothing, releasing the grip he had on his cloak that had been futilely holding back the cold. His cloak fluttered out behind him revealing the axe and scimitar on his belt along with the suit of chainmail that covered most of his body.  <br>  <br> &#8220;Now don&#8217; be doin&#8217; anythin&#8217; foolish lad. Jus&#8217; drop yer money pouch and walk away and we&#8217;ll be lettin&#8217; ye live.&#8221; <br>  <br> The sound of steel being loosed filled the night. Riese&#8217;s answer was clear as he held his axe and scimitar while getting into a defensive crouch. No further words were spoken actions said everything anyone needed to know. Both of the footpads rushed Riese from his flanks hoping to take advantage of their superior numbers.  <br>  <br> The thug on Riese&#8217;s left arrived at Riese a few steps ahead of his cohort proving the two lacked experience fighting together and giving Riese an opportunity to survive. The thug clumsily attempted to stab Riese as he charged in, overextending himself allowing Riese to easily sidestep the blow while he scored a glancing blow to the mans shoulder and pushing him into the other thief disrupting his charge. Something stirred in Riese something that had long been missing, he felt alive as the men attacked him.  <br>  <br> Riese waited while the two untangled themselves from each other. Riese&#8217;s initial attacker put his free hand to his wounded shoulder bringing back blood. The look of pure murder made its way onto the mans face as he thrust with his dagger again, not waiting for his accomplice to reset himself from the collision. Riese wasn&#8217;t quick enough to dodge this blow but his armor absorbed the brunt of it. Riese responded with an overhand slash of his scimitar across the cutthroat&#8217;s chest and abdomen. A geyser of blood sprayed from the wound onto Riese&#8217;s face and armor giving him a grisly countenance. Riese continued the movement of his initial strike spinning past the now dying man to the second while swinging his axe at him as he went just barely missing. The man seemed to have lost his fight when his friend fell to the ground lifelessly as he turned and began running. Mentally Riese cursed his stupidity at selling his shortbow a few weeks ago for money to drink. Not wanting to chase the man nor leave him to accost others Riese did the only thing that came to his mind. He threw his axe. End over end it went. It seemed to slow as it unerringly made its way towards the running man. Moonlight glinted of its blade at each of its zeniths in an odd rhythmic way. A sickening crunch was all that announced the end of its travel as the blade buried itself deeply into the mans back severing his spine instantaneously ending his life. <br>  <br> Riese slowly walked towards the man who had attempted to flee his fate. Small clouds of moisture exploded from Riese&#8217;s mouth with each quickened breath. The other mans blood was warm on his face yet was already beginning to rapidly cool. Riese calmly looked down at the dispatched man. The man was lying immobile on his face. The head of his axe was nearly buried to handle in his back. Riese casually put his put his boot on the dead mans back as he pried the axe from it. Emotionlessly he wipes the blade of the now freed axe on his assailants&#8217; cape before returning it to his belt.  <br>  <br> Just as the dead mans lifeblood cooled on Riese&#8217;s face so to did the flame of life he had felt while in the heat of battle. As Riese morosely trudged on the raging inferno that had lit his soul calmed to glowing embers. Embers that felt like an inferno to the spiritually dead man, a sign he may have a purpose after all. <br>  <br> The pale light of the steadily encroaching dawn peaked over autumn hills. With the light another dawning occurred, this one not of the coming day but of realization within Riese. Consciously Riese had no idea where he was going, but the mans subconscious had taken him to the perfect place to regather his facilities. He stood on the crest of a hill over looking the small farm his parents owned and ran. The morning suns light made long shadows within the valley, yet as is often the case with the autumn sun no heat came from it. Riese looked at the quite valley remembering a time of innocence and hard work. A small smile found its way onto his face as he fondly remembered his childhood. That smile marked a first in many months for the broken man. <br>  <br> Riese started walking down into the valley thinking this was the perfect place to get his life back together. Especially since his parents would still be in Camelot selling the summers harvest and buying seeds and supplies for next years planting and food to make it through the harsh Highland winter. He would have the place to himself. It was only a short walk before he reached the small stone and thatch building that marked his childhood home. He opened the door and found just what he expected a small clean family room with a kitchen area and three rooms attached to it. He made his way to what had been his room growing up. Other than it being a good deal cleaner than he remembered it the room was exactly as he left it. He went to his wardrobe and opened it, just as he had hoped neatly folded was an appropriate length of wool in his clans tartan. He picked it up taking it to the kitchen where he dropped on the table that dominated the room. He then grabbed the largest pot in the house and made his way to the small creek that ran behind the house filling it with its frigid waters. He made his way back into the house setting the pot on the wood burning stove and then began gathering wood and tinder to start the fire needed o heat the water.  <br>  <br> After a short time the fire was slowly heating the large pots clean waters while he relaxed in the living room. Soon he&#8217;d have the small wooden tub full of piping hot water and he&#8217;d clean of the months of built up grime that he had collected while he wallowed in self-pity. It wasn&#8217;t long before the tub was full of hot water and he was lowering himself into its steaming water. He Riese just relaxed in it for a few minutes before he started roughly scrubbing him self with a rag and a bar of lye soap. When he was finished his skin was red and tingled but he was clean and some of the self-doubt he had been carrying with him seemed to have gone with the dirt.  <br>  <br> He went to bed shortly after he had cleaned up after himself and deciding to make his way to Camelot. For some indescribable reason he wanted to return there and find the weapon smith that had made his weapons so long ago. Her kindly face, stark white hair, and calm self-confident demeanor stuck out in his mind. He also remembered the symbol of a Key crossing over a Sword in front of a checkered light and dark gray background. If he could not find her again perhaps he&#8217;d be able to find another of that carried the same coat of arms. He&#8217;d start his search in the morrow.  <br>   <br>
