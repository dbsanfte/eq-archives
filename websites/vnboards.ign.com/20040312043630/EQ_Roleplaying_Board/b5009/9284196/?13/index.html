				 <br>  <br> * Awakens abruptly. She looks around as if she were lost. Seeing the peoples of the inn she wonders why she is here, or how she got here. Then she remembers.... Lady Lenore was very ill.... her husband, Choco had not eaten for worry of her.... and her own beloved was missing. She had not seen him since her 12th cycle of Tunare. Where was he? Where has her beloved Warsong Lightheart gone? Will she ever see him again? She rises quickly knocking her chair to the floor. Leaving her belongings where they lay under the table she runs for the door, not sure if she knocks anyone over in her flight. The tears stream from her face as she thinks of Warsong. When she is clear of the inn and it&#8217;s inhabitants she lets herself fall. She cries uninhibited, letting the tears flow freely. * <br>  <br> After a time the tears begin to subside and she remembers the first time she saw him. <br>  <br> ~ Standing in Felwithe with her sisters, Reina and Qerowyn. She had just finished her formal training and had met in their home town to travel and adventure together. As the people walk by their are many new faces that turn to look at the triplets, and others who smile at them warmly. They stand talking, trying to decide where they should go. They know they want to leave their beloved home to make a change in their world that's gone mad with evil. Then a shadow falls over them. They take no notice of it, until they realize someone is standing beside them. As Essence looks up she takes in the most handsome Human she has ever seen. His armour glowed seemed to glow as did his hair. He smiles at her, taking no notice of her beautiful older sisters. She smiles shyly in return. <br>  <br> &#8220;Greetings lass&#8221; says the stranger. <br>  <br> Essence curtsies as she&#8217;s been taught, &#8220;Good day to you, Sir. Are you in need of assistance?, &#8220; is her automatic reply. <br>  <br> &#8220;No,&#8221; he laughs softly, &#8220;I am but partaking in the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Warsong Lightheart, Paladin of Mithaniel Marr.&#8221; He extends his hand in greeting as he waits for her to introduce herself. <br>  <br> As her sisters stand watching she extends her hand to him, &#8220;I am Essence, Cleric of Tunare. It is a pleasure to meet you. May I introduce my sisters, Qerowyn and Reina.&#8221; <br>  <br> He bows over her hand, kissing it lightly. He straightens and nods a greeting to the sisters, not releasing her hand. She feels something rush through her as he continues holding her hand in his. Not wondering why he doesn&#8217;t let her go, just relishing the fact that he hasn&#8217;t.  <br>  <br> &#8220;Where are you from, Sir Lightheart?&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;I am from over the Ocean Of Tears, a town called Freeport. I have come here in search of adventure, and to right the evil that is wreaking havoc throughout our fair lands.&#8221; <br>  <br> They stand talking for awhile longer before he tells her he must go. That his friends are waiting for him. He asks if he can visit her again, and after replying that she would like that very much he gives her a single gold earring. <br>  <br> &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t compare to your beauty, but I would be pleased if you would accept it.&#8221;  <br>  <br> Unsure of taking a gift from him she looks to her sisters as she always does in times of uncertainty. Seeing them smile she accepts it and puts it in her ear. &#8220;I shall wear it and remember you.&#8221; <br>  <br> He kisses her hand once more and slowly releases it, smiling widely he strolls out of town. Her sisters gather closer to her after he has gone and hug her tightly.  <br>  <br> &#8220;Congratulations little sister! I am so happy for you.&#8221;  <br>  <br> &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Don&#8217;t  you know that he is taken with you, as much as you are with him?&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; but she blushes. &#8220;He WAS handsome wasn&#8217;t he? and did you see his eyes?&#8221; She sighs happily.  <br>  <br> Several days go by as the triplets wander through Greater Faydark hunting the orcs that are found there when they are approached again by Warsong. Essence smiles widely as she sees his handsome face. He takes her hand and kisses it. <br>  <br> &#8220;Hello again beautiful. How are you and your sisters this day?&#8221; <br>  <br> Blushing profusely she replies, &#8220;I am far from beautiful, but we are well think you. And you are well I hope.&#8221; <br> &#8220;Far from.... Are ye daft lass? Ye&#8217;re the most beautiful thing I have seen in all my days!&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Now that is impossible when my sisters look just as I do.&#8221; <br>  <br> &#8220;Ahh lass, do ye not know that Qerowyn has a different shade of hair? and reina&#8217;s eyes are not s bright as yours? You are indeed the most beautiful creature the Gods and Goddesses have ever put on this world. I am glad I have met you today, for I must ask you something.&#8221; <br>  <br> Wondering what he has to ask her she waits for his question, smiling up at him she feels as though she is about to drown in the gold and blue pools of his eyes.....~ <br>  <br> * Wiping the tears from her eyes she smiles as she begins to play with the golden earring she wears to this day. * <br>  <br> /OOC  If you like this and want to hear more let me know and I&#8217;ll finish the love story. If you have any critiques on this I would like to hear them as well. It has been a very long time since I have written anything like this, so I am a bit rusty. <br>  <br>  <br>

				And watches her hurried flight from the tavern.  She had tended her in her illness and wondered what  she could do to return the favor.  She followed her outside, but as the regal Elf began to weep, Lenore battled to either go to her or go back inside.  The option to go to her won. <br> Lenore softly and gently sat a few feet from her. <br> &quot;M'Lady, forgive my intrusion.&quot;  She jumped at the sound of Lenore's voice but relaxed. <br> &quot;I could not help but notice your distress and since you have been so kind to me in my illness, I want to try to return the favor.  If you decide not to accept my offer, I will leave you and understand.&quot;  Lenore extended a hand.  Her violet eyes were soft and understanding.

				 <br>  <br> Not thinking of herself she replies, &#8220;M&#8217;Lady, you should not be out in this evening air. You have barely recovered from your ailment. Please, when you have recovered .........&quot; <br> Lenore smiles and raises her hand, &#8220;Worry not about me lass, I am recovered enough. Please, tell me why you are sitting here alone and crying. I will understand if you wish me to leave, but I do want to help, even if it is just to listen.&#8221; <br>  <br> *sighing she tells of her first meeting with the handsome Human Paladin.* <br>  <br> &quot;I remember the day he returned to Faydwer.....&quot; <br>  <br> ~&quot;My dearest Essence, I know I have not much to offer you, but if you would find it in your heart to be my wife I would be the happiest man in this land.&quot; <br>  <br> The young elf looks at him in astonishment. &quot;I would on one condition be your wife, M'Lord. You must first get my sisters permission. In truth it would be my parents, but alas they are gone from this world. If Reina Qerowyn and even Kerodru, give their permission I shall indeed become your wife.&quot; <br>  <br> *Happiness overcomes them both as they embrace, not caring who sees them. When she next sees Warsong her sisters have given their sanction and they are betrothed.*~ <br>  <br> Looking at Lenore she smiles, &quot;You see.... When I saw how much you and your husband were in love, it made me think of my own love that is now lost to me. I sometimes find myself sitting alone crying and remembering times past. I remember most the first days and the last. If you do not mind, perhaps if I talk to someone about the last day I saw him, it may help me.&quot; <br>  <br> With a  nod of her head Lenore makes herself more comfortable beside her on the ground. <br>  <br> ~ The day was sunny, the skies were blue and Warsong approached her. As was usual when they met by chance she threw herself in his arms and kissed him passionately. He returns her kiss just as passionately then sets her down. <br>  <br> &quot;We must talk my love. I have to leave this world for a time.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;But, where are you going? When will you return? Why must you go?&quot;  <br>  <br> The questions fly from her lips before she can stop them <br> &quot;And, we are not yet wed. Can we not have a small ceremony before you depart?&quot; <br>  <br> laying his hand upon hers he smiles sadly, &quot;I would like nothing more but to take you as my wife now, but as you well know, your sisters consent came with a condition. You must wait until your 20th cycle of Tunare. After that day, they we may wed. as for where I am going, it is a long journey from here, I do not know when I will return or if I will. I go to do battle with this another force that threatens another land. The people have called upon me and it is my duty. I shall return as soon as I can.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;If I can get my sisters to agree, will you wed me now?&quot;{ <br>  <br> &quot;You know I will, but I have little time left. Hurry, find them and I shall find the man that is to guide us to matrimony.&quot; <br>  <br> They kiss again and depart, each going their separate ways. Essence quickly finds her sisters and tell them what has happened, when they return where they will hold the ceremony, only the guide remains. <br>  <br> &quot;M'Lord Warsong was called away suddenly by his friends, who, from the looks of them, were also bound for places unknown. He asked me to remain here and tell you, his betrothed, that he is so very sorry, and that he will return as soon as he is able.&quot; <br>  <br> With a cry that sounds as if she's been wounded she runs the way the guide motioned. Her sisters catch her and restrain her, talking softly to her until she calms. &quot;Stay here Ess, he will return as soon as he can,&quot; &quot;Aye, lass. remain with us. Perhaps the Gods and Goddesses have sent him away so that you may reach your maturity before you wed,&quot; &quot;Take heart, sister, he loves you greatly to have asked for you, and waited this long, he'll be back.&quot;~ <br>  <br> &quot;So you see, it has been 14cycles of Tunare already. I am past my maturity and I miss him so very much. I feel as tho he still lives, but not here as we. I just don't know.&quot; She begins to weep again, softly this time.

				Feeling the motherly instincts within her kicking in, she gathers Peacebyrd to her and holds her.  Lenore smiled at the words she heard..&quot; I am past my maturity..&quot;  She did not know how long Peacebyrd's kind lived but she knew they were long-lived.  Lenore's own kind lived close to 400 years as it was, and she was still considered young at 110, though she was beginning the middle years of her life.  Lenore wisely kept her thoughts to herself.  The elf needed comfort, not a run down of her age. <br> &quot;Forgive me,&quot; Peacebyrd began to speak, but Lenore cut her off.  <br> &quot;It is alright.  My own daughter still needs me in her times of sorrow and she is a grown woman.  You are much like her.  Do not grieve so hard for your love.  Trust me when I say he is carrying you in his heart, willing him to live and return to you, giving him purpose.  Shortly after my marriage to Choco, he too, was called away.  He was gone nigh a year before he returned. <br> When he returned, he told me he heard my heart calling to him, driving him to stay alive, knowing I loved him and I was here for him when he returned.&quot;  Peacebyrd sniffed daintily and Lenore wiped a tear away with her fingers. <br> &quot;He does love you, sweetheart.  It probably broke his heart he had to go so abruptly, with not so much as a goodbye kiss.  He probably would have preferred to stay, but when duty calls, one must answer.&quot; <br> Peacebyrd sighed. <br> &quot;I suppose you are right, but it still hurts.&quot;  she whispered painfully, touching the spot near her heart. <br> &quot;I know, love.  I know.&quot;  Lenore gathered her close again.   <br> &quot;Tell me more.  It will ease your heart to tell someone and make you remember the joys, although brief they were.&quot;

				&quot;Here, love.  Dry your eyes.&quot;  Lenore handed her a cloth and she dabbed at her tears. <br> &quot;Let me tell you a little about me and Choco.  Yes, while we have a love that is so deep, that the either of us would probably cease to live should the other die, we are not without our problems.  The biggest problem is my stubborness.  He is very protective of me, and while I love that he is, I am capable of taking care of myself.  And I admit my stubborness has gotten me into trouble with him on occasion.&quot; <br> Peacebyrd looked at Lenore, her head cocked to one side as if to say how? <br> &quot;How so?&quot;  she then asked, intrigued.  Lenore giggled and covered her face with a hand. <br> &quot;Oh, Karana.  Where to start.  It all boils back to my stubborness.  I can take care of myself, as I said, though he would probably argue otherwise.  He truly hates it when I put myself in unneccessary danger, and even wosre when I use myself as a target.&quot;  The elf looked puzzled. <br> &quot;Allow me to demonstrate.&quot;  Lenore stood up and walked around the area, as if looking for something, or someone.  Then, Lenore began to chant, and a strange hum filled the air.  Peacebyrd watched, horrified, as an angry swarm of insects surrounded Lenore, causing the dainty elf to buckle to her knees.  Not sure as to what she could do, all she could do was watch.  Then, the swarm departed as quickly as it came, and Lenore began to heal herself.  Peacebyrd healed as well. <br> &quot;By Tunare! Lenore! That was a most dangerous thing you did!&quot;  She could see how that would upset the handsome human. <br> &quot;I know, but sometimes, I need to test my spells upon myself, to see how effective they will be in battle.  If it does not damage sufficiently to my liking, it will be worthless in battle.&quot; <br> &quot;Perhaps so, but you could have died!&quot;  Lenore dismissed the concern. <br> &quot;I know when to call the swarm off.  I would not have died.  But, Choco did catch me doing this once, and well,&quot; here Lenore looked a little embarrassed. &quot;let's just say it was a little uncomfortable to sit for a few minutes.&quot; <br> Peacebyrd looked confused for about two seconds before it dawned on her. <br> &quot;You mean he..?&quot;  Lenore nodded and Peacebyrd began to giggle.  The mental picture she had of the tall human turning this dainty elf over his knees caused her to laugh. <br> &quot;Oh, please forgive me.  I do not mean to laugh, but,&quot; she tried to stifle the  giggles.  Lenore grinned. <br> &quot;It is alright.  It is humorous now.&quot; <br> &quot;Serves you right, doing that to yourself on purpose.  Good for him.&quot; <br> &quot;I know.  Except for today, I have not done that to myself in over a year.  I have a stronger incantation of a deadlier and more aggressive swarm I do not dare attempt to summon.  I fear these may not be as controlable so I will not test the damage on me.  I just hope he doesn't find out I did this today.  He has the unusal ability to sense my distress.&quot;  She looked around and looked relieved when Choco seemed not present. <br> The two women sat in a comfortable silence.  A wistful smile touched Peacebyrd's face. <br> &quot;Feeling better?&quot;  Lenore asked. <br> &quot;Yes.  Thank you for sharing that with me.  It helped break my somber mood.  I still miss my beloved, but at least this small amount of humor lifted the gloominess in my heart.&quot; <br> &quot;I am glad.  Choco often wonders how I manage to get myself into so much trouble.  Remind me to tell you about my capture and near execution by the Freeport Militia, if you truly want to hear it.&quot;

				&quot;M'Lady, I thnak you very much for what you have done for me. Since Warsong left me I have felt lost and alone. My sisters have been the only ones to break that feeling of lonliness, until now. For this you have my gratitude. I know we are not so different. Elves are elves after all, be they Half, High or Wood, we are all the same. But, aside from my sister Kerodru, and her sister Lyrae, you are the only one that has shown me such a kindness. If I can ever be of help to you, even tho i am young yet in my 26th cycle of Tunare, you need but ask. I concider you a friend in the highest regard. Again, Thank you.  <br>  <br> And now that I have blown hot air all over you, would you care to join me in a glass of cool well water? I'd ask you to join me in my private wine, but you have recently recovered from an illness.&quot; <br>  <br> Smiling warmly she hugs Lenore as she would her sisters. <br>  <br> {/OOC I've been sick and taking care of sick kids.

				~The young elf smiles a little. She seems to pull two glasses of fresh cool water seemingly from thin air and hands one to Lenore~ <br>  <br>      &quot;I suppose you think me childish for some of the things I said.&quot; Quickly Lenore tries to deny this but the tounger elf raises a hand to stop her. &quot;Do not try to deny this... I have been told many times by others that when I say I am &quot;past my maturity&quot;, But you must understand my meaning. When i say these things I only mean that I have reached my 20th cycle, or in this case am past it. The 20th cycle, I believe some people call it by another name, is a turning point in our lives. Or, at least, in mine. I was given this to be the time I can marry, or make my own decisions about where my life will lead me. It was my father that gave me this right. I have long since forgotten that others do not live this way. That, once they think themselves old enough to marry, or stay unmarried, then they are free to do this. I myself had to wait for such a long time. When Warsong asked me to become his bride, I was overjoyed as I have said.&quot; She pauses with a smile that quickly turns to a worried frown. <br>     <br>  <br>     &quot;As an elf, you know we live much longer than Humans, and his being gone worries me all the more. I do know in my heart that he is alive, but....&quot; she lets her thoughts wander and her statement unsaid.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> /OOC Greetings again my friends...I am back. The next few posts will be about.... well, I'm not going to say. I'm still writing but thought I'd give a tidbit to hold you for a little while longer. Hope everyone is well and happy. See you soon, Peace/Ess

				Lenore smiles. <br>  <br> &quot;Yes, I truly understand.  You are young, my guess is about 20 in human years.  I myself am around 45, though I am 110.  As to your maturity, yes, you are past a certain time in Tunare's service.  Childish? Nay.  A young woman in love, yes.  Tunare has wonderful plans for you.  I feel it.&quot; <br> At this, Lenore placed her hand over her heart. <br> &quot;Have courage, and prosper in Tunare's wisdom and love.  She surely protects Warsong, just as surely she protects you.  If Warsong were truly not among the living, believe me, you would know.  The heart does not lie.&quot;  She took a sip of the cool water and placed it at her feet.   <br> &quot;Have faith, my young friend.  Not just faith in Tunare, but faith in love.&quot; <br> Lenore looked at Peacebyrd.  So much like her own daughter, she thought. <br> &quot;You would like my daughter, Jolene.  You two are so much alike.  She is a little more outspoken and pretty much does as she pleases, and that's probably why Rallos chose her to fight in his name.&quot; <br> Lenore began to giggle, and Peacebyrd found it to be contagious. <br> &quot;I feel so badly for my husband.  He is surrounded by stubborn women, as Jolene surely gets it from me.&quot;
