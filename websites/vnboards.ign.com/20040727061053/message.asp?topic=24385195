				As many of you know DD has been camping Ragefire in Skyfire for awhile.  While camping there on thur/fri he poped.  I want to thank OG, WoF, KoE, and the rest of you guys that came to our aid.  Knowing that a couple of guys where accually camping the mob yourselves, but had honor not to steamroll over us.  I got the mob, only because Metanis was in bed and we could not get him up.  So we continued to stay there and camp rage from that point on. <br>  <br> On sun/mon it was a different story.  IX decided it was their mob, we where kiting the mob while our guild was calling people to get them up, because we had the whole guild on stand by and camped there incase he poped in the middle of the night.  IX ksed us and Metanis looted the mob.  Although I'm not in total agreement with what was done, I really don't blame him.  This has been the 2nd time he had been steamed rolled over and ksed by an &quot;uber&quot; guild. <br>  <br> You guys know that if the &quot;uber&quot; guilds would give smaller guilds a little time to get together, because we dont have the people to have a full force there in 10 min like you guys do this game would be much better for all of us.  Earlier Sunday afternoon we killed trunt the Monk mob in Nurga.  OTW to OT, myself and our monk ran over to see if Astal was up in loio and a monk from the companions was there.  He wasnt sure if he was going to kill the mob or not, because he was not sure if his guild was going to leave their camp.  OTW to OT he sends me a tell saying that they where not going to come, so as soon as we turned the piece in to the mob in OT, I had our guild in route to LoIO.  After I got there the monk informs me that his guild is OTW.  I gave them 30 min to get there and told my guild not to worry about the rest of them coming because I knew the companions would have the force to get there.  It was only right the guy had been sitting there for hours.   <br>  <br> As far as my conversation with Nylith to be honest you guys in IX, I had only just logged on when he did the /ooc and I really had no clue who had been there or what.  I know that I was there earlier with Regnad and had to leave.  I had no clue that there had been an emergancy patch and Nylith loged on to the game befor we did and he couldnt have been there long. That is why I told you to talk to Metanis.  I probably should have handled the situation myself, but do you really think we should have just left. I understand that he had been there for awhile, but so had Met and Reg.  Can you honestly say that you had been there since sunday and not seen them there.  I think not.  As a guild we had made a decision to stay in SF and camp rage till he poped so we &quot;would not&quot; get steamrolled. <br>  <br> In coversation with Cerano.  I was informed that DD is a newbie guild.  Dude grow up.  Just because we don't have 150 members and can't steamroll over small guilds does not mean we are newbies.  I had 3 characters over 50 while you where still 35.  I have 2 chars over 55 on Saryrn sever.  By far, I am not a newbie.  I have played this game since the first month it was out.  I have been to Sleepers, NToV, and VP.  I have killed every dragon in this game.  I came back to Veeshan because I missed all my real friends in this game and I choose to enjoy it not be ruled over by &quot;uber&quot; loots and &quot;uber&quot; places, which as a member of HnE on Saryrn I could do anything and go anywhere I wanted to go and my bard was in full ToV armor.  I accually had no intentions of reforming DD when I came to this server, but many of the original members wanted to have back the old times we use to have.  Although it has been a long and sometimes stressful process, I don't regret it for a minute.  DD has some of the finest people in this game and I am very proud of who and what we are.  Everyone makes mistakes especially in the Heat of the moment, but if you guys would sit back and think and realize that steamrolling over a smaller guilds is not HONOR you would understand why he looted that mob.  I know this will never happen and I know I'm going to flamed to hell and back for this post, but I wanted Veeshan to know who I was and how I felt.  <br>  <br> As leader of DD I speak for the guild that we DO NOT want any enemies, we are always willing to be there for anyone that needs us if we are not in a raid or involved at the moment.  And by no means would we ever steam roll a guild that had been sitting on a camp for hours upon hours.  I dont care how big we where.  Fair is fair and wrong is wrong, and in that situation there where 2 wrongs and you guys know it. <br>  <br> Algood

				Ixtlan, as a rule, tries to be as nice as possible in all encounters.  In fact, we helped Whisperes of Fate kill skyfire rage two weeks ago when they didn't have enough people.  Why was this time different?  Its because of the way I was treated when a group of Dark Dynasty came to the camp after I had been there since Sunday night.  Here is the log: <br>  <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:37 2002] You shout, 'Can someone from Dark Dynasty please give me a tell?' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:49 2002] Algood tells you, 'whats up' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:51 2002] Players on EverQuest: <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:51 2002] --------------------------- <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:51 2002] [58 Templar] Algood (Dark Elf) &lt;Dark Dynasty&gt; <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:51 2002] There is 1 player in Skyfire Mountains. <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:10:52 2002] Banelor tells you, 'hi' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:03 2002] You told Banelor, 'algood did first, just a min  ' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:06 2002] Ellia tells you, 'what's up?' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:10 2002] Banelor tells you, 'k' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:12 2002] You told Algood, 'just wondering why you guys are here, you camping rage?' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:16 2002] Algood tells you, 'yep' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:21 2002] You told Ellia, 'algood gave me a tell first, talking to him atm' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:11:54 2002] You told Algood, 'so have you not noticed that i've been here the whole time, before you even? or are you just not respecting the idea of claiming the camp' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:12:19 2002] Algood tells you, 'hmmm someone from our guild has been here since 5pm yesterday' <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:12:21 2002] You told Algood, 'cause i've been camping ragefire since sunday night, literally.

				&quot;And by no means would we ever steam roll a guild that had been sitting on a camp for hours upon hours&quot; - Algood <br>  <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:23:08 2002] Algood tells you, 'you know it is barbaric but so if we leave because you are claiming the camp who are we going to have to fight with next time?'  <br>  <br>  <br> As the log shows, that's exactly what you did. You steamrolled our cleric out of the Ragefire camp through pure intimidation. You did it because he was the only person there and was an easy target. You had no idea it would come back to bite you in the ass when our whole guild was there.  <br>  <br> You then tried to justify it: <br>  <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:26:35 2002] Algood tells you, 'how can you claim a dragon spawn'  <br>  <br> [Thu Feb 14 18:35:04 2002] Suzzi says, 'thing is ragefire isn't a camp'  <br>  <br> So going by your words alone, how can you call it a steamroll?  <br>  <br> Let me outline the facts of what happened. <br>  <br> Nylith goes to check on Ragefire, he sees it up so we all start porting there. We have 18 people there. Dark Dynasty sees us there, so they start kiting the mob to stall for time, shouting that Ragefire is theirs. Now I'm thinking to myself, Self, we could help them with this spawn, even though it'd be a bitch to camp again, or we could snag it before a yoro guild does, seeing as they only have 6 people here.  <br>  <br> Nylith then tells the guild that this was the very same guild that strongarmed him out of the camp after he clocked in 5 days RL time at the camp. I'm sorry but were it KoE, GoV, or any other respectable guild there we would have lent a hand and assisted with the kill. The fact that you bullied our cleric and then kited Ragefire when we showed up threw all chances at negotiation out the window. <br>  <br> We had to chase the Human form down that you were kiting, root him, and deal with 2 adds in the process. After we killed the human form and got xp, we killed the dragon form and got xp as well. While we were waiting for the corpes to free up so our cleric could loot, what happens? Your 59 cleric Metanis ninja-looted the corpse, an epic mob, because it wasn't fair in his opinion, and you all went along with it.  <br>  <br> Sorry pal that shit don't fly. Luckily GM Saiphos knows his shit, checked the logs, returned the piece to Nylith, and suspended your cleric for ninja-looting the day after. Why are you posting on flamevault now? Because a GM busted you and now you're reaping what you sow. Why didn't you post this originally when it happened? Because your cleric ninja-looted an epic piece and you thought you would get away with it. Go sell crazy somewhere else, we're all stocked up here.

				To start off im Banelor Barbwar 56 warrior of Dark Dynasty also a officer of said guild. <br> To start with yes we were camping Rage for 3 days and suzi a 50 druid in our guild was kiting rage,but our 55 monk Engleheart had first aggro also gm says rage not camp but ffa i agree but in the pnp policys its and i quote You may not steal kills. <br> Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission. <br>  <br> I say Pursuing is being pulled that mob is chaseing that player because it attack it <br> so if our druid and monk had aggro then its Dark Dynastys Mob not Ixitan`s but only reason gm ruled over this is dd are a small family guild not a big guild like ixitan and fires of heaven if they were foh then gm would not care its because we just a small guild and this sucks start flameing me. <br>

				First question is How long had the servers been up.  I dont know because when I was in the zone the night before only our guild was there.  When I was there that morning only our guild was there.  Servers went down and he beat us in the zone by how long?  When he did that /ooc and I gave him a tell I had just loged on and only been there for like 2 min.  The rest of the guild had been here for I'm not sure how long. If he would have stayed in the zone that day and you guys got rage that would have been fine, but he didn't he gated out.  We can't steam roll you guys. WTF!!!  If he had been here the whole time, I would not have my epic and prolly mon morn when he spawned Met would have his. All we were saying is we where not going to leave the SF till we got rage.  Wether it been fri morn or mon morn.  If you got him the first time and you where in the zone it would have been all good, but you left and went to ToV.  We had been here for 3 days, you would know that IF you had been here. We stayed at that camp beleive me if there was any way I could have got MQed my piece with Met, I would have been more than glad to do it.  Epic is a great thing, but honestly it didn't mean as much to me as it did him.  If we would have gotten his epic fri morn, we would not have been there mon morn.  I would have rather had him get it than go thru this.  The reason I say it is crazy is because I know for a fact we had been there for 3 days and you where trying to tell me we hadn't been.     <br>  <br> This will be my last post because I think this is all BS myself. And I didnt post because he got &quot;caught&quot; and suspended!  I posted because I wanted to let everyone know my side and where I stood on this issue.  I had officers there that responded to Rekaar's request to send him a tell.  I was not on, but my understanding is he did not reply back.  <br>  <br> Algood

It's not like there hasn't been a precidence set in cases like this. Learn from others mistakes you dumb fucks. Ninja of epic parts = bad.

				I find this very funny. I find it funny because had you guys been nice like you want everyone to be to you your cleric would probably have gotton his epic.  <br>  <br> I say this because had you played nice with Nyl we would have probably helped you kill rage. You guys were the ones who decided how this would be handled. <br>  <br> Honestly tell me what kind of gimp tactic is it to kite rage around with 3 or 4 so another force can't have him while you take as long as you need for people to show up. Hell had you even gave one of us a tell and asked us to wait 10 min for your people to show up you would have gotton it. No you decided to take his ass on a tour of SF when you saw us in force. That in it self was dumb as shit.  <br>  <br> Next time you want someone to extend you any type of courtesy extend it to others you will get alot further in Life and in Game.

				RF is always going to bring these conflicts out, people need to deal with it and understand it can bring out the worst in everyone.  VI stated the rules of RF pretty clear, so if yer gonna do cleric epic, you need to understand what could and most likely will happen...and stop bitching. Of all flame threads RF must occur the most by far, and its getting really, really old.

That is saying look i dont have the capability to do this mob right now but im going to run him around for twelve hours till i can get enough people here. I dont think thats what verant had in mind for this mob either....

				Hmmm you left out a few things about this encounter? <br>  <br> Nylith you were not camping this spawn you were bound there popping in and out. <br>  <br> Thu Feb 14 18:55:09 2002] [60 High Priest] Nylith (High Elf) &lt;Ixtlan&gt; ZONE: cobaltscar <br>  <br> [Thu Feb 14 19:04:15 2002] [60 High Priest] Nylith (High Elf) &lt;Ixtlan&gt; ZONE: templeveeshan <br>  <br>  <br> So dont go telling ppl you have been sitting there for days that a bunch of shit. <br>  <br> Its amazing thar Ixtlan is hiding behind the PnP policy, becuase thats what you did here, You know we had aggro first and if you say different your full of shit.You are saying that you had the force well sorry guys I was there and when Rage went down you had no tanks left or Clerics. If our tanks,Druids or Wizzies were not engaged you would of lost the fight. <br>  <br> A couple of perecedents has been set here: <br>  <br> 1. Rage is not a camp &quot;Look at Nyliths log&quot; <br>  <br> 2. Kiting is not engagement on any mob, Poor Druids in CS they can now have there mobs picked off one by one and there isint a Damn thing the GMS can do. <br>  <br>  <br> So if your in a nice camp getting Exp and another group sits there ass down and says they want to alternate spawns by order of the PnP well guess what guys they can do it. <br>  <br> If your a Druid kiting Raptors and some enchanter Memblurs your mob and nukes it and Ks's ya well guess what they can do it. <br>
