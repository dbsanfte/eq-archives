				I feel that I must make this post to warn those that plan to join the guild Majesty. People should have a right to know that the guildleader is a racist idiot. <br>  <br> Where should I start........Well Hocog had asked for my phone number in game a few weeks ago. He wanted to ask me would my guild consider allying with his guild. We talked for awhile, and we agreed. Well one thing he wanted me to agree to was that we would not invite people that left one of our respective guilds for the other. I agreed to that and up until a yesterday that policy was kept. <br>  <br> Poetic a bard in my guild used us for SS armor, Vindi bp ect...Which this is common, and you learn to except that some people are low lifes, and are going to take advantage when they can. However since we had a agreement with one another I figured I would talk to Hocog to see why he broke that by inviting Poetic 1hour after he left Awaken. <br>  <br> Well I spoke with Casmik, then he tells me that it doesn't matter what agreement each guild had they were taking him in. So then Hocog sends me a tell saying that I am trying to cause problems, and I can post this on the server boards, and he doesn't care because he isn't a nigger like me. <br>  <br> Well I was pretty upset because I happen to be african-american, and I can be called racial slurs in RL, I don't need them called to me in Everquest.  Anyway just wanted people to know that the leader of Majesty is a racist, he was reported, and I spoke to a GM and hopefully they will take the appropriate action.......... <br>  <br> Moving on though since Hocog/Tegdias took this to a way personal level I guess I will too. <br>  <br> Tegdias was the leader of Majesty and his Real Life wife Duggen both played. Well his wife fell in love with a paladin in Valon, and they ran off together in real life. That is why Tegdias left the game, and never logged back on again because he was embarrassed that some uber Valon paladin was between the sheets with his wife. Sucks to be him that some person in a game could cyber so good that his wife would run 5 states away for a real life taste test. Anyway during that time he stole the entire guild bank of Majesty.  <br>  <br> Then he, and his wife tried to get back together but the Valon member that his wife had the affair with wouldn't leave him alone. So he changed his name to Hocog so that most people that were in old Majesty wouldn't know that he was the old Tegdias that stole their guildfund, and so that this Valon member wouldnt find him. Well his wife Duggen made a new character called Beatles and is a member of majesty now, and also did so to hide from her Valon lover who is still currently in Valon I am told. <br>  <br> Anyway It probably was a bit low that I posted this but then again calling people racial slurs isn't ok, and I am sick of people thinking they can say whatever they want and get away with it. <br>  <br> Hocog told his guild that he called me a nigger so that people would stop disbanding. I just wanted people to know what they were getting theirselves into when they decide to app to Majesty............... <br>  <br> Thanks  <br>  <br> Wezloc <br> 65 Arch Convoker <br> Guild Leader of Awaken

				Well here we go around the mulberry bush. <br>  <br> I knew of the so called alliance that was asked for with Awaken, Myself I wasnt to happy about it for not even 2 months before I was tagged with a guild I started with and was approached by Awaken to join them, I was sent a tell for 2 weeks straight by the same 2 people. I wouldnt join them because I had seen that had 2 people in the guild who had once KSed me,made threats and several other slurs towards me.  <br>  <br> As far as this Poetic goes, I personally do not know him or of any other conversation that took place except for Poetic asked if it was ok to come back and was told yes. We held to the part of not inviting any of your people to the guild til we noticed over the past week or so you had started to do it yourself. Poetic joined tonight and the next thing we know you have some of our members in your guild. You spammed me with tells and I asked you told hold on so I could find out what happened and yet you kept sending tell after tell. Then once you didnt get any response from me you proceeded to spam every guild member we had with tells, then threaten to come to the boards if we didnt guildremove Poetic and we had one hour to do so.All this started before you even spoke to Hocog/Teg, subject could have been left at the fact one of your members left your guild. But you decided to take it further by harrassing everyone in Majesty.Then after you start pushing all the right buttons you got into a conversation with Hocog/Teg it got to be a heated conversation and he blew up at you and called you a name.(Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me!) Obviosly if one of your members left your guild they werent happy, but instead of dealing with this in tells with Poetic you decided to get nasty. A grown up would just know when to quit when they were ahead but yet you had to keep going on and on making threats and saying &quot;ITS ON&quot;. i dont have a problem with you and most of your members, but I think your mixing things up a bit, this is a game, not a democracy,not a competition,not a picket line. The command /ignore is there for a reason and that is where you were with Hocog but instead of just dealing with that you had to go and spam the hell out of everyone til you got a rise out of him. As a leader he is there for us and to help us when we need it,as far as his past goes that is exactly what it is PAST done and over with, time for a new beginning.You dont need to bring his personal life into the picture, you werent there when any of it happened so all you know is what you were told.  <br> I think that everyone at one time or another has blown up and said things they dont mean and I believe this may have been one of them. I dont agree or disagree with what was said, but im not going to hold it against him. <br>  <br> Wezloc you need to take a step back from the computer and realize its a game not RL, you have all these commands at your disposal /ignore /ooc they all mean something other then just a text with a different color. <br>  <br> Running from zone to zone telling everyone to read this post is childish behavior. <br>  <br> This is all my opinion if you dont like it im sorry, its not here to hurt anyone or start anymore trouble then what has been started. Just wanted to post my side of it all. Thanks and please dont send me any tells in game unless its for a group =P (I am NOT a racist, I have friends of all races,creeds,colors etc....just want that to be clear.)   <br>

				Casmik your entire post is filled with nothing but lies. As you told me earlier you support Hocog in whatever he does. You even say in your post that you do not agree or DISAGREE with what he said. I have a screenshot of what he said. If anyone on terris thule would like to see it email me at wezloc@awakenguild.net, and i will be more then happy to send you a copy. <br>  <br> The fact that you can say that you do not disagree with your guildleader calling anyone a nigger says alot about you. We had not invited any majesty members until today after your guildleader showed his true racist colors. I can not push buttons for someone to call me a nigger. Sorry you idiot it doesn't work that way. Hopefully the members of your guild are nothing like the people that lead it. If they are i feel sorry for all of you.  <br>  <br> I also noticed that you did not say anything that i said wasn't true, just that i should get over your guildleader calling me a nigger. Sorry I do not take that kinda crap from people in RL not about to start taking it from losers in game. These boards are here so that people know what is happening on there respect servers. If someone ninja loots it is totally appropriate to post, and let others know about it so they can stay clear of these people. <br>  <br> I am letting everyone know that your guild leader is a racist, and a thief.  I think the minorities that could possibly be thinking about joining your guild have a right to know that. You are the one that needs to take a step back from the PC. I can not provoke anyone to call me a racial slur. It isn't possible. <br>  <br> Wezloc

				Exactly /yawn <br>  <br> Cas, you guys should have some sort of procedure like DM does, now you know why it takes a month to get in DM, appreciate why we have low turn over and members that are genuine players not player haters. When you applied you couldn't deal with the way it was handled, but now you know why.  Tagging without a trial period is just asking for a shitload of trouble. <br>  <br> Wezloc if anyone called me a racial slur in game I'd be writing verant every day until they were removed from the game.  Good luck on your crusade, hope you got the the log to back it up.  You'd think this game was full of backwoods-hill-billies the way some people just say shit.

				Well it's wonderful you would like to bring this to the boards. Yes i said to you your the one actling like a nigger. Everyone thinks nigger means black people. Nigger means ignorant lazy person and thats exactly how i feel about you. Poetic was in Majesty before the break up as Kyndill. If majesty had not broke up then i am sure he would be with us today so i get a tell from poetic saying hi i did not know your was tegidas welcome back and i would like to return to majesty. I am taking every old Majesty member back that wants to return who would not? Wezloc you continued to tell me lies about my friend Rastline and lies to him. You continued to cause problems because your jealous. I put you on ignore i petitioned you for harassment. Then you proceeded to /tell majesty members you just would not leave people alone then you treatened me and or guild. So i finally had enough and yes i said exactly what you said i did. I am not racist but people like you sometimes make me wish i was. I been playing eq since september of 1999 and there has never been a problem i have had with anyone like you until now. All we want at majesty is for you to leave us alone stop /telling us we don't care what you have to say. <br>  <br> About the guild bank the truth is i did stop playing people did not have access to it. I came back to eq and have the full bank and it is being used now for the guild everyone in the guild knows this but it's the ignorant people like you who say things they don't know what there talking about. <br>  <br> And the uber paladin thing from valon how crazy can you be. Me and my wife took some time apart Daedellus from valon a rl friend of both me and my wife came to visit us both while passing through. She never went 5 states away to see someone in eq. Daedellus can surely tell anyone and i am sure the valon people would be happy to tell you or anyone else this is a lie your making up. I hope the paladins in valon read this post and laugh. <br>  <br> Wezloc this is a public warning to you i have spoken with the manager of customer service today of verant over the phone he is aware of the problem he does know i called you a name. He does know all we want is for you   to leave us alone majesty people will /report you for tells they recieve from you if you want to recruit my memebers then if they leave they will come to your website everyone in my guild knows what i did and why i did it. Let this go i don't wish to keep either of us from enjoying eq and i don't wish to see your account banned for harassment. <br>  <br> Hocog Ravencurse <br> Leader of Majesty

				Hocog <br>  <br> You are not only a racist but a liar too. I have not harrassed anyone in majesty, and I sent a tell to Ducad, and Casmik because they are leaders in your guild. I also sent a tell to Vadyr because I thought he was a officer. Other then that who else have I sent tells too? Yup no one else so when you continue to lie saying that I spammed tells to people in majesty ect it makes you look even worse. <br>  <br> Second of all I did petition you and /reported the text.  If I harrassed anyone in your guild please have them /report the text of what i said. I didn't swear, insult or call names to anyone, because part of being a mature adult is knowing how to speak with someone without using racial slurs, and 4 letter words. <br>  <br> If everything is on the up and up with you then why did you change your name TEGDIAS. Why did no one in Majesty other then a few officers know that your wife was beatles and use to be Duggen. <br>  <br> You are a liar, and a racist. You lie to people and do shaddy things. I am going to be repetitioning today because I have already spoken with several guides, and a GM. Calling people racial slurs in game is not ok, and I will not tolerate it and hopefully SoE will not as well. Also fyi Verant is no more, and hasn't been around for awhile. Just you should check your infomation because you go to public boards to start lying, about who you talked to, someone might just call you on it. Just some advice........... <br>  <br> Wezloc

				A nigger is a lazy, ignorant person.  Niggers come in all shapes, sizes, and colors.  My husband pegged you right.  Obviously what you have posted here is completely ignorant and misinformed.  And lazy?  How about suggesting us raiding together to kill a mob, only so you and your guild could take the spot we were fighting at?  Sounds pretty lazy to me.  I don't see how your guild kills anything because it seems you spend all your in game time typing to Majesty members and others trying to stir shit up.  You told my husband lies about Rastline and told lies to Rastline, I guess in hopes to get them mad at each other?  or maybe it was to split up the guild.  Poetic was in the guild before with his wizard and all old Majesty members are welcome home.  Threatening us to either /guildremove Poetic on the spot and respond to you within one hour is unacceptable.  We stand behind our members.  Some might like the drama that goes on with you saying stuff in /guildchat and /telling people constantly and /oocing.  We have never badmouthed you in /guildchat or anywhere and I do not appreciate you coming here and stating such made up bullshit.  If anyone in Awaken is tired of your guildleaders anctics, feel free to check into us.  Anyone out there that is looking into Majesty, I hope this does not discourage you.  We have never kicked anyone solely because they didn't agree with the leaders/officers.  We hate to lose anyone under any circumstances.  And we do have an app period and a trial period just fyi for that other misinformed person that posted.  Also, I did not just create this character.  You can look on the EQ website to see what my name used to be.  I created this cleric in 2000 and didn't really like the name.  Tegdias was a computer generated name and he never liked it either.  That name change is also posted on the EQ website.  We never tried to hide who we are.  Always remember there are at least two sides to every story.  God bless you Wezloc. <br>  <br> Beatles Ravencurse <br> 54 Vicar of Tunare <br> Queen of Hocog's heart <br> Proud Guild Leader of Majesty

				Wezloc, I have my facts straight.  I am getting tired of posting here.  I have better things to do.  Feel free to call (858) 577-3100 and ask for Gary Mathews, Customer Service Manager.  If I am such a liar, would I not deny calling you a nigger?  I chose to change my name because I wanted a new one.  Don't you realize that with me being a guildleader that no matter what name I carry over my head, that everyone would know who I am?  Wezloc, think about it.  How many guilds have you been kicked out of?  How many guilds have denied your application?  That has never happened to me Wezloc.  Until now, I have never had such a problem, until I ran into you.

				That word is just as revolting out of the context and even in context it's revolting. Its dictionary use went out of style back 200 years ago and it's current use is descriptive toward a particular race when you use it.  Why not just call him a &quot;lazy fucking pile of shit liar&quot; and describe him like you would any person, why cause you knew his race and you pulled the most ingnorant and insulting word in the dictionary to play the &quot;big white man&quot; card?  Sorry but that's fucked up man!  Not defending anyone here, just think if you are going to call someone a &quot;nigger&quot; you better be ready to take the heat and you better be ready to tell verant why you did so and why you said it to someone who is black.

				I have admitted to verant what i called him and explained to them why i did it. I am told were are not about to ban or suspend a account because someone once in three years blew up and called someone a bad name. I can take the heat from Wezloc i don't ask to be defended but i do warn everyone stay away from wezloc or you are sure to be burned. He will always remain on my ignore list and i encourage everyone to do the same. As time go along people will see what happens majesty is here to stay have fun were not going anywhere. I don't know where awaken will go there is some nice people there and i wish them the best. Agian as i said in my first post i wish for Wezloc to just grow up and leave people alone i would never have sent him any tell if he had not treatened casmik. He was on my ignore for 2 weeks prior to this and is on it agian where he will remain. Many other guilds in this game have dealt with me anyone wonder why this is the first person to try something like this? Well it's because Wezloc is the only person ever to not stop harassing someone i think in all of three years i have put about 5 people on ignore and the others were just people who wanted to beg for armor etc. So is something not wrong with this picture? <br> Hocog  <br> Leader of Majesty

				I did call the customer service rep at SoE.  We had a very long conversation, and while I was speaking to him he started checking logs ect...Did you know that they can check to see who you have sent tells to and reports ect...over the phone? <br>  <br> Well he checked, and the only report that he saw was the one with you calling me a racial slur. He had no /reports on me what so ever. You lied to him saying i harrassed your wife but as was found out i have never sent a tell to your wife in the 3 years that i have been playing. <br>  <br> Secondly, As i said i only sent tells to officers of your guild, and one member that i thought was a officer. A total of 3 people. <br>  <br> Either way I was informed that your account was warned, and that if it happens again you will most likely be banned. That along with the fact that everyone on the server now knows who you are, how you ripped off the first Majesty, and how you are a racist idiot is enough for me.  <br>  <br> The fact that your account was warned, and that everyone Terris Thule knows you are a racist is enough punishment for even you.  Just in the future becareful what you say to people. I am never going to tolerate people speaking to me that way EVER. People think that i am whining because of what you said so be it. I really don't care but if something like that was said to there son, or daughter in a online Video Game i am sure they would feel very different.  I just hope that the people in Majesty realize what kinda person you are, and leave as many did yesterday. <br>  <br> Thanks <br>  <br> Wezloc

				Wezloc I don't know you, don't care to know you, but if you actually believe that story you say about Hocog and duggen, then you need a clue worse than I think.  This is my 1st and probably last post on this board, hell I don't even read it til someone posted the link out our site, I have better things to do. <br>  <br> Where to start.  Um for the uneducated, Kyndil is a man of more alts than me.  He was in Majesty with one at least 2 of his characters.  Poetic is his 3rd that I know of and I have talked with him for since luclin came out if not before.  Beatles has been around for quite a while too, before the guild break up, probably when the guild was formed or before.  I have known Teg and Duggen since we were in Dark Omen when the server opened.  The only interaction with Valon and them was me.  I visited while on my way across country to check out the place I was going to be renting after I left the militay.  If you consider getting a meal watching some tv with her folks while waiting for her to get off work bad, you are sad.  Teg and I watched some movie, forgot what, that night too, so was no big clandestine thing.  The bank accounts were never stolen, just unaccessable.  I can verify this since I saw the accounts over new years when I was defragging their slow ass PCs. <br>  <br> It is sad when the ignorant open their mouths and show themselves for what they are.

The fact that you are &quot;friends&quot; with someone this brain dead says alot about yourself.   <br>  <br> Why is it his officers were telling people that Tegdias stole the guildfund, and that he would never be allowed back in? Why is it if him changing his name was so not a big deal that he decided to hide it from most of the people in his guild, and the server? Do you really believe that he and his wife changed there names at the same time for no reason other then they didn't like the names? LOL, and then you come to the server board, and call me ignorant? <br>  <br>  <br> Wezloc

				Ok Wezloc, thats fine everyone who disagrees with you is a liar. Last time im posting last time im wasting my time with you. You would rather drag this on and keep things going this way then do it on your own, Im done adding fuel to the fire. I posted what I knew and what I heard I could care less what did or didnt happen ,I would rather spend my time enjoying the game which comes out of my pocket every month and do what I want. Then bicker with you over your hurt feelings, I dont know and dont want to know you.  <br> As far as app process goes www.majestyguild.org <br> Its posted there. Dont go posting alot of trash on the boards or will be deleted. Wezlocs intial is there for people to read however.(Mommy he called me a name: Its ok honey, sticks and stones may break your bones but names will never hurt you! )

				I don't suport racist people, but i do not think there is anyone alive today that has not been pushed to a point of blowing up and saying something. Telling someone there actling like a nigger and calling them one is 2 different things. Yes Wezloc please name the people who told you this or are you afraid that if you do they would come here and call you a liar? Was i lying about calling customer service? Did i not admit to them what i said to you? Reason i never reported you is simple i put you on ignore 2 weeks ago. Then you decided to push my officer and my members in tells you could'nt let it go that i did not wish to talk to you.Then your the victim here hell your no martin luther king nor no malcum x. I am not kkk member or anyting like that i have many black friends in rl. Never has anyone before ever pushed me to the point of saying what i did to you rl or in game. You pissed me off and got a earfull now your eating this up i guess maybe you don't work or something since your in eq all the time so you must have alot of time on your hands i just hope its not the working people paying your bills while you sit on your ass and cause problems no matter what color you are. And you can't name one person i have told i was not tegdias even the first time i met you i told you i was tegdias. Hell everyone knows cause i told them. Agian as far as the guild bank goes you have no idea what your talking about. As far as my rl and my wife goes you have no idea what your talking about. And as far as i go posting something public on the internet or in papers about someone you best have proof infact its illegal. See there is a difference well actually you might could file a claim and sue me for the mental stress i caused you i don't mind. On the other hand posting openly about my wife when it's not true is a good way for me to sue you but i guess you never thought of that. And if this continues i will. I do know your name your address age everything about you being in the line of work i am in thats not hard to find. You see when you gave me your number i checked it out. Do you want that posted here? You see it's public record so anyone can have access to it really. Anyway just let it go is all i ask leave me and my guild alone. Go play eq have fun do your own thing, because i am getting very tired of this crap from you.
