				Hello there, <br>  <br> As the subject header says, we are a roleplaying dark only guild on the Tallon Zek server and we are looking for recruits. <br>  <br> Go to <a class=BoardRowBLink target="_blank" href=" http://pub48.ezboard.com/bforgottenloretallonzek"> http://pub48.ezboard.com/bforgottenloretallonzek</a>  for more details and an idea of what we are about. <br>  <br> What follows is the guild charter: <br>  <br> Nightshade Assassins charter. <br>  <br> Welcome to the Nightshade assassins charter. As of this date (3rd of August 2001) you may know that we have been through a lot of turmoil over the last few months.  I am hoping that some new blood and the continued efforts of those who remain will mean that we will rise like a phoenix.  Changed for sure, but hopefully better.   <br> What follows is the structure that all must agree to.  It is an attempt at an identity which will create a role-playing community to be proud of, a meeting of like minds, an escape from reality and ultimately enjoyment! <br>  <br> Any enquiries should be made to me (Matron Yvonnel) at zoemercer@aol.com <br>  <br> Genre: <br> We are a dark team only guild on Tallon Zek.  We base ourselves loosely on the R.A Salvatore Drowe books.  We are not a noble house tied by blood.  We are more like the mercenary band, Bregan D&#8217;arthe.    A group of individuals, tied by their desire to raise their &#8216;station&#8217; (please read station post in required reading).  The Nightshade Assassins is a haven for those who have found themselves unable to improve said &#8216;station&#8217;.  In the same way that Bregan D&#8217;arthe was a haven for nobles and rogues who were unable to continue because of various reasons. (house eliminated etc) <br> However, it is run as a matriarchy.  This means that females hold positions of power.  That is not to say that males cannot gain power, just that the female form is seen as being inherently more privileged.  As such, all females must be treated with respect.  They have the title of Jabress.  Males can and are powerful players in this genre, a seasoned and trusted male member will not be disregarded on the say so of a fresh new Jabress for example.  Also, that is not to say that males cannot win over females, but like women in our real life history, they will have to be subtle.  That is the challenge of playing a Nightshade Assassin male. <br> The current leader of Nightshade Assassins is a staunch follower of Lloth.  Lloth is the lost daughter of Innoruk.  However, this does not mean that every member has to be also.  In the subtle world of Tier&#8217;dal, as long as you should at least &#8216;appear&#8217; to pay lip service to the religious aspect of the Nightshade Assassins, especially while the matron is around.  That is unless you want the conflict!  What your character actually believes is entirely up to you.  Consider the Sikh dedication to the monarch of England in spite of the fact that she is the head of the Church of England or Zaknafein&#8217;s dedication to Matron Malice if you prefer.  You, of course have the option of being a Lloth worshipper too J  Equally acceptable is being a worshipper of Innoruk.   It is considered within the guild that worship of one honours the other.  At this current time and for the foreseeable future, they are considered different denominations of the same faith.  <br>  <br> PVP. <br> Hoorah for PVP, that&#8217;s what I say.  It adds an element that is missing on carebear servers! (Never will I return!)  However we have some rules of conduct that you must agree to abide by. <br> a)	No crossteaming below 46.  That is, I see no need for crossteaming until planes raids and even then it is discouraged where-ever possible.  Even trading with non-dark team is discouraged and if it happens it should be done in secret but mind your reputation.  (What the eye doesn&#8217;t see the heart doesn&#8217;t grieve for) Should the Matron hear of violations in this area, you can be certain that you will cross words with her. <br> b)	We real life players behind the evil, dishonourable dark races are good people.  We will honour the following rules as a guild because it shows our integrity.  For example:  Loot and Scoot.  We as a guild will all loot and scoot should we be killed in a pvp situation.  It does not matter if you were 8 levels below, or just after killing a mob, or outnumbered 10:1.  We will always loot and scoot!  No moaning, ifs or buts, loot and scoot no complaints.  If you are desperate to stay in the zone, you may politely request of your killer permission to stay.  They refuse, well that&#8217;s tough then.  You will loot and scoot!  (get the gist :P) Immortal healing:  This issue has been up for debate for some time with varying opinions.  THIS is the standard to which we will adhere;  Immortal healing is, according to Verant, not against the rules.  Having played a cleric for time, I know that it is impossible to check if all your opponents are in range before you get the heal off!  Another point is that since lights do it, should we penalise ourselves?  Does it improve our reputation enough to be worth the sacrifice?  Also, it makes no role-play sense that an experienced shammie or cleric for example would not aid his brethren because he could not hit the opponents himself!  However, (I say that a lot don&#8217;t I!)  it is not encouraged.  Lets try and do our pvp on equal terms as much as possible.		      Corpse-camping, bind rushing, back and forth zoning and zone camping:  All of these are not allowed.  There is only one exception in the form of the &#8216;aggro player.&#8217;  You must attempt in every instance to use ooc tells to explain that this sort of behaviour is unfriendly.  Point out what they are doing wrong.  Maybe they don&#8217;t realise! (Blushes at the memory of bind rushing in the first few weeks of pvp server, not realising that it was bad form)  First ask the opinions of those around you or on guildsay.  Get another opinion, it is easy to get absorbed with our own issues.  You should firmly request that they cease all anti-social behaviour.  Possibly escort them to the zone if you are able.  Maybe try to get a role-play dialogue going on.  (Show them what they are missing.)  Leave the area if it is not too inconvenient and they are affecting only you?  But in the end, if you have to hit the naked elf at his bind point because he refuses to scoot and is memming his spells to get off a snare, then so be it.  Another case of discouraged rather than prohibited. <br> c)	Duels:  We are dark race and as such are not bound by light codes of honour (unless you want that as part of your character, it&#8217;s up to you)  If a red Gnome offers you out for a duel, feel free to laugh at him!  My tip is to wait until they are on low life after a tough mob, quickly accept and then HT, booms your gnome!  But be ready to run if he resists)))  Also, if a green human is loud, obnoxious and in your face challenges you, feel free to slaughter him.  We are dark races after all!  Dueling other dark races is discouraged rather than prohibited.  We have enough trouble with the other three teams without starting on ourselves.   <br> d)	Trash talk:  This is prohibited.  Keep your insults imaginative and in character.  My favourite at the moment when confronted with hairy barbarians is; &#8216;I like your beard&#8230;.shame it doesn&#8217;t cover the whole of your face.&#8217; <br>  <br> Role-playing <br> Unfortunately for us, a lot of the Everquest population does not realise that it is actually a role-play game.  Thankfully, I feel that on the zek servers, there is in general, more role-play orientated behaviour.  But you should bear in mind that some people do not understand the concept.  For example; <br>  <br> Brittneyspeers the light elf n00b warrior says &#8220;Cor, you look wicked mate, you must have loads of plat, lend us 10 gold will ya&#8221; <br> You do not scream &#8220;Get stuffed Noob, earn your own cash or buy it on e-bay, I don&#8217;t care go away&#8221;  rather you should; <br> &#8220;Foul light kin, ask your own forefathers for their tainted cash. Ooc Sorry dude, I don&#8217;t have any to give you at the moment&#8221; <br>  <br> It&#8217;s a shame that we have to explain ourselves but that&#8217;s the unreality (!) we live in.  On a positive note, it has introduced many people to the art of role-play.  Consider it your civic dutyJ <br> Shouts, normal speech and guildchat should always be in role.  Groupchat, it is up to the individual.  We don&#8217;t need the hassle of trying to translate the Ogres and trolls saying; &#8216;help I&#8217;ve got 4 extra mobs on my tail! Save me!&#8217; as by the time you have worked it out, they are dead and the mob has turned on you.  Ooc speaks for itself, but please do not use prejudiced language or the like. <br>  <br> Remember the reputation of the guild. <br>  <br>  <br> By the fact that you are reading this, I know that you have found the chatboards.  This is where our downtime role-play goes on.  You can do things here that simply are not possible in game.  It is also where you will get to know your fellow guildmates better, especially if they are from another time zone and you don&#8217;t get to play with them unless you do a mega late eq bender!  This is a vital part of the Nightshade Assassins, but again here comes some guidelines that come from being a gm for many years. <br> a)	You are welcome to get involved whereever there is an appropriate opening.  Also all are welcome to start their own thread.  However, (there&#8217;s that word again, someone get me a thesaurus) you must not change or portray another in an uncharacteristic way without their permission.  I recommend e-mailing them with suggestions and going through a sort of drafting process to check that all are fine with the way things are going. <br> b)	Make sure you have flaws.  Perfect characters are dull dull dull. And dull. Those that are good at everything are not realistic, especially in our genre.  If you were perfect, why would you be with the Nightshade Assassins?  We all have skeletons in our cupboards.  The fun is finding them out over time. <br> c)	Take your time and start small.  Don&#8217;t write a post that saves the manor as you walk in the door! <br> d)	Be descriptive.  You will see some fine writing with various styles on these boards.  But try to add colour.  I&#8217;m not gonna lecture you on good descriptive writing.  Read some of the examples on this site.  They can teach you better than I ever could. <br> e)	Do not compromise yourself or others characters unless you want to face the consequences.  What I mean by this is, you write that you punch the matron in the face and spit on her as she lies on the floor bleeding.  You could not be expected to be welcome back without some very harsh consequences.  In extreme circumstances I am willing to cast out those who behave in an inappropriate manner (untag them for a fixed period of time).  On the other hand, if you in a post mention to a trusted friend that you had a lovely daydream where you did the exact same thing, then there would be no come back.  Unless of course, your friend turns out not to be so trusted and dobs you in!  Such is the way of drowe society. <br> f)	Be warned that some of the themes on our boards are adult in nature. If you are easily offended, I do not recommend that you join.  Also you should  be over 18 but I am not going to ask for your driving licence! <br>  <br> Application advice and information for new members. <br> To apply for membership you should go to the &#8216;Applications for membership&#8217; section and leave the following details. <br>  <br> E-mail address: 	(if you prefer you can mail it to me direct at the address above) <br>  <br> Name of character: <br>  <br> Sponsored by: 	(Name of Nightshade Assassin who is willing to recommend you.  The implications of this should not be underestimated by the sponsor.  Your reputation is on the line regarding the potential recruit.  It is not compulsory to have a sponsor, but your application is more likely to be accepted with one.) <br>  <br> Race: <br>  <br> Class: <br>  <br> Gender: <br>  <br> Current Level. <br>  <br> Trade Skill: <br>  <br> Biography:	(We are selective about who gets in, not out of any desire to be elitist but in recognition of the impact of bad role-players on others.  We aim to be an exemplar of the role-play on Everquest.  You don&#8217;t need to be the perfect role-player, just willing to learn and open to ideas.  As the Nightshade Assassins is primarily a role-play guild it is this that will in the main determine whether your application is successful.  Don&#8217;t make it too brief or set out your character in stone is the best advice I can ive.  Best of luck.) <br>  <br> Have you read the charter?: <br>  <br> Once your application has been assessed you will be notified of the decision in game by myself or another officer.  Should you be successful you will be on a one month trial where your actions will be closely monitored and not able to act as a sponsor for another applicant.  The trial is for both parties (the applicant and the Nightshade Assassins) to be able to decide whether we are right for each other. <br>  <br> Phew, I think that is it.  All I have to say now is, thankyou for listening, good luck with your application (should you wish to do that.) and above all, Have Fun! <br>  <br> I look forward to hearing from you. <br>  <br> Ilharess Yvonnel Aka Zoe Mercer. <br> Matron of the Nightshade Assassins. <br>
