				&quot;Go.  This place is more dangerous than before,&quot; Kristinae told the girl. <br>  <br> Se looked around worriedly.  There was nothing aorund, not even the guards.  &quot;I'm not seeing anyone.&quot; <br>  <br> Kristinae slowly drew Harmony.  &quot;It's a shadow dancer.  They strike so fast that mortals don't even know what killed them.  If you don't leave now, you may just be another victim, and I've put too much at risk to let that happen!&quot;  she was nearly shouting as she came to the end.  Her features were Teir'Dal, but she was visibly pale and her hands were shaking. <br>  <br> The girl looked towards the entrance, and back at her saviour, then back again.  Kristinae looked directly at her, her patience waning.  &quot;Go to Freeport.  There's a ship called the Satyrica docked that leaves tomorrow.  Go on it, and they will take care of you.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;But...I can't leave you here.  You're all that I have left,&quot; it was almost a wail that came from her. <br>  <br> Kristinae turned the blade on the girl, coming down on her swiftly, stopping right at her neck.  &quot;Go, or I will kill you myself!  Believe me, I'll be doing you a favor compared to what this thing can do.&quot; <br>  <br> She turned and ran.  Kristinae wished she didn't have to be so hard, but it was necessary.  She closed her eyes, sending out her mind to probe for the assassin. <br>  <br> --- <br>  <br> Catallina and Kristinae's swords locked together, and immediately they pushed off each other, Kristinae stumbling to the ground.  Catallina, who managed to maintain her balance, took the opportunity to come down on her sister.  Kristinae tumbled out of the way, her sister's sword missing her head by less than an inch.  Kristinae immediately came up and her sword was hovering right over her sister's neck. <br>  <br> &quot;Gotcha again,&quot; Kristinae grinned. <br>  <br> &quot;No fair!&quot; Catallina shouted.  &quot;You cheated!&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Did not!&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Did too!&quot; <br>  <br> By the time the argument between the two girls came to its climax, they were both on the ground wrestling each other.  Kristinae was on the ground looking up, struggling against her sister, and almost losing the fight when she could hear footsteps close in on them.  &quot;Cat! Get up!  Someone's coming!&quot; <br>  <br> Catallina grunted.  &quot;You're just saying that 'cuz you're losing.&quot; <br>  <br> Kristinae replied hurridly, &quot;No! I'm not kidding!&quot;  Kristinae immediately lifed up her legs and brought them completely upwards, throwing off her sister and skipping to her feet just in time to see their father looking at them both.  Catallina scrambled to her feet, realized she wasn't kidding, and gulped.  The two were dirty, and had the same frightened look on their faces. <br>  <br> &quot;Not even ten years old and you two are already training, I see.&quot;  he smiled, faintly amused.  &quot;I suppose it's time to start really training you two so you don't kill each other.&quot; <br>  <br> The twin sisters looked at each other and breathed a sigh of relief. <br>  <br> &quot;There's more to training than fighting, however.  You may encounter being that can't be fought, and you have to be ready for everything.  You'll have to take their strengths, and make it their weaknesses, no matter what you fight.  It's a dangerous place, and you have to know what to do.&quot; he explained. <br>  <br> Catallina had a bored expression on her face.  &quot;Yeah, can we start training?&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;In a moment.  Let me explain a little better what I mean.  To me, you two are hard to catch, because you're small, and I've never seen anyone with such short legs run so fast,&quot; he almost muttered.  &quot;But, in that case, I just have to figure out what your weakness is, and counter it.&quot; <br>  <br> Kristinae scratched her head.  &quot;I....think so.  So, your advantage is that you're big and string and all that?&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Exactly.  Now, how would you deal with this situation?&quot; <br>  <br> Catallina looked as if she was going to say something, but held back, afraid to say what she wanted to.  Kristinae just couldn't figure out an answer.  Their father waited on them, but neither could seem or weren't willing to give an answer.  &quot;You have to bring me down, so you do whatever it takes.&quot;  He looked at Catallina.  &quot;You have an idea, I know it.  Whatever it is you're going to do, try it.  Don't worry, you won't get in trouble this time.&quot; <br>  <br> She looked at him suprised, and asked, &quot;Promise?&quot; <br>  <br> He nodded.  &quot;Just do it.  I promise, you won't hurt me.&quot;  he smiled. <br>  <br> She looked at the ground and muttered an &quot;Okay...&quot;  She walked up to him slowly and stopped right in front of him.  She looked at him up and down, and breathed in slowly.  &quot;You really want me to?&quot;  she asked again. <br>  <br> &quot;Yes.&quot; <br>  <br> That's all she needed.  With all her strength, she kicked him right underneath the kneecap.  Suprised, he went down and crashed to the ground, holding his leg.  She jumped back frightened.  She kept yelling out &quot;I'm sorry!&quot; over and over again, near the point of hysteria. <br>  <br> He waved at her, and got to his feet, limping somewhat.  &quot;It's okay, Catallina.  Ow...&quot; he sat down again rubbing his injured knee.  &quot;That's exactly how you beat someone down.  Do what you least expect.  I was expecting something a bit more....spectacular...to say the least.&quot; <br>  <br> Kristinae looked at him curiously. &quot;You mean you though we would assume True Form and try some of these powers?&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Something like that.&quot; <br>  <br> --- <br>  <br> Kick 'em in the shins... <br>  <br> She heard about these creatures before.  Only gods have the power to control them, and sending them out means certain death for their targets.  They move through shadows, as would a rat through tunnels.  But the shadows were everywhere here...there's no way to tell when-- <br>  <br> The force of the blow would have killed a normal being.  It came from behind her and sent her into the opposite wall.  She came to her senses and turned around, swinging her blade.  She caught nothing. <br>  <br> Once again, she was slammed from behind.  Then from the front.  The shadows themselves seemed to attack her.  Before she could be attacked again, she threw her sword at where the shadow threw her next.  It slammed into the wall, but made a sickening sound as the blade hit something substantial before hitting the wall and falling to the ground. <br>  <br> That was the only hit she got off against the shadow dancer.  She ran to her blade, but she was thrown back like a rag doll.  Her other blade, still strapped to her belt, was torn off and also thrown aside.  The shadows then descended upon her.  She saw nothing but darkness, and couldn't breathe.  She struggled valiantly, but her strength waned, and finally, fell limp. <br>  <br> --- <br>  <br> It was a day later the girl made it to Freeport.  Although she never had visited here, she almost seemed to know where to go, as if she was being guided.  After a short time, she came to the east side of Freeport where she found the docks, and the ship that awaited her. <br>  <br> The ship itself was an unusual design.  There were no sails as such, only metal bulges came out of each side, with grates on the front and back of them both.  Before she came close, a Human came up close to her.  &quot;I hope she doesn't scare you,&quot; he began. <br>  <br> She jumped at his words and looked at him.  &quot;W...who are you?&quot; she demanded. <br>  <br> &quot;I'm her captain.  Name's Xaviar.  Paul Xaviar. I was told to be expecting you.  If you don't want to attact attention around here, come onboard and I'll keep you safe.  Don't worry, I'm not abducting you.  Believe me, if I was, I would have done that already.&quot; <br>  <br> She nodded, and took the hand he offered.  He led her to the ship, named the Satyrica, then took her into his quarters.  &quot;If you wish, you can use this room for tonight.  They're the safest place in Freeport.  We'll be departing tomorrow morning.&quot;  He stopped for a second, remembering something, then continued.  &quot;Your friend had quite a way of making me accept this job.&quot;  He shuddered.  &quot;Almost made it like it would have been a bad idea if I didn't do this, if that makes any sense.&quot;  He shook off the feeling.  &quot;Sorry, just rambling.  Anyways, what's your name?&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Trystania,&quot; she muttered.  She went to a couch and lay her head down on a pillow.  She curled up on the couch and began crying into the pillow.  Paul decided to exit the room, suddenly feeling like a barbarian in the room with the tiny Teir'Dal.  He was troubled.  Never before had he ever seen one cry.  He began thinking that his preconceptions and assumptions about other races might be very wrong. <br>  <br> &quot;Is she going to be okay?&quot; a voice came to Paul from the docks.  Tara had come aboard, and had seen most everything. <br>  <br> He sighed.  &quot;I dunno...this whole job has seemed strange from the start.  Have you ever seen a Teir'Dal cry before?&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Well...&quot; she stopped, sifting through her memories.  &quot;Now that you mention it, no I haven't.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Take a look inside,&quot; he nodded towards his quarters. <br>  <br> &quot;You let her on?&quot; Tara nearly shouted.  &quot;You haven't even been paid yet.&quot; <br>  <br> His eyes flared, and he looked at Tara.  &quot;She came alone.  I couldn't refuse her just because we haven't received payment yet, or even any confirmation that we will be paid.  It feels just wrong.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Whatever.  If you say so.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Tara, you know you're difficult when you're like that,&quot; Paul told her acidly. <br>  <br> &quot;Then don't talk to me.  I have enough on my mind at the moment.&quot; she replied icily. <br>  <br> &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Trystania said from the doorway of Paul's quarters.  Apparently, she had heard everything. <br>  <br> &quot;If my presence troubles you, then I'll leave,&quot; she offered almost timidly.  She looked like she had only stopped crying a few minutes ago. <br>  <br> Tara looked at her for a long time in disbelief of what she was seeing.  This girl, she estimated about sixteen years old, had a worn look on her face, her clothes were dirty, torn, and it look like she had been beaten.  Despite all that, her green, almost luminous eyes spoke of an innocence that was shattered. <br>  <br> &quot;By the gods, who did this to you?&quot; Tara asked her, forgetting entirely her prejudices against the Teir'Dal. <br>  <br> &quot;I...they told me I was guilty of the Taint of Blood...&quot; she choked and tears began coming again.  The rogue went to the girl and enfolded her arms around her.  She began crying in her arms.  Tara brought her back into Paul's quarters.  After fifteen minutes, she emerged alone.  Paul stood at the railing of the ship and was staring out into the sea. <br>  <br> &quot;I see what you mean, Paul.  I'm sorry,&quot; she told him. <br>  <br> &quot;It's okay.  But what do we do about her?  I mean, to be honest, this isn't the place for someone like her to be.  We run dangerous lives, and I'd rather not involve her.&quot;  he told her. <br>  <br> She put her arms on the rail and looked out to sea as well.  &quot;This may be the only place for her.  Her own people have rejected her, no one else will accept her, so we have to do what's right.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;But is this a place she would want to be calling home?&quot;  Paul asked Tara.  &quot;You and I...we're made for this...&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;I have the same feelings about this as you do.&quot; Tara began.  &quot;But I feel like we should.  Every ounce of my being tells me that's what we should...no what we need to, for her sake.  She told me in there what happened.&quot;  she choked back her own tears.  &quot;God, it's horrible.  Her mother disappeared before she could remember, and her father was killed only yesterday.  She said that someone...something...saved her from the same fate.  She has nowhere else to go.&quot; <br>  <br> The two looked out into the open sea for a long time, watching the sunset.  After dark, the ship disappeared from Freeport. <br>  <br> --- <br>  <br> Kristinae awoke screaming.  Her body was drenched in sweat, making her robe stick to her body.  She looked around, at first not comprehending where she was at.  As her mind came into focus, she realized she was in her own room again.  It was dark out.  She got up and out and began looking around.  This house never changed, even as she and her sister did. <br>  <br> &quot;So, they got you too...&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;They got me, Father.  You were right, I couldn't deal with them myself.&quot;  She turned to him.  &quot;I...I'm sorry.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Do not be.  You were right, and I was wrong.  I was blinded by my beliefs, and for that, I must apologize,&quot; he replied softly. <br>  <br> She went to him and hugged him tight.  &quot;I've missed you, Father...&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;And I have missed you as well.  There is another that has missed you...she's in her room if you wish to see her.&quot; <br>  <br> Her eyes came alight.  The realization that her sister was alive as well was overwhelming.  She never thought she would ever see Catallina alive again.  She ran to her room to greet her... <br>  <br>  <br>
