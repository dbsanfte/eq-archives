				Not mine, I'm not a David and don't look like one.  <br>  <br> It's long. But painfully funny. <br>  <br> &lt;nYc&gt; <br>  <br> &gt; This Is the Title of This Story <br>  &gt; A story by David Moser... <br>  &gt; <br>  &gt;        This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also <br>  &gt;           Found Several Times in the Story Itself <br>  &gt; <br>  &gt;      This is the first sentence of this story.  This is  the <br>  &gt; second  sentence.  This is the title of this story, which is <br>  &gt; also found several times in the story itself.  This sentence <br>  &gt; is  questioning  the  intrinsic  value of the first two sen- <br>  &gt; tences.  This sentence is to inform you, in case you haven't <br>  &gt; already  realized it, that this is a self-referential story, <br>  &gt; that is, a story containing sentences that  refer  to  their <br>  &gt; own  structure  and  function.  This is a sentence that pro- <br>  &gt; vides an ending to the first paragraph. <br>  &gt;      This is the first sentence of  a  new  paragraph  in  a <br>  &gt; self-referential story.  This sentence is introducing you to <br>  &gt; the protagonist of the story, a young boy named Billy.  This <br>  &gt; sentence  is  telling  you that Billy is blond and blue-eyed <br>  &gt; and American and twelve years old and strangling his mother. <br>  &gt; This  sentence  comments  on the awkward nature of the self- <br>  &gt; referential narrative form while recognizing the strange and <br>  &gt; playful  detachment it affords the writer.  As if illustrat- <br>  &gt; ing the point made by the last sentence, this sentence  rem- <br>  &gt; inds us, with no trace of facetiousness, that children are a <br>  &gt; precious gift from God and that the world is a better  place <br>  &gt; when  graced  by  the unique joys and delights they bring to <br>  &gt; it. <br>  &gt;      This sentence describes Billy's mother's  bulging  eyes <br>  &gt; and  protruding tongue and makes reference to the unpleasant <br>  &gt; choking and gagging  noises  she's  making.   This  sentence <br>  &gt; makes the observation that these are uncertain and difficult <br>  &gt; times, and that relationships,  even  seemingly  deep-rooted <br>  &gt; and permanent ones, do have a tendency to break down. <br>  &gt;      Introduces, in this paragraph, the device  of  sentence <br>  &gt; fragments.   A  sentence  fragment.   Another.  Good device. <br>  &gt; Will be used more later. <br>  &gt;      This is actually the last sentence of the story but has <br>  &gt; been  placed  here  by  mistake.   This is the title of this <br>  &gt; story, which is  also  found  several  times  in  the  story <br>  &gt; itself.   As  Gregor  Samsa  awoke  one  morning from uneasy <br>  &gt; dreams he found  himself  in  his  bed  transformed  into  a <br>  &gt; gigantic insect.  This sentence informs you that the preced- <br>  &gt; ing sentence is from another story entirely (a  much  better <br>  &gt; one,  it must be noted) and has no place at all in this par- <br>  &gt; ticular narrative.  Despite  claims of  the  preceding  sen- <br>  &gt; tence,  this sentence feels compelled to inform you that the <br>  &gt; story you are reading is in actuality &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; by <br>  &gt; Franz  Kafka,  and  that  the  sentence  referred  to by the <br>  &gt; preceding sentence is the only sentence  which  does  indeed <br>  &gt; belong in this story.  This sentence overrides the preceding <br>  &gt; sentence by informing the  reader  (poor,  confused  wretch) <br>  &gt; that this piece of literature is actually the Declaration of <br>  &gt; Independence, but that the author,  in  a  show  of  extreme <br>  &gt; negligence (if not malicious sabotage), has so far failed to <br>  &gt; include even one single sentence from that  stirring  document, <br>  &gt; although  he has condescended to use a small sentence <br>  &gt; fragment, namely, &quot;When in  the  course  of  human events&quot;, <br>  &gt; embedded in  quotation  marks  near  the end of a sentence. <br>  &gt; Showing a keen awareness of the boredom and  downright  hos- <br>  &gt; tility  of  the  average reader with regard to the pointless <br>  &gt; conceptual games indulged in  by  the  preceding  sentences, <br>  &gt; this  sentence  returns  us  at  last to the scenario of the <br>  &gt; story by asking the question, &quot;Why is Billy  strangling  his <br>  &gt; mother?&quot;  This  sentence  attempts to shed some light on the <br>  &gt; question posed by the preceding sentence  but  fails.  This <br>  &gt; sentence,  however, succeeds, in that it suggests a possible <br>  &gt; incestuous relationship between Billy  and  his  mother  and <br>  &gt; alludes to the concomitant Freudian complications any astute <br>  &gt; reader will immediately envision.  Incest.  The  unspeakable <br>  &gt; taboo.   The universal prohibition.  Incest.  And notice the <br>  &gt; sentence fragments?  Good literary  device.   Will  be  used <br>  &gt; more later. <br>  &gt;      This is the first sentence in a new paragraph.  This is <br>  &gt; the last sentence in a new paragraph. <br>  &gt;      This sentence  can serve as either the beginning of the <br>  &gt; paragraph  or  end, depending on its placement.  This is the <br>  &gt; title of this story, which is also found  several  times  in <br>  &gt; the  story itself.  This sentence raises a serious objection <br>  &gt; to the  entire  class  of  self-referential  sentences  that <br>  &gt; merely comment on their own function or placement within the <br>  &gt; story (e.g., the preceding four sentences),  on  the  grounds <br>  &gt; that  they  are monotonously predictable, unforgivably self- <br>  &gt; indulgent, and merely serve to distract the reader from  the <br>  &gt; real  subject  of  this  story, which at this point seems to <br>  &gt; concern strangulation and incest and who  knows  what  other <br>  &gt; delightful topics.  The purpose of this sentence is to point <br>  &gt; out that the preceding sentence, while not itself  a  member <br>  &gt; of  the  class  of self-referential sentences it objects to, <br>  &gt; nevertheless also serves merely to distract the reader  from <br>  &gt; the real subject of this story, which actually concerns Gre- <br>  &gt; gor Samsa's  inexplicable  transformation  into  a  gigantic <br>  &gt; insect  (despite the vociferous counterclaims of other well- <br>  &gt; meaning although misinformed sentences).  This sentence  can <br>  &gt; serve  as  either  the  beginning  of  the paragraph or end, <br>  &gt; depending on its placement. <br>  &gt;      This is the title of this story, which  is  also  found <br>  &gt; several times in the story itself.  This is almost the title <br>  &gt; of the story, which is found only once in the story  itself. <br>  &gt; This  sentence  regretfully states that up to this point the <br>  &gt; self-referential mode of  narrative  has  had  a  paralyzing <br>  &gt; effect  on  the  actual progress of the story itself -- that <br>  &gt; is, these sentences have been so  concerned  with  analyzing <br>  &gt; themselves and their role in the story that they have failed <br>  &gt; by and large to perform their function as  communicators  of <br>  &gt; events  and ideas that one hopes coalesce into a plot, char- <br>  &gt; acter development, etc. -- in short, the very raisons d'etre <br>  &gt; of  any  respectable, hardworking sentence in the midst of a <br>  &gt; piece of compelling prose fiction.  This sentence  in  addi- <br>  &gt; tion  points  out  the obvious analogy between the plight of <br>  &gt; these  agonizingly  self-aware   sentences   and   similarly <br>  &gt; afflicted  human  beings,  and  it  points out the analogous <br>  &gt; paralyzing effects wrought by excessive and  tortured  self- <br>  &gt; examination. <br>  &gt;      The purpose of this sentence (which can also serve as a <br>  &gt; paragraph)  is  to  speculate  that  if  the  Declaration of <br>  &gt; Independence had been worded and structured  as  lackadaisi- <br>  &gt; cally  and  incoherently  as  this  story  has  been so far, <br>  &gt; there's no telling what kind  of  warped  libertine  society <br>  &gt; we'd  be  living  in  now or to what depths of decadence the <br>  &gt; inhabitants of this country might have  sunk,  even  to  the <br>  &gt; point  of deranged and debased writers constructing irritat- <br>  &gt; ingly cumbersome and needlessly prolix sentences that  some- <br>  &gt; times  possess the questionable if not downright undesirable <br>  &gt; quality of referring to themselves and they  sometimes  even <br>  &gt; become  run-on  sentences or exhibit other signs of inexcus- <br>  &gt; ably sloppy grammar like unneeded  superfluous  redundancies <br>  &gt; that  almost  certainly  would have insidious effects on the <br>  &gt; lifestyle and morals of our  impressionable  youth,  leading <br>  &gt; them  to  commit  incest or even murder and maybe that's why <br>  &gt; Billy is strangling his mother, because  of  sentences just <br>  &gt; like this one , which have no discernible goals or perspicu- <br>  &gt; ous purpose and just end up anywhere, even in mid <br>  &gt;      Bizarre.   A  sentence  fragment.   Another   fragment. <br>  &gt; Twelve  years  old.   This  is a sentence that.  Fragmented. <br>  &gt; And strangling his mother.  Sorry, sorry.   Bizarre.   This. <br>  &gt; More  fragments.  This is it.  Fragments.  The title of this <br>  &gt; story, which.  Blond.  Sorry, sorry.  Fragment  after  frag- <br>  &gt; ment.   Harder.   This is a sentence that.  Fragments.  Damn <br>  &gt; good device. <br>  &gt;      The purpose of this sentence is threefold: (1) to  apo- <br>  &gt; logize  for the unfortunate and inexplicable lapse exhibited <br>  &gt; by the preceding paragraph; (2) to assure you,  the  reader, <br>  &gt; that  it  will  not  happen  again; and (3) to reiterate the <br>  &gt; point that these are uncertain and difficult times and  that <br>  &gt; aspects of language, even seemingly stable and deeply rooted <br>  &gt; ones such as syntax and meaning, do break down.   This  sen- <br>  &gt; tence  adds  nothing  substantial  to  the sentiments of the <br>  &gt; preceding sentence but merely provides a concluding sentence <br>  &gt; to this paragraph, which otherwise might not have one. <br>  &gt;      This sentence, in a  sudden  and  courageous  burst  of <br>  &gt; altruism,  tries  to  abandon  the self-referential mode but <br>  &gt; fails.  This sentence tries again, but the attempt is doomed <br>  &gt; from the start. <br>  &gt;      This sentence, in a last-ditch attempt to  infuse  some <br>  &gt; iota  of story line into this paralyzed prose piece, quickly <br>  &gt; alludes to Billy's frantic cover-up attempts, followed by  a <br>  &gt; lyrical,  touching,  and beautifully written passage wherein <br>  &gt; Billy is reconciled with his father (thus resolving the sub- <br>  &gt; liminal Freudian conflicts obvious to any astute reader) and <br>  &gt; a final exciting police chase scene during  which  Billy  is <br>  &gt; accidentally  shot  and killed by a panicky rookie policeman <br>  &gt; who is coincidentally named Billy.  This sentence,  although <br>  &gt; basically  in complete sympathy with the laudable efforts of <br>  &gt; the preceding action-packed  sentence,  reminds  the  reader <br>  &gt; that  such  allusions  to a story that doesn't, in fact, yet <br>  &gt; exist are no substitute for the  real  thing  and  therefore <br>  &gt; will  not  get the author (indolent goof-off that he is) off <br>  &gt; the proverbial hook. <br>  &gt;      Paragraph.  Paragraph.  Paragraph.   Paragraph.   Para- <br>  &gt; graph.    Paragraph.    Paragraph.   Paragraph.   Paragraph. <br>  &gt; Paragraph.  Paragraphh.  Paragraph.  Paragraph.  Paragraph. <br>  &gt;      The purpose.  Of this paragraph.  Is to apologize.  For <br>  &gt; its gratuitous use.  Of.  Sentence fragments.  Sorry. <br>  &gt;      The purpose of this sentence is to  apologize  for  the <br>  &gt; pointless  and  silly  adolescent  games  indulged in by the <br>  &gt; preceding two paragraphs, and to express regret on the  part <br>  &gt; of  us,  the  more mature sentences, that the entire tone of <br>  &gt; this story is such that it can't seem to communicate a  sim- <br>  &gt; ple, albeit sordid, scenario. <br>  &gt;      This sentence wishes to apologize for all the  needless <br>  &gt; apologies  found  in  this story (this one included), which, <br>  &gt; although placed here ostensibly for the benefit of the  more <br>  &gt; vexed  readers,  merely delay in a maddeningly recursive way <br>  &gt; the continuation of the by-now nearly forgotten story line. <br>  &gt;      This sentence is bursting at the punctuation marks with <br>  &gt; news of the dire import of self-reference as applied to sen- <br>  &gt; tences, a practice  that  could  prove  to  be  a  veritable <br>  &gt; Pandora's  box  of  potential  havoc,  for if a sentence can <br>  &gt; refer or allude to  itself,  why  not  a  lowly  subordinate <br>  &gt; clause,   perhaps  this very  clause?   Or this  sentence <br>  &gt; fragment?  Or three words?  Two words?  One? <br>  &gt;      Perhaps it is appropriate that this sentence gently and <br>  &gt; with  no  trace  of  condescension reminds us that these are <br>  &gt; indeed difficult and uncertain times  and  that  in  general <br>  &gt; people  just  aren't  nice enough to each other, and perhaps <br>  &gt; we, whether sentient human  beings  or  sentient  sentences, <br>  &gt; should just try harder.  I mean, there is such a thing as <br>  &gt; free will, there has to be, and this sentence  is  proof  of <br>  &gt; it!
