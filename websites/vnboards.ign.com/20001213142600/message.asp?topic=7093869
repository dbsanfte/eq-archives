				Gordon had made a comment about EQ having some kind of evolving story, I've been playing since december and never knew anything about this.  What is this story?

				Unfortunately, EQ has never had the life it was promised because Verant for whatever reasons never actively evolved it. There is a difference between having a story and making it part of the game....I think its very deceptive for anyone to say EQs storyline is evolving....its not...thats like saying the moon is made of cheese its not but there are stories about it being so...EQ is a hack and slash game it is not a roleplaying game. Are there roleplayers? Yes. Are there more hak and slashers than role players? Yes. Does the game make you want to roleplay? No. People do that (hell they have to set up special servers to get people to roleplay am I not correct?) So this means that EQ is relatively static, unchanging, and just people enjoying the scenery and trying to level. Does anyone really enjoy hell levels and medding and stuff? No. <br> forexample, Is there a real reason to have Ragebringer? No. Do these new uktimate quests mean jack to the game? No. Are these items worth the effort? No. Do mainly only guilds that bully people around have them? Yes. Why? They hack and slash their way to get them. But oh well its fun to play EQ for what it is I guess...as long as you KNOW what it is you areplaying......

				I guess the trick would be how to pull this off. I really don't like to go to events where there is a well rehearsed play before you because ultimatly you get folks that are rude and ruin it for everyone.  <br> One of the funniest thangs happen the other day when a we get system messages of a terrible storm at sea.  Followed up a little later with an ooc that the boats were down for a bit.  <br> Just a thought but what would really be wrong with a system message that came along with the story then maybe adding something for fun.   <br> Say for example The Cyclops (insert name) is angry and has summoned up friends to push the invaders out of Rath Mtn with his trusted (insert special item)  Now those that want can go try and kill him and his bodys.   <br> You could also do something were a so and so wizzard has lost something he leaves a clue and if you figure it out and retrive the item and bring it to him they you get a reward even if its just exp.   <br> If you do these with a story in mind you can drop little tid bits until you reach a climax.  Just a thought I know I would enjoy.

				Many of the NPCs in the game have a background history that you can ask them (or others) about. However, because of Faction many NPCs in the game are not going to talk to you, so its unlikely you'll be able to get the full picture without resorting to secondary characters or the web. <br>  <br> The way the game is designed, with static spawns, fixed loot tables and set-in-stone zone architecture, makes it hard for them to implement an evolving storyline. Only a couple of times have they dramatically changed the NPCs in a whole zone (Split Paw, Kithicor). AFAIK they have never changed the architecture. <br>  <br> Storywise the best they can do, therefore, is GM events where one or two GM controlled NPCs will enact a little scene and maybe spawn a few monsters in the process. Mostly these scenes are unrelated and have no lasting impact on the game, which thus remains as it was before, hack n' slash. <br>  <br> What I'd have liked is High Pass overrun by Orcs or Gnolls, Freeport burned to the ground with refugee camps in North Ro, new Guard towers being raised (and old ones ruined) in the Karanas, and so on; but for those kind of changes you have to play AC or presumably one of the upcoming MMORPGs. <br>

Some carelless human drops a torch and the whole city goes up in smoke. <br>  <br>     The Crushbone orcs should be wiped out by the dark eleves.
