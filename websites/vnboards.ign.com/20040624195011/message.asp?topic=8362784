				The weather was cold and raining. It was almost 4am. A person sat close to the fireplace inside the tavern, which lied close to the road in West Commons. That person were on his way to Freeport, when the rain suddenly broke out. So he took shelter in the tavern. It was a nice little tavern. Not very visited. Most people just came by to buy food and water and then left again. Few stayed in there. But that was the charm of it. Now there were only himself and another in the corner and then the bartender who half slept. He pulled his robe closer together. <br> He enjoyed an ale when the door slammed up against the wall. In the doorway stood a figure, crouched, that kept looking out into the rain. The figure stood there in a minute, until he closed the door fast. It looked like he looked for some way to lock the door but gave up when he found nothing. He walked tall, high and proud over to the bartender. He looked at all three persons in the room. The person by the fire felt like he was examined like a chicken by a butcher. He shuddered and looked away. But looked again at the stranger when he reached the bar. The person talked very controlled and thought about every word:&quot;I woulds like ssome... waters. Pleasse!&quot; The words felt like a lightning went through the man at the fireplace. He could recognize that accent. He talked the same accent. That was an Iksar that talked that way! The sudden movement the person at the fireplace made, made the Iksar stranger turn around fast, with hand at sword hilt. <br> The person by the fireplace quickly talked: In Lizardman&quot; Please! I am a friend. No need to get violent. Please, come join me.&quot; The other Iksar turned quickly around to see the others respond to been spoken Lizardman. The others fast looked away and began their own doings. The Iksar stranger took his water and walked over to the table and sat down. <br> In Lizardman:I am Kcrixk, Traveler of Norrath! And you may be...? <br> The stranger Iksar looked long and hard at Kcrixk before he spoke:In Lizardman&quot;I am Ssnar Jarsath. Shadow Knight of Cazic Thule. Or rather I was. I dont think the temple would call me a servant of Cazic Thule anymore. But they are FOOLS!!!&quot; Ssnar shouted the last sentence out and squeezed his hands on the table so scratches came. Kcrixk looked amazed at Ssnar. An Iksar had to do something extremely vicious against the temple to be casted away from Cazic Thule. He asked Ssnar how so:&quot;What have you done to get casted away from our true God? If I may ask?&quot; <br> In Lizardman&quot; It is a longer tale. But if you have the time I guess I could tell you the short version.&quot; Ssnar looked out the window, like he searched something. In Lizardman&quot; I have time. They wont travel that fast in this weather.&quot; Ssnar swallowed his water and asked for a new one. <br> In Lizardman:&quot;I had a dream some time ago... It is first now I have understood the meaning of it.&quot; <br> Ssnar looked around nervously. Strangely enough he looked mostly upwards nervously. <br> In Lizardman:&quot; It was a hazy dream at first. Filled with pain. I woke up many nights screaming and found myself covered in blood...&quot; Ssnar shaked by the memories and took another gulp from his cup. In Lizardman:&quot;It was Cazic Thule that came to me. He showed me an free Iksar who would retake Sebilis from the drakes. He showed me Iksar take control of all Kunark and push out the weak soft flesh. He showed me that we needed to unite!! We needed to be strong in numbers!!&quot; Ssnar eyes looked almost mad in the light from the fireplace. In Lizardman:&quot; I told of these dreams to the temple, but they said I was crazy. That it wasnt Cazic Thule but a madmans dreams... Fools! They were afraid were they! In the end I was told they would make my mouth shut one way or another. So I did my daily doings as everything was back to normal. But I also began contact other Iksars who didnt like the soft fleshs. I did my rituals to please our God, Cazic Thule. I earned rank within the temple. I had collected a small band of Iksars that was ready to follow me. Years went by. But then my punishment came!!&quot; There were a loud crash as Ssnar crushed his mug between his claws. But it didnt seem Ssnar noticed that. He looked like he was in some kind of trance. In Lizardman:&quot; Cazic Thule were not pleased with my daily and simple offerings. Cazic Thule were not pleased with the temple and its ways. He showed me by killing all my followers. May He have mercy on their souls...&quot; <br> There were a long pause here where Ssnar said nothing. He just looked at his smashed mug with sorrow in his eyes. It was first when Kcrixk moved on his chair, that Ssnar came to himself.  <br> In Lizardman:&quot; The temple discovered my doings. They called me a heretic. They said I worshipped strange Gods and demons... So I was punished to be sacraficed on the Altar of Cazic Thule. But He would have it differently. He showed me how to escape. On condition to follow His word and realize His visions. I fled. Now I wander the lands of soft fleshs to hide. I seek out other Iksars on my road to join me on my crusade; to wipe the soft fleshs of the face of Norrath, for it is the will of Cazic Thule!!!&quot; Ssnar shouted again the last sentence out loud. The two others in the tavern looked at the strange Iksars, but looked away fast when Ssnar returned their sight in cold eyes. In Lizardman:&quot; Yes. Off course I get homesick sometimes. And I do visit Cabilis sometimes. In disguise, off course. But mostly I am forced to walk among these soft fleshs. I loathe these soft fleshs. But I guess it is Cazic Thules way to make me suffer and feel pain. And I welcome it. It makes me stronger! Without it I couldnt do this!&quot; Ssnar fastly raised from the table and ran over to the stranger in the corner. A loud scream came from the stranger but it quickly died away. The bartender looked up frighten and began to fumble after his sword.  <br> &quot;I wouldss notss do that, sssoft flesssh! But pleassssse... It wouldss make myss day a betterss oness...&quot; Kcrixk could see a greenish light come from Ssnar and the bartender. The bartender got weaker and weaker. He dropped the sword in the end and the light disappeared. Ssnar putted his sword away and walked back to the table to Kcrixk. In Lizardman:&quot; Soft flesh are weak. You must understand that.&quot; Kcrixk nodded. Not because he understood what Ssnar told him, but because he still didnt have got over the shock by the killings that had taken place in front of him. In Lizardman:&quot; I am a chased man. The temple see me dead. Several selfclaimed inquisitors follow my trail to hunt me down. The warlords see me dead.&quot; Ssnar smiled. In Lizardman:&quot; Who know. Maybe you would like to see me dead.&quot; Ssnar Laughed out a hollow laughter. In Lizardman:&quot; I am just kidding, brother. If you really wanted me dead you wouldn&#180;t have waited that long and heard my story. I know. It is the first thing my executioners get told when beginning their chase on me. They are afraid I show them my side of the story and turn them to my cause. I have done so before.&quot; Ssnar looked out the window. The rain had stopped during the tale. In Lizardman:&quot; I guess I have to go now. They will soon be here. You can follow me. Or rather; follow Cazic Thules word. Do his bidding! It is time soon. Be not the soft fleshs servants. Slaves!!&quot; Krcixk looked amazed at Ssnar. &quot;But Ssnar. I am not anybodys slave or servant. I follow my own beliefs and do not what other races tell me to...&quot; The words were stopped by the sound of scales being teared to blood. Ssnar stood with Kcrixk&#180;s blood on his claws. Kcrixk touched his cheek with his right hand. It was sore and blood was on his hand. Kcrixk raised slowly from his chair. No one should hit him unpunished. In Lizardman:&quot; You are a slave already, Kcrixk. You talk the soft fleshs language like it was your own. You talked to me like it was your motherlanguage instead of using our own language. And dont tell me you havent done what soft fleshs have asked you to do. I bet you have handed in orc scalps, gnoll scalps, goblin ears and all other quests the soft fleshs make you do. That is a dogs duty! Not an Iksar! So dont tell me you are independent. You are just like all the others. Weak! So? Will you kill me now? Is that it? Please try. You will not be the first.&quot; Kcrixk looked at Ssnar. He hated him. Because he was right. Kcrixk sat down again. In Lizardman:&quot; Contact me when you see the light, Kcrixk. For now I have to go. They are close. Farewell brother. May Cazic Thule bring pain and suffering to your world.&quot; With that, Ssnar bowed, turned around and walked out the door. <br> Kcrixk sat for some time and thought about what he was told. How long time he didnt knew. He returned to senses by someone shaking his shoulders. &quot;Excuse me, stranger. Do you know what has happened here?&quot; Kcrixk looked up into a scaled face. &quot;Was it a brother like us? Was it an Iksar?&quot; Kcrixk saw three armed Iksars. Looked like they were ready to storm Freeport. <br> &quot;Erm...&quot; Kcrixk began. <br> &quot;It was Ssnar, right? Have you talked with this traitor!!&quot; It was more a statement than a question. In Lizardman:&quot;Yes. And I tried to catch him. Ermm... And as you see he managed to escape. He punched me unconscious and slayed the rest.&quot; The Iksars looked around. &quot;Yes. It seems so. You were lucky you survived. Ssnar is a very dangerous heretic. And you feel lucky you made him your enemy. Or we would have killed you. The three Iksars turned around and left the tavern. <br> Damn! Ssnar had saved his life by clawing his face! Ssnar knew that when he had clawed him. Kcrixk walked out of the tavern. He stood in the doorway and looked at the sunrise in the horizont. In Lizardman:&quot; Ssnar. I owe you my life. Next time I meet you, you have a disciple.&quot; Kcrixk looked back at the corpses in the tavern. In Lizardman:&quot; And I promise that I will never do a soft flesh&#180;s bidding ever again. Praise be Cazic Thule!&quot;
