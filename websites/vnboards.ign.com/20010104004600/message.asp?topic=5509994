				Yes, I know it says it is a roleplaying game.  And, yes I know there are many of you who want to roleplay in the game.  And yes, I know there are many who make valiant efforts at roleplaying their characters in the game.   <br>  <br> The problem with EQ is that the game just doesn't support roleplaying.  For true roleplaying there needs to be an interactive plot.  Players need to be able to make permanent changes within their world.  The environment needs to be ever changing and not static.  In EQ we simply do not find these things... and we never will unless there is a lot of new code written.  Let's face it, thats not going to happen. <br>  <br> I too, bought the game with high hopes of being able to roleplay.  I mean, it was advertised as a roleplaying game...geez.  Well, i had fun with the game for awhile but quickly grew bored, as the only real thing to do in the game is to try to level.  To do this requires fighting the same beasts over and over... ugh..it turned into such drudgery. <br>  <br> I had hopes for a time that Verant would add features to the game necessary to roleplaying.  But as time went by, and there were no changes, not even fixes to some very lame trades skills, I realized that this would not happen.  The only changes Verant is going to make is adding new zones, fixing minor technical bugs, and whatever else is necessary to keep the majority of the customers.  And this is somewhat understandable, they are a company in the business of making money.  I just wish they had never advertised the game as a ROLEPLAYING game.  Apparently they really have no idea what a roleplaying game is.  Just because it has some dragons, orcs, and elves many people will call it a roleplaying game...yeah, right. <br>  <br> This post is not meant to be against those who are currently trying to get a RPing server.  I wish you the best of luck.  I just don't have any faith in Verant to make the necessary changes to implement the idea.

				The problem with RP in EQ isn't all Verant's fault.  I'll admit that some of the choices they made with the game seem to favor the 'levelers' more than roleplay, BUT that is as much the players fault as it is Verant's.  People in this game choose to camp spawns, not because it's fun (most of them hate to camp for stuff).  You could easily have a few groups meet at the entrance to Unrest and 'raid' the house.  But because a group of people decide &quot;I MUST have dwarven work boots! and I'm not leaving until I do!&quot; and go sit in that room, they ruin the opportunity for roleplay, because they remove the goal of the dungeon. <br> Yes, it IS Verant's fault that they CAN do that by making the spawn repetative (every 20 minutes or whatever it is for the ghost), and by making it so that high level people can just walk past the lower level mobs without a care.  BUT, it is still the PLAYER's fault for actually going and DOING the camping. <br>  <br> But then again, there is more to 'roleplay' than running around with a funny accent and all that.  If you have a cleric in your group that won't heal people, kick him out, because he's not playing his role (roleplaying).  :)

				I do think EQ is a roll playing game.  When you play a traditional RPing game such as D&amp;D do you just sit there and let the DM tell you a story? No you don't. You interact and do things to. The DM only keeps you guided and keep a story going. <br>  <br> In EQ you can still RP, yes you can't make big changes to the world but you, as a player can still interact with other players to form storys of their relation ships since you can't go have a conversation with Antonius Bayle or slay the king of Ak'Anon for good. <br>  <br> Someone wrote a pretty good editorial on Everquest Express in issue 120 or 121. I recomend you check it out if you have never read it.

				Again, don't misunderstand what I am saying.  I am not saying it is impossible to roleplay in EQ, i am only saying that the atmosphere of the game is not condusive to this type of play. And yes, this is Verant's fault.  Sure players can choose to ignore the faults, but the fact is that people will play the game as it has been written..and it hasn't been written to support roleplaying. <br>  <br> And roleplaying does of course mean interaction with other players but it also means interaction with monsters and your surrounding environment.  If for example, I tried to roleplay a loner who by nature seldom speaks or involves himself with others this would be nearly impossible since I would get no interation from the environment. This is just one example of hundreds I could think of... There are ways to roleplay in the game, but these are very contrived.   <br>  <br>

				IMO... <br> its both verant AND players fault. <br> To me, the &quot;dynamic quests&quot; which were suppose to add to the element of RPing has become nothing more than &quot;give me a magic item!&quot; <br> noone even cares for the story, they just want an item.I've seen lv 50s complain about having &quot;weak&quot; items being dropped off of a dynamic quest mob... The problem doesnt stem here, its in the whole atmosphere of the game. It seems that 90% of the people who play EQ are indeed, playing to get the best item, get the highest level, be the best that you can be, and say screw everyone else-I'm playing the game for ME. <br> And Verant is at fault for promoting this by having special mobs drop special items, not going to the randomizing that Asherons Call(AC) because they feel &quot;its against what we envisioned the game to be.&quot; They also allow some classes to be able to solo lv 50 creatures while the rest of us (I'm play a paladin as my prime char) get our arses handed to us. <br> I always get a kicker out of their &quot;envision&quot; excuse... <br> What do they envision? i often wonder... <br> because the reality is that high lv dungeons (such as SolB and LG) are OVERCROWDED with 80 people in LG and 50 people in SolB on good nights. <br> Thankfully we have Kunark to ease the conjusted zones but it still doesnt promote Rping. <br> The best thing about Kunark is exploring new territory that noone else has seen-temporarily having the powergamers/item farmers crawl out of their hole and play the game as what it was meant to be-exploration and adventure.(IMO anyways) But after they done that, its back to playing the game as how they see it-just kill and get an item. <br>  <br> EQ can be fun to rp, just need to get those kinds of people together under one roof and get a story going =) <br>  <br> Plus if you want a REAL rping game, check out NeverwinterNights , it'll be out in some time, but it looks great =)  <br>  <br>  <a class=BoardRowBLink target="_blank" href="http://neverwinternights.com/">http://neverwinternights.com/</a>  <br>   <br>

				Well, it is roleplaying if you consider the fact you are playing the role of someone else on the online world. But otherwise, there's as much roleplaying as Diablo on Battle.net (for those of you who havent played, there is very little, if any roleplaying on Diablo).

				EQ is NOT a ROLEPLAYING GAME <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> ......... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> EQ is NOT a LEVELING GAME <br>  <br>  <br> Eq doesn't favor either leveling or roleplaying. As hard as it is to belive- you can roleplay without leveling. Want to travel? Roleplay a shadow knight(or some other tricky or evil class- get a wizard and trick the wizard into teleporting you someplace and make a run for it. <br>  <br> SK: Hey can you teleport? <br> WIZ: Why yes I can. <br> SK: Can you teleport me? <br> WIZ: No, I'm not teleporting now. <br> SK: Hmph! I bet you don't even know teleport. <br> WIZ: Yes, I do! <br> Sk: No you're too weak to teleport. <br> WIZ: Fine, I'll teleport myself somewhere. <br> SK: How do I know you teleported? Maybe you just cast invisable or camoflauge on yourself. <br> WIZ: Fine, I'll take you with me just to prove it. <br>  <br> This is kind of a lame example but do you see where I am getting at. EQ is a freestyle game, do whatever you want- want to make items? Take up a trade skill. Want to be the best fighter? Then go level. Want to roleplay? Then go ahead, ROLEPLAY! The only people that ruin roleplaying are the people that say EQ is not a RPG. If they don't think that roleplaying is found on EQ then just don't say anything. Go level or camp or whatever you want to do just don't interfere with people that are acually trying to roleplay! <br>  <br> Well sorry if it sounded like I was flaming but I just see alot of these &quot;EQ not RPG!&quot; that I got annoyed. <br>  <br> Mr. Boombastic <br> &quot;If you want to rplay a hot wood elf stripper- don't let me stop you!&quot;
