				   Before you read this, just know that this is not another sob story. It is a lesson learned, not from anyone else but me. And after my story I would like to her some of ya'lls if ya have any. <br>    May 18,  I just bought my buddy lunch at roundtable and I was taking him back to school. On the way there, a car pulled up next to us, and two kids my age were smoking and laughing it up. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at, until I dropped my buddy off. He looked in the back seat and said, &quot;those mother fuckers threw a lit cigarette in your back seat.&quot; I looked back there, and sure enough, there was a burning cigarette and a fat burn hole. I looked at my friend and took off after the guys. I didn't go far when they passed me, so I threw a U turn and followed them. While I was driving I pulled my tire iron out from underneath my seat, and my 12&quot; survival knife out from under the passenger seat. I followed these guys into a rich neighborhood, and they parked in front of a house were about 8 guys were waiting. You are probably wondering why i didn't leave and come back later, you have to understand my mindset. Anyway, I pointed to the driver and told him to come over to where I was. (I was still in the car) I asked him as calmly as I could; &quot;Did one of you just throw a lit cigarette in my car?&quot; He got an attitude and started to cus me out. By that time all his little rich kid friends surrounded my car. I grabbed my knife and told him to tell his boys to get away from my car. They backed away, and I started to drive offf. Then I heard a comotion, and saw one of the guys running after my car with a baseball bat. I pulled over, opened my trunk and got my bat out and told him to come here. He stopped running, and I could see the hesitation in his eyes. By then, the other guys all had weapons. I looked the youngest kid there, he must've been 17, he had a knife. I asked him, &quot;Are you ready to kill somebody kid?&quot; I think the question scared him, becuase he looked like he was gonna cry. I don't care what kind of person you think you are, when you see a human being cornered with nothing to lose, it's a very intimidating sight. I'm not a scary guy, but when I'm in that mode, it's almost sub-human, primal. Anyway, one of the little spoiled bitches started going off &quot;My brother's in the Aryan Brotherhood and he's gonna kill you!&quot; I said, &quot;thats funny, I used to run with the AB.&quot; Then, the guy with the baseball bat came towards me, so I got in my stance and was ready to go. I didn't notice the little bitch getting in my car and taking off. I ran after the car for a short distance, than just stopped in the street and laughed like a mad man. I waited for her to come back, and when I saw her I put my hands out and dropped my bat as to say, &quot;I'm harmless.&quot; She got out, and I got in. That's when the kid with the baseball bat came over and tryed kicking the door on my leg. I let him and just looked at him and smiled. Then, he slapped me in the face like a little bitch, didn't even leave a mark. I started busting up laughing my ass off. I honestly can't believe how calm and collect I was through the whole thing. I looked at him calmly and said, &quot;Hey, there's always a price to pay.&quot; He had the baseball bat pointed at me like he was gonna shove it through my face, but I knew hw wouldn't. By that time I heard the cops coming, so I left, but I was too late and got pulled over on the next street. The cop detained me for an hour. I was completely honest with him, and he liked that. He even gave me my baseball bat and I my knife back.;) I was really stoked to find such a decent cop. I went my way, and realized that something was wrong with my car. I don't know what, but now it makes a repetitive knocking sound. Anyway, the ride home, many things were going through my head. I was going through all the ways I could exact revenge. Then, I thought, wait a sec. what if I don't do anything? I though about it. Last night before I went to bed, I prayed to God to take the hostility out of my heart. I woke up today, and realized that I'm not going to do anything back. I mean, this is how I know I'm growing; the old me would've got a bunch of skinheads in a truck and would've firebombed the whole heihgborhood. But, I know I that happened, some who didn't deserve it would be hurt or killed. I don't want anyone getting hurt over my pride. I've decided to let nature take it's course. The words I spoke to that guy were true, &quot;there's always a price to pay.&quot; He will pay the price without me doing anything. And even if he doesn't, oh well. I want to set an example. I've seen too much violence, I don't want it anymore. I hope people can learn from this, I know I have. So, that's what's been happening lately. I feel better now that I know I wont do anything back. No guilt, no hostility, and everything will be alright. This was just another turning point in my life, and I think I made the right decision. <br> (By the way, I don't mean to make myself sound all high and mighty, and just want to show you that no matter what happens, you can leave it alone and move on.) I mean, how humiliating, letting some punk rich kid slap you. But, I have nothing left to prove, and the alternative will me unescisarily messy. Fuck it. I'm done fighting for my pride, I hope the people that read this already feel the same way. <br> Peace  <br>

				&gt;&gt;I just bought my buddy lunch at roundtable and I was taking him back to school. On the way there, a car pulled up next to us, and two kids my age were smoking and laughing it up. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at, until I dropped my buddy off. He looked in the back seat and said, &quot;those mother fuckers threw a lit cigarette in your back seat.&quot; I looked back there, and sure enough, there was a burning cigarette and a fat burn hole. I looked at my friend and took off after the guys. I didn't go far when they passed me, so I threw a U turn and followed them.&lt;&lt; <br>  <br> So you saw kids, then dropped your buddy off, exchanged some words with your buddy, then miraculously you were able to find the kids again? <br>  <br> I call bs

				Ok, I'm sorry but that is the biggest pile of horsesh*t story I've ever heard. It's like a mix of every movire out....Outsiders, American History X, a couple AAARnold movies, a Rambo, and maybe some Dulph Lungren(sp) movie as well. <br>  <br> I'm sorry but nothing in that story makes any sense. It's like you sat there making it up as you went. No matter what you say from this point on no one will believe this story, and I think even you after you read it a few more time will say.....hoilly sh*t that was some bomb-a$$ weed yo! <br>  <br> My favorite was this line... <br>  <br> &quot;I looked the youngest kid there, he must've been 17, he had a knife. I asked him, &quot;Are you ready to kill somebody kid?&quot; I think the question scared him, becuase he looked like he was gonna cry.&quot; <br>  <br> You go Dirty Harry!!!!! <br>  <br>  <br> But you can't forget these timeless classics. <br>  <br> &quot;I don't care what kind of person you think you are, when you see a human being cornered with nothing to lose, it's a very intimidating sight. I'm not a scary guy, but when I'm in that mode, it's almost sub-human, primal. Anyway, one of the little spoiled bitches started going off &quot;My brother's in the Aryan Brotherhood and he's gonna kill you!&quot; I said, &quot;thats funny, I used to run with the AB.&quot;  <br>  <br>  <br> AND........ <br> Then, the guy with the baseball bat came towards me, so I got in my stance and was ready to go. <br>  <br> *What is this a turn based RPG? The warrior with the bat takes 2 steps to the right, I hit the Jab,Jab,Upper Cut, protect hot keys, and then I is winner! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Ohh there is sooo much more. I can tell you've never been in a fight in your life, or atleast won, one. Fromt he sound of it people have kicked your ass before, but this is like all that built up frustration came back all at once, and you decided to write your story as if you could pay all these people back. F*ck this could be a movie of the week on AMC! <br>
