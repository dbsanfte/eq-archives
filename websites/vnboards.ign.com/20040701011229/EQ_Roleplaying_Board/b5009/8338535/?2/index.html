				Well, here's the problem first. <br>  <br> For those of you who don't know, vallon zek &amp; tallon zek are pvp teams. Meaning you can't pk (player kill) anyone on your team, but you can pk someone on another team. <br>  <br> The teams: <br> Humans, Erudites, Barbarians <br> High Elves, Half-elves, Wood Elves <br> Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes <br> Dark elves, trolls, ogres, iksar. <br>  <br> Now, here's the problem. <br>  <br> Assume you see a human grouping with a half-elf.  <br>  <br> Now, about half the people there think that 'Hey, that's wrong! Humans and half-elves aren't supposed to like each other!' and attempt to kill whichever one they can. These types are also usually the ones who will randomly pk anyone of a different race they see. <br>  <br> The other half say 'well, they're both lighties so okay.'  They think that just because you can kill someone, doesn't mean you should.  If both are paladins or something, then no reason to random kill things. <br>  <br> Okay, both have a valid reason (although I'm siding with the latter).  Anyway, here's a decent solution to this: <br>  <br> Make a REASON for the war. <br>  <br> As it stands, there is no reason whatsoever for there to be war. There just is. <br>  <br> So, Verant should create a reason behind the war. <br>  <br>  <br> Here's my bardic idea. Er-hem. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> In Qeynos, several stores were attacked and robbed by a series of half-elves.   Sneeds, tubal's, and several other store were attacked by a new rebel guild of half-elven theives. <br>  <br> Antonious Bayle was angred by these assorted robbings and managed to finally stop them. They were thrown out of Qeynos, and seemingly vanished. <br>  <br> Then, a few days later, similar events occured in Freeport.  The freeport leader (whatever his name is) spoke with Antonious bayle. both assumed it was a ploy of the elves, and sent an emissary to Felwithe to speak with them. <br>  <br> The High Elves in Felwithe were extremely insulted and annoyed to think that they had any part in dealing with half-breeds or useless humans.  They simply turned the emissary back in disgust, refusing to speak to him at all once they heard his reason for coming. <br>  <br> This was considered an act of war.  A small human force gathered in Freeport, with the intent of forcing the elves to listen.  The High elves, with their wood elven cousins, formed an army of their own, angered at the arrogance of the humans. They attacked the moment the humans got off the boat. <br>  <br> However, the fight was on DWARVEN territory.  The dwarven leader went over to the elven then human leader and politely (in a dwarven sort of way) informed them that they would have to get out of their land, and carry their fight somewhere else.  Neither side payed any attention to him. <br>  <br> Finally, the human force won, but just barely.  There were only 5 human soldiers left, and the remaining 3 elves had run for the hills. <br>  <br> This insult was unforgivable by the hard-headed dwarves, especially when they saw a young random dwarf on the ground of the battlefield, dead, with an arrow in his chest. The arrow was either human or elven, and the dwarves didn't care.  They shut off their port to both humans and elves. <br>  <br> Around this time, gnomes had visited Erudin (Assume for a moment that Norrath is round, heh).  They sailed over there on an elven boat with a few elven seamen to guide it, and tried diligently to create a mechanical booking system to make the library more efficient.  The Erudites at first refused, then decided to allow them to attempt it.  The device exploded, destroying quite a few ancient texts, and the angry Erudites ousted the gnomes. In the chaos, several elves were slain as well. <br>  <br> The proud and true Barbarians were guarding their home of Halas when they were attacked by a spectacular sized group of gnolls.  After they barely managed to drive them off, they found, among the corpses, a young halfling.  He was dressed like a gnoll leader. <br>  <br> And that was that.  The High elves considered themselves officially at war with the other sets of races, and their wood elven cousins followed.  Though distastefull, they also allowed half-elves to join, realizing that they would give them a link to humans, so they could understand and destroy them more efficiently. <br>  <br> The Dwarves decided that those who follow the duke of below are worth trusting, and formed an alliance with the battered and angry gnomes and halfings. <br>  <br> The humans, barbarians, and erudites joined to expel the other races. <br>  <br> And everyone already hated the dark races. <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  <br>  <br> However, on both sides, there are some who are against this war.  Those who realize it for the foolishness it was. <br>  <br> Also, there are those who realise the benifits of allowing certain other races in who have proven their loyalty.  Such as Trumpy Irontoe the dwarf in Qeynos, and The pickle maker in Freeport. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> There.  How does that sound? It gives you a reason to support or go against the war on a roleplaying basis.  <br>  <br> Please comment. <br>  <br> Ruberot - Half-elven bard of the 12th song.

				This sounds like a good start for one way that the PvP teams conflict could be interpreted. <br>  <br> It could also be interpreted as more of a long-standing racial and cultural conflict, with races that are similar in appearance and customs naturally siding with one another over the thousands of years.  Because the alliance that the races have formed is not official, and carried by general good will and word of mouth alone, it is not a very strong bond and has no strict terms of agreement.  Thus, even the races that generally cooperate with one another may sometimes be at odds over certain instances.  Also, because there is no official war, and the conflict that races have with other races that are not on their &quot;team&quot; is due to xenophobic emotions only, a good number of members of all races will choose not to harbor resentment agaist other, foreign races and will cooperate with them. <br>  <br> I believe that this explanation offers a solid solution to the PvP teams question.
