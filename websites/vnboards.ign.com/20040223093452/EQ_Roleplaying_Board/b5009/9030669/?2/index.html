				Turn $6 into $50,000 <br>  <br> It's true.Read this carefully or download to read <br>  <br> A while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just like you are now, and <br> came across an article similar to this <br> that said you could make thousands of CASH within weeks with only an <br> initial investment of <br> $6.00 plus stamps! So I thought, &quot;Yeah, right, this must be a scam!&quot; But <br> like most of us I was curious and kept <br> reading. It said that if you send $1.00 to each of <br> the 6 names and addresses listed in the article, you could make thousands <br> in a very short period of time. You <br> then place your own name and address at the bottom of the list at #6, and <br> post the article to at least 300 <br> newsgroups. (There are about 32,000 of them out there and that's quite a <br> large market pool). No catch, that was <br> it. Even though the investment was a measly $6, I had three questions that <br> needed to be answered before I could <br> get involved in this sort of thing. <br>  <br> 1. IS THIS REALLY LEGAL? <br> I called a lawyer first. The lawyer was a little sceptical that I would <br> actually make any CASH but he said it WAS <br> LEGAL if I wanted to try it. I told him it sounded a lot like a chain <br> letter but the details of the system (SEE <br> BELOW) actually made it a legitimate legal business. <br>  <br> 2. IS OK WITH THE POST OFFICE OR IS IT MAIL FRAUD? I called them: <br> 1-800-725-2161 and they <br> confirmed THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! (See 18, h sections1302 NS 1341 of <br> Postal Lottery Laws). This <br> clarifies the program of collecting names and addresses for a mailing list. <br>  <br> 3. IS IT RIGHT? Well, everyone who sends me a buck has a good chance of <br> getting A LOT of CASH ... a much <br> better chance than buying a lottery ticket!!! <br>  <br> So, having these questions answered, I invested EXACTLY $7.92 ... six $1.00 <br> bills and six 32 cent postage <br> stamps ... and boy am I glad I did!!! <br> Within 7 days, I started getting CASH in the mail! I was shocked! I figured <br> it would end soon and didn't give it <br> another thought. But the CASH continued coming in. In my first week I made <br> between $20 to $30. <br> By the end of the second week I had a made a total of $1,000.00. In the <br> third week I had over $10,000.00 and it <br> was still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of <br> just over $42,000 and it's still coming <br> in ..... <br> It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps !!! <br>  <br> Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the <br> information off of it as you need it. I <br> promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start <br> making more CASH than you thought <br> possible by doing something so easy! <br>  <br> Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download <br> it.) Follow the simple directions and <br> watch the CASH come in! It's easy. It's legal. <br> And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) <br>  <br> IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; <br> and it is virtually no risk - it really <br> works!!!! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will <br> receive extraordinary dividends. <br>  <br> PLEASE NOTE: <br> Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in <br> 20 to 60 days. This program <br> remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the <br> participants. Please continue its success by <br> carefully adhering to the instructions. <br> You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your <br> product is not solid and tangible, it's <br> a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large <br> corporations are happy to pay big <br> bucks for quality lists. However, the CASH made from the mailing lists is <br> secondary to the income which is made <br> from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. <br>  <br> Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <br> STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each <br> piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON <br> YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of <br> the 6 pieces of paper so the <br> bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent <br> thievery). Place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You <br> should now have 6 sealed envelopes, <br> each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, <br> and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing <br> is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a <br> legitimate service and you are <br> paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little <br> worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I <br> checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they <br> confirmed that it is indeed legal! Mail the 6 <br> envelopes to the following addresses: <br>  <br>  <br> #1) Christopher L. Sloan <br> 2200 Hickory St. <br> H.S.U. Box #14579 <br> Abilene, TX 79698 <br>  <br> #2) Kristen DeJoseph <br> 138 Jansen Street <br> Staten Island, NY 10312 <br>  <br> #3) Baraquin Yannick <br> 10 Charlemagne <br> L-1328 Luxemburg <br> Luxemburg <br>  <br> #4) Ed Kim <br> CB 4692 <br> 7900 Loyola Blvd <br> Los Angeles CA 90045 <br>  <br> #5)Le Huynh Ngoc Phan <br> 75/11 Nguyen Van Cu P1Q5 <br> Ho Chi Minh City <br> Viet Nam <br>  <br> #6) Arik Money <br> 540 N. Bayberry Pl. <br> Corpus Christi, TX 78418 <br>  <br> STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the <br> other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 <br> becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list. <br>  <br> STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close <br> to original as possible. Now, post your <br> amended article to at least 300 newsgroups. (I think there are close to <br> 32,000 groups) All you need is 300, but <br> remember, the more you post, the more CASH you make! This is perfectly <br> legal! If you have any doubts, refer to <br> 18 Sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps <br> for <br> yourself and, whenever you need CASH, you can use it again, and again. <br>  <br> PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty <br> and integrity of the <br> participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it <br> this way. If you are a person of <br> integrity, the program will continue and the CASH that so many others have <br> received will come your way. <br> NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on <br> a computer or hard copy and keep <br> the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a <br> service. (Also, it might be a good idea <br> to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce <br> the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions <br> carefully followed, <br> six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer <br> with one dollar each. Your name will <br> move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 <br> position you will be receiving thousands of <br> CASH in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the <br> first six people listed above) Send <br> it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! <br>  <br> ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS <br>  <br> Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own <br> posting. Simply put your cursor at the <br> beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this letter, <br> and select 'copy' from the edit menu. <br> This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. <br>  <br> Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the <br> blank page. From the 'edit' menu select <br> 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can <br> add your name to the list. <br>  <br> Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your <br> postings in different settings, you'll <br> always have this file to go back to. <br>  <br> Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various <br> newsgroups (on-line forums, message <br> boards, chat sites, discussions.) <br>  <br> Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message <br> by highlighting the text of this letter <br> and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be <br> the header <br> that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a <br> particular group, click the post message button. <br> You're done with your first one! <br> Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different <br> newsgroups and post away, after you get <br> the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! <br>  <br> **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE <br> MORE CASH YOU WILL MAKE!! <br> BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 300** <br>  <br> That's it! You will begin receiving CASH from around the world within days! <br> You may eventually want to rent a <br> P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to <br> stay anonymous, you can invent <br> a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. <br> **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** <br>  <br> Now the WHY part: <br> Out of 300 postings, say I receive only 7 replies (a very low example). So <br> then I made $7.00 with my name at #6 <br> on the letter. Now, each of the 7 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the <br> MINIMUM 300 postings, <br> each with my name at #5 and only 7 persons respond to each of the 7 <br> original 7, that is another $49.00 for me, <br> now those 49 each make 300 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 7 <br> replies each, I will bring in an <br> additional $343.00! Now, those 343 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM <br> 300 with my name at #3 and <br> only receive 7 replies each, I will make an additional $2401.00! OK, now <br> here is the fun part, each of those 2401 <br> persons post a MINIMUM 300 letters with my name <br> at #2 and they each only receive 7 replies, that just made me $16,807.00!!! <br> Those 16807 persons will all deliver <br> this message to 300 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 7 persons <br> per 300 Newsgroups react I will <br> receive $117,649.00! With an original investment <br> of only $6.00! And some stamps. <br> AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest <br> posting in the newsgroups, and <br> send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 <br> again. And start posting again. The <br> thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the <br> world are joining the internet and <br> reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford <br> $6.00 and see if it really <br> works?? I think so... <br> People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the <br> CASH? So what! What are the <br> chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new <br> honest people who are joining the <br> internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? <br>  <br> Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of <br> those joining the actual internet. <br>  <br> Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work. <br>  <br> By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages with <br> your name in the list and not sending <br> the CASH to the rest of the people already on the list, you will NOT get as <br> much. Someone I talked <br> to knew someone who did that and he only made about $150.00, and that's <br> after seven or eight weeks! Then he <br> sent the 6 $1.00 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks <br> he had over $10k. <br> This is the fairest and most honest way I have ever seen to share the <br> wealth of the world without costing <br> anything but our time!!! You also may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists <br> for future CASH. <br> Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW! Also, try to keep a list of <br> everyone that sends you CASH and <br> always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing <br> fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS THE <br> BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic idea to make the CASH!! GOOD <br> LUCK to all and please <br> play fairly and reap the huge rewards from this, which is tons of extra <br> CASH. <br>  <br> Please remember to declare your extra income. Thanks once again... <br>  <br> &quot;People have asked me if this is really legal. Well, it is! You are using <br> the Internet to advertise your business. <br> What is that business? You are creating a mailing list of people who are <br> interested in home based computer and <br> online business and methods of generating income at home. Remember, people <br> send <br> you a small fee to be added to your mailing list. It is legal. what will <br> you do with your list of thousands of names? <br> That's up to you.&quot; So, build your mailing list, keep good accounts, declare <br> the income and <br> pay your taxes. By doing this you prove your business intentions. Keep an <br> eye on the newsgroups and when the <br> cash has stopped coming (that means your name is no longer on the list), <br> you just take the latest posting at the <br> newsgroups, send another $6.00 to the names stated on the list, make your <br> corrections (put your name at #6) and <br> start posting again. <br>  <br> NOTES: <br> *1. In some countries, the export of the country's exchange is illegal. But <br> you can get the license to do this from <br> the post office, explaining the above statements (that you have an online <br> business, etc. You may have to pay an <br> extra tax, but that's OK, the amount of the incoming CASH is HUGE! And as I <br> said, a few countries have that <br> restriction . <br> *2. You may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future CASH. (Or <br> Database or Spreadsheet software.) <br> *3. If you're really not sure or still think this can't be for real, please <br> print a copy of this article and give it to <br> someone who really needs the CASH, and see what happens. <br> *4. You will start getting responses within 1-2 weeks, it depends. <br>  <br> ***ALSO REMEMBER*** <br> SEND YOUR $1 OUT TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST, <br> EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT FROM THE U.S. <br>  <br> WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? <br> $$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!
