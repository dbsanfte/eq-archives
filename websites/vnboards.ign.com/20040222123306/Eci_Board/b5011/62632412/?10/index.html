				Reminds me of the most painfull experience in my life, about 3 yers ago, working in a factory. I worked the ovens in a casting facility. We had ceramic molds that were heated up to between 2100 and 2350 degrees (depending on the job) which I would take out of the oven, and put in a machine that another person uses to fill the molds up with melted metal. Hot <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span>, rough job, but good money.  <br>  <br> The ovens were about 30 feet long, you put a steel tray on one end, put the mold on top of it, then use a hydraulic pusher to push it in the oven. Then you go in front, take a mold out, pull out the tray it was sitting on, and repeat the whole process... always had 15 or so steel trays in the oven.  <br>  <br> Got burned a few of times, mostly from the hot air that got under my saftey mask and burned off my eyelashes and other hair, some worse, (got a lot of burn blisters over the course of the time I was there, but nothing scarring or anything. Good $$.  <br>  <br> One thing you have to be carefull with is steel when it cools. First, it goes from bright yellow to black in about 5 minutes, so it looks cool even though it'll still set a newspaper on fire if you were careless. Second, as the metal contracts as it cools, little slivers pop off. We pull the trays out of the oven onto a cart, then put the cart in an open area where it will cool. At the end of the night, you'll have about 1 or 2 pounds of metal shavings that you have to sweep up. The trays had a life of about 6 months before they get shinned to the point where they get weak. You walk by one and you almost always get a small burn on your arm. That's what got me one Friday night when I was working the midnight shift.  <br>  <br> I was pushing a hot load of trays (oven was empty, pulled out all the empty trays, mad heat coming from the cart I was pushig) and I heard a pop, felt the metal shaving bounce off my chin. (ow.. but you get those little burns all the time there) Problem was it bounced off my chin, off the inside of my face shield, under my saftey glasses, and lodged in my eyeball. Went to the emergency room, doctor numbs my eyeball, then flushes it, tells me I'm good to go. I'm gratefull, because eye injuries are my worst nightmare (still can't stomach the eyeball scene in Terminator =/) and it hurt like <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span>. But all was good, got a ride from company security back to the factory.  <br>  <br> About 5 minutes after leaving the ER, I feel it. The painkiller was wearing off, and the pain was coming back with a vengeance. I was warned it would hurt for a few hours because my eyeball was burned. I was NOT looking forward to trying to sleep that night. The pain got worse and worse all night, and all weekend. I couldn't get out of bed.. every time I blinked I would see a flash of white and feel pain so bad I got nauseus. I threw up countless times, and kept on the Tylanol PM, because I was desperately trying to just sleep through it. You can't stay awake and keep your eyes shut, and you can't keep your eyes open without blinking. As the weekend went on, I was sure that it wasn't a burn, the metal HAD to still be there. The longest weekend of my life, I swear it lasted two weeks. Imagine feeling like you are going to <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span>, barf, get dizzy and fall over every time you blink. It was so shocking to the brain that I felt like the guy in Metallica's ONE, because the real world didn't exist to me, just this li  <br>  <br> I didn't sleep *at all* the entire weekend. Monday morning I had a follow-up appointment at the hosptal, which I was lucky enough to get a ride to. The doctor, who I'll go ahead and give his name, Doctor incompetent<span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span>, gave me a lookover, and asked how everything was. I looked at him as sarcastically as I could out of my good eye, unshaven, and unshowered for three days, and told him &quot;The metal is still in there, get it out, NOW.&quot;  <br>  <br> He looked in and assured me it was out, it was residual pain and some burnt tissue causing the pain. I called his <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span> and, risking my reputation as a calm and laid back individual, told him to get the goddamned peice of metal out of my eye or I'll rip his balls off. I'm in no mood for this. He again assured me that my eye was fine.  <br>  <br> I think back to a year earlier when I tore a ligiment in my thumb, and he told me I was able to go back to work (even though I couldn't carry a brick with that hand, much less the 85 pound molds) and discovered he wasn't a ER doctor, but a *company doctor* on call. Gets paid to get us back to work ASAP.  <br>  <br> So thinking about that time, I tell him he's the same <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span> that sent me back to work with an ACE bandage when in reality my ligaments were torn, and told him I have no confidence in his integrity or his competence as a health provider. He asks if I'd feel better seeing a specialist, I insist on it. He even had the balls to try and talk me out of it by saying I'd have to pay for it out of pocket! Asshole. He sets up an appointment across town for about 3 hours later. I'm there in 10 minutes.  <br>  <br> The receptionist takes one look at me, and pulls me into a room. The doctor takes me on in two minutes, X-rays me, and puts some fluid <span style="color: red;">[moderated]</span> in my eye that I was able to taste in the back of my throat. Some chemicals that numb the eye, and puts a dye in it so he can see foriegn objects. nasty. He gives it 5 minutes to do it's thing, whle he gets the X-rays.  <br>  <br> He walks back in and shows me a picture of my eye. A thin, bright line that went deep into my eye, with only the tiniest of tiny end of it poking out. It was the peice of metal. A quarter of an inch. Don't just imagine it, go find a ruler, and measure out a quarter of an inch. Then imagine a sliver of metal sticking that far into your eyeball. I almost fainted when I saw the picture, but I was just so relieved that yes, there was metal in there, and yes, this man can take it out and get rid of the pain. He leaves again for a minute.  <br>  <br> He comes back with a flashlight, and some tweezers. Pulls open my eyelid, reaches in with the tweezers which as an eye freak really scared me. I felt them pushing against my eyeball, and felt them grab hold of something. The outside of the eyeball was numb, not the *inside*. I never knew until that moment that, in certain situations, you could feel the inside of your eye. I know it hurts to look at a bright light, but that's kids play when it comes to an injury. I actually *felt* the insides of my eyeball that day. I actually get sweaty writing this when I think about the pain. I hope NONE of you ever feel it.  <br>  <br> The most excruciating moment of my life was when he pulled the monster sliver, thinner than a pice of hair, out of my eyeball. I could actually see the distortion as my eyeball held onto it, like pulling a spoon out of a cup of pudding. I had a towel in my mouth to hold back the screams I knew were coming, and I was at the mercy of the pain as I felt my stomach heave, and my bowels move. I just could not control them. The more he pulled the worse it hurt. My eyeball snapped back into shape, the tweezers pulled away, and the doctor leaned back. I swear I heard angels sing. I saw a blurry spot, which was some puss and eye fluid coming from the mild infection that had developed.  <br>  <br> &quot;I got it&quot; the doctor said, but I already knew that. Like a bad dream, the pain was fading quickly into just a bad memory. There was still a lot of discomfort, enough pain to make me buckle to my knees today, but at that point it was so miniscule compared to what I had just gone through for a couple days that this pain was like heaven to me. Another X-ray to make sure it was all out, a nice bandage, and I was on my way.  <br>  <br> I was dizzy from sleep loss, and my head didn't hit the pillow before I was asleep. Best sleep of my life. Got the week off of work, too.  <br>  <br> Got my revenge on the doctor about 6 weeks later, but that's a story for another Tuesday. In the meantime, just think Taco Bell, a gallon of Apple Juice, and a nice Mercedes Convertible with the top down.  <br>  <br>

				Company doctors/nurses all suck. There was a guy in my department a couple of years ago whos arm turned cold. After a couple of days of it, he went to see the company nurse. She did what she does for everyone, gave him a couple of ibuprofen and an ice pack and sent him back to work. That weekend the guys wife finally convinces him to go to the ER to have a doctor look at it. The guy had a bloodclot in his arm, thats why it was so cold. The doctor told him if he had waited just a few hours more he would have died. Legal action was tried against our nurse, but I guess it didn't work because she is still there handing out ibuprofen and ice packs.

				Until about 5 years ago I used to work in a Magnesium plant in Utah (MagCorp - worlds largest Chlorine poluter).  I have seen first hand how much of the Corporate Doctor thing goes on.  I was a brick mason for them working on a device that funneled the molten salt through a series of &quot;Strippers&quot; that would use Iron Oxide to burn the excess chlorine out of the melt.  Raw chlorine is introduced as catalyst to start a chain between the chemicals. At the time I was a member of the Steel Workers Union. <br>  <br> While working on the stripper, it was properly tagged off for maintenance and roped off, our Union President engaged the Chlorine valve sending a back pressure of chlorine through the system.  Due to condensation hydrochloric acid is formed and often in a mist form within the stripper, he then began to feed melt through it.  When the melt hit the acid and cool chlorine it exploded sending acid and gas into the air where my crew was working.  We ran for cover withour OSHA respirators on, I was the tail end to make sure my team got out safely.  A few hours later I started coughing up blood and was sent to the clinic.  They put me on pure Oxygen until my shift ended then said I would be fine the next day.  I returned the next two days to work only to continue caughing up blood and on Saturday went to a real doctor.  Preliminary tests showed that I had severe chemical burns in my throat and lungs almost to the point of respritory failure.  Seems the pure oxygen drove the HCL and Chlorine into my Alveoli.  I spent the next 18 months or oral and inhaled steroids just to bring my lungs to a functional level.  Even now any amonia in the air makes my lungs burn from the reaction. <br>  <br> Seems the nurse that saw to me in the clinic knew the dangers of O2 with the acid in my lungs but was asked to get me back on the site due to an imposing deadline.  I tried to sue but in Utah you are unable to take legal action against your employer, had this happened in California I would have never needed to work again. <br>  <br> I could go on and on about horror stories I personally witnessed like a man getting knocked into an electrolytics cell full of 2000 degree salt, lost his food and needed to have skin grafts on his entire right leg.  Or my very close friend (almost father in law) who had melt blow onto him burning 53% of his body in 3rd degree burns.  He spent a year in a medically induced coma while they tried to stabilize him.  Due to his burns he was able to help pioneer the use of cultured grown skin for grafts versus donnor areas on the body.  It has now been over 10 years and he goes into reconstructive surgery almost every 6 months.
