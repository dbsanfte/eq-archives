				http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20031230/ap_on_re_eu/france_war_coverage <br>  <br> Journalist Lambasts French War Coverage     <br> Tue Dec 30, 5:52 AM ET   <br>  <br> By ELAINE GANLEY, Associated Press Writer  <br>  <br> PARIS - Reporter Alain Hertoghe's book accused the French press of not being objective in its coverage of the U.S.-led war in Iraq. His newspaper fired him. <br>  <br> The book, &quot;La Guerre a Outrances&quot; (The War of Outrages), criticizes the French reporting for continually predicting the war would end badly for the U.S.-led coalition.  <br>  <br> &quot;Readers can't understand why the Americans won the war,&quot; Hertoghe said in a telephone interview. &quot;The French press wasn't neutral.&quot;  <br>  <br> The book, published Oct. 15, charges French reporters were more patriotic than journalistic and what was written amounted to disinformation.  <br>  <br> It examines daily coverage by five major French dailies, including Hertoghe's own La Croix, in the three weeks from the first strikes on Baghdad on March 20 to April 9 when Saddam Hussein's regime fell.  <br>  <br> &quot;As soon as there were a couple of wounded, of dead, they were talking about Vietnam, Stalingrad,&quot; Hertoghe said.  <br>  <br> In contrast, work by journalists traveling with U.S. troops indicated that &quot;the war was advancing well,&quot; he said.  <br>  <br> Hertoghe, a 44-year-old Belgian, said reporters reflected the emotional high in France more than realities on the battlefield, becoming caught up in France's central role in leading the opposition to the war at the United Nations.  <br>  <br> &quot;The French public was so carried away,&quot; he said. The journalists, he wrote in the book, &quot;dreamed of an American defeat.&quot;  <br>  <br> Hertoghe, who covered the 1991 Gulf War and the presidential campaign that put President Bush in the White House, was assistant editor-in-chief of La Croix's online version during the Iraq war.  <br>  <br> Besides war coverage in La Croix, the book examines that of the independent Le Monde, the conservative Le Figaro, the leftist Liberation and the regional daily Ouest-France, which has the largest circulation in France.  <br>  <br> Over three weeks, the five papers carried 29 headlines condemning Saddam's dictatorship and 135 blaming Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. <br>  <br> Hertoghe was fired on Dec.15 for a &quot;loss of confidence&quot; following publication of the book. La Croix, in a letter, cited four points, including damaging the newspaper's reputation, Hertoghe said.  <br>  <br> La Croix refused to comment.  <br>  <br> Efforts for comment from Le Monde &#8212; the paper Hertoghe targeted most severely &#8212; also were unsuccessful, with the international editor away on vacation. A Paris-based reporter cited in the book did not answer his phone.  <br>  <br> Only a free newspaper handed out in the Metro, &quot;20 Minutes,&quot; has so far reviewed Hertoghe's book.  <br>  <br> &quot;The silence is deafening&quot; in France, although there have been rave reviews in Belgium, said Ronald Blunden, editorial director at Hertoghe's publishing house, Calmann-Levy. <br>  <br>  <br> And from the International Herald Tribune (http://www.iht.com/articles/122993.html): <br>  <br> Largely ignored in the newspapers that it finds at fault, the book fits into an emerging series of critical analyses in Europe of the European news media's treatment of the war. In Britain, attention has focused on what has been described as the British Broadcasting Company's biased position against British participation. <br>  <br> In Germany, an independent media watchdog group, Medien Tenor, has produced a report, to be released next month, on the performance of television reporting of the conflict in Germany, Britain, the United States and other countries. It focuses notably on Germany's two main state-financed channels, finding that the United States was treated negatively. <br>  <br> A draft of the report, underwritten in part by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, says of the state networks: &quot;After assuming a position of sharp criticism of American military actions, abandoned only after their increasing success, and after fixating on the Iraqis as suffering victims, they created a representation of the war in line with the position&quot; of the German government. It continues, &quot;Critical questions concerning the extent to which the unrelenting German position contributed to the escalation of the conflict were thus kept from public scrutiny.&quot; <br>  <br> Criticism by Iraqis and Americans of the war &quot;dominated the coverage&quot; of the ZDF state channel's main newscasts, the group said. America's decision to go to war, it said, was juxtaposed by German television, &quot;with the supposedly unanimous opposition of the rest of the world.&quot; <br>  <br> But the dismissal of Hertoghe, 44, for making essentially the same characterization of the leading French newspapers, was unique. <br>  <br> A telephone call to the editor of La Croix, Bruno Frappat, requesting a comment on the firing was not returned. <br>  <br> &quot;I was fired because I wrote a book they didn't like,&quot; Hertoghe said. &quot;They think I hurt the paper, that I criticized it and hurt it - that's their position.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;I did not want to hurt La Croix's image and I don't think I did. I think La Croix participated in what was a collective slide, but the other papers were much greater disinformers.&quot; <br>  <br> Hertoghe's examination includes Le Monde, Le Figaro, Lib&#233;ration and Ouest-France as well as his own newspaper. <br>  <br> As an example, he compares headlines involving Saddam Hussein, President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain during the period. He said there were 29 clearly negative ones concerning Saddam, and 135 for Bush and Blair. The coalition leaders were routinely described, he says, as violent, imperialist, fundamentalist and unreasonable. <br>  <br> In the book, Hertoghe explains what he considers the press's unanimity not as the result of some kind of explicit understanding but coming from a combination of factors. He regards the single most cohesive element as French anti-Americanism. <br>  <br> The two other central motors, in Hertoghe's view, were France's nostalgia for its lost status as a great power and what he described as &quot;the Arabophilia that reigns among France's deciders and in particular among the journalists specializing in this part of the world.&quot; <br>  <br> Hertoghe writes of these French journalists, &quot;As a result of being permanently confronted with dictatorial, or at least authoritarian, states and abusive or even terrorist means, a kind of tolerance develops, which sometimes drifts into open complaisance.&quot; <br>  <br> Last week Hertoghe said that his &quot;problem&quot; was not &quot;anyone's opinion on the war, but that there were no diverse and opposing views on its legitimacy. Readers were not offered a debate.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;What bothered me more,&quot; he continued, &quot;was that reporting, when it was uncertain what was going on, fell into predictions of disaster because there were so many who wanted for everything to go wrong. As soon as there were problems on the ground for the United States, it was Vietnam.&quot; <br>  <br> Hertoghe said newspapers ignored reports from journalists traveling with U.S. forces, including those from Agence France-Presse, when they did not indicate insurmountable difficulties. <br>  <br> &quot;The papers wanted disaster, and when the reporting didn't reflect it, they predicted it,&quot; he said. <br>  <br> &quot;Le Monde went the furthest,&quot; he added. &quot;I wrote that Le Monde became 'Saddam's Gazette.' It gave a picture from Baghdad of Saddam's units perfectly controlling the situation. The difference between Le Monde and Le Figaro was that Le Figaro insisted that American tanks would operate easily on Baghdad's wide streets.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Then when the Americans made their move, we read how they were massacring the Iraqis. The explanation for the collapse was that Saddam's fedayeen had so much compassion for the population that they stopped fighting.&quot; <br>  <br> Despite the book's appearance under the imprimatur of a leading publisher, Hertoghe said he was invited to discuss it on only one radio and one television broadcast. <br>  <br> The only extensive review in print of the book, he said, appeared in a free newspaper available to commuters in Paris. <br>  <br> &quot;I tried to be totally fair in writing this,&quot; Hertoghe said. &quot;I thought that a journalist's conscience was more important to his newspaper than any other consideration it might have. I admit to having read my contract before the book appeared. But I never thought I would be fired.&quot;

				A French newscast on the War in Iraq: <br>   <br> Today, there were VERY few surrenders accepted by either side in this strange little war with it's odd lack of daily surrenderings.  A bakery was damaged in an attack this morning in Baghdad, but no baguettes or croissants were damaged.  No announcements were made taking credit for this terrorist attack, nor did anyone surrender, which surprised this journalist so much that I dropped my eclaire and nearly surrendered in my surprise.  No surrenders, how can this be?  It is a puzzlement! <br>  <br> -Pierre La Reddition, Paris Press Association

				 <br>  The French media is vastly different than ours.  Same for most European medias, hardly any of them claim to be objective, if you go to a news paper stand in lets say Paris you will find 9 different news papers, everything from Communist or anarchist perspective to extreme right wing.  Each is as widly circulated as the next.  Its not like the US where the media is controled by a few companies and a very few people.  You wont find any German or French paper or news program with the per capita circualation of Fox News or the USA today.   <br>  <br>  <br> And there are hundreds of writters that write about the faults of the US media, which is far worse than the French media.

				Chomsky: &quot;Nobody pays any attention to that accusation, except, interestingly, the population of the United States. In the last few months, there has been a spectacular achievement of government-media propaganda, very visible in the polls. The international polls show that support for the war is higher in the United States than in other countries. That is, however, quite misleading, because if you look a little closer, you find that the United States is also different in another respect from the rest of the world. Since September 2002, the United States is the only country in the world where 60 per cent of the population believes that Iraq is an imminent threat &#8211; something that people do not believe even in Kuwait or Iran. Furthermore, about 50 per cent of the population now believes that Iraq was responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre. This has happened since September 2002. In fact, after the September 11 attack, the figure was about 3 per cent. Government-media propaganda has managed to raise that to about 50 per cent. Now if people genuinely believe that Iraq has carried out major terrorist attacks against the United States and is planning to do so again, well, in that case people will support the war. This has happened, as I said, after September 2002. September 2002 is when the government-media campaign began and also when the mid-term election campaign began. The Bush Administration would have been smashed in the election if social and economic issues had been in the forefront, but it managed to suppress those issues in favour of security issues &#8211; and people huddle under the umbrella of power. This is exactly the way the country was run in the 1980s. Remember that these are almost the same people as in the Reagan and the senior Bush Administrations. Right through the 1980s they carried out domestic policies that were harmful to the population and which, as we know from extensive polls, the people opposed. But they managed to maintain control by frightening the people. So the Nicaraguan Army was two days' march from Texas, and the airbase in Grenada was one from which the Russians would bomb us. It was one thing after another, every year, every one of them ludicrous. The Reagan Administration actually declared a National Emergency in 1985 because of the threat to the security of the United States posed by the Government of Nicaragua. If somebody were watching this from Mars, they would not know whether to laugh or to cry. They are doing exactly the same thing now, and will probably do something similar for the presidential campaign. There will have to be a new dragon to slay, because if the Administration lets domestic issues prevail, it is in deep trouble. <br>       Right now it is cheerleading for the home team. Look at CNN, which is disgusting &#8211; and it is the same everywhere. That is to be expected in wartime; the media are worshipful of power. More interesting is what happened in the build-up to war. The fact that government-media propaganda was able to convince the people that Iraq is an imminent threat and that Iraq was responsible for September 11 is a spectacular achievement and, as I said, was accomplished in about four <br> months. If you ask people in the media about this, they will say, &quot;Well, we never said that,&quot; and it is true, they did not. There was never a statement that Iraq is going to invade the United States or that it carried out the World Trade Centre attack. It was just insinuated, hint after hint, until they finally got people to believe it.&quot; <br>

				&gt;&gt;if you go to a news paper stand in lets say Paris you will find 9 different news papers, everything from Communist or anarchist perspective to extreme right wing. Each is as widly circulated as the next.&lt;&lt; <br>  <br> Not really. There are three major daily newspapers that are similar to leading American newspapers like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. Their circulation is as follows: <br>  <br> 1. Le Monde - 416,774 <br> 2. Le Figaro - 364,721 <br> 3. Liberation - 166,275 <br>  <br> Then there is Le Parisien, a conservative daily newspaper somewhat along the lines of The Washington Times and the Daily News, with a circulation of 516,401. <br>  <br> Other daily newspapers occupy smaller, more specialized niches, e.g. La Croix is a &quot;family&quot; newspaper with a modest circulation of 96,629. Les Echo (146,710)and La Tribune (92,164) cover the economy and L'Equipe (334,790) covers sports. <br>  <br> The closest that leftist groups come to media presence as suggested above is l'Humanite, which is a weekly with a circulation of 50,312. <br>  <br> Source: Association Pour le Contr&#244;le de la Diffusion des M&#233;dias, 2002 (quoted at http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/DF_media-prt.shtml#)

				Trolic I dont think you understood the meaning of the origional post here.  Basically what they are saying is that the major newspapers in France decided to go along with the French governments stand on the war.  They did not print any objective articles at all. <br>  <br> Then again the same can be said for the US media.  I remember keeping a tally on the number of &quot;major&quot; substories that CNN and Fox came up with that were based on nothing but rumor.  It would start at the beginning of the day as a rumor (and reported as one), but by the end of the day everyone was reporting it as fact.  Never mind the FACT that they had no new information on it, or that nobody in the military had confirmed it. <br>  <br> In all I guess this goes to show that the French report on a war as well as they fight one.   <br>  <br> As for Iraq being an imminent threat to the US, I never did buy that.  Then again neither were the Vietnamiese or the Koreans.  <br>  <br> I do think that Iraq was a threat.  What would have happend if the coalition forces had pulled out of Kuait, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey?  How long would it have been before Iraq decided the Saudi oil fields were once a part of ancient Iraq?  Saddam came to power in the mid 70s.  The majority of the 80s were spent in a war with Iran, and a few years after that he invaded Kuait.  In the middle he managed to gas people of his own nation, and make threatening advances at Turkey.  The way I see it our choices were either to continue to send in forces to keep Saddam at home (which has invited terrorist attacks on the US), or to go in and take him out of power.  I think we took on the lesser of two evils. <br>  <br> Gralal Kindersoul <br> 65 Pally of Tribal Faith
