In my EQ experience, classes have <span style="font-weight:bold;">clearly defined</span> roles they must adhere to in order to be successful in PvE or on raids. <br>  <br> <i>We could even simplify this down to the fact no classes in EQ are useless all are desirable</i> <br>  <br> There is a &quot;holy trinity&quot; of almost required classes in a group (or raid) and the rest are just filler, and become less desirable the more you have.  But the problem now in EQ is not so much the classes as it is your AAs, equipment and spells--these determine your desirability. <br>  <br> <i>while in DAOC several classes are perceived as useless either in PvE or RvR and sometimes both depending on how they &quot;speced.&quot;</i> <br>  <br> There are certain specs that are definitely not optimal, but you have the choice of changing your spec and going for an entirely different one; no one is locked into a certain spec. <br>  <br> <i> In DAOC every class is locked into 1 single method of play and you do that from level 5 to 50.</i> <br>  <br> This is so untrue as to be laughable.  How can you just talk about specs and then turn around and say each class is locked into 1 single method of play?  By way of example, an Eldritch may spec primarily in Light for direct damage spells, but then respec (freely) at lvl 40 to Mana for point-blank AE spells and debuffs, which requires a totally different style of play. <br>  <br> If anything, it's EQ classes that are locked into 1 single method of play throughout their careers.  Don't like it? Start a new character. In DAoC, at least you have the option of respec'ing your character to a different spell line. <br>  <br> <i>I am not saying DAOC is the &quot;wrong choice&quot; for anyone, I am simply correcting your misinformation. </i> <br>  <br> No, you've presented misinformed opinion.  You've made several claims in regards to EQ that you don't support.  Do you still assert, for example, that &quot;EQ has by far the most variety in tactics and how you go about setting up winnable combat&quot;? <br>  <br> <i> You make vague claims about how much more varied the gameplay is in DAOC but the only specific evidence you give was DAOC has RvR- which is the same boring spam &quot;X 4 the win!&quot; gameplay as your PvE content.</i> <br>  <br> I didn't say &quot;varied&quot; I said &quot;involved&quot;, but both are true, if not for PvE, but definitely for RvR.  What good is spamming &quot;X 4 teh win&quot; against someone who's being protected by a shield/sword character or even bodyguarded?  It's certainly not going to help you if you run into a caster who decides to MoC. What if you're grappled or rooted?  <br>  <br> The point is, there are an infinite variety of combat situations in DAoC that actually require more thought and tactics than simply hitting a single button, as you do in EQ with auto-attack, your DD spells, or your heal spells.  Unless you're on the cutting edge of raiding in EQ, which is enjoyed by maybe 1% of the playerbase, pretty much every raid encounter is going to be known beforehand--what you do, the MOB's weaknesses, his special strengths, counters, etc.  Winning comes down to successfully executing a pre-ordained plan. <br>  <br>  <br> <i> Saying that it matters for the DAOC warrior which weapon he chooses because of damage modifiers is incorrect. All being locked into one weapon type does in DAOC is limit which type of mobs you are allowed to hunt- in a game that only had about 7 mob models to see when I played already.</i> <br>  <br> Again, this is so laughably untrue as to make me think the extent of your DAoC experience consists of a single month of play after the game's release. <br>  <br> There are certain armors and mobs in DAoC that are weak not only to a weapon type (slash, thrust, crush), but spell types as well (heat, cold, spirit, energy, etc.).  These don't limit which types of mobs (or players) you're allowed to hunt; all it does is provide certain bonuses or penalties based on what weapon you're using or spell your casting.  A slash weapon against a tree-type mob may give a bonus to slash weapons, but a penalty against thrust type weapons. That same tree-mob may be weak against fire spells, but strong against spirit spells, so you'll do more damage using the former rather than the later.  Contrast this to EQ which has none of the weapon-type bonuses and only a rudimentary version of the spell type bonuses (i.e., some mobs may be more resistant to a certain spell type). <br>  <br> In terms of MOB models...7? All I can say is...bahahah. There are certainly more MOB models in EQ than in any other game, but I find the graphics on them typically ugly, simple and blocky, but that's simply a matter of taste. <br>  <br> <i>The mentality in DAOC from every way you look at it is limiting your choices- you are locked into a certain &quot;spec&quot; you are locked into 1/3 of the content with the realm division- all the dungeons and 90% of the land are copy &amp; paste affairs, the much advertised &quot;styles&quot; are 50% useless and the other 50% are just as effective either repeatedly hitting the same one as choosing another based on the situation.</i> <br>  <br> More proof you're woefully misinformed (or deliberately spreading falsehood).  In contrast to being &quot;locked&quot; into a certain spec, you're free to choose.  I've changed the skill spec on my DAoC character about 4 or 5 times now, and the realm ability spec more times than I can count.  You can't play another realm on the same server, but this doesn't mean you can't play another realm on a DIFFERENT server.  As for the styles, again, not sure where you pull your figures (well, I can guess...), but in my experience most melee characters use up to 90% of all their styles.  How many styles does an EQ melee character have or even use? <br>  <br> The mentality of EQ, on the other hand, is just one huge timesink treadmill.  You PvE to gain more levels or AAs, which unlock higher raid content, giving you access to better loot, which leads to more raid content, new or easier PvE content, etcetera ad nauseum.   Many players find this sort of deep character development and exploration rewarding and challenging (if not time-consuming).  Acquiring a new Breastplate of Uberness that only a few others have after months of play is extremely gratifying.  I know I was quite happy when my ranger got both his epic swords (Swiftwind AND Earthcaller).

In my EQ experience, classes have clearly defined roles they must adhere to in order to be successful in PvE or on raids.&quot; <br>  <br> This is completely false. Druids and clerics are interchangable in PvE. Enchanters aren't necessary for successful crowd control. And Shadowknights and Paladins can tank xp mobs as well or better than warriors. <br>  <br> Necros and enchanters make great pullers. <br>  <br> I have over 1000 unused LDoN points. <br>  <br> &quot;We could even simplify this down to the fact no classes in EQ are useless all are desirable..&quot; <br>  <br> This is a true statement. <br>  <br> &quot;There is a &quot;holy trinity&quot; of almost required classes in a group (or raid) and the rest are just filler,&quot; <br>  <br> This is an out of touch and amazingly false out of date statement. No such thing as the holy trinity any more. <br>  <br> Rangers, Rogues, Wizards, Mages, druids, shaman, etc.. <br>  <br> Are not filler. every class has it's place.  <br>  <br> &quot;But the problem now in EQ..&quot; <br>  <br> Problem? Problem?? What problem?? Is there a solution?? What are you talking about?? <br>  <br> &quot;is not so much the classes as it is your AAs, equipment and spells--these determine your desirability.&quot; <br>  <br> Ridiculous. The only time I've ever seen a requirement on AA's is on a guild application. <br>  <br> I have yet to have anyone check my gear when asking me to join a group. <br>  <br> &quot;If anything, it's EQ classes that are locked into 1 single method of play throughout their careers. Don't like it? Start a new character. In DAoC, at least you have the option of respec'ing your character to a different spell line.&quot; <br>  <br> Utterly ridiculus. I've seen clerics that solo to 50. Druids that group till their 65. Rangers solo or group. Enchanters that charm solo or group. Necros can do anything they want. Monks that solo 50+. Mages solo or group. Wizards solo or group. Shadowknights and paladins that solo up to certain levels or group. <br>  <br> EQ classes have options. What are you talking about? <br>  <br> &quot;No, you've presented misinformed opinion. You've made several claims in regards to EQ that you don't support. Do you still assert, for example, that &quot;EQ has by far the most variety in tactics and how you go about setting up winnable combat&quot;? &quot; <br>  <br> And that's true. Completely true. Ever seen 1 bard and 5 wizards go into a dungeon and clear the whole thing in about 10 min? <br>  <br> Or all pet class xp groups? Necro, Mage, Beastlord, Druid, Shaman, and Necro. First Necro pulls with snare, dots the mob to get aggro, then everyon puts their pet on it. Mob dies in about 20 seconds. That was in Plane of Nightmare 3 nights ago. I was playing the necro that was doing the pulling. <br>  <br> &quot;..later. Contrast this to EQ which has none of the weapon-type bonuses and only a rudimentary version of the spell type bonuses (i.e., some mobs may be more resistant to a certain spell type).&quot; <br>  <br> None?? When's the last time you've played EQ? <br>  <br> EQ has weapons with special damage bonuses against just about everything; Summoned, undead... <br>  <br> Mobs that are 100% resistant to spells. 100% resistant to Fire. 100% resistant to Slow or snaring or rooting. <br>  <br> You're view of EQ seems woefully outdated. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23lockedtopic">Locked Topic</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=69026614" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=170581">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=170581">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/SuperSiabra?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">SuperSiabra</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star3.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="779 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/SuperSiabra"><font size="1">collection (0)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/SuperSiabra"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 779<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Feb 02<br></span><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;5/18/04 5:09pm&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Why is EQ so popular...even after 5 years.......Discuss :)</td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%">This DAoC-is-much-better claim is argumentative with accusations of &quot;laughable&quot; tosses in.

DAoC was one of the most boring games I've ever played and I've played them all ... or close to all of them. To me, DAoC is just an EQ clone with RvR as its endgames. Sad really. I always thought that EQ was one dimensional myself, but I finally played for a bit (short bit at that) and I can see I was wrong. <br>  <br> While the strength of a char is determined by level, gear and AA's ... even the most decked out char can be useless unless its played right. Give a noob that char and they will fail. That means that regardless of gear, there takes knowledge and skill to use your char. Something I think many overlook. <br>  <br> Wish I had the playing time to get into it, but I have a family and a life and I need to spend some time with them too.

Generally I agree with you.  The problem is that the belief among the players that a group has to be made up of this or that class is very strong.  So strong that it becomes a reality. <br>  <br> Its very frustrating sitting around waiting for a cleric while a perfectly decent druid is going around lfg, or passing up some great damage dealers because the rest of the group is convinced you have to have a second tank type (invite that wizzy? no way! we need a ranger or rogue!). <br>  <br> I've tanked for groups while playing a ranger.  It can be done if you have enough dps - which will really limit the amount of damage you'll take.

You can go to every class board and find a post from someone trolling the board saying their particualar class is worthless. This has been the case since EQ went live. <br>  <br> You can go over to the Safehouse forum and see Rogues complaining that they are worthless because they don't see themselves out damaging the Wizards. <br>  <br> Proves nothing. <br>  <br> &quot;There is a &quot;holy trinity&quot; of almost required classes in a group (or raid) and the rest are just filler,&quot;  <br>  <br> &quot;This is an out of touch and amazingly false out of date statement. No such thing as the holy trinity any more.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;Really? Then why:&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;While you can get away with off-the-wall groups in normal LDON's, you are gonna have a heck of a time doing that in hards and most of GoD.&quot; <br>  <br> So? I doubt very seriously a Ranger will be tanking the Avatar of War any time soon. <br>  <br> Your argument is very flawed. You are using extremes to try to prove your point and not addressing the alternatives or the middle areas. <br>  <br> And your quote above is still false. Because I regularly group in the Ferubi zone, in GoD. And the only constant is that a 65 SK is our main tank. <br>  <br> I've been there on a couple occasions with a Druid as the main healer. A BL as the only slower. Bard as the puller... <br>  <br> Your Holy Trinity statement, meaning, you abolutely have to have Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter is patently false. <br>  <br> The only time I've been with the &quot;holy trinity&quot; in GoD was when my wife and I, her main is a 65 cleric, teamed up with a Warrior/Chanter husband wife team. Then we invited 2 others. <br>  <br> But it was not due to neccessity. <br>  <br> And that 65sk is also the main tank on the Hard LDoN's we do. I'd be happy to let anyone login to the Povar server and introduce you to her. <br>  <br> &quot;A ranger tanking, with a necro healing, and a bard slowing just ain't gonna cut it. &quot; <br>  <br> Straw man argument. You're using extremes again to  try and prove your point. You wouldn't have a warrior with maxed bind wound skill being your main healer either. <br>  <br> A necro isn't a healer. A ranger is a melee same as a rogue, but a ranger isn't a tank. <br>  <br> A Druid, however after 58th level is a good healer. Not as perfect as a Cleric, but definitely usable. <br>  <br> &quot;You need a heavy duty tank, a heavy duty healer, and a heavy duty slower.&quot; <br>  <br> This is NOT what is meant by the term &quot;holy trinity&quot; in EQ. The &quot;holy trinity&quot; is Warrior, Cleric, and Enchanter combo. Those classes exclusively. <br>  <br> Sk and a Druid and a Necro. There ya go. <br>  <br> Necro's can slow undead 70%. Druids get a 5k heal. And the SK in my guild has 9000 hit points buffed. <br>  <br> There is no holy trinity of EQ anymore. <br>  <br> &quot;All 3. Having a dedicated pulling class such as a monk or bard also helps tremendously.&quot; <br>  <br> Does it? I rarely have either in my group. Rarely if ever. You do know SKs and Necros can FD pull right? <br>  <br> Or have clerics, chanters, druids, or rangers Harmony or Pac pull in some situations always works just as good. <br>  <br> The holy trinity of EQ was, Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter. <br>  <br> You seem to be skewing this into skills instead of classes. <br>  <br> &quot;No such thing as a &quot;holy trinity&quot; any more? Riiiiight.&quot; <br>  <br> After reading your latest response I'm not convinced that you know what is actually meant by the term &quot;holy trinity&quot;. <br>  <br> &quot;EQ has by far the most variety in tactics and how you go about setting up winnable combat&quot;? &quot;  <br>  <br> &quot;And that's true. Completely true.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;That's fine. EQ to me is very one dimensional in that it's one long treadmill of character development. Its PvE is fairly bland, quests are a chore and a tremendous timesink, and raids are simply exercises in executing a script.&quot; <br>  <br> That's a troll..but I'll answer anyways. <br>  <br> I play a Rogue. And sneaking across the Plane of Hate, alone mind you, in order to steal a quest piece off the night stand of a boss mob was anything but bland.

It is just 1 example of a guy who hates to see other classes gain lesser-versions of what he considers &quot;his&quot; toys.  <br>  <br> All his examples in your qoute are false or misleading anyway, like hinting that the ability to slow is what makes or break the shaman class. It is what most players think of first and shamans are clearly still the best at that one ability but it is just one of many things a well-played shaman brings to a group. Clerics said this same thing when shamans and druids gained 10 sec CH heals, but it obviously didn't change how much in demand clerics are, it just made the healers far more interchangeable and still diverse. <br>  <br> Your other qoute refers to the last 5% of the high end of the game, where everyone still has a role, it just changes to reflect what your class is best suited to do because minor mistakes or the difference in an extra 1000 hps can make or break winning the encounter. Even here sufficent gear or AAs can overcome these requirements (with the one exception of clerics, there are places where you just cannot win without a few clerics). Would you claim in DAOC's &quot;endgame&quot; of keep raiding you do not need tanks/melee? or do not need crowd control classes? Your claim that some classes bring little to nothing to a raid is also totally false, the only person that adds nothing to a raid is someone /afk that returns only to roll or that gets themselves and others killed within the first 5 seconds through the inability to follow a plan. <br>  <br> This gets back to my original point, in the other 95% of EQ content players based purely on their knowledge of the game can play and succeed through varied tactics- class is secondary. No you do not NEED crowd control or slowing, or tanks or even a pure healer to succeed in the other content, you can change your tactics to suit each situation. This is the difference, in DAOC everyone only has 1 way to win, 1 way to advance, 1 place to raid, 1 place to even really find people to fight in RvR in a practical manner. You say having &quot;specs&quot; gives people more choices- I say your &quot;mana&quot; spec caster is still just hitting 2 buttons to win just like the &quot;light&quot; spec caster you see different graphics but the effect and how you set up and win the fight is exactly the same be it PvE or RvR where you say its all different but in fact any variance means you either need to be running or you will die in seconds. If you took all 3 &quot;spec&quot; paths of the above DAOC caster, rolled all those abilities into a single class and then added dozens more unique spells you have a single EQ wizard. <br>  <br> As the start of this argument was comparisons with the state of affairs in DAOC I would advise anyone here that actually cares enough to just go to DAOC's IGN boards and scan the top most thread subjects. All you will see are whines about how this class or that &quot;spec&quot; is worthless in RvR, PvE, or both. Now, no online message board is an authority on anything, even online games, but I do not need to dig up one qoute from an embittered player from a random board to illustrate the points I was making. <br>  <br> I will also repeat that the only claim you made I have no argument with was how RvR in DAOC &quot;can:&quot; be the most varied gameplay out there. But, again, understand, it's because of the players getting creative, setting up ambushes, stealth attacks and so on and other things no AI is capable of, it has nothing to do with the actual game mechanics or what abilities classes have, in fact if anything the basic game of DAOC only holds the RvR back due to inbalances and nonsensical things like the interrupt code. If most of RvR was like this I would be much more generous to DAOC, but the sad fact is 90% of RvR consists of gank/zerg-groups running around with 30+ people running around destroying single groups or those sad individuals trying to solo in realm warfare. That involves no tactics, it's simply hitting /stick or /assist and firing away with your best damage spell or style repeatedly. <br> <p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23lockedtopic">Locked Topic</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=69155901" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=559276">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=559276">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/KoneThane?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">KoneThane</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star4.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="1,855 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/KoneThane"><font size="1">collection (0)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/KoneThane"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 1,855<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Jan 02<br></span><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;5/20/04 6:07pm&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Why is EQ so popular...even after 5 years.......Discuss :)</td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%">&quot;Why does anyone complain?

Besides, it's 100x more difficult to balance for PvP than PvE. &gt;&gt; <br>  <br> Hahah excuse me but this statement of &quot;wrong game&quot; stings from my memory.  When DAoC first began it was announced as a PvE game with PvP &quot;option&quot;.  We were told we'd never have to do RvR, and that was why you could only do PvP in the frotiers.  It was a marketing ploy that fooled many EQ players into moving to DAoC.  By 4 weeks into the game the DAoC boards began its first wave of nerf calling, and when those of us who went there for PvE tried to say it was runing our PvE aspects, we were ignored and told by the PvP crowd of players that we were in the &quot;wrong&quot; game.  In that debate I posted a direct quote by Mythic in their pre-release annoucement specifically saying PvP was an option to this PvE game. <br>  <br> I couldn't believe these PvP players would dictate what the game was. <br>  <br> You seem to love quotes.  I wish I can find that quote to show you now.  Anyway, after watching Mythic's nerf bat for the next 2 months I realized Mythic's true intention was in RvR, and they really were just trying to lure EQ players into it with their propaganda of &quot;PvP being an option&quot;.  So I left. <br>  <br> DAoC became a domain for PvP people who even suggested to can all the PvE content to just go directly to level 50 so they could do RvR.  Why have PvE at all? Duh.  And I agree with them.  Mythic should have made a Seige game with characters who can battle in the seige at level one and win abilities up the rank.  That's what Shadowbane was gearing toward. <br>  <br> And neither DAoC nor SB is more popular than EQ.  DAoC is indeed the wrong game.  EQ is the right game for PvE. <br>  <br> DAoC left such a bad taste for me the moment I heard AC2 would have &quot;optional PvP&quot; I refused to play it.  Yes, PvP is much harder to balance, and I refuse to beta a PvP game for any developer. <br>  <br> Lineage 2 is starting to sound the same, with tons of boring level grinding to get to Castle seige.  I will not touch it either. <br>  <br> Now CoH isn't bad in the sense that it is combining missions at lower level for PvE with PvP in the next expansion.  Will there be less balancing issues then DAoC once its PvP City Of Villans launches? That remains to be seen. <br>  <br> I am happy EQ2 announces with honesty that it will be mostly a PvE game. <br>  <br>  <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">Socializer 80% <br> Explorer 60% <br> Achiever 53% <br> Killer 6% <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23lockedtopic">Locked Topic</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=69160887" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=639832">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=639832">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/SuperSiabra?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">SuperSiabra</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star3.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="779 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/SuperSiabra"><font size="1">collection (0)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/SuperSiabra"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 779<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Feb 02<br></span><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;5/20/04 7:12pm&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Why is EQ so popular...even after 5 years.......Discuss :) - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Edited:</span>&nbsp;5/20/04 7:21pm (1 edits total) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edited By:</span> <a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/SuperSiabra?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">SuperSiabra</a></td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%">Re: Every class in EQ is broken. <br>  <br> I think EQ has the best, albeit not perfect, class blance in the MMORPG games I've tried.

I've played just about all of them and this is the one I keep coming back to.  <br>  <br> DAOC bored the <span style="background-color: DarkGray;"><span style="color: MidnightBlue;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">[Mod]</span></span></span> out of me. Nice eye candy but fighting variations of 4 or 5 mobs got boring, as did the lack of newbies around under level 20. The death penalty in DAoC took all the thrill out of fighting as if I died, I lost nothing and only had to see a healer to get much of my xp back. The game world was so small and making up for this by having the toons run slow was maddening. Finally, all the bots and people running 2 or 3 applications at once so they could cheat was the final straw. Mythic loves its cheaters. Also, ToA was a ridiculously bad expansion that successfully chased away scores of people.

The quote was to cast doubt on whether, as you said, all classes were desirable. <br>  <br> <i>Your claim that some classes bring little to nothing to a raid is also totally false,</i> <br>  <br> Again, that's not what I said.  I said that the value of certain classes falls dramatically the more you have on a raid. How many CC'ers do you need? Buffers? Slowers? Pretty much just a couple of each, particularly if they have some of the more advanced AAs. <br>  <br> <i>this gets back to my original point, in the other 95% of EQ content players based purely on their knowledge of the game can play and succeed through varied tactics- class is secondary. No you do not NEED crowd control or slowing, or tanks or even a pure healer to succeed in the other content, you can change your tactics to suit each situation.</i> <br>  <br> Pardon me, but this may be true for PvE (like LDoN raids), but not for raiding.  Players may spend 95% of their time in PvE, but they're doing it to improve their characters for raiding (EQ's end-game), which is where the best loot is. <br>  <br>  <br> <i>This is the difference, in DAOC everyone only has 1 way to win, 1 way to advance, 1 place to raid, 1 place to even really find people to fight in RvR in a practical manner. You say having &quot;specs&quot; gives people more choices- I say your &quot;mana&quot; spec caster is still just hitting 2 buttons to win just like the &quot;light&quot; spec caster you see different graphics but the effect and how you set up and win the fight is exactly the same be it PvE or RvR where you say its all different but in fact any variance means you either need to be running or you will die in seconds.</i> <br>  <br> LOL...man, you're so out of it, I can't believe you think you can even talk about DAoC. <br>  <br> <i>If you took all 3 &quot;spec&quot; paths of the above DAOC caster, rolled all those abilities into a single class and then added dozens more unique spells you have a single EQ wizard.</i> <br>  <br> How many of those spells do wizards actually USE? Someone else already agreed with me that basically the wizard just nukes when a mob is 1/2 to 1/3rd life.  <br>  <br> <i>I would advise anyone here that actually cares enough to just go to DAOC's IGN boards and scan the top most thread subjects. All you will see are whines about how this class or that &quot;spec&quot; is worthless in RvR, PvE, or both. </i> <br>  <br> They should go, because they'll see that this is BS. What you will see is mostly questions regarding specs and the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one spec over the other. <br>  <br> <i>But, again, understand, it's because of the players getting creative, setting up ambushes, stealth attacks and so on and other things no AI is capable of, it has nothing to do with the actual game mechanics or what abilities classes have</i> <br>  <br> ROFL...this makes no sense. Re-read it. <br>  <br> <i>If most of RvR was like this I would be much more generous to DAOC, but the sad fact is 90% of RvR consists of gank/zerg-groups running around with 30+ people running around destroying single groups or those sad individuals trying to solo in realm warfare.</i> <br>  <br> There's a wide-variety of RvR: zergs, gank groups, keep defenses, keep takes, relic raids, etc.  Whatever it is, it's more variety than EQ's PvE, which is the same basic stuff over, and over and over again. <br>  <br> In any case, DAoC's new RvR expansion is going to eliminate many of the problems in the game's current RvR set up. <br>  <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">A MMOG'er since '91 <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23lockedtopic">Locked Topic</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=69318173" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=711702">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=711702">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/Malkosha?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">Malkosha</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star4.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="3,685 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/Malkosha"><font size="1">collection (0)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/Malkosha"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Title:</span> Beating Dead Horses Since April of 2000 <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 3,685<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Apr 00<br></span><img border=0 hspace=8 vspace=8 src="http://vaultmedia.ign.com/vnboards/UO.gif" width="80" height="80" alt="8320" name="8320" id="8320" class="IconImage"><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;5/24/04 10:12am&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Why is EQ so popular...even after 5 years.......Discuss :)</td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%">This is almost too funny. <br>  <br> This thread is supposed to be about why EQ is still popular after all these years, but has turned instead into a DAoC fanboi fest. <br>  <br> Lets kill that right now.  <br>  <br> DAoC has been and always will be a pretty but poorly concieved EQ clone with buff bots and RvR as an endgame.

Accept it, deal with it and grow. <br>  <br> Now if we are through with this DaoC nonsense ....  <br>  <br> When you look at what's comming for EQ in the future in terms of expansions, will what has kept it going for the last 5 yers give it another 5 years? <br>  <br>  <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">Hard Work Pays Off After Time <br> But Laziness Pays Off Now <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23lockedtopic">Locked Topic</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=69321024" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=20118">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=20118">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/SuperSiabra?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">SuperSiabra</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star3.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="779 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/SuperSiabra"><font size="1">collection (0)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/SuperSiabra"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 779<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Feb 02<br></span><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;5/25/04 7:29pm&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Why is EQ so popular...even after 5 years.......Discuss :) - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Edited:</span>&nbsp;5/25/04 7:41pm (2 edits total) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edited By:</span> <a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/SuperSiabra?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">SuperSiabra</a></td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%">&lt;&lt;There are far fewer people playing DAoC than are playing EQ.&gt;&gt; <br>  <br> That's the bottom line. <br>  <br> As for the future of EQ, the next expansion is going to be important.  GoD kind of bombed.  I can see GoD tried to address what many players wanted.  It has single-group instanced zones that has no time limit.  (When LDoN came out, many people wanted to rid the time limit.)  With the flag progression, GoD is kind of the single-group alternate to PoP to elite loot.  Again an attempt to address the more causual players. <br>  <br> But there are several problems: <br>  <br> 1) The sewer/mountain trial zones are so ugly. They remind me of the generic zones.  LDoN zones are much more interesting.  I have fun camping LDoN night after night, but sewers give me a generic feeling.  They are not fun for me to look at. <br>  <br> 2) The reward system is back to &quot;win or lose&quot;.  No more favor points.  This combined with the difficulty of GoD made people unwilling to go.  I much prefer to spend mega time in LDoN where I can always get some favor points even if I lose all rolls on dropped loot.  In GoD, I can end up with nothing for hours of work. <br>  <br> When we first went to GoD we had a 9k hp tank and a uber cleric with FT15.  Within 3 mobs in the sewer our cleric had to cry low on mana. This is why enchanters are asked to charm the mob, since it can save clerics mana. And with a charmed pooka yeah I can kill the mob in 10 seconds, but.... <br>  <br> One night I charmed a pooka in vxed for 4 hours which is pretty stressful like sitting on a time bomb cuz the mob hits for 1200 and I had to watch it like a hawk and handle it the moment it broke charm.  The mobs hit so hard, cleric had to med, and when people went afk medding, they at least got a break, but they left me alone to watch my pet.  I could not even go AFK or take my eyes off my pet for 2 seconds.  It began to feel like work of the worst kind, not play. <br>  <br> After 4 hours of what felt like painful work, I killed enough mobs to start up the path--only to have the group's attempt in getting a Named halfway up the path end up wiping our group.  The pally didn't gain aggro for 2 seconds, and the mob killed the shaman who tried to slow it, then killed my pet.  It was too frustrating and a waste of my time as far as I felt. <br>  <br> I talked to my friends and they all have the same experience.  The slightest error from any one in the group can cause the whole group to wipe losing hours of work. <br>  <br> The tank I know with 9k hp told me it is too stressful for him to do GoD.  I can sense his unhappiness.  He had spent a lot of effort gaining his equipment, and yet GoD made him so vulnerable he was worse off than a newbie facing an orc pawn.  Newbie can have more time running to the guard, hehe.  Next thing CoH came out and he's gone.  At first I thought it was just him, but there is something going on now... <br>  <br> Even when I put up LFG for GoD, I seldom get a group there, cuz in order to make a group in GoD you need an uber tank and uber cleric first.  So I'm playing LDoN most days. <br>  <br> It used to take me 15 min or so to get a group for LDoN.  The last 2 weeks, however, it's been harder and harder to fill a LDoN group--mostly due to a shortage of tanks.  As an enchanter, I was getting tells from 4 or so great clerics a night asking me to group, but no tanks were around.  We end up milling for up to 2 hours before we are able to form a group even for LDoN. <br>  <br> What's going on?  I personally know only one tank that left for CoH.  But this shortage of tanks is making me wonder if many tanks ditched EQ for now over their depression at how quickly they die in GoD. <br>  <br> Anyway, with the promise of new level cap some of us are looking forward to trying GoD at 70.  Others are wondering if the new expansion will be just as unpleasant as GoD. <br>  <br> With EQ2 and WoW coming out, if the next expansion is not fun, I can see EQ losing the crown. <br> <p></p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span><div class="SignatureText">Socializer 80% <br> Explorer 60% <br> Achiever 53% <br> Killer 6% <br>  <br> </div></td></tr><tr align="right" valign="bottom"><td colspan=2 class="BoardRowB"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23lockedtopic">Locked Topic</a> | <a href="/active_topic_notify.asp?mes=69408587" class="BoardRowBLink">Active Topic Notification</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/pm_send.asp?usr=639832">Private Message</a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="/user_posts.asp?usr=639832">Post History</a></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top" class="BoardRowA"><td class="BoardRowA" rowspan=3 width="17%"><a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/nvrsbr?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">nvrsbr</a>&nbsp;<a href="/help/default.asp?goto=faqs%2Easp%23stars"><img align=absmiddle src=http://media.ign.com/boardimages/star4.gif border=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 alt="2,457 posts"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- WISH & COLL STUFF --><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr class="BoardRowA"><td nowrap="false" class="BoardRowA"><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/collection/nvrsbr"><font size="1">collection (0)</font></a> | <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="http://users.ign.com/wishlist/nvrsbr"><font size="1">wishlist (0)</font></a></td></tr></table><!-- /WISH & COLL STUFF	--><span style="font-weight: bold;">Posts:</span> 2,457<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registered:</span> Feb 04<br></span><img border=0 hspace=8 vspace=8 src="http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/ignoddities_insiderstupidicon.gif" width="80" height="80" alt="12175" name="12175" id="12175" class="IconImage"><br></td><td class="BoardRowA" colspan=2 width="83%"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Posted:</span>&nbsp;5/26/04 6:12am&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span> RE: Why is EQ so popular...even after 5 years.......Discuss :) - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Date Edited:</span>&nbsp;5/26/04 6:13am (1 edits total) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edited By:</span> <a href=" http://users.ign.com/about/nvrsbr?boards=vn " class="AuthorLink">nvrsbr</a></td></tr><tr valign=top><td class="BoardRowB" colspan=2 width="83%">Yikes....
