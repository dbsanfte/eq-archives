				This guild is a total joke. They don't stand for honor considering they have members the likes of Kellian and Angele, formerly unofficially voted &quot;the most pathetic couple on Norath&quot;. What happens when you pair a 32 year old divorced druggie outcast with an std and a 19 year old cheater? Too bad, so sad. It's a harbour for social misfits and outcasts, their guild leader Luladen no exception. They are best avoided by any polite company. Kellian, formerly Bayllara, and Angele, formerlly Xendel/Amande were also well known for their misdeeds and infidelities across the lands. Xendel involved with at least three known relationships with other chars while she married Bayllara, and Kellian a class all his own for his disgusting and disgraceful RL situation. All those who would associate with the likes of these people hereby have an early warning: Stay clear or share in their corruption.  <br>  <br>     I was engaged to be married to Merilie, Angeles other char. She would have married me except that I discovered one, then two other relationships she had going on with other chars concurrently plus this marriage and would of course have nothing to do with her after. She and others who use the game for such infidelities are a menace. If the purpose of a marriage in RL is to imply faithfulness to one person then what is the point of marrying in eq? &quot;Just a game&quot; but then again real-life people are involved, and real live people spend hours upon hours interacting in the game. I have met so many who escape here to add some spice away from real relationships instead of spending the time to fix them. It's a good excuse not to exercise ones morals and is disgusting how the anonimity of eq is abused.  <br>  <br> Sincerely, Syedoth

				I shouldnt respond to such a message as you have posted, and frankly I dont think a message of this type should be on the boards at all. First, I would like to say that Crescent Dominion is a good guild and as a member, Ive always tried to represent the guild in my gameplay to the best of my abilities. I am a cleric and I heal, buff, rez and assist other players in the game whenever I can. Luladen is a respected and fair guild leader. Yes, last year Merilie was engaged to your character Turinth, but when you left the game I did delete her. I later married Kellian, at that time Bayllara with a new character I created Xendel. We have changed our names to avoid your harassment of us. I had to delete my 40 cleric, and others because of you. I made a new cleric Angele in September and worked relentlessly, and now Im 46. But youve hunted for me til you found my new characters so you could continue your tirade. Kellian is a player that has my respect. He is a fair, helpful, decent fellow, and a fun person to be with as any who have grouped with him could attest. He has never cursed, followed, harassed, questioned acquaintances and attempted to besmirch anyones name all over various gameboards. Im an A student at University, a member of my church choir that I attend every Sunday, a volunteer, a decent girl that lives at home and helps with 3 brothers and a sister. Im mature enough to select my friends and guild, and I think Ive chosen well.

				Between us we have wrote over 1200 emails. When I left eq it was with the promise of return and the continuance of our engagement in eq, and when I did return it was you who did assure me that you intended to marry as before. That was with Aramore, and Aerie, both new characters we had made. At this same time I discovered you were adventuring with Loych, who was power-levelling you. You carried on adventuring with him after I was surprised about it and spoke about how it bothered me. I knew something was up when you then remade a druidess to adventure with him behind my back. When I spied on you one day to discover the truth of the situation, you emoted kissing him and &quot;sitting on his lap&quot;. That was the official end of our engagement. But there was more, a lack of explanation as to gaps in your normal eq regimen. A mis-sent email from you intended for him. After more questioning I discovered you had married another, and would not reveal to me or him about the other. After yet more questioning Iwas told his name, because he deserved to know. I proved then that we had been together to him, and it seems that you called us both &quot;dearest&quot; in letters all teh time, had not asked us to see other people in the game, and in the meantime did whatever you liked with your other multiple characters. You know attending church will sound very good in your post, so do I. It doesn't mean you were bound to good or wholesome morals. This is all past, we have discussed it enough and forgiven each other for it in any case.  <br>  <br>      If you could hear what this mans past was, you would just cringe. I investigated after some very dubious things he said to me in email, out of concern for you, the one I loved and who was with someone I knew nothing about. What I discovered grieved me too deeply. After speaking with old Rl aquintances of his I knew that the character behind the mask never deserved such fair company as yours. Since he cannot persue a RL relationship he has relied on you to fulfill that fantsy for him. You have gone along with this based on his in-game conduct. <br>  <br>     The fact remains that you use this game as a dating service, and don't care how you lead people on along the way. You have not seemed to change, and have always avoided addressing what is truly important. Your father deleted your character out of concern whom his daughter was with, and very rightfully so. Instead you returned and probably disrespect his wishes to this day. So far as maturity, you have been very nieve.  <br> I do not care that you have disregarded what I found out about Kellian, you will see another side you like instead. You remain with a very disgusting individual, and will likely see others who suit your fancy behind his back.  <br>  <br>     How many others are like you on this server and others? It's appalling, and internet relationships are a very vulnerable and sad way to be with people will remain my conviction after meeting you. You are very ready to tout your good points I notice, these I don't deny.  <br>  <br> Sincerely, <br> Syedoth

				Well, we know these posts are not about Crescent Dominion. I dont feel the need to discuss what I do in game or publish it over all the boards, only as it relates to other innocent parties. I consider Loych a friend. You insinuate Loych and I were having an affair that day in greater faydark which is entirely untrue. I was on orc hill fighting when you came along as &quot;Innuendo&quot; and approached Loych for help. He buffed and healed you, as well as me. You flirted outrageously with him and sent me many &quot;mistells&quot;. When I went to town to sell  we discussed Innuendos behaviour and I indicated that it might be you. We moved on to CB entrance so that I could take more higher level orcs and you followed, interrupting during combat. When I sat down and you continued, I emoted &quot;sits on Loychs lap and kisses him&quot;, as I was determined to put an end to it, altho Im sure it surprised Loych as much as you. So you revealed yourself at last. Only I didnt know it would begin an endless campaign of harassment. <br>  <br> Your campaign continued with following, questioning friends, vulgar shouts about my character in endless zones, postings on boards, letters to guilds about my character,vulgar and demeaning email to me and your persistant search for my characters even after i renamed them or recreated. You threatened Kellian in tells and emails. You ordered an email &quot;investigation&quot; ,so you told me ,which is entirely fabricated and maligns character of Kellian in his real life and spread that disinformation in the game. Ive married only Bayllara/Kellian in the game and we are decent and fair players. Thats all anyone could ask of us.

				These posts are also about Crescent Dominion, whom consider honour and integrity their hallmarks. It has become moreso about you only because you responded though there is a lot more to say about guild which would at the same time be fair to say. There were others you hurt along the way in the same manner, there was the whole Ashra incident from which I understand was some kind of a trade rip off against others, and the whole situation on Brell you carried on with. With the way you have acted behind paramours backs this year I am only mentioning a little because I don't Need to be comprehensive after what I have already said.  <br>  <br> So far as Loych goes that entire day and the previous day and before anything was done or said, you sat across from him every time you took a  break practically on his lap anyway. Only couples in eq do that under most circumstances. The only thing missing there was any graphic emotes...every time you took a break. There I was, your eq-fiance, bothered by your intimate contact with another man. You told me you longer adventured with him. Meantime you  remade a druid and carried on as before. It was entirely to be expected I was very hurt and bitter about this, the first I knew of your ways. In the meantime you had been married for 2 months anyway so whoop-de-do right? Something this minor in your eyes shouldn't deserve any attention, should it? Your concience was already seared and you couldn't emphasive with me because you had already gone way too far. Both affairs were absolutely disgraceful, and your conduct was disgusting. Loych was very grateful to know about what else was truly going on, and sent me tells afterwards thanking me on several occasions. <br>  <br>   Since your eq-husband deserved to know how far you were going behind his back, I persisted looking since you would not reveal his name. <br> Had I known he would turn out to be as he was in real-life I still would have cared to tell him. At the time and before any of the above you mention, very eggagerated I might add,  it was out of respect to him. I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON DOING WHAT YOU SPEAK OF. You have hurt many this year and they reacted in their own ways. My investigations into his real-life were over a month and a half and involved five sources Plus numerous phone calls. They ARE NOT fabricated though he has managed to convince you otherwise and you have only chosen to deny the reality. I would not persist in saying so if they were otherwise, by this point. <br>  <br>    You know as well as I do one important reason why this comes to light when it does. Who are the two people I am not mentioning here currently? Your other eq-character and her present boyfriend. I happen to like the guy, he is decent and doesn't deserve what you are doing behind his back. I have adventured with you both and believe the he would treat you honourably, fairly, and in an above-board fashion. Kellian on the otherhand I have every good reason not to like. I know he doesn't care what else you do, and will do nothing to endanger his situation. He also lacked any self-respect to break things off when he first starting figuring out what you were also up to. He's only there for being so hard-pressed himself. That does not mean other people are going to be like him, most would not and have not carried on with someone who behaves as you have with other adventurers in eq behind their backs.  <br>  <br>     I see you setting another up in the same manner as you have us this year, the others I have spoke with over time in eq. I will not see you ready to commit eq-polygamy again without saying something of the subject, knowing how you have hurt people. I do not want to expose this if possible, but will if you persist with both. I write so that you will do the right thing on your own, as you ought to have in the past. Change your ways and stop hurting people.

				Hiya Syedoth, ol stalker pal.  Still up to your crap?  Well, we'll let everyone know how &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;respectable&quot; you are when i post all your email threats and your so called &quot;contacts within the Sony Station&quot; and your &quot;admission to stalking and harrassing&quot;  I've already forwarded the real life threats to the police. You were dumped, get over it.  Get a life.  Anyone wanting any search on me can find me.  my name is Donald Jeandervin AW1, United States navy, yes i am 32 and divorced, but thats about all you didnt make up.  I welcome any searches by anyone, i have nothing to hide.  I would like to read a book you write someday with that creative imagination you have.  Oh, and if anyone thinks his email threats are fake, feel welcome to request a forward to track them back for yourselves <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  <br> Grow up little guy and get over it.  The police sure are interested, im sure others will be too <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">   Until then, im done with this childishness of yours.   <br> Kellian

				So the snake finally shows his head? Hello Kellian. Yes it was a war of words via email for a time with the only difference being that I did not forward your threats to the police or continually try to get you banned. Funny thing is, why am I still playing and why have no charges come against me? I took your own garbage with a bit tougher skin. I already realize your situation is embarrassing enough so cover up all you want, it doesn't change the facts I discovered about you one bit. Based on no one else having the incentive or reason to look into them is the reason you play at denying it. Admit a little and perhaps they will disregard the rest? Someone in your shoes should not be courting people in any event.  <br>  <br>    Me, get a life ? Anyone who has looked for you up til now knows you can be reached almost anytime on-line, Monday through Sunday. If that changes now it's likely only because you read this post ) <br>  <br>    You are hardly the issue, faithfulness is the issue. No, I was not &quot;dumped&quot;. Had I not grown suspicious and investigated...&quot;stalking&quot; as you would prefer to call it...and had I not been affronted enough by what I found: Aramore and Aerie would have been married at the same time the two of you were. Yes it was me who broke off our engagement which had continued over the time I had to be away from eq. This is the issue I address in these posts more than your own situation. I already know you do not care about such things, that much was evident after I proved to you what was going on back in March. I wish to prevent another pain should he discover that his eq-fiance is married behind his back, as is about to happen ...or already has. I've been away from Quellious for two days now. Deal with that however you like, you had your own share of misery over the matter I'm sure, but I have long discounted you as anyone worthy of association.  <br>  <br>    You dwell on words spoken between us and legalities. Keep hiding behind those then Kellian, this is about the morality of multiple marriages in eq and the the callousness of continuing in such ways by some people. You lost all my respect the moment you showed you did not care that such had happened behind your back. Enough said. Little guy? lol <br>  <br> Written to Aerie, upon my return to eq before discovering of Loych... <br>  <br> The questions that roused the past tonight are only the wind <br>        Eroding the sands of past monuments, to sting less as days pass <br> The crumbles of walls grow flower and weed, there to lie in reclaim <br>        Smoke filled air no more to be seen, lit now in sunlit hues <br>  <br> As walk I dells in blissful respite, sings the breeze in soft delight <br>        Sheltered now from scorching heats, canopied from rain and sleet <br> Gaze the eyes on pastures green, on sweetness grown to beds of heather <br>        Time recurve her normal course, pressured not by unnatural season <br>  <br> Wishing to walk these places with you, gentle whisper in your ear <br>        In sorrows hearts carved deeper for joys to fill, thoughts and moments to treasure and fill <br> To kiss you sweet 'neith the knotting pines, together again hearts to  bind <br>        In cisterns deep drink we the spring, so far and ever close again <br>  <br> Speak easy thy hopes on listening ear, to make and thrill the future My dear <br>       And placing misgivings in a box, I'll dig it deep enough to lock <br> Thy every tear away so deep, all willing for with worms to sleep <br>      And hold you happy as night mists fall, hear the owls haunting call <br>  <br> Through trancelike stare at crackling flames and think with clear minds again <br>      No more alone than glowflies who dance, beyond the clearings simple fence! <br> And when thy sweet voice carries no more its song, to gently place thy blanket on <br>     kiss you soft into slumbered trance, pay heed the night in watchful  stance <br>  <br> Anticipate the breaking morn, ever sweeter than the one before... <br>      To know and treasure such sweet company, as in your closeness only I feel <br> With dewlike fresh pass you morning fare, warm milk and a buttered bread there ) <br>     And hug you like we'd never known, a crack, splinter, or breaking groan. <br>  <br> Such thoughts long have dwelt on I, never musing peaceful where our moments did fly <br>     Cast no more on mysterys lens, wiped of dirt and grime again <br> Softened with such lace and finery, so as have your dear thoughts been to me <br>     And clasping your hand close to walk, delight I in delight you take. <br>  <br> Such love and gentle peace were all our correspondances filled with until I looked deeper to the ugly truths behind. It was a miserable betrayal to have a relationship built on such empty pretences. There was no way I would abide to marry one whose other character already was. It is worth my time to write these posts and address the issue that &quot;Angele&quot; may change her stance this time and not hurt another the same way. May the whole sad matter be as a stern caution against others contemplating a similar situation. &quot;Out with old before in with the new&quot; - French saying <br>  <br> Sincerely, Syedoth <br>

				Syedoth, if this is a situation that started as an EQ relationship, and turned into a RL relationship, the boards are not the place to air your problems.  Trying to trash her publicly isn't going to make you feel better about your &quot;scorn.&quot; <br>  <br> If this was a purely EQ relationship, then get over it.  When you &quot;marry&quot; another character, that does not mean that all of their characters have to be faithful to you, unless that person so chooses.  I know its a hard line to see, but it really should be there.  Yes, these are real people, with real feelings.  But if you cant stay behind that invisible line, then you need to move on and find someone who has the same goals as you. <br>  <br> There are so many reasons why your post was a wrong choice.  One, you are trying to damage a guild, based on a personal relationship with one of its members.  Second, you are divuldging supposed RL information about people, and slandering them.   <br>  <br> My advise... move on, before you damage yourself some more.

				Syedoth, <br>  <br>       If not for the real fear you have put into these two members of my guild, I would think this is the funniest, most pathetic behavior from a player I have ever seen.  (Having spent time as a GM, I know what pathetic behavior is.)   This is just a game sir, and if you let yourself get personally involved, then you are a man of weak moral fiber, and show lack character at best. <br>       At least half of this guild is either a member of my family, or a close personal friend IRL.  We are VERY careful whom we let into our crew, and if Kellian and Angele are a part of it, its because they deserve to be there.  I take personal offense to this public forum, and have heard of your YEAR LONG harrassment of my friends.   <br>       I do not want to see my friends go because you can't get over an imaginary relatinship.   I am taking this thread as a personal assault, and have instructed Kellian how to best have your accounts, and your billing credit cards, banned by Verant.  I have also contacted some of my senior GM friends via email , whom will be notifed, and a log kept, everytime my freinds are harrassed.  Am I foolish enough to think that this will keep you away forever?  Of course not.  But eventually, you will tire of buying new EQ accounts, and obtaining new credit cards.  <br>       Also, this sort of behavior IS stalking.  Investigating is a temporary thing.  A YEAR LONG assault on the private lives of others, in very much illegal, be it IRL, or electronically.  You have made death threats that are documentable, and that have been forwarded to the police.  Your Real Life can and will be affected if this continues. Heed my warning friend, you don't want the Hellstorm that this criminal filing will bring you.  A subpeona is all it will take to get you into some serious trouble friend.  Be warned. <br>  <br> Respectfully, <br>  <br> Drexell Deadbane. <br>

				I think you deserve a fitting answer, the both of you vipers Kellian and Drexell/Luladen. Why do you think I mentioned you as part of this Luladen, in my original posting? From the first time we ever spoke on line you immediately set me up in a trap so that you could petition to ban me. You immediately jumped the gun and would not speak in a civil manner.  <br>  <br>    Kellian you are so so full of crap. My eyes glaze over as I read your post, to see what you make up here in public, and to see how you have so inflamed the issue with Luladen to have made things seem so drastic. I realize you are embarrassed about what I've had to say but it has been no call to invent all this garbage. I realize what you are trying to do at once and am not willing to participate. You intend to post so much garbage in hopes of banning this post, a forced censorship. I hope they ban your posts in which you would spout and bring up such nonsense. <br> I have addressed an issue at hand for a purpose. People who see what I have had to say knws that it remains a relevant issue and was worthy of awareness. <br>  <br> In my own defence from what you have said: <br>  <br> - Those characters were not all mine. Four of them were, whom I was dealing with you in the first situation. You both made more than myself an enemy over this though I know you insist on using solely me as a scapegoat. That's why it won't work and why my account won't be &quot;banned&quot; by your useless rants. You have to understand something that has never seemed to sink into that thick skull of yours Kellian. I am not the one who has continued this save in an occasional manner. Angele has hurt people this year with: multiple relationships, trade-scams with Ashra or other characters. That leads to a lot of hurt feelings and I am not responsible for how other people have reacted under the circumstances. <br>  <br> -  I do not use multiple accounts for harrassment. I have never been banned from the game, and the one time I did speak with Gm's was for two hours in which they sided with me over Angeles behaviour and were Very fed up over your malicious attempts to have myself and others banned over nothing. They truly take you and your hotheaded allegations with a Lot of salt. <br>  <br> - I have never made a death threat to Kellian or anyone in my life. I am not stupid, and the nature of my letters regarding threats were to say that  <br>  had we lived closer after hearing his first arrogant letters back from the beginning, things may have been settled differently. I have your own letters which were &quot;threatening&quot; Kellian, all stored away. Yes they exist. *kicks sand in the losers face as he lies on the Oasis beach next to her* <br>  <br> - Little guy? lol  I think you are one of the biggest meatheads I've ever met. You aren't even remotely humourous, you sicken me you disgusting individual. She has already told me the last thing she ever wants to do is meet you in person. In other words &quot;thank goodness it's just a game&quot; in your case. <br>  <br> - If you decide to bring your garbage to a court case, you had better realize you will be trying to sue or get into trouble about 6-7 people. You know how much hype you are spouting here So GIVE IT UP lol You Luladen have sounded like a bad lawyer every time I met you. &quot;I can sue anyone, anywhere, for anything at anytime..for the most amount of money!&quot; You need the wakeup call to stop being babies over something you don't like that has happened ) Upset because you reaped some disgrace over Angeles actions? Your tough luck for remaining with such a women then, and for accepting her into the guild! Deal with it! ..ahh, I guess you are in your own ways. Do you know how many innocent people you have reported or petitioned against because they asked a question or you thought it was another? Probably a ton of people, though I'm just guessing. <br>  <br>     Let me ask the reader after hearing these two peoples comments. Who are the people who are truly not taking it as a game after reading their two posts? Lao, your comment excluded. I have to respect your opinion (alone lol) because it deals with the real issue here. I disagree that multiple marriages are acceptable practice in eq, and your saying it &quot;is okay&quot; for the reason that &quot;it already happens&quot; doesn't seem to be much of a point. I like to believe it was worthy of airing. You could read about this in a magazine! You could read about this in a paper! Would you like to censor everything disagreeable? Are you upset because someone made a stand over it? <br>  <br> Most of this from you Kellian/Luladen is so far-fetched and blown out of proportion that it doesn't deserve a response. You are on glue Kellian, wake up and realize I was not the only person involved. I was just the person you hate the most because I made a stance over the real issue behind your involvement.  I received an email yesterday from &quot;Angele&quot; in which she is not going to post to this board any longer, she asked me to do the same. My issue is addressed Kelian, it's all over except for your crying. I told her I would be happy to leave as is, only reserving the right to respond to purvs comments if it was fitting. (sorry, that would be you Kellian). If you weren't such a moron you might realize what I talked about wasn't about you or even me any longer.  <br>  <br> Sincerely, Syedoth <br>

				I read this thread and just have a suggestion for Syedoth. You've addressed all the issues related to the matter and it sounds like you could really make things worse now by exposing her other character or characters. I ask you which is most important, that the marriage remain at just one in number, or that she be allowed to move on into a relationship with a more fitting individual since it sounds like she'd be happy to move on anyway? I think she is probably just going to let this guy down gently and it would resolve itself all on it's own. If you interfere and tell him then the new guy will likely run and she'll still be stuck in the same situation! Why not leave well enough alone and let this Kellian guy suffer what he's set himself up for already by being with someone so much younger? Whatever your original thing, it's just a game to them both, obviously.

				A final note to this all, to the best of my knowledge none of my characters have been involed in any trade scams. I generally sell much under market price as I dont enjoy marketing and  it takes up too much time to haggle. If anyone thinks they have been cheated, they have not made it known to me. Ive had to keep changing characters because theyve been hunted down, not because i enjoy doing that. Any friends Ive made, or thought Ive made, Ive always tried to treat fairly. Ive never tried to deliberately hurt anyone in the game. As to the fact that Im married to Kellian in the game, is really no ones business but Kellians and myself.

				You said you wouldn't post any longer? Ah well, nice little wrap-up message from me too then. Pretty hard to cover up a scandel with a few flowery words though isn't it Angele? Noooo...you haven't hurt Anyone at all this year, have you? ) Little innocent Angel, aren't you? LOL On the contrary, you are part of the bad seeds most wish had never discovered their past-time of eq. Besides the guys you have hurt this year: I'll add Derkonis w. your char Ashra and one other who requested anonimity and quit eq over you, to your list. Shall I also add the names of the people I do know whom you did rip-off in trade scams?  <br>  <br>     To the best of my knowing, correct me if I am wrong, when you staged Ashras &quot;suicide jump&quot; from Kelethin in gossamir robes in about April, you also jumped away from the engagement/relationship planned with her and with 4-5 k of trade-rips bolstering your bank accounts! Big <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/2.gif" border="0" alt="sad" hspace="0" vspace="0">  It's all documented by the Gm's regarding the trades so I wouldn't deny too much before you try. <br>  <br>     You are such a menace, there was no question in my mind that keeping some minor tabs on you would help others in the future. Here it is the future. You already both dragged down &quot;Dii Minores&quot; guild by your prescences there. I'm reflecting and am actually now sad for your present guild.  <br>  <br>    Please recall my purpose in writing. Why should I not expose your other relationship now? You never change. Call me vindictive if you will, I never once said I was a nice guy when it comes to crap that you pull. I too respect and love my friends and those who treat others with fairness and respect. I have very few problems with anyone, both in game and in life. I didn't start this ball rolling in the first place, it's your deeds Angele. <br>  <br> Sincerely, Syedoth <br>  <br>  P.s. ~ Regarding Drexell / Luladen mixup, my apologies. I've never spoken to a Drexell before and thought it was another character of Luladens who spoke on behalf of the guild. <br> It sounded exactly like something he would spout; Respectfully my ass. It's pretty easy to tell you two are family.

				You are such a liar. Bring a GM report. No one every complained to me on any trade. Ashra did not take anything from people. Let anyone who would say otherwise come forward, not your vindicative lies. Ashras gossimer gowns were her own, earned by xendel and bayllara. Bayllara later gave her a FBR. All her things she earned or got from bayllara or xendel. She jumped off Kelethin to stop u harassing her, and i planned on deleting her then, but you werent satisfied with that so I didnt. You didnt want to give up til u found xendel and hounded her and questioned everyone to find who xendel was married to. So I had to change my name by GM and delete Ashra and Jolie. Then u found our renamed characters and continued until i had to delete xendel/amanda. Im so glad I didnt marry you and Im not going to delete Angele because I chose to marry someone else. I honestly couldnt tell you who derkonis is other then I ve heard the name before. My life is not your business, so stay out of it; dont follow me, dont tell to me on your multiple names and stop trying to smear and demean me, kellian and my guild.

				I resent being called a liar very much by YOU. I am not used to not being taken at my word. Make up what you like about the past you deceitful little tramp. Ashra being deleted wasn't bloody well about me and you know it all to well. Let those who the whole Ashra issue was really about come forward and defend their own issues however they want to. I don't care about your trade ripoffs that much only because I put the value of peoples hearts and your leading them on over a million k of eq belongings. If I have been following you or stalking you all the time as you so claim, why don't you at least give credit where credit is due and admit that I know a little more than your liking ? In the case of her, I don't know enough to keep going on about it, and anyone who has been following these posts will see that it wasn't my intent to bring up half of your sordid history in the first place. Yes it is in the Gms records and from what I've gathered, yes you were almost banned from the game. Why have you spoke up about this and remained quiet on so many other points I mentioned? Only because you realize I don't have as much to say on your whole Ashra affairs, they still remain your skeletons in the closet no matter what you'd say about it. <br>  <br> I welcome anyone who has been involved with &quot;Angeles&quot; past to voice their accounts after hearing her so blatantly denying everything. You know you don't have a leg to stand on. Something becomes apparant by this point. She has resented the fact that I would try to defend others for warning them about her habits. At the same time she would like to completely cover up everything by calling it &quot;harrassment&quot; or &quot;stalking&quot;. Once again you would attempt to make me the scapegoat. The herald maybe. <br>  <br> I detest your ways. I have been happy not to degrade myself in your company since I first found out about Loych. &quot;Once a cheater, always a cheater&quot;. Yours are the way of an adulterous, who makes her bed in the morning and says &quot;I have done nothing wrong&quot;. <br>  <br> Myself, I have nothing more to say to you. To your new fiance I will simply direct him to this post and let it speak for itself. My sympathy to all who still have to associate with the two of them. ~ Syedoth <br>  <br>

				Like many of you have said, my breasts are one of the few of my body parts that I've come to make peace with. After a while of complaining of them being too small, I've just given up being difficult, faced the facts that they're gonna stay small, and accept them. My 34A's are porportionate to my petite little body and they allow me to do things that women with larger breasts might not be able to do. I can wear those skimpy ho tops that tie in the bag (strictly for clubbing, I swear I'm only a performance ho!) and even go braless. Now I just gotta do some sit ups to get a tighter tummy, and I gotta get me a buttmaster. My mother likes to refer to my butt as &quot;bodacious&quot; but it's just a little perky for my likes.  <br>  <br> But at least I'm happy with my breasts.

				Well Xendel, or maybe thats you Syedoth using my former name, as you have in-game, I can say that you are as wrong about my manner as you are about my bra size. Whomever you are, you are immature and common. <br>  <br> Oh, and pardon me Syedoth for attempting to respond to any point in your tirade that tried to portray a &quot;fact&quot; other than just hearsay or invention. The only GM contact I have had, has been in regard to your telling and following of me in game. No player or GM has ever advised me of a trade problem, on any character. If they had, I would have been glad to resolve it. But then again, most trades I make are at a loss, so I dont think many people would want to complain. <br>  <br> I dont have any &quot;eq fiancee&quot; in game, so it would be hard for him to be &quot;surprised Im marrying behind his back&quot;. But then again, you're probably &quot;investigating&quot;,lol, the wrong person, as you did when you insisted this summer I was someone on Brell you were following. Oh yes, that wasnt me either was it. <br>  <br> And in case you havent got it yet, we're not engaged, or married, and Im frankly none of your business. Play your own characters, elsewhere I hope, and just let me alone. <br>  <br>

				Well Xendel (or Syedoth) that was about the most imature display of playground antics i've ever seen.  And yes, you have used our old names before.  Do you know that every character she has i have one that goes with it?  Ashra was deleted when i deleted Kezixx. It was by pretending to be Kezixx that you found out our NEW names.  Yes, Feeliux changed our names from Xendel and Bayllara.  Do you think a Lead GM would make a change like that to a tradescammer?  The only reason he changed our names was because of you.  Ashra never scammed anyone.  Angele never scammed anyone.  Most everything she has she has got herself or from me or others in the guild.  And yes, im high enough to get most everything i want alone without trading.  In fact, she is the nicest person in the game.  Always healing people, buffing, its a wonder we get anything done at all while she's going out of her way to help someone else.  She also gives away things i get her.  We really dont need to scam anyone, we're pretty self sufficient.  Your lies just keep getting thinner and thinner and will eventually fall apart.  That last post as Xendel was pretty weak, whether it was you or someone else.  Grow up.

				I am somewhat relieved today. I'm glad you did the right thing Angele, it's good you broke it off. I guess I didn't leave you much choice. I was just chatting with my main char on Quellious to him, it seems you fessed up and now will remain as friends just as you fessed up to Kellian about the two of us before I discovered his name, knowing it would arise. I didn't direct him to the post, it was hardly nessesary. We just talked so breathe easier. I'm not out to ruin your entire eq existance after all and it is for his sake I'm sparing feelings, not either of yours.  <br>  <br>      You would like to make a complete monster out of me now sadly you are talking about all the people you have hurt in the game this year and would still insist on blaming me for every single thing that's come of it. Sorry, not accurate in the least. Since the summer my part has been very minor and the only reason I bring this up now is because of your other engagement.  Look at the list of characters you accused me of being! You two please get Your facts straight. <br>  <br> Kellian, you repeatedly prove yourself as clueless. You do not know what has gone on in half the issues we speak of so kindly butt out. I adventured with Angele on several occasions this year alone that you will never know about on Quellious and other servers, and no, you were not a part of it. You also do not know who my main character is, and further you do not know who her other characters are. She lied to us both repeatedly and will never reveal her other relationship to you unless you look into it yourself. I'm not recommending anything. She has already stated you don't question her other &quot;aquintances&quot; so continue to serenely trust and accept that she is faithful to you as I know you don't believe. In your case I would however content yourself in realizing what has just occurred. She remains with you, her prominent relationship over this, and will likely hope these ripples just die down now. Do I need to explain this to you? Really? Just because no ones going to say anything next time to you thanks to eq anonimity, in all likelihood, doesn't mean that it's not going on! I already know you don't care so what's the difference.  <br>  <br> Here are some good points then to make then, if my last ones were weak in your eyes. <br>  <br> - She has never met you in person Kellian. She has only chosen to believe your denials over RL loser. She didn't research or look into you in the first place, didn't even know your age when she was engaged  you according to past accounts! It's only because it's &quot;just a game&quot; between the two of you. I could speculate on a lot more things based on this years discussions and know how questionable your life has been based on actually looking into it. Mock on, I have never been able to take you seriously.  <br>  <br> - The trade rips were a long time ago before such self-sufficiency. From what I can tell the characters involved do not play those same chars and are perhaps unlikely to read this post. If they do come forward you will smear them just as you have tried to do with me, and will lie your way out of everything from what I can tell.  <br>  <br> -  You never ripped me off any monetary amounts and I was not the one involved. I did hear all about what went on as it happened because I grew very disconcerted over the fact that you were blaming me for things I never said to you and emails I never wrote. Yes I wrote some and yes I said some, the lions share you try to pin to me over the summertime I will accept little of. How else do you think I staying involved in all your crap? I was informed by GM's not to get involved personally and besides talking to them and those you dealt with I did not. It had to do with the nature of eliciting gifts from people and remaking new characters.  <br>  <br> - Do you think I enjoy bringing up matters like this and trashing people in public? No, not at all. I also don't like to see people hurt, my own name wrongly slandered, and welcomed the opportunity of a public debate to bring up this whole disgraceful mess. I'm not completely innocent, the issue I bring up is nor about my behaviour until you mentioned it!  <br>  <br> - The matter on Brell was questionable. It's true that others of her company were very suspicious at one point but in the end cleared her of anything. I haven't mentioned this except in passing, I simply would not put it past her.  <br>  <br>    Yes Angele, you are charming, usually kind in all you do, and have so many redeeming qualities. I've appreciated a lot about you all on my own over the times. It's unfortunate you have another side to you that I detest because it hurts so much. You've always kept a very good front. A chameleon like quality that allows you to so effectively deceive and then pass it off as if nothing happened afterwards. This is why you have been a menace more than anything in my eyes, not because I envy you, because you are so effective at duping people. It's about time you grew up, and stopped using feminine wiles to have your way, see your bread buttered on all sides. You had me fooled for so long, I trusted you completely! You had Kellian fooled until I spoke to him, until you admitted the truth just before I spoke to him. You fooled this guy you are with until yesterday. Loych, Derkonis (yes Derkonis...doesn't wash folks: it was a relationship), and one other I am loath to mention and won't. That's just who I know about. Welcome to the eq dating services, prime users group.  <br>  <br>    I'll discuss things so long as you want to. What will we get into next? Email proofs to back up what we speak of? Favourite quotes? The sociology of an eq marriage? Eyewitness accounts? Lists of items you aquired from people? Lists of items you have given away to prove you are good? Acts of kindness in shining glory, and behind-the-scenes acts of treachery that shook peoples faith in humanity? <br> I'd rather not discuss anything at all. I'm game but I'm not enjoying bringing things up about the either of you. If others from your past feel like speaking up and posting here or tqlking to you, they will. As for me, I'm quite through with it and with the subject of you &quot;Angele&quot;. If anything at all, someone please post something here about the real issue for some sensible discussion? eq polygamy. <br>  <br> Sincerely, Syedoth <br>

				Angele treats her golden goose very well indeed, she makes certain everything is kept quiet about her past, and that her goose hears least of all what goes on so that she will keep getting those eggs her heart desires.

I don't smoke, have two drinks a day tops, don't do drugs, have a college education and a respectable job.

				Hey, thanks Jukan <img src="http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  <br> Anyway, the thing Syedoth is wrong about is me not knowing what characters Angele plays.  We both have played each others characters from time to time to be used for rez's and teleports (yes a cleric druid combo is nice).  So i know exactly what characters she plays.  As far as the morality of a marriage?  EQ marriage has nothing in common with a real marriage and Syedoth does not get this.  True, my marriage did not last, but me and my X are still good friends and we have both sat and laughed at his emails to me.  (oh, Syedoth, so when you told Angele you talked to my X about me?  rofl.  she thinks your just as much a loser as i do)  Anyway, had you ever known what a true marriage was you wouldnt even had to compare it here, and if EQ marriage is all you can get, then im all for ya.
