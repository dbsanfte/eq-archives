				I dunno dude, it's an awful tricky business to say one way or the other. <br>  <br> &quot;Peter Bergen: Bin Laden has aged 'enormously' This is a man who was clearly not well. I mean, as you see from these pictures here, he's really, by December [2001] he's looking pretty terrible.&quot; <br>  <br>  <br> [Healthy bin Laden vs. Bin Laden December 2001 video] <br>  <br> The only difference I see is in the beard, which is a pretty natural thing. I don't know how old he is, but I can see the grey-ness growing in over that period of time. Hell, how do we know he wasn't just dyeing it before, when he wasn't hiding in a cave? <br>   <br>  <br> &quot;But by December, of course, that tape that was aired then, he's barely moving the left side of his body. So he's clearly got diabetes. He has low blood pressure. He's got a wound in his foot. He's apparently got dialysis ... for kidney problems.&quot; <br>  <br> I've seen the video, and I don't see how you can conclude any of that from it. Since when does barely moving the left side of your body ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY mean you have diabetes? How does it prove the rest of those conditions? What does it even mean if he does have them? That the video is false? o_O <br>   <br> &quot;Pakistan's Musharraf: Bin Laden probably dead Pakistan's president says he thinks Osama bin Laden is most likely dead because the suspected terrorist has been unable to get treatment for his kidney disease.&quot; <br>  <br> If there's so much Au De Conspiracee in the air, let me play devil's advocate for a moment and point out that no one is *sure* he even had a kidney diease. And Pakistan's president's speculation means no more than anyone else's (which means nothing, really). <br>  <br> &quot;[A Bush administration official] said U.S. intelligence is that bin Laden needs dialysis every three days and &quot;it is fairly obvious that that could be an issue when you are running from place to place, and facing the idea of needing to generate electricity in a mountain hideout.&quot; <br>  <br> Come on now, the guy was *prepared* to hit the caves, and it isn't difficult for a man like that to get his hands on some gas powered generators to take from place to place. <br>  <br> &quot;Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Bin Laden would need help if on dialysis Renal dialysis -- talking about hemodialysis -- is something that really is reserved for patients in end-stage renal failure. That means their kidneys have just completely shut down. <br> The most common cause of something like that would be something like diabetes and hypertension. Once that's happened, if you're separated from your dialysis machine -- and incidentally, dialysis machines require electricity, they're going to require clean water, they're going to require a sterile setting -- infection is a huge risk with that. If you don't have all those things and a functioning dialysis machine, it's unlikely that you'd survive beyond several days or a week at the most.&quot; <br>  <br> Again, we don't know that he needs it, and we don't know that he isn't getting the proper care even if he does. <br>   <br>  <br> &quot;Magazine runs what it calls bin Laden's will The editor-in-chief of a London-based Arab news magazine said a purported will it published Saturday was written late last year [2001] by Osama bin Laden, and shows &quot;he's dying or he's going to die soon.&quot; <br>  <br> How do we know it was his will? How would the press get their hands on it? HOW DO WE KNOW THE KIDNEY DISEASE AND THE WILL WEREN'T LEAKED INTENTIONALLY TO MAKE US THINK HE DIED? Oh, and wills don't really mean a damn thing about one's condition. <br>  <br> &quot;Bin Laden's voice was detected regularly until [14 December 2001] by intelligence operatives monitoring radio transmissions in Tora Bora, according to the Pentagon.&quot; <br>  <br> Maybe he remembered that someone trying to hide should stay off the air waves? <br>  <br> &quot;Since then, nothing has been heard from the al-Qa'eda leader and President Bush has hinted in private that bin Laden's silence could mean he has been killed. [Telegraph]&quot; <br>  <br> Speculation again. President Bush &quot;hinting&quot; that he thought of something... well... actually that would be news, but it doesn't mean a thing about Bin Laden. <br>  <br>  <br> &quot;Translation of Funeral Article in Egyptian Paper: <br> al-Wafd, Wednesday, December 26, 2001 Vol 15 No 4633 <br>  <br> News of Bin Laden's Death and Funeral 10 days ago <br>  <br> A prominent official in the Afghan Taleban movement announced yesterday the death of Osama bin Laden, the chief of al-Qa'da organization, stating that binLaden suffered serious complications in the lungs and died a natural and quiet death.&quot; <br>  <br> At the risk of sounding like a broken record: How do we know that's even true? How do we know it wasn't leaked intentionally? How do we know they didn't just come up with it on a whim? And doesn't that sort of spit in the face of the kidney disease theories? <br>   <br>   <br> &quot;Karzai: bin Laden 'probably' dead Osama bin Laden is &quot;probably&quot; dead, but former Taliban leader Mullah Omar is alive, Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said. <br>  <br> Bin Laden 'probably' dead The US Federal Bureau of Investigation's counter-terrorism chief, Dale Watson, says he thinks Osama bin Laden is &quot;probably&quot; dead. <br>  <br> Bin Laden could be ill or dead - US A taped message by Osama bin Laden that aired on Al-Jazeera television suggests the al-Qaeda leader is ill and could be dead, US analysts told Knight-Ridder newspapers. <br>  <br> Israeli intelligence: Bin Laden is dead, heir has been chosen Israeli sources said Israel and the United States assess that Bin Laden probably died in the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan in December. They said the emergence of new messages by Bin Laden are probably fabrications, Middle East Newsline reported.&quot; <br>  <br> So what that says is that he could be either dead, or alive. Ah. Glad they could shed some light on the situation. <br>  <br> &quot;Swiss scientists 95% sure that Bin Laden recording was fake Scientists in Switzerland say they are almost certain that an audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden is a fake.&quot; <br>  <br> They are 95% sure that they are almost certain? What? I refuse to believe the Swiss. <br>  <br> &quot;Osama bin who? Israel does not view bin Laden as a threat.&quot; <br>  <br> And Israel, historically, has always been right. Therefore, Bin Laden is clearly dead. <br>  <br> &quot;Bush says bin Laden no Threat &quot;We haven't heard from him in a long time,&quot; Bush told reporters at the White House. &quot;I truly am not that concerned about him.&quot; <br> Nearly 3000 people died on September 11, 2001, but Bush is unconcerned about the whereabouts of the man who supposedly masterminded the 9/11 attacks. The words &quot;I am truly not that concerned about him&quot; speak volumes about bin Laden, and Bush.&quot; <br>  <br> Yeah, I coulda told you that. It's still meaningless speculation. <br>   <br> Now hey, I'm not saying that I think the guy is alive. I just wanted to say something about all the bullsh*t conclusions that people try to draw about things like this.

				Clearly in the second picture on that link, you can see that is not Osama.  The skin is white (way to white for an Arab)... and I think I see a glint of a gold ring there.  We all know a Muslim would not wear gold. <br>  <br> Might I suggest that this is possibly the same CIA agent who murdered Nick Berg?

Funny how he hates &quot;the infidel west&quot; yet loves our medical technology.

				&quot;Michael Moore said that his movies are not documentaries. They are satire.

				I totally agree with Alikat. If you look at the FBI's most wanted terrorist list (at fbi.gov) a good number of them are rumored to be dead or in custody in Iran (Bin Laden - dead, Ayman Al-Zawahiri - dead, Muhammad Atef - dead, Saif Al-Adel - Iranian custody just to name a few). Again, just rumors, but life aint easy when you're already in frail health and the US is bombing the living crap out of your hideouts.

It is reported that he has diabeties, and Im sure getting proper medical treatment is not possible.  Look at Saddam, and he was in a region that still suppored him.   <br>  <br>  <br>
