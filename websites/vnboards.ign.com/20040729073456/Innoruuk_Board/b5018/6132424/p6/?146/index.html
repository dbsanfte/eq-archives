				&lt;&lt; <br> Ask the groups that died at Gruplinort and gave tells to Avarus, LoD asshole, at Necrosis scarab asking to CR them. There have been nights where I've done corpse recovery for other groups within sebilis up to 3 times a night. There have been times where my all LoD Asshole groups have lost 'camps' because we helped CR a group that died.  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> the complaints you read and hear about here are mostly due to probably a few bad characters or a few higher ups that are using twinks and have hurt others...i got that from what was said...you may have missed it...he said CT and that means level 30-40...so you guys in sebilis are doing good. <br>  <br> much of the stuff that we hear daily about lod is the junk where someone like bamur trains out of the bug area and gets 7-8 players killed and disrupts them so they loose 1-2 hours in recovery and then laughs at them or shouts profanaties when they express their discontent. <br>  <br> as for lod helping, so did mystical legends one time on a trip to POF where a new guild tried to go in and suffered massive losses due to their inexperience.  lod was in the wings flinging harassments at them and trying to get into the zone even though it wasn't scheduled by them.  did they offer to help when things went wrong?  no.  but mystical legends did.  they did this contrary to guild leader's wishes and was probably the straw that broke the camel's back and caused the break of the guild.  i hear he flung insults to those trying to help their friends recover. <br>  <br> all of us have helped our friends and lost our camps and the loot that went with them. <br>  <br> there was one time i asked for lod's help in sebilis (a long time ago) and was turned down.  oh well....we did the recovery the hard way...stayed up till 4 am getting keys and summoning corpses and recovering on our own. <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> Ask the people whose corpses got summoned due to a bug to the Armorer room about the LoD assholes that stopped to rez all the corpses when the guides wouldn't help/were slow to respond.  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> ask several of my friends that visit sebilis that are necros that sit for long times out of gameplay waiting for their friends to get the 2nd key so they can zone in and get their body summoned...or ask me how many hours i sat in paw helping a necro get his summon corpse spell. <br>  <br> i think that there are people in every guild, big, small, good or bad that help and loose and die and succeed.  that's normal game play. <br>  <br> i've even known necro's and others to sacrafise themselves for the essense emerald in order to res people to speed up recovery.  my guild members used to accept no exp res's to speed up recovery after a bad turn of events in pof. <br>  <br> none of these though Rhiow has anything to do with LOD or the mentality of lod (good mentality or bad). <br>  <br> people hate big and successful,but not everyone...some have cause for their discontent others don't. <br>  <br> I think much of what sparked the worried concern that I have for lod, myself, that is, was when this miri person came here and lambasted storm for their accomplishment in taking down their first dragon.  syd posted several comments on exploits accusing them of exploits, and as i recall he was anonymous and people in the thread pointed it out.  after GM Brenlo got involved he congratulated them on the tactic and on their taking down of the dragon, yet syd still insisted he was right.  that set off a huge flamming thread. or the time on verant's flameplay that syd admitted to training the ice giants and vox out onto a guild preparing claiming it was taking them too many hours to prepare.  and miri when proven to be contradicting herself insisted on drawing out the conversation.  these types of things are what upset people and create flames. <br>  <br> as I said I had a lod member really screw with my group one day.  he created a problem got many of my group killed and left before the recovery was finished.  then when we were healing, and getting ready for the recovery, he and some of your guild mates, began to insult our group members.  it was the lod guy that created the problem. <br>  <br> it is these types of things that make people mad at lod.  when some members of lod have an elitist attitude and insult others and if you don't think that starts off the resentment somethings wrong. <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> Ask the people in Chardok from Unbidden who were having some problems near Korocust about the LoD assholes who cleared to their corpses and CR'd them.  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> i'm sure they thanked you for it...even my guild has done the same thing...thank you again for whatever help you gave to them. <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> When you zone into Sebilis and there are 35 people there, 12-18 of the are likely LoD Assholes. How often have you been trained by them?  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> I was actually there one day and lod did train big time.  my first day I was in sebilis we were trained near the bride by lod as we were moving in.  we went and killed many mobs to help lod recover. no thanks were given by lod members <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> If you think we're bad players because we're willing to test our limits, well, that's laughable.  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> i didn't read that in the posts here.  the guys are upset at how badly some of your members conduct themselves and then fling insults at others.   <br>  <br> here's an example of something that happened to me recentely.  we had a rogue from your guild cheat one of our group's druids. it upset the druid and forced our group to wait long periods of time while they bickered.  did it make us happy that shortly after the druid left saying she could play with the rogue becuase she took the item and didn't give the item she said (no don't ask me about the exchange).  then the rogue left and we had to spend our time finding replacemnts when we were happy before the rogue came. <br>  <br> or how about the shouting i often hear in skyfire by your lod members at arven or others they don't like.  that's rather pathetic if you ask me...yeah i heard the whole conversation and it was rather stupid to hear lod members bitching at someone over /shout or /ooc...a waste of my time...can't they exercise some self control? <br>  <br> i've had friends tell me that because some lod member took a dislike to them that they are being harrassed...having the lod guy follow them from zone to zone shouting insults. <br>  <br> you may say this happens in every guild or potentially to everyone, but be aware that a guild of strong players shouldn't be seen trying to alienate and intimidate those others in the game. <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> We took a single group of level 56 people down to the myconid area and did it with no deaths. We've taken a single group of high level people to do Juggernauts and succeeded. Where does the claim of taking on more than we can handle cuz we're arrogant come from?  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> actually the term is self-aggrandizing.  that's what ppl hate. if you accomplish these things feel good about them, but the problem isn't with your successes but how some of lod make others feel bad about them not doing it.  it is one thing to say &quot;we were successful and here's what we did&quot;, and another to say &quot;we are elite and you suck&quot;, even if you think they do suck.  it is best just to not open the box. <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> You don't know what you can accomplish until you try, and if you fail, then you've learned something.  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> i go to other big guild boards and read their posts and i visit lots of other boards.  i read the tactics, much of which are so extensively written out that anyone can follow them.  the hard part isn't getting the individual to do something but getting the group to do it together.  If i hear any type of compliment about lod it is that.  individually the lod members aren't so well respected, but as a group accomplishing things you are, as a guild you are hurting because of some of your members and how they treat others.  respect != fan. <br>  <br> &lt;&lt; <br> And yeah, you're going to encounter some arrogance. I think anyone can attest to the fact that I'm damn arrogant. I'm incredibly proud of my accomplishments in LoD and I'm not afraid so say that I think we're the strongest guild on the server and I hope it stays that way. Who wouldn't want to say that?  <br> &gt;&gt; <br> i'm happy you feel that way, but aren't there 32 servers, with thousands of guilds, and a hundred that are very powerful?  i think that you may consider yourself the best, most would consider themselves the best...it is a highly subjective term.  hell, i think i'm the best, you think you are the best and there are many that think they are the best but we don't go around rubbing others noses in it. <br>  <br> syd, <br>  <br> if you want to know what upsets people just remember some of what i said.  i know you guys are using some sort of counsel now and that will probably help your image...a bit of advise i'd give is to try use one voice when speaking here or anywhere so as to reduce the possible conflict that would arise from some hardnosed people that populate all guilds.  of all the things that i read here that upset people its the rubbing others noses in their lack of equipment and accomplishments that give rise to the flamming fires. <br>  <br> another thing i'd suggest is just to get a thicker skin.  it is a game afterall.  i'm not saying you personally but the members in general.  we all could use a bit of rising above the issues.  prove to everyone that you are the best by making sure you don't bully others. <br>  <br> and finally, not everything people say you will like or agree with,but it doesn't mean you call them fag or a child.  that's just not mature.  i read that in these posts and i think it was just lame.  bodkin was one i believe.  and as for the guy that posted that hard but mostly true post about lod here you shouldn't be attacking people that are willing to speak up.  if you really want to know what is wrong, ask intelligent questions.  he didn't even sound unreasonable.  and I have to agree with him that you all are anonymous so to those that bitched about that i think you may have been looking for something wrong...not right to attack the person...attack their arguments. <br>  <br> and i was also in a guild that maintained for hours on end pof with 12 people...not as great an accomplishment as yours but one nonetheless.

				I wouldnt say people kiss lods asses, they are the best its as simple as that. Of course they might be a little big headed and tight knit but i guess they can afford it, they do not have to rely on anyone not in LOD. Whilst all the other guilds cannot do anything without inviting 4 or 5 other guilds.

				   True to be at that kind of level and with such great equip it would seriously damage their social lives. And people with damaged social lives do tend to lash out at others. But you can't make assumptions about all of LoD by the actions of few/most of them.  <br>    You can make fun of the lack of care they have about their members going around trashing the guildname but thats about it.  <br>    I must add that as long as I have known them I dont remember the name LoD ever being a respectable title.    <br>    You can quote William Wallace from the movie &quot;Braveheart&quot; on the topic of titles.  <br>  <br> &quot;People dont follow titles, They follow courage.&quot; <br> =p <br>  <br> ps. Im not 12.... but I sure do have the grammar skills of a 12 year old. &quot;I also have the attention span of one&quot; <br>  <br> Hakeem Bloodbringer <br> Dark Ranger of Innoruuk <br> &quot;Its not how many times you die its how many hours you spend getting back to where you started.&quot;
