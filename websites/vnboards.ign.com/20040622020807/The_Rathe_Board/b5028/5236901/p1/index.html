				This message is intended for KEG, Sodiacus, Raain, and especially Fitz. <br>  <br> You know Fitz, the last week I played Roebin you and I had a talk and what you told me was true and I felt it important enough to come here and post it. Besides, I am banned from KEG's site, am I not? I haven't tried to post there, but you did tell me I was banned. BTW to prove it is me, Roebin (old Roebin) the last digits of my IP are (.6.102). Since you bragged you had my IP address on KEG's website (you are the moderator so you obviously can look it up), then you will know it is me, for real. <br>  <br> Basically, I am coming here to dispel some rumors that my best friend told me about- specifically about a player on the Rathe by the name of Advaik saying he was me and posting messages taking &quot;credit&quot; for my accusations against KEG. I went to KEG's BBS and read back a little and saw your posts to where you guys flamed Advaik for being me. Advaik is not me. There is no massive conspiracy as you guys wrote on your site. I have a static IP that never changes.   <br>  <br> First of all, I do not understand why Advaik would be so stupid as to say he was me, considering everything that happened. Advaik, you have got to be the stupidest person alive for telling the uber-nazis (hehe j/k) on the Rathe that you were me. I bet now you wish you didn't, eh? <br>  <br> There is no multi-person conspiracy against KEG. KEG hasn't crossed my mind since I sold Roebin on Ebay a couple months ago. And the posts I made were made by me and me alone, there was no one else involved. I cannot speak for your paranoia thinking otherwise, but since Advaik came forward and said he was me, then I agree that logic would dictate that that would yet be another avenue for you to attack. <br>  <br> Now for my insights. First, not all of KEG was responsible for what happened. I have all the facts now, and I am saying it right here that only 1 person in KEG participated in the actions against me on the Rathe server. That person, who I am not going to name simply because I am not here to argue again, for one reason or another, whatever reason, he (or she, never talked to him in real life) decided to use his pull in the game to ruin my gaming experience. <br>  <br> So was I wrong including all of KEG? Let me finish and you make the call. For 3 months I tried to get KEG to quit harrassing me in the game. 3 Months. I must have spoken to 100 players about it. On KEG's website, Poizon just left the Rathe server for exactly the same reason I was hating the game and what did you post to her. What? &quot;Oh, sorry Poizon, we are going to miss you, have a nice day.&quot; You go back and read what she wrote. Then read what I wrote. Hmm, sounds pretty familiar, eh? <br>  <br> So since I was subject to that crap from KEG, and since I tried to find out why, it didn't take long for me to realise how unforgiving you guys were, and that I could get nowhere in trying to get it to stop. Then the camps were being overrun by you guys, my guild was getting trained regularly, monopolization of spawns, ect. But look, we have been through it so there is no need to ramble on anymore about it. <br>  <br> But then I go to your webpage and tried to get the matter resolved and that marginal person Damail or whatever her name is instigated it to higher levels, with the full support of 90% of KEG. That is the impressional I got. <br>  <br> But I want to let KEG know that most of what happened is a big misunderstanding on my part. I thought all of KEG was involved in the scam and it turned out only 1 was. I guess it was the multiple characters these guys have in many of the uberguilds that throws it off. Bottom line is, and this is just my opinion, you are entitled to yours, what I thought was happening on the Rathe was wrong. And if one player in your guild had a hand in it, then so be it. But does it matter? Hell no. Verant doesn't care. <br>  <br> And let me clear another thing up right now. I never contacted Verant directly about it. I posted on 3 sites, including KEG's site, and other players copied those posts. <br>  <br> So knowing Verant didn't care about it, and knowing that the harrassment by the uberguilds wasn't going to stop, I bailed. And you know what? It was the best decision I ever made. Everquest does affect people in the worst ways. I went to everquest's bulletin board and did some reading and it reminded me of the posts from 6 months ago- same old bitterness and anger, and frustration. People shooting each other down. People complaining over things that really don't amount to a rats ass. <br>  <br> I haven't played EQ in months. There is no conspiracy against your guild. I left Everquest because I didn't like the commercialization of EQ and I admit I sold Roebin simply because I wasn't going to walk away from the game and leave 62 days of work for nothing. Call me a hypocrite. Call me anything you want. When I was in the game I heard it from KEG daily anyway, so what does it matter? And Fitz, the last wekk I was playing I was getting denial of service attacks while in the game. I won't draw conclusions about that here, but you have to admit, getting syn flooded over a video game is pretty lame. And being on a static chassis doesn't help either. Was I bullied on the Rathe? You bet. <br>  <br> I do apologize to those innocents that got caught up in the &quot;smackdown&quot; simply because of your guildtag, or your blind following of others who had deceived you. I stand by everything I said, minus the &quot;whole&quot; KEG involvement. Reflecting back on it I should have been more specific. Maybe it was the mass-denial from KEG that inflamed it. But now I know that 99% of KEG didn't have a clue as to what the situation was all about. But I don't appreciate the mass-hysteria against me in the game- tribal instinct would be the best way to describe it. Those that believe they have reason to be offended, I apologize.  <br>  <br> Fritz, how long would it have taken before I got an apology from KEG for what they put me through? When hell freezes over? I know that. Leaving EQ made me realise that it just doesn't matter. You were right. It was natural human instinct that if people want to make tons of money off an easy thing they can do it. But respect my opinion that I believed that it was wrong, and that is why I eventually left the game. I am a man of principle, and I didn't believe that it was worth my $10 a month to get harrassed by KEG and other uber guilds and be denied spawns, ect, and remain silent. Silence is consent. There was no way I was consenting to what was going on. <br>  <br> But I do hope that you all feel better knowing that I am not playing EQ in any shape or form. My best friend drops by once in awhile. He got a shield that is the only one on Tarew Marr so we were pretty excited when that happened. <br>  <br> Odd point, what I just said, considering that when I played Roebin for 62 days the most I could do for him on the Rathe was get level 40 gear at level 50 because other paying players kept us non-uber guilded people out of events, with the full support and complacency of Verant. <br>  <br> I also want to apologize to those members of noble house that were offended by what happened. I never had any intention of bringing that guild into the fray, and they should have approached me and told me what the deal was. Like I said, for months I tried to get it worked out. Maybe if you guys treated other players on the server like people none of this would have ever happened.  <br>  <br> Raain, I read on KEG's site that you think I was Advaik, or whoever the hell he is. Wrong friend, and I do still consider you to be a friend. I told you I was leaving EQ, I guess I should have been more clear. We never did get you the SF hilt and I never got the BP from the vamp in the tower in MM. How long did we try? Weeks? Months?  <br>  <br> And Sodiacus, sorry about hearing that KOP disbanded. That is another reason I am here. My points are proven. Here I am out of the game for months, and the bitterness in EQ prevails. I don't know all the details of what happened with Advaik saying he was me, but whatever effect this whole situation had on the guild, I apologize. And if you see Roebin in the game, that is not me, so don't harrass him. Just goes to show that while people say everything is cool in EQ, it is one of the most abrasive communities on the internet. <br>  <br> Fritz, in closing, I must say I enjoyed talking to you, even if it did get confrontational at times. If you get around to it, unbar me from your website so I can apologize to those keggers that were wrongly accused. 1 bad apple doesn't spoil your entire guild and I want to let them know it. But if you don't want to unban me, at least copy this portion of the message so they know. <br>  <br> And for those of you who disagree with my opinion that the commercialization of EQ is not good for the game, don't be pissed off at my opinion. You are entitled to disagree if you want. But you need to know that I don't miss EQ at all and I have found another cool game to play. So don't waste your energy hating other players over their opinions. That is the lesson I learned after I took some time to think about it. <br>  <br> Take care KEG/FRITZ/RAAIN/SODIACUS and all my other pals, I hope you make it to level 90 when the new expansion pack comes out. If you want to continue this chat, feel free to write me at prophet@consultant.com <br>  <br> And know that there is no conspiracy against any of you guys- this isn't the X-Files. <br>  <br> Roebin (old Roebin) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>

				Advaik, man am I pleased that you saw the message. One of my best friends has his main on Tarew Marr and an alternate on Rathe and he told me what was happening. I basically came to clear your name. But you have to admit that what you did was pretty stupid by going to KEG and telling them you were me. <br>  <br> See, I told KEG I had other accounts on Rathe, which I did, but I gave those away and sold Roebin. It wasn't until I left EQ that I realised that the game was having a bad effect on me, as well as many other players. <br>  <br> In beta we had a blast. When the first phase of the commercial end hit the market it was pretty cool too. But then the trolls showed up and started commercializing it. <br>  <br> But is it wrong? NO. <br>  <br> Why do I say that? Because Verant says it is cool and it is their game and I am just a lowly customer. <br>  <br> That doesn't mean I agree and that is why I left the game, because I don't agree and won't be forced to agree. <br>  <br> But the news of a so-called &quot;conspiracy&quot; by some kegger posts had to also be resolved because I alone brought the accusations against them which I admit now were overblown since one person was behind the harrassment. Can one person ruin a player's gaming experience in EQ? You better believe it. This guy had tons of loyalists who made my gaming time miserable. <br>  <br> You don't have to agree with that but my suspicion is Advaik got a taste of it just for saying he was me, much to his regret from reading his posts. <br>  <br> Bottom line is, it should be dropped. I went to KEG's site and they are planning to take non-guilded folks to the planes and events. Maybe there is hope for them and since I got away from the madness that is EQ I can comment on favor of KEG doing that. To me, it is a long time coming- those guildless people should have been accepted into the &quot;groups&quot; long before...months before.  <br>  <br> Anyway, I hope this clears things up, and I also hope no one wants to go another round or two because frankly, it isn't worth my valuable time. Most of the foilks I argued with were just agressive due to what everquest does to people, and others simply wanted to argue because they are anonymous over the internet. My opinion, and that is all it is, was that commercialization was hurting everquest, and if you don't care for that opinion then so what? I am one person, not an army propaganda machine looking to chop people off at the knees. I knew Verant didn't mind the Ebay thing but I made up my mind that if it didn't change I was going to leave the game. And it didn't so I left. <br>  <br> If anyone talks to Raain or Sodiacus let them know to read the first post so they get the word.  <br>  <br> Thnx all <br>  <br> it's been said before and I'll say it again... &quot;Remember when it just used to be a game?&quot; <br>  <br> --I agree Drakain, and I miss those early days, believe me. If they ever return, drop me a line and I might come back and play.

				If you think I am immature then go ahead and think that. I could care less. About now i am so sick and fed up with everyone that I could do anything. I quit because rathe sucks. What with KEG the power guild and BOTS the wanna be power guild with the little CiW and MFH trying to get in on KEG powerguilding and VS hating everyone and cussing out the guild that they are allied with it's just no fun. It's politics at it's peak. And you know what I gotta say about politics? Jack shit it's just like all of you to verant. It means shit, it talks shit, and it will be forever, shit. All of you have to realize that this game JUST AIN'T FUN ANYMORE. Hell even the new servers suck because they are following the old servers and making powerguilds and politics. When you guys get your heads out of your asses and stop being stuck up sob's maybe just maybe something would change but untill then you are snobby clickish politics. I thought I was done posting on this board but I guess some people just have to bring my name up again.

				Advaik, <br>  <br> I don't even know who you are. I don't even remember you in the game. If I offended you by calling you stupid then I apologize bro.  <br>  <br> Believe me I know how you feel. I don't even want to think about the harrassment I went through at the hands of the guilds you mentioned.  <br>  <br> The last week on EQ that I was playing I couldn't even play because I was getting ping flooded or syn-flooded with denial of service attacks. So under those conditions, should I have kept playing and paying my $10 a month? Hell no. <br>  <br> Man, I hope they weren't as rough on you as they were on me. But look, if you want to see something that may make you feel better then go to everquest's main board. There are thousands of those angry, bitter, dangerous uber-guilders there screaming about a new &quot;be nice&quot; policy. I don't know all the details but so far it sounds pretty good. If Verant sticks with that policy I may come back. But in order for that to happen I will need to see draconian changes by Verant. A anti-camping &quot;be nice&quot; to your fellow EQ player is a great start. <br>  <br> Anyway Advaik, I don't know you, but you appear to be as angry as I was when this was happening to me. Walk away from the game for a time and you will be alright. You don't have any power over those tribal idiots on the servers so there is no sense letting it get to you. <br>  <br> You know, at everquests main board the uber-guilds are complaining about giving up rare spawns. Hell, with Roebin and 62 (accrued!) days I couldn't get jack for him. I would probably have been happy to get 1 piece of planes loot. But get to the planes? HA! Nice to dream about but when the Nazi SS run a server you can't get anything done. <br>  <br> At least you had the courage to complain. Complaining openly on the Rathe is like going up to the Nazis and bragging to them you are a Jew. Watch what that gets you. I hope the changes Verant made work out for the non-aggressive players like me, but from their past track record I won't hold my breath. <br>  <br> To me, EQ wasn't about selling stuff on Ebay. It wasn't about harrassing other players just because Verant didn't enforce a gaming climate that prevented otherwise. It was about having fun. <br>  <br> Hang in there bro.

				Roebin - I have been having stuff blamed on me since I was lvl 18. I am a prime target for things that go wrong because I accidently used a bug in unrest and it made a huge train. I mean fuck who hasn't made a huge train in unreat? I learn to just deal with what people say about me and let them go on with their little lies like fitz and sareena. That is NOT why I quit. I quit because I hate powerguilds. I HATE keg with their anti outsider policy. KEG is the most clickish bunch of pricks I have ever met in rl and not. I have had so many fingers pointed to me by keg it's not even funny. I have done N.O.T.H.I.N.G to keg as a guild but now I wish I had. I respect what you said about them before.

I love the fact that the uber-lamers like you Stuss are whining and crying on EQ main board about it.

				Advaik, <br>  <br> &quot;Roebin - I have been having stuff blamed on me since I was lvl 18.&quot; <br>  <br> -Yeah bro, I was too man so don't feel bad. <br>  <br> &quot;I am a prime target for things that go wrong because I accidently used a bug in unrest and it made a huge train.&quot; <br>  <br> -Yeah, its in their anonymous, behind the keyboard pussy nature to do crap like that. They are a bunch of punks and don't let them intimidate you. <br>  <br> &quot;I mean fuck who hasn't made a huge train in unreat?&quot; <br>  <br> -Hey, I have made my share of trains myself unintentionally. The game is designed to have monsters chase after you.  <br>  <br> &quot;I learn to just deal with what people say about me and let them go on with their little lies like fitz and sareena.&quot; <br>  <br> -I never had any run-ins with Sareena but I have had some with Fritz. And there are times he can be rather..intellectually challenged. <br>  <br> &quot;That is NOT why I quit. I quit because I hate powerguilds. I HATE keg with their anti outsider policy. &quot; <br>  <br> -Yeah, everyone tells them about it but they ignored it. Well, the &quot;be-nice&quot; policy will fix that HAHA! I don't hate KEG. I Don't waste my time hating bottom-feeders.  <br>  <br> &quot;KEG is the most clickish bunch of pricks I have ever met in rl and not.&quot; <br>  <br> -Yeah, the 90210 guild crap was a problem, but like I said, Verant IS on top of it hehe. <br>  <br> &quot;I have had so many fingers pointed to me by keg it's not even funny.&quot; <br>  <br> -Me too. Notice how asthmatics like Stusser come here and blindly defend them? Isn't it hilarious? What did they promise old Stuss?  <br>  <br> &quot;I have done N.O.T.H.I.N.G to keg as a guild but now I wish I had.&quot; <br>  <br> -Nah, don't bother with it bro. They aren't worth it. <br>  <br> &quot; I respect what you said about them before.&quot; <br>  <br> -Yup. Thanks. Like I said, the truth hurts, and that is why they attacked me the way they did. I stand by everything I have said, minus implicating all keggers in the lameness. Alot of KEG are still lame because what they do to people on the server, but that is another topic entirely. But like I said, don't worry. Trust me, go to EQ main board and see how Verant is dealing with these bullies now. It is hilarious!    <br>  <br>

				You think *I'M* defending KEG?  <br>  <br> Half of the guild hates me, dumbfuck. A couple of weeks ago whoever was playing Mills' account went after me anonymously on chat when Rathe was down; when I asked &quot;BMills&quot; who was playing him he wouldn't answer and left the channel. I went on a joint raid with KEG a couple of weeks ago and couldn't even get a clarity. <br>  <br> I'm sucking up to KEG? That's got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Yeah, KEG is giving me ph4t l00t for flaming you on EQVault when I was asked not to post on their website anymore. Yeah, I'm trying to get in KEG when half the guild hates my guts. Dumbfuck. <br>  <br> Read back on their board to when you actually made the claims, I was half on your side. I bitched about the uberguilds just like you're attempting to do now, although even then I didn't buy the log of ebay shit you pulled out of your ass. Actually, no, I didn't do it just like you're doing now... I didn't make it out like they had a personal goal to fuck me over, I made it out like that was how the game works and it sucked. And, it does, *still*, suck. But there's not much we can do about it. These &quot;play nice&quot; policies are not gonna help. Obviously. <br>  <br> I find it really amusing to see adviak and roebin bitching together like old women. You guys are birds of a feather... one is absolutely insane and the other seems to be living in a different world than the rest of us. Fuck you both. <br>  <br> Oh, and what did they do to Adviak exactly? He was a bad player, he lied constantly, (much like yourself) and he couldn't be trusted. He said that he was the original adviak's wife, and the original player had died. He apologized multiple times then recanted multiple times. Hell, he even claimed he was YOU just for the noteriety. That's how crazy that guy is, he's just WACKO. I mean really, he's just ODD. You're paranoid with delusions of grandeur, but he's FUCKED UP IN THE HEAD. <br>  <br> But thats besides the point... what did they actually DO to adviak? What can KEG actually *DO* to ANYBODY? They can not invite you to planes or dragons, but they don't invite outsiders anyway. They can train you, but if you prove it then get banned. They can killsteal from you, but you were level fifty anyway. Everquest isn't PvP, they can't directly affect you... and they simply don't have enough power to make your game hell. Or they (or some of them, not the entire guild, ok fistal?) would have done it to ME. <br>  <br> And really, I've yet to see any proof that anyone in KEG purposefully trained or killstole from ANYONE. They might be self-righteous and exclusionary, they might have a couple of serious pricks in their ranks (cough, stalkin, iegen, alkarn, cough) but have they actually stolen kills or trained anyone? Can you prove it? <br>  <br> All they can REALLY do is exclude you from their activities, and they were gonna do that anyway, right? <br>  <br> Guess what, I'm not a friend in &quot;KEG and Friends&quot;, I'm not in BoTS, and I've gone to planes four times in the past week. That's what my guild is all about. Instead of constant bitching, we actually made a guild powerful enough to do some of this shit by ourselves. <br>  <br> Nothing that happened to either of you is your fault, right? Adviak caused a train at level 18 and so he's screwed. You made some bad comments during a dragon raid so you're screwed. It's always someone else's fault, right? It's never YOUR fault. It's KEG's fault because they're exclusionary (which is their right, even though it sucks for everybody else) or it's my fault, (because I'm so scared of KEG that I won't speak up a word against them), or it's the game's fault (because you accidentally trained in Unrest, and that's just how the game works, monsters follow you) or it's..... someone else's fault. Right? <br>  <br> Guess what, bucko. It *IS* your fault, because you're responsible for your own actions, and you will be judged by them. And yes, people have very, VERY, long memories. Oh yes, VERY long memories. <br>  <br> Oh, and since when is &quot;asthmatic&quot; an insult? Don't you mean &quot;asskisser&quot; or something like that? <br>  <br> I really honestly don't even know why you guys are still posting here. You both sold your characters, why not move on with your life? <br>  <br> Stusser, Ranger of the 47th Glade (semi-retired)  <br> Slant, Shaman of the 50th Winter  <br>  <br>  <br>

				Well Im not THAT busy at work to not reply and i have kina a different slant. <br>  <br> It's funny how this argument seems so 20 minutes ago to me but ill try and spread some of my knowledge. <br>  <br> As a person I am one in 200,000 subcribers of this Game. So do I think that my opinion is gonna sway people's opinion one way or another? No i don't. I just wanna give a slant. <br>  <br> I got this game back in april of 99. I met Avaik and Roebin early on. I NEVER had a problem with them in a group setting. I know that they had problems with other people and, well, who doesn't. I've pissed people off and made them laugh their collective asses off. I'm mostly a get along type of person because I get enough confrontation in real life because of my Job. Spend thirty days in the mud in some weird out of they way places and you get the idea. <br>  <br> Advaik, <br> Bro you are kinda INSANE i hope the meds keep you stable for a while. I'm insane too so misery loves company and all that. LOL I watched you purposefully piss people off and I seen you go WAY out of your way to help people too so its kinda funny. That time you came back to sol B for a while in a robe and JUST ressesd people for hours at the zone was kinda funny ( err considering alot of the ones you ressed were people you formerly went out of your way to piss off) <br>  <br> Roebin, <br> Well I'm not really involved with any of the &quot;Politics&quot; of your self destruction of Reobin. You always seemed to be a person of high standard and moral fiber. I was in a Bat/Bug group the night that you went on that Dragon raid and I did witness you in a pretty big /ooc shouting match with about 50 people LOL. Not sure if that classifies you as insane but it was pretty crazy. Sometimes its hard to step back count to 10 and try again but I find im doing it alot lately. Anyway, Roe I dont know if you remember me anymore I am the guy you use to group with and I ,like many of my guild mates, helped you camp that dumbass Vampire in the MM tower for MANY nights. One night you said something to a VERY dear friend of mine and she was upset about it. I wont mention her Name but you know who I mean &quot;A guildmate of ours&quot;. I was away on buisness but when I came back you were kicked, or left the guild and I never got a striaght answer from any party involved. After that seems things just sort of deteriorated between us. The problem was I was your &quot;Friend&quot; and I was the person involved's, we will call her the victim's, &quot;Freind&quot;. She being a person I can look to watch my back ANYTIME. I still see Raain form time to time and I will tell him to check this post. Not sure what really happend that night in the tower or on the Dragon raid but, as I've said, it was 20 mins ago anyway so it has no real relevance to right now. Planes raids are being done all the time by other guilds now. I never had a problem with any of the Big Guild's ( I wont use Uber Guild because it seems inflamatory and not really necessary) and it seems at least that the Rathe server's Big Guild's have actually gone out of their way ( to me at least) to help others get into raids with them. If I do go on a planes raid with KeG or BoTs or VS or MFH I expect for them to get the Lions share of the booty. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE. Any raid that me or a guild member ever went on had an equal chance at all loot and that is something that I respect from them. Snaggle from KeG even went so far as to write me back the other day when he included me on a Planes run and I couldn't make it. Saying that he was sorry I couldn't go and such but was VERY respectful to me , even tho he didnt have to be. I ain't kissing up it's just a fact. This argument these troubles, they need to be put to bed. I can appreciate your sencerity in coming here, swollowing pride and posting that you made an error and didn't mean to piss on a whole guild and that seems more in character with the old Roebin. Sigh..I am glad to see everyone working together nowadays and the Big -Guilds offering to take others into a Planes raid or whathaveyou. I think it wasnt an exclusion of people on these runs either by the Big - Guilds. I think it was rather easier to organize a raid within a guild because they all check the same sites. they all know one another and can work together MUCH better as a team than some make-shift planes runs. I have seen a Guild only planes run, go like clockwork, while a make shift planes run struggled to even clear the protal, even tho there were 55 people in the makeshift run and 35 in the guild run. As usual ALL of these problems extended from a lapse in communication. IF we as a society in EQ could communicate better. If people had the ability to communicate their thoughts in a chat environment better I think 75 percent of disagreements would be settled. Almost always in an EQ chat fight someone always tosses out &quot;If we were face to face i bet you wouldn't act this way&quot;. LOL like they think the threat of Violence will curb the argument,rather i offer, if you were face to face the problem would be resolved because its easier to get a point accross when you are standing in front of someone. Now roebin please do not use a reference to &quot;asthma&quot; as your basis for a put down. Asthma is a desease that, the last time I checked, is not caused by too much time in front of a computer. The use of which you used to say that someone with asthma is somehow lesser than yourself. I'll offer this. I was an Army Ranger for 6 years, I had Asthma till I was 18. I don't feel that your use of the term for a desease I fought day and night for most of my young life is anything to toss around lightly or to poke fun at or to use as an epithet of someone somehow lesser than a &quot;normal&quot; person. Please don't use those again as it does somehow reduce the fact that you came to this board to appologize. <br>  <br> See ya bro, <br> Talan <br>  <br> P.S. Advaik hehe you are crazy..I think thats what makes you so interesting LOL

				Stuss Said:&quot;You think *I'M* defending KEG?&quot; <br>  <br> -Hell yes, go check out your posts on their website. I have seen you in action before. Throw the occasional &quot;asshole&quot; around at folks and then think yourself as cool. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;Half of the guild hates me, dumbfuck&quot; <br>  <br> -Point being, you toss up a website, call every other person an &quot;asshole&quot; or a &quot;dumbfuck&quot; and now your telling me KEG hates you? Join the club man. They hate anyone that isn't into their &quot;game plan&quot; or interferes with their &quot;business.&quot; You know, shit like (nagafen.com)- no possibility of trade infringment there, eh? Oh yeah man they are just angels sitting in heaven and Stuss is just hated by them. Yeah, right. <br>  <br> I had respect for you Stuss when I posted on your site and you posted to KEG &quot;Uberguilding asshole guilds&quot;- you know, I was like &quot;man, Stuss knows what is going on!&quot; But man, after that, it was chamberlainian love notes from there. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;I was half on your side. I bitched about the uberguilds just like you're attempting to do now, although even then I didn't buy the log of ebay shit you pulled out of your ass.&quot; <br>  <br> -That's because you were to damned lazy to check it out for yourself. So you toss around a few swears at people and shrug it off. Lazy-minded journalism Stuss. Bottom line. You ever contact me directly? NO. So you didn't have a clue, didn't give a shit, or both. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;I didn't make it out like they had a personal goal to fuck me over, I made it out like that was how the game works and it sucked.&quot;  <br>  <br> -That was the only thing I bitched about Stuss. Was the commercialization. It destroyed EQ. And where do you think the &quot;play nice&quot; policy directed by Gordon came from? It didn't come from everyone in EQ saying &quot;Hi, how are you. Would you like to come to the planes with us?&quot;--No, it came from &quot;What the fuck are you doing here lamer? You aren't going to the planes because we run this server and you aren't in our guild so screw you. And loot? Hah! Dream on asshole. That shit is heading to Ebay.&quot; <br>  <br> That is where the &quot;Be nice policy&quot; came from. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;But there's not much we can do about it. These &quot;play nice&quot; policies are not gonna help. Obviously.&quot; <br>  <br> -Oh, I bet they do help Stuss. You know why? The last week I tried to play on EQ, the instant I logged into the game I was getting blasted off the net by denial of service attacks. You make it sound like I didn't know what the hell I was talking about. And try to tell me that EQ doesn't need a &quot;be nice&quot; policy to get those brats under control. <br>  <br> Stuss Said:&quot;I find it really amusing to see adviak and roebin bitching together like old women.&quot; <br>  <br> -What you think I like coming here to exchange blows with assholes like you Stuss? Hell no. I knew the real deal long before I ever talked to you the first time. I was in Sol B and keggers and other uber-nazis were swearing at me in OOC. Zatosia, the head GM for the rathe was in the zone...and she didn't do jack about it. Just because you didn't have the balls to confront shit like that doesn't mean I don't have the balls. And as far as me being here, I was out of EQ for 3 months, and they told &quot;everyone&quot; that Advaik was me. You believe that shit Stuss? They screwed with Advaik so hard, I had people contacting me 3 months later asking me to get involved to set it straight. So don't even say it doesn't happen Stuss. Advaik is proof. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;one is absolutely insane and the other seems to be living in a different world than the rest of us. Fuck you both.&quot; <br>  <br> -yada yada yada <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;Oh, and what did they do to Adviak exactly? He was a bad player, he lied constantly, (much like yourself) and he couldn't be trusted.&quot; <br>  <br> -Really? Gee Stuss, how did I lie? Because KEG said I lied? Quit being such a follower; it stinks being on your knees Stuss. Stand on you feet up to where I am and breath some fresh air. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;Hell, he even claimed he was YOU just for the noteriety. That's how crazy that guy is, he's just WACKO. I mean really, he's just ODD. You're paranoid with delusions of grandeur, but he's FUCKED UP IN THE HEAD.&quot; <br>  <br> -Hey I laughed my ass off initially when I heard about what Advaik did by saying he was me. But then after I heard what they did to him, I had to clear his name. As far as his mental condition goes- only Advaik knows that, and when I was with special operations we had guys 1000 times more wacko than Advaik or anyone could ever dream of being. So you can call Advaik wacko, and me delusional and it doesn't mean jack. That is the average talk in EQ- an infestation of lamers. You fit right in with them Stuss, believe me you do. You know, &quot;Hey, this guy is against our bullying and the other shit we do. Let's smear him by calling him wacko and delusional.&quot; Old shit Stuss. Can't you at least be original? <br>  <br> Stuss Said:&quot;They can train you, but if you prove it then get banned.&quot; <br>  <br> -Bullshit Stuss and you know it. Man, you are so clueless as to what the deal is I don't even know why I bother trying to explain it to you. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;Everquest isn't PvP, they can't directly affect you... and they simply don't have enough power to make your game hell.&quot; <br>  <br> -Again, total lie Stuss. I was systematically harrassed by those assholes for months- and when I wouldn't &quot;go away&quot; they hit me with denial of service attacks. Now tell me that another player doesn't have the ability to ruin the gameplay for someone else. You shouldn't even represent the EQ community in any form Stuss because you are an apologist. The lamest of the lame. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;And really, I've yet to see any proof that anyone in KEG purposefully trained or killstole from ANYONE. They might be self-righteous and exclusionary, they might have a couple of serious pricks in their ranks (cough, stalkin, iegen, alkarn, cough) but have they actually stolen kills or trained anyone? Can you prove it?&quot; <br>  <br> -Proving that is cake. I am certain others who read this will step forward and discuss it, if they have the balls. Better yet Stuss, instead of hearing it from me, go to Keg's board under general and read Poizon's post. You know, the one where she says she is leaving the Rathe because of uber-guilded assholes, their trains, and their lack of taking people on events (monopolization). Basically everything I have been saying. And when you read her post, try not to be dumbed down and use selective listening this time. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;All they can REALLY do is exclude you from their activities, and they were gonna do that anyway, right?&quot; <br>  <br> -Shit, that just wasn't me. That was their universal policy. It changed this week, but that was probably because Verant &quot;finally&quot; got sick of the shit and told them to quit being assholes. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;Guess what, I'm not a friend in &quot;KEG and Friends&quot;, I'm not in BoTS, and I've gone to planes four times in the past week. That's what my guild is all about. Instead of constant bitching, we actually made a guild powerful enough to do some of this shit by ourselves.&quot; <br>  <br> -Gee Stuss, when all this shit was going down, did you and your &quot;powerful&quot; guild ever contact me to bring me to the planes? Hell no. The situation on the Rathe is so bad why do you think they have the &quot;be nice&quot; policy now? Verant just didn't &quot;hallucinate&quot; one day and just make it up. Guys like you Stuss are nothing but part of the problem because you refuse to see the truth and your complacency is consent. Ask Advaik, I am sure he can explain it better than I can. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;Nothing that happened to either of you is your fault, right? Adviak caused a train at level 18 and so he's screwed. You made some bad comments during a dragon raid so you're screwed. It's always someone else's fault, right? It's never YOUR fault.&quot; <br>  <br> -Oh Boy! I said, &quot;Go nagafen!&quot; one night when they were attacking him. Is that bad Stuss? Pull that crack-pipe out of your mouth and and tell me how saying &quot;Go Nagafen&quot; was a bad thing. It was harmless. But since you weren't there, it is obvious, once again, that your &quot;blind following&quot; of misinformation stands out again like a signal flare off of a rowboat. Did you check it out for yourself? Fuck no. You just come here and blah blah blah blah. <br>  <br> Stuss Said:&quot;Guess what, bucko. It *IS* your fault, because you're responsible for your own actions, and you will be judged by them. And yes, people have very, VERY, long memories. Oh yes, VERY long memories.&quot; <br>  <br> -No shit Stuss. It could be for any reason. I saw people just show up in the same proximity as those lamers and be harrassed for months, with doing nothing wrong at all. Insofar as the long, long, long, memories....That is highschool shit, standard EQ intimidation that doesn't mean jack. 99% of the problems that come my way I can handle myself without breaking a sweat. The other 1% my pals in the FBI take over. So if you are going to threaten people Stuss, be a man and put it on the table. Don't use &quot;high school&quot; 90210 rhetoric. Tell me how you really feel! <br>  <br> Stuss Said:&quot;Oh, and since when is &quot;asthmatic&quot; an insult? Don't you mean &quot;asskisser&quot; or something like that?&quot; <br>  <br> -asskisser to Keg may have been more appropriate. <br>  <br> Stuss said:&quot;I really honestly don't even know why you guys are still posting here. You both sold your characters, why not move on with your life?&quot; <br>  <br> -I already have moved on. Leaving EQ was the best decision I made in a long time. But since it is getting fixed, I will probably be back. Insofar as your &quot;desire&quot; to know why I am posting here, well, it's a right I have under the 1st Amendment. Read about it Stuss, you might learn something. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

				Talan, <br>  <br> Thank you for your kind words. Yes, I have apologized to KEG members that weren't involved and that apology stands. I also apologized to Noble House folks because they weren't even involved for the most part and for some reason came forward claiming &quot;responsibility&quot; for some of the issues I talked about. <br>  <br> Not all of Keg was responsible for what happened. There was a Nagafen raid one night and I shouted &quot;Go Nagafen&quot; and the next thing I know I had the plague in EQ. Did I have the right to find out why and who was responsible? You bet. <br>  <br> So basically I stood back, looked at what was happening to me, and then decided to analyze it a bit further and confront what I believed were serious problems in EQ. It was just my opinion, and point being- if my opinion pissed off so many people, then is it not true? Where there's smoke there is fire. And I found the fire. <br>  <br> But yes, I remember you, and yes there were times in the game that even I got confrontational with people, and yes, that is directly related to the game itself. You get people playing the game for hours and hours and it makes people mean inside. I am convinced of that. They get nasty to other people. Then you get the crew that commercializes it for profit, and that makes it even worse. <br>  <br> But as the honorable person I am, I heard what happened to Advaik, and if that isn't at least some proof of what I have been saying, then no amount of proof will ever convince you. <br>  <br> There are people in Keg that I like personally, as well as alot of other guilds. I play SubSpace regularly with keggers and they are pretty cool. Would they crap all over themselves if they knew who I was in SubSpace? Yup. <br>  <br> But that is the irony. People look at characters in EQ as &quot;real&quot; people, when they are not. A distinct set of &quot;traits&quot; begins to form around a digital character, having no connection with real life, yet people look at those same digital characters as having the same &quot;physical&quot; traits as living people. Nothing could be further from the truth. 100 different people could be playing one character. How can you prove otherwise? You can't. <br>  <br> About Raain, yes I miss that guy. He was cool. We tried to get him the SoulFire hilt from Mistmoore for months. You were with me many months trying to get the breastplate off of Gunther. I spent more collective time there trying to get one item, which I never got, than it took me to go up 10 levels. Frustrating? You bet. <br>  <br> I was also annoyed to see that KOP was disbanded because Advaik I guess joined after I left. I told everyone, including Sodiacus, that I was leaving Everquest. They knew the deal. The whole guild knew so I don't understand why the guild failed. Raain left KOP right before I left EQ, so that wasn't an issue. He deserved to get some stuff because he was in his 40's and basically didn't have jack like me.  <br>  <br> Personally, there are problems on the Rathe. I don't know how they are now, but there were serious problems. If the uber-guilds are now taking people to the planes then that is great. Believe me I am all for it and it is a long time coming. <br>  <br> But yes, keep in mind, and I reemphasise again, that I do not hate KEG. There are bums in every guild and every guild has their fair share. But there are individual's on the Rathe who do, on the individual level, have the capability of making a players life living hell. I posted to KEG's BBS and shortly there after I was getting denial of service attacks in the game, the instant I logged into EQ. Do I believe the board administrators coughed up my static IP? You bet. Did I take action by calling the FBI under the interstate communications felony denial of service law? No.  <br>  <br> It was the signal to me of the resounding lameness of Everquest, and the limit that people will go to, to take &quot;action&quot; against people they consider to be real, yet are digital characters in the game. Guys like Stuss come here and say &quot;Gee, everything is hunkeydorey&quot; but thousands of people know it isn't. <br>  <br> Why do you think Verant has the new &quot;be nice&quot; policy? It wasn't because of me, or what happened to me as a player. It is because of what happened to &quot;thousands&quot; of players. I say that it is a long time coming, and should have been implemented sooner. Point being, if you don't like a &quot;digital player&quot; then by all means have at it. But as a fellow paying customer, you have no right to ruin the play of that other person. That is what happened to me, as well as many others, and I am not afraid to say it. <br>  <br> It is &quot;fashionable&quot; to &quot;be cool&quot; and join the &quot;uber guilds.&quot; So what? If a person doesn't want to, then other players, regardless of their guild status, have no right to take action against that player. That is what I was talking about. And that, combined with the commercialization of EQ, where paying customers were running &quot;businesses&quot; making huge profits off other player's &quot;inability&quot; to get items because the spawns were deliberately monopolized, to me, was the straw that broke the camel's back. I presented my opinion of it, and if anyone disagrees, then fine. But I will defend the facts, and my good name. <br>  <br> Take care bro and yes, if you do see Raain, tell him I said hello. <br>  <br> BTW you were a Ranger danger? We might have met before. When were you in? Were you at Battalion in Lewis? I was in special operations for almost 10 years. Were you in Somalia during the Ranger fiasco? I lost a friend there (KIA). Let me know and I will hook you up with my e-mail and we can chat about it. Thanks for serving bro, especially in the elite. I trained alot of Rangers and still have friends at Battalion. I also have alot of friends at Bragg in North Carolina (at group). Good talking to you. <br>  <br>
