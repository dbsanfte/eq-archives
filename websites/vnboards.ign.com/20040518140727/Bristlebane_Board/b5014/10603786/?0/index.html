				The Dark Side (TDS) Shard <br> http://www.tdsshard.com  <br> LoginServer=server1.tdsshard.com,2593  <br>  <br> TDS has upgraded!!! <br>  <br> No Lag, High stability, Large player base: <br>  <br> * TDS is now hosted at a professional ISP on a dedicated server. It's costing us over $4000 a year to do it but we are doing it. The players are so dedicated to this shard that they donated and made it happen. We have 9 months paid in full at this time. That right there should show you how good of a shard TDS is. <br> * TDS is now lag free. We can handle as many players as there are players that want to play all lag free. Since we have upgraded to the new ISP there is always over 100 players on. But don't take our word for it. Check out the current status page here: http://www.tdsshard.com/serverstatus2.htm <br> * TDS has been almost a year (over 310 days up) with no downtime ever.  <br> * TDS has more bug fixes than any other shard out there period. If there is a bug we know about it and have made a work around for it. <br>  <br> Uniqueness: <br>  <br> * TDS has more unique items than any other shard period. We have over 2000 unique items and weapons, everything that you can imagine. It's like we took all the great items from EQ and threw them into UO.  <br> * Players are always thinking up great ideas and we add them in. Players shape the shard to how they like it after all the shard is for the players. <br> * All monsters have a chance of dropping a unique item, weapon, or armor. Even though the items are rare they are worth it. Killing harder monsters means better magic items, stuff you have never seen anywhere else. <br> * TDS has over 200 unique monsters so you will always have something new; a lot of work went into fine-tuning those monsters so it is perfect for you. <br> * Unique dungeons that are fully spawned unlike anything you have every seen before for a unique hunting experience. <br>  <br> Features: <br>  <br> * TDS has Necromancy <br> * TDS has a skill stone where you can buy skills if you would rather hunt than macro. <br> * TDS allows macroing 24/7 <br> * Your character is completely customizable; we let you change everything about them to any style and color you would like with our special character customization stones. <br> * TDS has unique alchemy potions. <br> * TDS has a leveling system. Its completely optional but there are 30 levels and each level gives you +1 tactics and +1 magery.  <br> * Players get to start out with 100 in each STR, INT, DEX and 60 in a few skills so you can skip all that newbie stuff and get right into playing, you will need to extra stats and skills till you can get the good weapons and armor to fight the tough monsters. (Since we have 100 in all 3 stats we have working Bless and Curse spells unlike other shards). <br> * Skills on TDS gain faster than on OSI.. We have the speed set perfect where it's not to fast where you don't feel you earned it but not to slow either where you're not happy with the speed of skill gain. <br> * The monsters on TDS are HARD. This is a shard you want to come to if you want something new and a new challenge.  <br> * Every day we have multiple quests and tournaments and other events. <br> * No regents are required for any spell (other than summon spells). <br> * No skill cap. <br> * No guards but Moonglow is a safe zone. <br>  <br>  <br> Staff: <br>  <br> * We have a full staff of GMs as well as quest GMs that all they do is run quests for the players, one of the quest GMs we have just designs D&amp;D type dungeon raid quests for a small party of players, other quest GMs do full scale server wide quests.  <br> * The shard has three admins that work full time at nothing but improving the shards so you can have fun on it.  <br>  <br>  <br> Role Playing and No PvP: <br>  <br> * If you don't want to participate in general PvP mayhem then you don't have to. When you join the server you can choose your type of character, either PK or NonPK. If you are NonPK then players cannot attack or loot you ever. If you choose to go PK then you are open season by other PK characters. This way if you just want to hunt monsters and avoid PvP you can with no risk. (75% of the player base does this). <br>  <br> PvP: <br>  <br> * TDS is the premier PK server, with many PK players that come here for the unique experience of the thousands of unique items we have which really enhance PvP. <br> * We have a very detailed PvP ladder system with great prizes to show who is the best PvPers on the server. <br> * We do tournaments and color war events every day for everyone on the server to enjoy. <br> * Britain is a no magic town-fighting zone for that old town fighting experience. <br> * Serpent's hold is a free zone where both PK and NoNPK can go and hunt each other if that's what they want to do. <br> * We have a free for all arena that anyone can join if they want some PvP action 24/7 with no risk, we even supply the armor and weapons. <br>  <br>  <br> Craftsmen and Merchants: <br>  <br> * TDS is a craftsman's dream where everything is craft able and the sales of all items is done through player vendors; even all houses and boats are craft able. If you want food you need to forage it or buy it from another player. If you want arrows you need to make them or buy them from a player that is selling them. This promotes a nice healthy economy, which makes it fun for all people and gets away from the same boring UO and makes it exciting. <br> * TDS has tons of new craft able armor and bows as well, and are adding more craft able items every day. Every item that is sold on other shards by vendors is 100% craft able here. We also have a lot very nice magic items that are craft able, magic bows, magic tailored items, etc. We are adding more every day. <br> * Also all players purchase a spot for player vendors to sell their wares. We are probably the only sphere server out there that allows players to sell stackable items on their vendor through rename able bags.  <br>  <br> T2A new area (This stuff just applies to the new T2A area) <br>  <br> * We just opened up the new T2A area; it is geared toward the player that wants a real challenge. You have to create a new character that is T2A only to use this area. It's like a world in a world. <br> * There is no recall in T2A and only gate. Dungeons don't have gate so you have to work your way all the way in and out to get to the monsters with the great items. Its recommend you go in a group. <br> * There are no tags in T2A (There is one safe zone for blue players though). <br> * The unique item drop rate is 15x less than in normal lands so things are a lot rarer here. <br> * If you want to try out a real challenge then create a T2A only character. This area just opened up a few days ago and is considered the best PvP of any shard out there period! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> How to join: <br>  <br> * This shard isn't just a shard that some kid set up in his spare time; the admins of this shard have an average age of 32. Our team has spent the last year spending a good 16 hours a day each making this the best shard we possibly can. Give it a shot we know you will love it. If you want to play now you can be playing within minutes, as no signup application is necessary. Just make sure you are using client v2.0.0b and your login.cfg file has been changed to: <br>  <br>  <br> LoginServer=server1.tdsshard.com,2593 <br>  <br> If you need more help just visit our web page at  <br> http://www.tdsshard.com
