I do have a few questions that I submitted that were asked but may have been missed due to the change in chat format for this evening.  If I get them answered I will post those as well. <br /> <br /> Nolrog : What is the current status of the populations on the progression servers, and are there plans to merge them soon?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: We don't have concrete plans to merge the progression servers yet, but I'm pretty sure it will have to happen in the near future.<br /> <br /> Wycca: Taskmistress Krisz in Riwwi requires 24 people in-zone to spawn, is there any chance this could be reduced?<br /> <br /> Prathun: Back when Gates was released I didn't expect that the Taskmistress could be killed by less than 4 groups, and I didn't want players blowing the spawn or griefing others by popping her at an inappropriate time.  Times change though, and there's probably no harm in lowering the player requirement to spawn her now.<br /> <br /> It's currently set to 18 minimum. Prathun is going to lower that to a full group of 6.<br /> <br /> Wycca: Given that the monk disc Echo of Misdirection did not appear to meet its original goals, is there any intent to revisit this disc and improve its usefulness?<br /> <br /> Prathun: The Echo of Misdirection spell for monks wasn't working as I had intended, as most are aware, and it was possible to use the ability as in-camp crowd control when it was aimed as a pulling tool.<br /> <br /> We recently got the functionality necessary to allow or disallow the use of an ability / spell based on whether the caster is in combat or not, and I plan to change the Echo of Misdirection so that it's only usable outside of combat. I might make a few other tweaks to the ability, as well, and I'm always interested in the community's feedback on these kinds of changes.<br /> <br /> Wyre: What should players be looking forward to in this expansion, that uniquely seperates it from pervious ones? The talk of ship to ship combat etc?<br /> <br /> Rashere: In addition to the features for the expansion, The Buried Sea is set up to offer a lot of single group mission-based content similar to what we did with Dragons of Norrath. There's content both for the more casual players and the high end.<br /> <br /> Nodyin: As far as the expansion goes there is going to be a variety of content in the form of Missions that players at a large variety of levels will be able to do and improve their characters. There are several distinct areas in the expansion with a lot of different missions to explore. That's one of the main things I see being a positive for this expansion. We're definately giving the level 71+ crowd a lot more to do than they saw with TSS in this expansion<br /> <br /> Nodyin: In terms of items, there are some new mechanics that I think players will enjoy. Energeiac armor will allow players to "customize" stats to a certain extent, and I know a lot of people have asked for something along those lines for a while.<br /> <br /> Zigee: how is the retuning of items in TSS going, seems class items still lack focus as do most tier 4 armors?<br /> <br /> Merloc:  I'm planning to go over TSS items next week, he'll be adding more secondary mods to single group gear, upgrading some weapon ratios, and he'll be adding/changing focus effects on several items both raid and single group.<br /> <br /> Wyre: Are there plans to enchance the power of the regeneration line of spells in the future? Several druids voiced concerns with the loss of the spell in general, though others have also asked about plans to return it's utility in line with the currrent content.<br /> <br /> Prathun: The feedback I've received from druids was nearly unanimous that the regeneration spells were limited in use because of the impact of the out of combat regeneration system. I apologize to the druids that did enjoy Wildskin and Blessing of the Wild, but I think it's better for the class to have access to the upgraded DoT spells that I reintroduced. As far as looking at regeneration effects in light of the OOC regen system, I agree that it warrants looking into but I'm not sure what the resolution will be.<br /> <br /> Zigee: is the gargoyle event in FC2 going to get an overhaul? 2.5 hour event for an AUG, seems pretty poor risk vs reward base.<br /> <br /> Rashere:Yeah, we're taking another look at the loot on events like the gargoyles and will likely be upgrading the drops to full raid status. In that particular case, we also plan to tone down the length of the event<br /> <br /> Nolrog:Can you give any more details on Fellowships and they will work in TBC?<br /> <br /> Rashere: Felowships are a form of mini-guild that are targeted at players who tend to play with the same folks often.  They support about a groups worth of players (maybe up to 9...final numbers are still being decided) and allows those players to share a dedicated chat channel as well as create campsites.  The campsites, in turn, can be upgraded to provide beneficial effects to the fellowship members that are near it and other fellowship members can use a token to travel to the campsite quickly.<br /> <br /> Rogean: On Progression Servers, The Yellow Kill Messages stopped appearing after the patch yesterday, and IV on Sleeper Killed Quarm to unlock Gates of Discord and it did not open (No Messages).<br /> <br /> Nodyin: Rogean we'll look into that and make sure those scripts are working properly.<br /> <br /> -Wycca: DoTs and Pet procs are not visible to anyone but the caster/pet owner, any chance this could be made visible to all?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Wycca, maybe. There are concerns about the number of messages that would have to be sent down to the various clients with how often those occur.<br /> <br /> Elucid: on the combine server, all 2 of the raiding guilds can't raid because more people are leaving than they can recruit, and there are hardly more than 100 people in the bazaar at peak times. If there are no plans currently for a merge, when do you think you'll begin to look at the situation?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Elucid, to answer your question from before (sorry, was putting out a fire earlier), we're looking into the situation now...we just don't have a definite answer yet.<br /> <br /> -Wycca: Merloc, can you discuss the new energean (sp) effects or mechanisms a bit?<br /> <br /> Merloc: Energeiac Armor will be available via tradeskills, single group point vendors, and raid point vendors in TBS. There will be Energeiac armor for the visible slots, and there will be Energeiac weapons from the same vendors, and from raid encounters.<br /> <br /> Zigee: will those armors - weapons be superior to the endgame TSS items?<br /> <br /> Merloc: The armor will range from 30s level via tradeskills, and 75+ from the endgame in TBS. The high end raid armor, and high end single group will be superior to the armor in TSS.<br /> <br /> Merloc: The Energeiac armor itself will be fairly vanilla with no focus effects. There will be more than a dozen different types of Energeian power sources that can be equipped in a new inventory slot. The power source will provide power to the armor, and increase or decrease various stats on each individual equipped Energeiac armor, and will add focus effects.<br /> <br /> Wyre: Most of the druids are happy with the change, the interest was more, will the OOC regen system replace the addition of new regen spells, or if they would be brought up to speed with recent changes to the game. But "looking into it" should be fine for now, I'm sure it's not a simple matter =)<br /> <br /> Prathun: Yes.  It's not as simple as changing one spell - there are possibly hundreds of effects that would need to be changed.<br /> <br /> Nolrog: Are there any core system changes coming with TBC like there were with TSS (change in the con system, and the stat caps and invis, which were removed at the end of the TSS beta?)<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Nothing big like that, Nolrog. Most of the new features are specific to the expansion.<br /> <br /> Lewin: Most of the people I know where very pleased with the recent spell swaps/additiond, are there any plans for further swaps/additions? specifficaly guard of the scale and needlecoat?<br /> <br /> Prathun: Thanks Lewin. I'm glad to hear that the changes were well-received. I'm going to be addressing other classes as I have time, and you can thank Rashere, I have a lot of time to look at spells right now.<br /> <br /> Zigee: will there be a way...like armor dyeing, to see how the end products will be effected before the power is added and changes made?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Zigee, you can swap the power sources on the fly. It's not like augments where it requires special circumstances to add or remove.<br /> <br /> -Wycca: I believe that the short duration buff box still has a bug, where ber Warcry, and all of the lvl 68 pure melee discs (Cry Havoc, Fists of Wu, etc), do not transfer to the normal buff box when it is full, can this be looked into?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Wycca, I just bounced a note over to QA to have them check that problem.<br /> <br /> Zigee: but we would be required to have all 9 or however many power sources to see how each one impacts?<br /> <br /> Merloc: You can see the effects of the power sources by equipping them, there will be inexpensive "shards" with a limited charge if people want to test out basic power sources.<br /> <br /> Zigee: cool so a testing shard we can get one each of to see how the more powerful versions effect, good to know about that.<br /> <br /> Lewin: like a 1pp shard that would last untill you zone or something similar?<br /> <br /> Merloc: Yes.<br /> <br /> Merloc: Since the power sources are expendable, they will be relatively inexpensive.<br /> <br /> Wyre: Are there plans to intce the raiding community to explore TBC as groups? I understand the DoN style of play, but will there be rewards available in harder group content that better geared players will want to spend time getting? I ask primarily because of the vast amount of variety in content offered in TBS and no addition of new AA's<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Wyre, the difficulty we run into with making single group content that challengers raiders is in the rewards. We can't really offer raid level gear in single group content, so if we tune for raid level difficulty the loot ends up being mostly useless to the raiders doing it.<br /> <br /> Nodyin: Wyre there is at least one content arc that I'm confident both high end single group players and serious raiders will both want to do very much with some very challenging single group content.<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: In this case, the reward system is point based like DoN and the power sources are mainly obtained from the points, so that may provide a bit of a solution.<br /> <br /> -Wycca: Is there going to be a /claim item in TBS? If so, any spoilers?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Yes, there's a /claim item and no, no spoilers yet. <br /> <br /> Nolrog: Any info on the lore behind TBS?<br /> <br /> Vahlar: Nolrog, the lore in TBS is focused on two major themes really -- the Buried Sea and its islands and inhabitants including pirates, aviaks, goblins, sirens and more and the story that drives that area. Under the water, the Combine Loyalists have secured Tsaph Katta over the ages and are working to cure him still. We will have lore available on the site soon to give you more background. There's not enough time or space here. <br /> <br /> Prathun: The most important thing to know is, there's pirates and Shissar.<br /> <br /> Vahlar: and kedge too!<br /> <br /> Zigee: will TBS be digital only or a boxed version on store selfs, im sure ppl want to know that one.<br /> <br /> Vahlar: TBS will be digital<br /> <br /> Vahlar: More than likely there will be another compilation in the near future though so we can have another box on the shelves.<br /> <br /> Zigee: will the entire guild have to do the progressions like in TSS, or will there be a mechanic were like 1 group can do parts to unlock raid contents to flag entire raid groups of 54 ppl?<br /> <br /> Merloc: I think the progress will be like a toned down version of the progress in DoDH.<br /> <br /> Nodyin: I won't go into too much detail but everyone will need to do the progression to get into the end zone with the normal 85/15 rules in effect.<br /> <br /> Lewin: I don't think most people expect raid quality rewards, however, expecting some/most of them to be upgrades for groupers at all levels of play doesn't seem out of line, hopefully you guys will do like you did with the dodh rewards, not necessarily cursor loot but in terms of quality, and rewards for completing the entire arc/group of arc like the WW skull mask<br /> <br /> Merloc: Lewin, there are going to be rewards for completing quest "arcs" that will appeal to both raiders, and single groupers.<br /> <br /> Merloc: In terms of itemization, I'd like to make the transition from single group player to raider a little easier than it has been in the past.<br /> <br /> Razma: If I may ask a general question... Are the developers happy in general with the time/effort it takes for a new player from level 1 to achieve level 75 and join with raids / etc? The hotzones are nice, but groups are incresingly difficult to find with most players in the 75 range. Are there any plans to change the overall difficulty of leveling for casual gamers? For example other*cough* games have 'rested' experiance for time offline to give them a leg up<br /> <br /> Vahlar: I'm pretty happy. I can't speak for everyone Razma. I think that in EQ there is some reward for getting to 75. In my opinion, the time it takes to reach 75 now is trivialized compared to the time it took several years ago to get to 50. I can't imagine we'd speed that up too much. We also have the shroud mechanic for those people who want to level down and group with friends.<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: I actually plan to take a look at the levelling curve, hopefully in the next few months, to see where we can smooth it out...particularly in the 50-60 range.<br /> <br /> Lewin: Is underwater combat gonna play a big role? and if so can we expect to see a revamp of the mechanics of underwater combat so it isn't so unfun?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Lewin, underwater combat is only a minor part of the expansion and we have made changes to the underwater physics to make it more fun to play underwater.<br /> <br /> Prathun: it's funny how often the underwater combat question comes up.  There is very little underwater content in The Buried Sea, despite what the lore or zones may suggest.<br /> <br /> Vahlar: There is almost no underwater combat in this expansion! <br /> <br /> Merloc: Most of the expansion is "under" water, but not "in" water. <br /> <br /> Prathun: If you shrank yourself and worked really hard, you could find some puddles in Silyssar and Zhisza to submerge yourself in. Then you could pull mobs in there and fight them.<br /> <br /> Vahlar: Rashere is a landlubba...at least until water changes on Norrath.<br /> <br /> Nodyin: If you really *want to* you can fight some sharks under water but there's plenty to fight on dry land<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Yeah, it was fun finding way to have an underwater feel without actually fighting underwater most of the time.<br /> <br /> Zigee: none of the pet casters in our guild bother to use pets on raids anymore. That's a third of our DPS down the drains due to them dieing in all of 30 secs on mobs, any changes being looked at for TBS release?<br /> <br /> Prathun: I made a ton of changes last expansion to help address pet survivability. The new pets have substantially more hit points and AC than their predecessors and I added in a number of spells and abilities to help keep them alive in battle. I'll continue to look into that issue, though. We've indirectly given pets more hit points by increasing the stats on Aenda's Trinkets, as recently as last patch.<br /> <br /> Razma: Would it be possible to add a 'shrouded' option to Looking for group, or some other way to help facilitate grouping with others as shrouds?<br /> <br /> Vahlar: Good idea Razma<br /> <br /> Razma: I'm afraid I'm still shaky on how shroud experiance works heh, but thats something I can look up, not a dev question.<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: It's pretty easy to answer, Razma<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: When in a shroud, you gain (and lose when you die) experience as if you were the level of the shroud<br /> <br /> Razma: I guess, not to sound selfish, but whats the advantage to me (75 cleric) to group with a level 35 as a shroud? If I'm gaining level 35 exp, then a few hours of shrouding = 1/4 AA point?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: If you're trying to power level your friend, there isn't one. That's not their purpose.<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: They're aimed at letting you easily play with friends at their level or check out what its like to play as something else for a while.<br /> <br /> Razma: Okay, so it's not something I'm going to go out and gain AA/progress etc with, just a tool for grouping with friends at lower levels?<br /> <br /> Nodyin: Exactly<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: correct, or if you wanted to experience older content at the difficulty it was meant to be experienced<br /> <br /> Vahlar: Also, as the world expands, someone might want to experience some of the lower level TSS content for the fun of it, for example.<br />   <br /> Stren: I have a class-related question. Is the perception at Live that Berserkers and Rogues have about the same DPS when like-equipped/leveled/AAd? Or that one has more DPS than the other? <br /> <br /> <br /> Prathun: I've recently been going through parses submitted to me by various guilds to get a wide variety of examples of real-world guild DPS and I'm going through them. My perception is that Berserkers do more damage than rogues, but this perception may change.<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Really high end berserkers.<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: They're not quite as deadly at the average range<br /> <br /> Wyre: Will there be more monster missions with rewards similar to the Dain missions in the relative future? I haven't done them myself, but I belive they were widely liked and accepted<br /> <br /> Nodyin: Wyre I'd love to do another arc like that in the future. So far it hasn't really "fit" anywhere but I'm keeping my eye out.<br /> <br /> Nodyin: What was really great about that set of Monster Missions, for me, was how the story came together. I was able to get excited about something and overall that made the missions a lot more fun to make and to play, I think.<br /> <br /> Lewin: You could possible have an arc related to phingel and the kedge, not sure if there is enough lore to support that but could be interesting and would fit with TBS theme<br /> <br /> Waring: what about one for the giant or dragon sides of the dain story?<br /> <br /> Nodyin: The Dain set was great because it worked out so well to be able to do 3 missions that move through the Coldain history. That's a rare opportunity although I could do more of a multi-chapter story with the same characters rather than 3 sets of related characters.<br /> <br /> Stren: Will there be another expansion in 2007 after this coming one?<br /> <br /> Jourdian: We are currently focused on TBS at the moment and there is still plenty to get done before thinking about the next expansion.<br /> <br /> Lewin: Are there any plans to give hybrids more comabt abilities ala jolting kicks and rake and the like?<br /> <br /> Prathun: It's nice to have the option to give hybrids endurance-burning combat abilities. Safe bet that I'll consider it for future expansions.<br /> <br /> Zigee: with new managment coming into the works for EQ, what's the current VISION looking like?<br /> <br /> Nodyin: Zigee I think the "Vision" we all share is to make the best game we can that's fun for you guys to play. It sounds pretty generic but it's true.<br /> <br /> Merloc: I think the current Vision is looking good, there are a few new changes internally that I think are going to be very positive for the game in the future.<br /> <br /> Razma: A friend of mine wanted to know how you can stand how beautiful Trolls are? I mean, they are truly stunning really, and their beauty eclipses the other races hands down.<br /> <br /> Vahlar: To each his/her own, I say.<br /> <br /> Prathun: My ogre wife locks me in the basement if I so much as look at a troll.<br /> <br /> -Wycca: Prathun, any plans to revisit the lvl 68 DoD discs all pure melees received?<br /> <br /> Prathun: I've officially been asked to revisit every spell line in EverQuest, so I have a lot of work ahead of me.  Was there something particular about the DoD abilities that would warrant looking at them?<br /> <br /> Zigee: will they ever finish making and handing out the DoDH auras like they promised on the boxes when we bought that expansion?<br /> <br /> Prathun: All players have access to auras in the form of clicky effects, Zigee. It is highly unlikely that I'm going to create aura spells for classes that don't already have them.<br /> <br /> Lewin: Has there been any progress on implementing an NPC that can tell you what missions in any given series you have completed?<br /> <br /> RashereEQ: Lewin, it' very case by case. To create the NPC, we have to unravel how all the missions are tied together and make the NPC figure out what you have and don't have.<br /> <br /> Nodyin: Lewin in which context? I think Rashere answered this on the boards but our systems don't support creating mission arcs and progression quests automatically so anything like that would have to be manually created on a case-by-case basis.</span>
