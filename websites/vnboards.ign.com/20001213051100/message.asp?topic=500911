				The door opens and the swirling snow howls in in a small drift of cold clean white.  A figure wearing an obviously 3 sizes too big ice bear cloak riddled with crimson circled holes places a pouch of gold and a note upon the bar.  The note is scrawled with 4 words &quot;Spiced Red Wine, NOW&quot;. A small woman inside the cloak makes her way to the warm hearth to thaw, as she warms herself she places a poker into the hot flames until it glows red as her glowing hate filled eyes. <br>  <br> She turns and removes her snowcovered gloves to warm her indigo hands by the hearth as the bartender brings her spiced red wine in a tankard to her.  As she grasps the tankard with one hand her other hand plunges the red hot poker into the drink warming it and releasing the scent of fruit and cinnamon into the tavern air.  As the drink is heated she drapes the white and crimson holed bear cloak over a chair she reveals herself in hand-forged silk lined banded mail. <br>  <br> &quot;By Innoruuk's pantaloons!  Halas is freezing cold this time of year, but I got my shopping done in time for the next round of warfare.  These crystalized marrows, cyclamine corms and ichors shall do well indeed in my role in the next battle.&quot; <br>  <br> She then takes the now cooled poker from her hot mulled wine and threads some mammoth and bear meat on it.  Into the fire the steak laden poker goes to roast the hearty meal as the tiny indigo rogue sits to drink her hot mulled wine. <br>  <br> As she thaws and the warm wine reactivates her senses she looks around the almost empty tavern.  Seeing the familiar face of Homunculus she grins wickedly, nods in greeting to him, then motions him over to join her in her feast of roasted mammoth and bear steaks.

				.. the happenings of the inn from his seat.  His softly glowing violet eyes move from the still-silent intruder to settle on the Tier'Dal newcomer, and he watches as she tears into her roasted meat with vigor.  A loud growl from the round belly underneath his palms reminds him of the lack of meals lately.  Without a word, he unties one of the pouches on his belt and lays it on his stomach, popping the round, smelly contents into his mouth one by one.  As he chews, the crunching and grinding of bone between his teeth can clearly be heard. <br>  <br> The troll looks up to Lothannon's toast just as he finishes his meal, and raises his mead tankard in the drunk's direction, to be polite.  Under his breath, he rumbles, &quot;Is a gud ting Xeri is no here.. all da bad talk of da Marr ladee wud prolly make her mad.&quot;  With a small shrug of his massive shoulders he chugs the last draughts of mead, washing down the remnants of his meal.

				 Wasted stomach a-growling at the delicious odours, and finding the impudent invitation impossible to ignore, the faded Dredger arises and softly limps over to the sullen hearth. There, he lightly seats his emaciated frame and wordlessly, with an upturned palm, offers to take the burden of the makeshift spit. With an eye full of twinkling spirit, he transfers his calm, clear blue gaze first to the freshly wrought armour the Indigo Rogue is clad in, and then back to her carmine assassin's eyes. <br>  <br> &quot;...May I?&quot; <br>  <br>  He leans forward and winces slightly as a leg is raised and one Banded Boot is plopped square in his lap, with a little more force than is absolutely necessary. As the radiation of the hearth gives the polished metal an infernal sheen and lustre, he concentrates on the exquisite craftsmanship, noting the seemingly etched, perhaps stamped, little symbol on the heel; an intertwined &quot;R&quot; and &quot;T&quot;...and also a &quot;G&quot; in elegant, heraldic script. <br>  <br> &quot;Gutrot..?&quot; <br>  <br>  The Angler ruminates as the metal wrapped leg is returned to its earthbound position and then nods slightly. <br>  <br> &quot;A Silk interior, for comfort and insulation. Halasian nights can penetrate the sturdiest of armours in little time, and chaffing can rapidly make even the shortest of trots an endurance test. The product of an inventive Troll's keen mind and nimble fingers?&quot; <br>  <br>  The little human lapses into a distant silence, punctuated only by the snap and pop of the settling embers. He worries with the spit a little and then, seemingly addressing the rear of the hearth: <br>  <br>  &quot;I do feel guilt at the duplicity I have inadvertently engaged in...but it may be necessary for him to labour under this misapprehension of my demise in order to fulfill his military duties without compunction.&quot; <br>  <br>  Homunculus doesn't bother looking for any signs of mercy or empathy where he knows there will be none forthcoming. Instead, he fidgets with the very almost cooked meats on the jerry rigged kebab, a tiny dancing flame dotted at the very rear of his icy orbs, as if encased within. <br>  <br>  Then, as a happier, more mischievous thought displaces his previous melancholia, he smiles his infuriating darkly-bearded half-smile at Rakash. <br>  <br>  &quot;Anyway, how has your Autumn...&quot; (here he falters slightly with his knowledge of Teir'Dal physiology and the havoc the season wreaks with its women) &quot;...been, Coucillor Tzg'nash? Congratulations on the promotion by the way, much as my tidings may be worth. And also..your first Lightdweller slaying, I believe?&quot; <br>  <br>  The deep ice eyes begin to twinkle a little. <br>  <br>  &quot;Much has passed since we last met. Lax word from the Dismal Rage informs me Gutrot also managed to attain a seat on the Ebon Council, within days of being appointed Division Officer for the Minions. The last such position to be filled without a Council vote, too. Surely a little...galling for you?&quot; <br>  <br>  The sewer walker transfers his attention to the sizzling sounds before him, and deftly removes first the poker from the hearth, and then the individual meats, apportioning them equally between the two. His long-neglected stomach gurgles its gratitude as he pops a succulent piece into his mouth and chews with a rapt expression, unaware he was consuming a portion of Halfling fillet sneaked onto the collection. <br>  <br>  He glances up with an appreciative sound, Rakash's expression swiftly altering from gleeful, mischievous malice to a neutral smirk, and notes the ostentatious, yet tasteful display of jewellery she now sports, a slight tingle in the dim light betraying their magical nature. <br>  <br>  &quot;Knowing your penchant for biting beverages, perhaps you would care to sample this concoction of Sir Lothannon's?&quot; <br>  <br>  Here the slight Angler gestured with a fist full of Trollsize tankard, its contents fizzing and sloshing. <br>  <br>  &quot;If you can bring yourself to drink from the same receptacle as a Lesser Race, that is, then you may find it the perfect mordant accompaniment to such a repast. Then allow me to introduce you to the Shaman occupying the &quot; <br>  <br> Homunculus, <br> Asinine Angler

				&quot;Tell me do you intentionally try and gall me, or is it sheer ignorance on your part?  And why the ruse of your death for your charge of Gutrot?&quot; <br>  <br> The delicate indigo rogue sizes up her object of study, the human sewer dredger.  What is is about him that fascinates her so?  How is she to peel away his many layers of ego and psyche?  What is the soul of the human in reverence of?  Questions... nothing but questions uncovered in each layer of a mere human's existance. <br>  <br> She looks deeply into Homunculus' ice cold blue eyes and compares them to the glaciers of the frigid plains of northern Antonica. <br>  <br> &quot;Is the meat cooked done enough for you?  I'm fine with my mulled wine.  Tell me of your adventures of late... you look a bit thin and worn, are you weary?&quot; <br>  <br> Thinking she'd try a new approach to the fly within her spiderweb Rakash attempts to get Homuculus talking with the guise of kindness and interest toward her prey. <br>  <br> She takes a hot poker from the fire and places it into a tankard of mulled wine to warm it.  An almost softened expression of femininity upon her face as the drink roils to a boil releasing it's perfume of fruit and spices into the air.  &quot;Cheers!&quot;
