				We are customers. It's Verants job to please us. However, they can make our gaming experience infinitely less pleasurable, and if we complain through present channels, we run the risk of getting banned, if we're even heard at all.  <br>  <br> Of course, while we're banned, we're still paying for our account.  <br>  <br> Oh, people threaten to quit EQ all the time. But the fact is, hardly no one is going to delete a level 50+ character. Someone quits, the account is either sold, or given to a friend. Either way, the account continues to get paid for, and EQ's subscriber base increases. Verant knows this, and that is the reason for their arrogance.  <br>  <br> They KNOW we're addicted, so, they act accordingly. They talk about *their* vision, instead of customer satisfaction; the want to treat us any way they want, and they don't want to hear complaints, when we don't like it.  <br>  <br> Out of a subscriber base of 300,000+, they pay one guy to answer between 4 to 10 questions a day, and they better not be complaints. Never is a complaint answered. Personally, if i was paid to do the same job, I would answer a minimum 50+ questions per day.  <br>  <br> So, as it stands now, Verant can do whatever they want to us, with absolutely no repercussions...........or can they?  <br>  <br> I, as a paying customer, refuse to pay for this situation. August 1st, I will cancel both my accounts, for at least one month. I am an Everquest addict, i think all i can take away from the game is one month. How will I survive? Well, maybe Shadowbane, Anarchy Online, or Neverwinter nights will be out by then. if not, II guess I'll play Diablo's expansion, or maybe even a little Red Alert or Counterstrike. There are lots of options. Maybe i'll even find something I like better than EQ, in which case, I may even find the courage to delete my character.  <br>  <br> So, that's 20 dollars less for verant next month, big deal. But, suppose someone talks their whole guild of 122 players with 215 accounts, into taking one month off? That's 2000+ dollars less. Suppose a whole server, of 8000+ players, decides to take a month off? That's $80,000. May be Absors' salary. now, they get worried. They lose their swagger.  <br>  <br> What do I want? I want better player representation, and costomer service that doesn't assume I'm a criminal, when i lose all my equipment, due to a bug. While whineplay was a huge mess, Absor getting paid to answer 4 questions a day is also not the answer.  <br>  <br> If Absor can answer 300+ questions per day, fine. If he can't, maybe get 10-20 volunteers to help him. Volunteers won't be hard to find. I'll volunteer.  <br>  <br> I refuse to pay for nerfs to my character, without Verant having to hear about it. This makes my gaming experience less pleasurable. If i buy a Big Mac, and they stop putting secret sauce on it, I can just go to Burger King. That's the customer's option.  <br>  <br> You have your own reasons for dissatisfaction. However, we're all in the same boat. We can do nothing about it. If you're a new player, and think the game is absolutely brilliant, then ignore this post. If you're unhappy, then cancel for only one month, on Aug 1st. When you come back, you will still have all your equipment, same name, same level. If you're an even worse EQ addict than me, and you have 2 or 3 accounts, maybe you can cancel one or 2.  <br>  <br> In any case, to bump this post, please indicate how many accounts you have, and how many you're canceling.  <br>  <br> EXAMPLE: &quot;I have 2 accounts, canceling one&quot;  <br> &quot;I have 3 accounts, canceling all 3.&quot;  <br>  <br> If you want your power as a customer returned, bump this post. If not, there is no hope.

				Well i for one will not be cancelling my account. Verant are the target for a lot of people venting their frustration about stuff that Verant has not done, rather than what it has done. <br>  <br> If I ran a game with 300,000+ people I would certainly expect that there would be people who were not satisfied for one reason or another. Sure, Verant and their GM's have done some puzzling things to myself in the time that I have been playing. But when it comes down to it, it is their game, not mine. They do what they do and I judge the game according to that. Myself, I am very satisfied. You, however seen very unsatisfied. <br>  <br> It's your choice - you can do whatever you want to do in this regard, but for me your letter seems to be hysterical at times and out of step. This is not about exploited workers trying to get benefits off a harsh employer. This is not about a company who exploits third world countries. This is not about anything really important to anybody, really. <br>  <br> If you don't like it - great, quit, do whatever. But maybe also do a bit of a introspective on yourself to see why a computer game of all things gets you so worked up. <br>  <br> Each to their own... <br>  <br> Kempo

				I can see how your idea might work, you explain that part well. It seems like a long powerstruggle now between players with various complaints and eq staff who enjoy their creative liscence. This is also coupled with the closing of the official game boards, previously the route players did raise any issues plus find their answers.  <br>  <br>    What isn't clear is what you are trying to change. What requests are you making of the staff? A more effective avenue of communication could be really complicated to their way of thinking. It may be the reason they closed the boards...too many divided opinions from players on what needed to change. Also, too little gratitude for what has been worked on.  <br>  <br> It sounds like a proposal would be a good thing to work out first. <br>  <br> Syedoth

				We are like fish at the bottom of Verriant/Sony's well. We hate them because they don't give us room, and we feel slow and crowed. We hate them because we have to pay for our shelter, from the harmful outside world, to be with our own kind. We cruse them when they don't answer our calls, and threaten to swim away if they don't give us attention, and our fellow fish don't treat us nicely. Than when they feed us and calls us nice names (Give us patches, expasions, and nice little events and goodies) we jump at them with love and happiness. <br>  <br> I think this is a good metaphore. <br>  <br>           - Droma

				I cancelled 2 accounts over a year ago due to lack of customer service. I started playing Asheron's Call, and from a playability standpoint, its GREAT! I'll admit, the graphics are alot different, but I'll take playability over &quot;pretty&quot; any day. <br>  <br> As to customer service, Turbine does a great job, oddly enough, with Microsoft's support. <br>  <br> (Side note: How is it Microsoft has GREAT games with excellent service, yet their OS's and service for them is less than satisfactory?? *BOGGLE*) <br>  <br> In AC, I can play for 15 minutes and accomplish something. If I die, I don't have to sweat being naked, having possibly lost a level, and have a 45 minute run if I can't get a port. No monster that cons even to me wipes the floor with me. Tough fights? Heck yeah! But FAIR. Plus content is added every 30 days! No add-on to buy, just a download! Yes, they did just offer an add-on, but after almost 3 YEARS! Everything else was FREE CONTENT! Evolving storyline! New monsters! Changing season! New Quests, that offer me exp that is commensurate with my level! Here's a BIG one, support for third party applications! Sony/Verant threw lawyers at anyone that tried that with EQ! NO &quot;zoning&quot; Bah! The list goes on and on. <br>  <br> I'm not saying drop EQ &amp; jump on AC. What I'm saying is this: YOU have the money they need. If you aren't happy, go elsewhere, you will find something that is more to your liking, trust me. AO, DAoC, AC, EQ, SB, etc. There are lots of options, and more coming out every quarter. <br>
