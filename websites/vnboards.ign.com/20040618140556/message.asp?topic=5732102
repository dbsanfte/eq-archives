				this message has been posted elsewhere as well, feel free to spread it to your personal guild boards. <br>  <br> This is a proposition to try to end the bickering, please donnot flame as I do not make accusations.okay, time for my 100pp worth ( I like to give myself an ego boost now in then, good for the soul; that and I get long winded sometimes ) <br>  <br> This is going to be posted on as many message boards as I can find to post it on, and I hope other people will feel free to cross post it on any boards I miss for me to spread the word. <br>  <br> Okay, for some reason, almost every idea propsed to try to make this server a more civil place to play has been shot down by one of any number of factions with any number of reasons. <br>  <br> 1----FIrst complaint I would like to address: surfing message boards.  Given that the calander was originally planned as a message board...it would be ONE message board, and would take you perhaps 10 minutes to look it over.  The only other seemingly feasible idea (which I will detail later in this post) would require much more time and effort. <br>  <br> 2)----THen we have those opposed to the mailing list based calandar.  Are you saying you don't check your email daily? weekly?  I would be one lost puppy without mine, I can guarantee it as it is the most efficient method of communication between my multinational friends (and yes, I now have an IRL friend in Japan, so language will soon no longer be a problem for me). <br>  <br> 3)----We have the people under the impression that it's tough luck if you don't raid Vox the instant she spawns, or whatever dragon/plane there is.  My argument against this is the same as many have presented here.  I work from 6 AM EST to 5 PM EST Monday thru Friday.  I get home aound 5:30 EST, in the shower by 5:45 EST, then eating supper about 6:30 EST.  I check my email and guild board between the shower and supper.  I log onto EQ at 7:00 PM EST.  By the reasoning most Veeshan folks have presented here (sorry, just seems those are the ones presenting this argument) I will NEVER be able to do another dragon, or visit another plane again, as they will be dying at the time I log on.  Guess I may as well not play then, because after time, that will pretty much be the only way I can improve my gear. <br>  <br> 4)----We have guilds not willing to work with each other, and people opposed to it.  I can understand both arguments in the open-guild/guild-only raid department.  Each plan has it's merrits andit's downfalls.  Each plan is up to the guild organizing the raid I believe.  This should NOT be an issue. <br>  <br> 5)----The current assumption that the Japanese will not respect any of these plans anyway, so why not live in total Anarchy is just kinda one-sided in my opinion for one reason: I have not heard this from one single japanese person.  You show me where the Japanese people state they will not cooperate with we Americans (and whatever other nationality we have on this server...god I miss my Swedes and Aussies back on BB) and I will then buy these statements 100%.  Actions may speak louder than words, but I haven't heard anyone try to ask them; perhaps they do it that way because they think we are doing it to them.  Just a thought there folks. <br>  <br> SO, what to do to try to aleviate everyone's complaints and pressures? <br>  <br> We could continue to go as we are now, slamming and bashing, flaming and slandering, and just generally screwing up the whole plan to try to get everyone to get along. <br>  <br> Or, we could manage to unite in one way or another to work out the wrinkles in this new server to make it a lot more pleasant than it currently is.  I know that if all the bickering and bitching doesn't stop soon, I am likely to cancel my account as I don't pay my monthly fee to have stress added to my life, I get enough of that from family and work.  I'm sure others feel the same, and other still think we all are reacting a bit rashly. <br>  <br> With all that said, please allow me to make a proposition or two. <br>  <br> First, and likely the one involving more work on the individual basis, is that in order to not step on each others toes, we put the links to every guild's message boards here, so that others may browse about to see if another guild is planning a raid the same time you are.  Now personally, this should be the leaders responsibility, since being a leader in any other aspect of any other game I've played involves a bit more work to make a successful guild and have healthy relations with other people.  Trust me, been ddown the road many times in other games, and considered it here.  Yes this means countless hours staring at your web rowser of choice while posting, reading extensive threads in various message boards, and watching your password compilation become equal in size to the MP3s you've been downloading. <br>  <br> SOunds liek a lot of work, but it would seemingly keep everyone happy. <br>  <br> There is a simpler way though, and for you people touting you want an in-game way of doing it, and this is it: we form a Guild Council. <br>  <br> Before you start with the groaning and rolling of eyes (or laughing and falling out of chairs) please hear me out. <br>  <br> Every guild on the server assigns one of their officers the title of Ambassador, Senator (although everyone would automaitcly think you a ninja looter and yer banging yer woodelf intern), Councelour, or whatever fancy title you want meaning the same basic thing.  Once a month on a set day and time (perhaps the first of every month at midnight GMT which would be 7 PM EST for the time zone challenged) these Ambassadors would meet in a specified zone that is low in population or step into a designated chatroom to have a meeting.  SOme rules would have to be made for conducting the meetings (have a &quot;chairman&quot; to keep the room in order, queueing of questions, etc) so they are not utter chaos.  At that meeting, the ambassodors discuss the current state of affairs on Saryrn, scheduling of raids to keep each other happy, perhaps diplomaticly resolve inter-guild conflicts, etc. all in a diplomatic fashion.  Things would be voted on.  If we truly felt it necessary, perhaps problem guilds or such could effectively be ignored or shunned by others, not in a harrassing manner mind you, or whatever was deemed appropriate by the Council.  All guilds involved would agree to abide by the decisions of the council and so on.  Yes, it's a little ploitical, but a little politics are involved no matter what you try to do in life (even if it is simulated).  To ease things, perhaps Ambassadors could be voted into various functions for the Council (chairman/speaker, secretary/records keeper, stuff like that).  We could get one of the more Web-inclined to design a site if that would be preferable where we could meet there. <br>  <br> I think this proposal is fair enough that it could be done entirely from within the game, and it would be a good way for all guilds to relate with one another, be they warring or allies or indifferent to one another.  It would require some effort from EVERYONE, not just the people coming from BB or Veeshann.  One thing we all have to agree on is that this server is NOT BB or Veesh, so we must try to come to a way of doing things on our own.  I think this is an excellent idea, as it covers a little of what the biggest complaints are. <br>  <br> As such, I would like it if we could have each guild at least appoint a representative to meet and discuss the possibility of setting this up. <br>  <br> As an officer of Familjen, I would be more than honored to represent our guild as it's Ambassador if they would have me. <br>  <br> Let's all please take a step to try and owrk together, not so much in terms of raids, but as a community because like it or not, we are stuck here with each other.  I know I would much rather get along than to be at each others throats. <br>  <br> Feel free to respond to me in E-mail about this should you desire to do so, but I do ask we give this a shot, and this message is cross posted as much as possible. <br>  <br> thank you <br>  <br> Kiriani Greywynd <br> Familjen--Saryrn <br> nytcrie@lenzlink.net <br>  <br>

				Yes, things were great for the larger guilds who are on early enough to raid whoever and whatever they want at whim. <br>  <br> As for guild unity, would you rather have people bickering and arguing for eternity? <br>  <br> Yes, let's keep it to where the smaller guilds or people who can't be on early never get to slay a dragon or raid a plane.  Kinda pointless to play beyond that point for many.  Forget about any form of making the server a community, let's just keep it a competition where people get screwed as normal. <br>  <br> As somebody else pointed out, what happens when our population rises to the 1800's?  WIll you still be completely happy with things remaining as they are now when you find somebody else beating you to everything you plan to hunt?  What about when some larger guild decides they don't care what your plans are, and as your friends log in to raid the dragon or plane you were planning on taking down you have to inform them all to scrap the plans?  Will you still feel this way? <br>  <br> Try to put yourself in the other person's place for a moment, and look at it from the opposite side. <br>  <br> The proposition I make here is a form of compromise, where all guilds can have their opinion heard and compromises over various issues can be met.  It's not imposing some set of rules one person or one group from a certain server developed.  It's not looking at the world and saying &quot;this is how we did it on our server, so that's how it will be here&quot;.  It's a chance for all guilds to be heard, be they large or small, and some form of compromise be had. <br>  <br> I do have an honest question for many people who have argued on this subject: What is it about change that scares you so much?  and if change is apparently not good for you, why did you move servers? <br>  <br> This post was not meant as a flame, so please do not take it as such.

Become more organized, and do things the way we do them.  I'm not saying either way is right but i'm tired of everyone from BB saying why are we why are we.   WHY ARE YOU <br>

				Everyone who presents this calander idea or who supports it has so far avoided one key issue.  Many, MANY of the &quot;raids&quot; are spur of the moment.  Guilds don't spend weeks planning them, for the most part.  Say one day BR sees that it has 30 players on of 50+ and decides to raid deep in sebilis.  Would that have to be on the calandar?  Or TWC has enough on to break fear, do they have to refrain?  What if a guild has &quot;reserved&quot; hate for late one night, but another guild is ready to do it early afternoon?  Oh and do you need a credit card to reserve zones?  Can you stencil my secondary in for Cazic on june 14th?  I'd hate to get there and have the gators camped.   <br>  <br> I have yet to hear of any incident on this server where one guild moved in and stole a dragon/zone from any other guild.  Everyone seems to be cooperating.  And they're doing it the right way.  Without scheduling kill times for the 5th mob to the right of karnors zone.   <br>  <br> I may be exagerating the extent of the calander, but damned if months ago noone rolled for shit.  We used to give loot to those who deserved/needed it.  Then somebody rolled, then someone else. Now some guy who enters your group at the last minute expects to roll on that swarmcaller you just looted.  (precisely why we don't want nonguild on plane fyi)  I'd hate to have this calandar go from someone's bright idea to make the server his paradise to some horribly congested schedule for zone kills.  Life is very good on saryrn, why mess with it?

				It's funny how people refuse to see longer than a week into the future. Yes, I have never said that things are not good now. They are in fact very good. But what when the server fills up? Because it WILL fill up, sooner or later. What then? Fear will be farmed 24/7. People will race for the pulls in Hate. Heh who knows, maybe Chardok turns into SolB. Bottom line is, we moved from our respective servers for a reason so why don't we try to make the best of it not just for a short time but also in the long run?

				Yes, ROK helps a lot, but does that mean that instead of continually adding new servers Verant can now stuff more people into existing ones? When i /moved from BB to Saryryn, there were 700 tops on the saryrn server. Now, a month? later last night when I logged in there were 1028. Within 6 months we will be up to 2k playes, if not sooner, depending on what other ORPGs are released and how good they are.

				I really think six months from now will start the levelling off, and then letting down of the EverQuest servers.   They'll still grow, for now.  But people who have been playing the game for a year+ are getting bored, no matter what new zones they add.  It really still is the same thing over and over again.  Soon you'll see mass disappearances of people, not even necessarily to other games, just people who no longer have fun playing EverQuest.  It's got a finite life.  It won't go on forever.  <br>  <br> This too will pass. <br>

				Tain I kinda disagree here. Look at UO, it still has a huge use base. Have you ever played RL RPGs? It is basicly the same game but you keep playing it again and again and.. Yes I think all those who play the game to be powerful and get phat lewtz will leave, but frankly I will not miss them. I play the game beacause I love the interaction with other people. I love cooperating and being successful that way. And I think most of the people who think like me will stay for a long time yet.

				Okay, I have an answer to the constant retort of &quot;there was no problem till people vcame up with solutions&quot;. <br>  <br> There is no problem IN YOUR OPINION because you are among those who CAN be on early enough to play Race for the Raids. <br>  <br> The main reason many of us feel *some* form of organization could be used is to help AVOID future conflicts and flaming such as this. <br>  <br> The Council Idea is so that we could, as a server, settle arguments such as these once and for all, with everyone agreeing on the decisions the council comes to. <br>  <br> It would end the useless bickering and flaming. <br>  <br> As for asking myself the same question about change:  I am more than willing to, and often I have.  You show me where the way of chaos is any better than what we propose and I'll change to your way.  SHow me how it benefits me and all the other people who don't have the ability to be on when the servers come up and race everyone to a raid and I'll do it your way.  I have changed the way I did things already on this server.  I am open to change, and truthfully, I am hoping for change from the way things are now.
