				The delicate, slender elf stood perfectly still.  Her pointed ears flickered slightly, her nose twitched as she sampled the air for any hint of danger.  The darkness pressed down on her, heavy and laden with the sounds of battle preparations.  She was near the enemy camp, and she was so young!  She had given birth too soon, and the tiny elfling she held in her arms seemed so fragile, despite the 3 years that had passed since her birth.   <br>  <br> She trembled with fatigue and terror.  The slightest movement would betray her to the arrogant Tier'Dal who stood nearby.  What was a Knight of Shadows doing here in this forest?  The haven of her own kind, he did not belong here, and just the sight of him sent a frission of terror through her.  She continued to sample the air for any hint of how many.  She could clearly distinguish at least 12 different spores.  10 orcs, the Tier'Dal, and his pet.  Not knowing how she knew, she was certain that he could kill her in a heartbeat.  She was trapped here, and had been for most of the night.  <br>  <br> She began to pray, not knowing what else to do.  &quot;Mother of all, save the child, at least.  I would that she grow up free, if you're willing.&quot; <br>  <br> Suddenly, a wood elf appeared, an abrupt presence.  Something was... wrong about him.  She realized suddenly that he was not truly as he appeared.  He was one of the arcane path, the enchanters.  His form shimmered, and he stood towering over the dark elf beside him.  He was Erudite, and as arrogant as the Tier'dal who bowed before him.  He spoke for a moment with the Tier'dal, all the while staring right at the spot she stood hidden.  He walked over to her, and grabbed her by the arm. <br>  <br> &quot;What have we here?  A little spy.  You shall pay dearly for the knowledge you've accumulated this night.&quot;  He shoved her at the Tier'dal. &quot;Watch over her.  don't harm her until I decide what is to be done with her.&quot; <br>  <br> More Tier'dal arrived, milling around the fire, their voices hushed and hurried.  Finally, the enchanter came over to her.  One of the dark ones offered a magic bond with her, and she refused.  He leaned towards her, and spoke in cold tones, &quot;Accept the bond, go with them, or you and your child die here.&quot;  She accepted the hunting bond, recoiling with disgust from the intimate mindspeach.  The Dark ones spoke to each other in their insidious language, vile and ugly as it curled around the edges of her mind. <br>  <br> One of them began an incantation, and the air grew heavy with gathering Power. &quot;Quickly, give me the child.  It is her only chance for life.  There is nothing I can do for you, but I can save the child.&quot;  For a moment, she saw compassion in the depths of his eyes.  Instinctively, she trusted him.  Slipping the cradle from her back, she turned to face her fate.  Just as he caught the tiny bundle, the air shimmered, and the elven ranger was gone. <br>  <br> Delgov stood holding the elfling, confusion warring with annoyance.  Finally, he decided what to do.  He spoke the incantations that changed his form back to that of a wood elf, and turned back towards the city.  He looked down at the bundle he held, and saw the most engaging, sweet little face he had ever seen.  The tiny elfling touched his cheek, so trusting, so innocent.  For a moment, he felt grief.  He had just destined this child's mother to death, when he could have ignored her.  But, he had not, and now, he found himself with a child to care for.   <br>  <br> He called to his friend, and went to meet him.  Together, they made their way to Freeport, where he kept an apartment.  He named her Ches'ria, meaning 'hope reborn' in Old Erudian.  He raised her as best he could, gently guilding her.  Noticing her love of song, he encouraged her to learn all she could of music, and the power it held. <br>  <br> Time passed, and the day he dreaded came upon him.  She asked him the question that he knew would  destroy their makeshift family forever.  &quot;Who are my real mother and father?&quot;  He told her what he knew of her mother, and admitted he knew nothing of her father.  She turned away from him for several years, but forgave him somewhat.  She spoke with him, rarely, but it was enough for him. <br>   <br> It was that day that she swore to destroy the orcs.  As she grew, she vowed to destroy all dark elves and orcs.  She promised powers she did not even have to the service of the Goddess, Tunare.  She swore to uphold the memory of her mother by destroying those who had taken her life. <br>  <br> He watched her begin her career as a bard, and then, time took its toll, and as often happens, his spirit bond grew too weak to call him back to Norrath, and he was gone forever. <br>  <br>  <br> ******************************************************* <br>  <br> She stood with her face raised to the wind, a slight smile flickering around her lips.  Her hands rested on the hilts of the two weapons strapped to her side, and cloak fluttered around her.  Her voice lilted softly across the frigid plain, light, cheerful, sparkling.  The music sparkled with light, dancing around her and her companion. <br>  <br> She looked down at the ranger beside her, and the smile that had been lurking bloomed.  It suffused her face with light, and her eyes sparkled with suppressed mirth.  Responding lightheartedly to something the elven man had said, she pulled him to his feet, whirling around him in a spontaneous dance.  He laughed and joined her for a moment, before a scent caught his attention. <br>  <br> Noticing his shift in attention, Chesria slid the weapons from their scabbards.  She nodded once, indicating she was ready. <br>  <br> &quot;Come,&quot; Miongel muttered. <br>  <br> Chesria followed him, her voice altered to a rousing beat that hastened their steps, speeding them towards their prey.  Miongel stopped so suddenly that she nearly ran into him, and she heard and felt the telltale booming of massive footsteps.  The gigantic mammoth topped the rise, and she waited, vibrating with tension. <br>  <br> Miongel muttered an incantation, and the great beast slowed, turning towards him.  Side by side, Chesria and Miongel rushed into battle.  Chesria's voice changed again.  This time, she concentrated her Power into the music to create fear in the mammoth, and it turned to flee, hampered by the magic restraints Miongel had placed on it.   <br>  <br> Chesria watched Miongel fight, his blades whirred through the air, a violent, beautiful dance.  They darted, flashing, glittering, too fast for the eye to follow.  He moved with acrobatic grace, not in the least hampered by the heavy chainmail that he wore. <br>  <br> She realized her distraction too late, as the mammoth turned and gored her, gouging a huge dent across her breatplate, bruising her and knocking the wind out of her.  She stood gasping for a moment, eyes tearing from the pain.  She vaguely heard Miongel intone an incantation, and once again, the mammoth swung away, lumbering the other direction.  At last, it breathed its last, its massive body slamming against the ground.  Miongel examined the corpse, and raised aloft a tusk, roaring in victory at taking one of the precious trophies.  They rejoiced in their good fortune, and then examined the corpse again, for the more practical reasons.  Unfortunately, this mammoth was diseased, and therefore, they could not salvage any meat from it. <br>  <br> Chesria and Miongel hunted, and as they rested, they spoke for hours.  Sometimes of nothing at all, sometimes of matters deep and meaningful.  One day, as they sat recovering, a barbarian came towards them.  Neither of them thought anything of it, as this was the homeland of the barbarians.  But when he drew near, he snarled and attacked without provocation or warning.  The battle was long, and when it was finished, they stood broken and bleeding, but alive. <br>  <br> Chesria began to bandage herself, her voice, as always, lifted in song.  She sang the song that wound around them with gentle healing.  Her voice lilting, tender, seductive.  As Miongel began to help her bandage, she found herself once again distracted.  How could hands that weilded weapons with such deadly accuracy be so gentle?  She laughed at herself then.  He wasn't even aware of her beyond her songs and the blades she wore. <br>  <br> &quot;I must go.  A friend needs my help,&quot; Miongel said into the silence that followed.  <br>  <br> Chesria nodded and watched him go. She hunted for a while alone, and then, hoping it was not too soon, she send him a thought.  Just to say hello, and that she missed him.  At last, afraid of losing him, she spoke her heart to him.  Once again, they hunted together, but this time, with the beginning of a heart connection.  They sought each other first to hunt with, traveled together, laughed together.   <br>  <br> Time passed, and the friendship came to an abrupt end.  Before the partnership had formed, it was gone.  Where laughter was, silence.  Where closeness, distance. <br>  <br>  <br> ********************************************************* <br>  <br>  <br> Chesria stood again in the icy Northland.  She watched the ghosts of the past fade.  She heard the echo of songs in the tinkling of the icy branches of the trees.  She knelt in the snow, and let her grief pour out to her Goddess, knowing there would be no response.  She grieved there in the snow, grieved for the mother she'd lost, for the father she'd never known, the lover who had never quite become a lover, for the friends that the years had taken away from her. <br>  <br> As she knelt there, a feeling of complete peace surrounded her.  She looked up into the face of her Beloved Goddess, Tunare.  Suffused with light, her tears dried.   <br>  <br> The voice spoke to her, and in her and through and around her, &quot;You wish to be free of the grief?  Freedom comes at a price.&quot; <br>  <br> Humbled, Chesria could only nod.  Finally, struggling to form the words, she asked, &quot;And what is the price?&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;You will love none but me, until you pay the price to love again.&quot; <br>  <br> &quot;And what is the price to love agian?&quot; Chesria asked in a whisper. <br>  <br> &quot;You must forget,&quot; and the presence of the Goddess faded away. <br>  <br> Chesria stood then, and raised her blades to the sky.  The setting sun colored them red.  Once again, Chesria took a vow. &quot;I will not forget.&quot; <br>  <br> She turned, her cloak swirling around her, and walked back towards the mainland.  Behind her, the sun bathed the snow in blood.  The wind died, and the Northland was once more silent and forsaken. <br>  <br>
