				Endless streets, alleyways, houses, factories, businesses...all going on for as long as she could see.  This was Neriak, home of the Chosen Race, and only those pure of blood and the corruption of other inferior godlings.  This was without a doubt Innoruuk's domain.  Once again, the people were to be shown this. <br>  <br> Gallows were set up in the Commons, ready to please an already gathering audience.  They were promised a grand show, one to bring justice to those responsible for the recent acts of turmoil.  The government was in desperate need of a scapegoat, and they found one, just in time to stave off anarchy.  In these times, no single nation was left untouched by the chaos. <br>  <br> Today's event was a double execution, one that would prove memorable.  Father and daughter, both charged and found guilty of the Taint of Blood.  In truth, there was no trial, only an execution. <br>  <br> Three men were on the 'stage', the executioner, a Priestess, and a guard.  The executioner sharpened his axe many times, growing impatient with the wait.  He wanted to get this over with.  He surveyed the crowd, which was growing as impatient as he was.  Every so often, he heard shouts demading when the show was starting. <br>  <br> An iron-clad Teir'Dal walked up on stage.  He removed his horned helmet as and looked out to the crowd.  He held up a hand, asking for silence.  &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the wait.  The main attractions have had a difficult time in getting prepared, but we are ready now.&quot; <br>  <br> The crowd began to part to either side of the road as eight steel-plated guardsmen escorted the main attraction towards the stage.  A young girl, about sixteen, and her father, an man in his late thirties walked upon stage, clad in torn clothes and chains.  It was apparent they had been beaten on several occasions.  Each wore bruises all over their arms and faces, and the girl suffered from a massive cut across her left cheek. <br>  <br> The announcer motioned for their chains to be released.  The guardsmen drew their swords and unbound them, making sure they would not try to escape.  Then, the announcer held out a piece of parchment and proclaimed, &quot;These two have been tried and sentenced.  Their crime: Taint of Blood.  As is known, Innoruuk detests such abominations as this!&quot;  He pointed to the girl.  She raged at him, held back by the spears and swords of the guards. <br>  <br> &quot;Now, Innoruuk's will be done.  Without further delay, enjoy the death of these monsters!&quot;  he roared to the crowd and they cheered.  The executioner grabbed the father first, shoving him none too lightly towards the awaiting chair and noose.  His only job was to make sure nothing went wrong.  He detested the job, he would have rather be using his axe for the more messy job of decapitating them instead.  He pointed the man to the chair, motioning for him to get on.  He secretly hoped he would refuse, but he didn't.  He even put the noose around his own neck, making his job that much easier. <br>  <br> The priestess came forward, gave him his last rites, and asked if he would repent.  This was his last chance to save himself and condemn his only child.  He refused.  At the jeering of the crowd, the priestess backed away, and the executioner kicked out the chair from underneath his feet. <br>  <br> The crowd cheered.  He struggled against the rope, at one point still breathing.  That was the executioner's cue to stop him from living too long.  They had another one to go through, of course.  He rose the axe and came down in his side, spilling blood.  his struggle after that was minimal, and he stopped moving after less than a minute. <br>  <br> The girl never ceased crying.  She kept shouting out, but the crowd's cheers drowned out any sound she made.  The chair was set up next for her, under a rope next to her father.  She struggled as the executioner grabbed her and threw her next to the chair.  he moved towards her, grabbed her by the hair to yank her to her feet and muttered to her, &quot;If you want this to go quickly, get on the chair and put on the rope.&quot; <br>  <br> He let her go and she collapsed to her knees in front of the chair.  Slowly, she picked herself up and stood shakily on the chair.  She put the noose around her neck.  The executioner made sure it was tight, and backed off to let the priestess give her the last rites. <br>  <br> The priestess approached from the side, a tome in her hand which was closed.  She spoke hesitantly, with a strange accent. <br>  <br> &quot;The Father's Will be done.  You have been charged with a crime that is only punishable by death.  But fear not, if you confess your sins, you shall be forgiven as you enter the next life...&quot;  then the Priestess spoke in the common tongue to her, &quot;but it won't have to come to that.&quot; <br>  <br> The girl looked at the Priestess apprehensively.  Then, the Priestess looked at the Executioner.  &quot;She is ready.&quot; <br>  <br> He nodded and moved towards the chair.  Mid stride, the Priestess swept his legs out from under him in one kick.  She opened her book and withdrew a small blade from within, throwing it perfectly to release the rope that bound the girl. <br>  <br> The crowd began shouting, confusion reigning.  The guards, seeing everything charged the Priestess.  Their weapons pierced the cloak of the Priestess without any trouble.  All they found was her clothes, torn to ribbons, and the book.  From above, the true form of the Priestess descended upon the hapless guardsmen.  Kristinae's blades tore through the steel-clad men in seconds.  Screams and shouts from the crowd indicated they were fleeing. <br>  <br> She was in her true form for this.  She hated doing so, but it was the only way to cause enough commotion to buy her enough time to escape with Vanessa's daughter.  She turned towards the girl, who was suddenly more afraid of the sight before her than she was anything else, cringed away. <br>  <br> &quot;I told you, if you want to get out of this alive, you will have to do as I tell you,&quot; Kristinae reminded her.  &quot;Do you want to live?&quot; <br>  <br> She gulped and nodded, frightened to do anything.  Kristinae held out a hand to her.  Hesitantly, timidly, she took it.  Before she could even think, she threw herself into Kristinae's arms, crying.  She was taken aback at this, and tried to think of what to do.  She took the girl by the shoulder and broke the embrace to look at her. <br>  <br> &quot;I was told to come get you,&quot; Kristinae said plainly. <br>  <br> Vanessa wasn't kidding when she said she has those eyes, Kristinae mused. <br>  <br> &quot;W-who...&quot; she could barely whisper. <br>  <br> More sounds came, most likely the elite guards rushing to the scene.  Kristinae concentrated for a moment and assumed the guise of a Teir'Dal.  &quot;No time, we must escape.&quot; <br>  <br> Their escape was easier than expected.  The anarchy caused in the Commons quickly spread to other places, causing panic everwhere.  No one knew what to make of the 'visitor', but the loudest rumor was that some demon was coming to destroy them all.  Kristinae had never been called a demon before, and was almost flattered she made that kind of impression.  No less than an hour later, they scaled the final wall that broke out to the outside.  They landed safely on the other side and prepared for their final escape. <br>  <br> Kristinae's mind reeled at that second, causing her to collapse to the ground.  The girl helped pick her up.  &quot;What happened?&quot;  she questioned. <br>  <br> Kristinae swore.  &quot;We're not out yet,&quot; she told her.  Something was in the area, something of great power that wanted her dead. <br>
