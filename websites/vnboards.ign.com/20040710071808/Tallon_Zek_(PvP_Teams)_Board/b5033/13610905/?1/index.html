				I am here to dispell all the rumors about Test Server. Its high time people are told the TRUTH and not the lies that are constantly spread througout the system.  <br>  <br> Lie #1: Constant Server Wipes  <br>  <br> False. There has only been ONE server wipe in the 28 month history of Test Server since Everquest has gone live. This wipe occured after dragon loots where dropping off common dogs as common loot in Sol B and the server went into a frenzy and farmed them like mad. But the real reason the server was wiped was due to the fact of Bad policy and GM abuse. After Kunark Beta, MANY players had full Kunark armor/weapons on personal Play accounts given by rogue GM's/Staff. Also, when the server had a reset or a long crash, the rollback of a few hours resulted in EVERY character you ever had on Test showing up in your account as duped. Resulting is huge amounts of extra items, (ie Rubi BP's, COF's, Kunark Armors etc etc). This has all since been corrected with the Player Item Wipe on June 20th , 2000. Before and since that time, there have been NO wipes. Verant also stated that there will be NO wipes, though they reserve the right that they will not exercise.  <br>  <br> Lie #2 Daily Crashes  <br>  <br> False. These 'crashes' occur during regular business from 9 am PST to 6 pm PST for the most part, to bring the server down for code updates. This might effect a few European/Asian customers, but the benefit is far greater to them (see benefit #3) For the past year, Verant has given server warnings of impending downtimes 98% of the time. In general these downs are no more then 15 min in length. During Peak Times , 6PM PST - 2AM PST, the server almost NEVER goes down, with the acception of MAYBE the night before a major Patch to live servers (again see benefit #3 for why this is a GOOD thing) The benefit, ALL mobs and UBers REPOP, explained later.  <br>  <br> Lie #3 Verant Does not want a large population  <br>  <br> False. Verant would be tickled pink if Test server had 1000-1200 regular players. As it stands now, offpeak is 100-200 and Peak is 400-600 at best. Not nearly enough to test new code accurately. Hence the addition of the testeverquest.exe icon tot he Desktop with the release of Ruins of Kunark. They WANT you here, thats why the made it easier to get here with the Icon  <br>  <br> Lie #4 You cant get anything done on Test so why bother.  <br>  <br> False. Just log on and see all the level 60 players. See how all are in FULL kunark and most are now partially in Kael. (majority of 55+ are Pro-Dragon on Test at the moment). Every Dragon has been killed on test pretty much but TOV and Sleepers. Sleepers Tomb has been breeched and people are hunting there now too. TOV is farmed regular. ALL gear on Test is now obtained Legit, NO MORE GM gifting, or the GM is fired !!!  <br>  <br> Lie #5 We dont want you here.  <br>  <br> False. Sure, the 55+ DO NOT WANT you there. Why, because of simple GREED. They have realized that Test is a Candy Store. They can Farm Farm Farm and not have to worry about competition. Of coure they dont want anyone but them there, it cuts into the Twink farming.  <br>  <br> Benefits of Playing on Test Server  <br> ----------------------------------  <br>  <br> Benefit #1 Low Population  <br>  <br> General Population today is 100-200 offpeak and 400-600 Peak. Most zones have 2-5 persons in it at any time, popular Zones have 20-30 at the MOST. Lower Guk stand EMPTY most days !! If you play on Test, you will enjoy unlimted choice of Zones and camps !!! Even if my post generates people to play on Test, it still wont be a crowded server like Live servers. At Best, I might convince 200 more ppl to play here, still leaving Peak poplation below 1000!!  <br>  <br> Benefit #2  <br>  <br> Verant constantly is changing and updating Code. But when they make a mistake on items, they generally just make a new one, leaving the mistakes in the game on test only. Hence, Test Player have been able to obtain items, armor, spells that Live Servers will NEVER see.  <br>  <br> Benefit #3  <br>  <br> UBers - Ubers - Ubers  <br>  <br> Would you like to play on a Server where Venril Sathir pops EVERY day, sometimes 5-10 times a day? How about Trakanon, or Vox/Naggy? Sleepers Tomb? WW dragons?  <br>  <br> A few weeks ago a code change made it so ALL mobs poped on Server up. SO Klandicar, Lodizal, Zlandicar, Severilous, Talendor, Faydedar, Gorenaire, VeeshanPeak ... they all Poped DAILY. Sometimes 5-10 times a day !! Christmas Time on Test !!! Whoohooo.  <br> Eventually this code was replaced but for 2 weeks it was Bliss. Good thing is, this happens ALOT, so be prepared for the next round of Dragon Lotto !!  <br>  <br> Benefit #4  <br>  <br> NO WIPES !!! Period!!  <br>  <br> Verant has stated time and time again to many test regulars that Verant has no intention to EVER wipe Test Again !!  <br>  <br> The previous wipe created MANY problems in testing due to the lack of players and equipment. THERE WILL BE NO WIPES !!!  <br>  <br> Why do you think the regular players have all come back to Test? If they were in threat of wipe, do you think they would play for 300+ hours to get that phat L33T just to lose it??  <br>  <br> Wipe Rumors are perpetuated by the Test Players as a means to keep the population LOW. Its purely GREED driven !!!  <br>  <br> Summary  <br> ---------------------  <br>  <br> Test is a Server in the system that has low population and easy gameplay to obtain Loot. There will be NO WIPES, Verant WANTS people to play here. Higher level Players will attempt to disuade you from playing on the server by filling you with lies about wipes, 5 day downtimes or general nonsense to protect their 'Farming rights' on the server.  <br>  <br> Test Server can be accessed either from the Seperate Icon on your desktop (FURTHER EVIDENCE Verant WANTS you here by placing the icon on the desktop with Kunark's release) or by going into your EQ Directory and running -- testeverquest.exe  <br> Pathes are small and not too troublesome. For ease, and if you have HardDrive Space, eename your old MAIN eq directory to something else temporary, re-tinstall EQ. This cretaes a SECOND copy of EQ on the computer. Once done, rename the NEW copy TestEverquest (or anything else you chose) and change the OLD copy BACK to Everquest. NOW you can keep Live servers updated and no patcing back and forth, just run testeverquest.exe from the NEW copy for playing on Test only. Simple.  <br>  <br>  <br> So COME play on Test, its UTOPIA !! Its high time the population grows and Verant gets the people it wants for a population on Test. No more 120 people in East Commonlands or Greater Fay. Last night EC had 12 and GFay had 3 people.  <br>  <br> Enjoy the Game the way it was MEANT to be played. Good luck and I look forward to all the new faces on Test Server.  <br>  <br> ps .. No doubt Test players will get wind of this post and try to tell you otherwise. DONT let them lie here, they are just trying to scare you away like a animal scares a predator from its den of goodies. ALL talk, no Reality !!! After playing on Test for 28 months, im sick of the BS, GREED and LIES.  <br>  <br> Tell ALL your friends about what I have told you here, lets stop the Lies and have fun.

Is it a team, diety, or free for all PvP server? <br>  <br> With the low population, do you find it difficult to find people to kill? <br>  <br> Nevermind.
