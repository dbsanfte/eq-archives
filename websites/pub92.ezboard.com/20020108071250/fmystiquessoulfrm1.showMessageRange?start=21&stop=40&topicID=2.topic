<br>
I try and offer and help out as much as possible in the guilds I am in.  But what is the point if this kind of thing keeps happening.<br>
<br>
I wasn't able to get on last night due to my comp jsut breaking down and stoping working with eq.  Now i find this.<br>
<br>
I know there have been problems but for the guild to disband like this is rediculas.  I feel let down and betrayed.  <br>
<br>
I will not be rejoining any guild for bit.  Hell at the moment I feel like logging on and deleting all my chars.  If I do start playing again it will be to join one of the solid guilds on the server that have been and will be around for a while.  I have seen to many guild just disapear.<br>
<br>
So many hopes and plans just destoryed.<br>

But I do read the boards daily, even if i am not in EQ.<br>
<br>
I am dissappointed that MA has gone away.  I found out last night, via Zantoz.  I had only been in MA a short time, but I had so much fun playing with everyone (well, i guess obviously not everyone, as I am much to small to have played with many of you).  At any rate, i was really liking it in MA even if my only contact with many of you was through /gu or these boards.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you all know that although I was new,and small, and on the fringe of MA, I had some good pals there, some I knew before I joined MA, some were the reason I joined MA, and I like to think I was making some new ones in MA . . .  <br>
<br>
I am definately interested in tryng to keep some of the guild together, even if under another name.  I know many of us have some irons in the fire about just how to do that.  I'll keep in touch and check the new board regulalry. <p><P><IMG SRC="http://wsphotofews.excite.com/031/IK/VX/oS/t042139.jpg" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=239 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC, fantasy"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Heleth

I just wanted to express my sympathy for what happened to you.  <br>
<br>
We've had high level folks leave our guild, and I saw how it bothered and upset some members who thought they were not being loyal, etc.  I understand why it can be upsetting and frustrating to a guild leader who is trying his best to help his guild get stronger.<br>
<br>
Personally I came to the conclusion that if someone has decided they'd rather be in another guild, for whatever reason, then basically I agree with them.  I don't let it bother me even though in most cases I wish they would stay.  I understand why some folks leave at the high levels, and what a challenge it can be to build a strong, high level guild.<br>
<br>
I just do my best to make the guild a fun place to be for higher and lower level players alike, and personally I think the friendship is more important than what mobs you can kill or raids you can do.  Sure I'd like to get there, but IMO it's not worth leaving your friends behind.  Some disagree, and to them I say more power to you, I hope you find what you seek.  And I'd rather part with them as friends, so I do my best to leave things that way.<br>
<br>
It sure seems like the situation, whatever the details were leading up to it, could have been handled in a way that allowed the membership to decide their own fate.  I know I would never do something so unilateral--our guild belongs to everyone in it, sure the leader and the officers make certain decisions, but everyone is allowed input and most important decisions are put to a vote.  If I ever found myself in a situation where I no longer wished to lead or be part of the guild, I would simply inform the guild and let them choose a new leader.<br>
<br>
I hope you can successfully reform under &quot;new management&quot; and pick up near where you left off.  I know our members, myself included, have friends who held the MA tag, and I wish them and all of you the best of luck.  If there is anything I or other members of Order of Reverent Mirth can do to assist you, please look for us in game, or if you prefer you can e-mail me at Aalek@usa.net.<br>

It was purely Keril's long suffering and work that kep this going. I was an officer and saw how people treated each other. <br>
The same people who would bitch about people moving on, would hit mid 50s and leave. This guild was not set out to be a primer guild for the high level guilds. If that is what people want to start, then fine. it is not what we wanted MA to be. it is also what MA had become. <br>
Before you run to blaming Keril, ask yourselves why you play EQ. Why you are in a guild, then take on leading a guild for a week and see if you still enjoy the game. <br>
Many of you I stil consider a friend, but I will not tolerate bad mouthing of a friend as good as keril. Make no mistake; he was my friend long before I met any of you, and will be my friend for a long time to come. I am not fickle in my friendships. I ask you not to be either. <p>~Avezes Oscuridad

<br>
I think people just feel little angry the way he did it, I don't claim to know Keril well, but I must agree that he could have done it using a pillow not sledgehammer. <br>
<br>
Most likely he was VERY angry at the point he did this so I understand why he did it..but people have valid reasons to be upset, some of them had NOTHING to do with this.<br>

I also am very concerned about Keril. He struck me as a kind, rational, and very realistic type of person. For someone like that to do what he has done seems very out of character. I understand that many people are angry with him right now, and that is totally natural. Don't get me wrong, disbanding a guild like this is unspeakable,but something very  wrong and upsetting must have happened for keril to do this to something he loved so very much....<br>

<br>
All due respect Sashah, I did not join PoS. I was in it for a few days due to a HUGE raid and the only one up there unable to get information.  Keril knew that and ok'd it.  Then I was back in the guild.   Please do not spread a rumor like that without checking the facts.  I am without guild and spent quite a bit of time last night talking to Keril and the other officers, trying to help with a solution.<br>
<br>
Also I would like you all to remember that Keril did do very much for us. Please give him a chance to heal as we need to heal too. <br>
<br>
Thank you. <p>Lysyndia Fifthelement<BR>

That's what I did when Tranquilitee self-destructed, I took my small team which was very unified in our friendship, trust for one another, and long-term goals, and formed the core of a new guild. It was only through an immense amount of logistical and social work that this new guild did not collapse in its early stages. There were several points in which it would have if not for the dedication of the players and the strength of the ideals it was founded on.<br>
<br>
You guys have far more raw material (players with levels and desire and knowledge of planes and higher areas) than I did when I started FC. Now you need to figure out if there's an idea that holds you all together, and find a leader who is willing to pay the price to stand up for those ideals and make them work. From firsthand experience I can tell you it is much more satisfying to watch your own team progress, learning planes at first then moving up the difficulty ladder step by step, overcoming obstacles, learning new areas, etc. than to join a guild that can already do those things. I do feel that many if not all of the members of BoW/ToD who joined after the development phase have cheated themselves out of an important and fulfilling experience in this respect. Doing this part of the endgame was far more satisfying than the easy path of 'join an uber'.<br>
<br>
Remember though, building a strong guild is anything but easy, and it requires a lot of trust, faith, and perseverence from people dedicated to making it happen. Differences must be put aside and not be allowed to build internal obstacles and barriers. Sometimes people you hate to lose must be let go for the long term betterment of your team. Each player will need to make personal sacrifices to make it work. It is not neccessarily forever; I have effectively handed off the running of FC to a strong set of officers and they are handling the task extremely well; however, it did take 6 solid months of damning torpedoes and solving problems to be able to do that. (My method of picking officers - choose people who don't want to be leaders but are good at it anyway, and avoid people who are looking for officership or any other position of responsibility as a way to enhance their status.)<br>
<br>
If you can't all agree on one idea, then perhaps two or more guilds are in order. I've heard the '50% want to be uber and 50% want a family guild' line - personally I believe it is possible to do both at once, if you have strong loyalty to your guildmates and your guild is dedicated to this level of advancement - I learned that both could coexist when I was in Heroic Legacy (before most of your time I'm sure <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and believe I have revived that spirit in FC. You can do it for yourselves as well if you want. However, if there are incompatible factions/ideas within the guild then you are best off establishing separate guilds to pursue separate goals.<br>
<br>
As far as Keril goes, he worked his ass off for you guys, and despite how upset you may be at the disbanding of MA, it was his prerogative to do so and it is wholly ungrateful to disrespect those efforts. If you really feel that Keril is a bad guy because of this I suggest you try to do it yourself and get a taste of what it is like.<br>
<br>
Last thing, about people who decide to join another guild/stay unguilded - don't burn your bridges with these people. Who knows, maybe one day they will feel differently and want to rejoin you. They may be key people in your relationship with another guild. They may be there to help you anyway even if they don't wear your guild tag. Real friends see beyond guild tags - guilds have many objectives, but to place friendship as the objective of a guild imo demonstrates a misunderstanding of what guilds are and why they exist.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents to a bunch of people I wish the best for,<br>

We all are still friends.  Remember that.<br>

Just to be able to network with people and not feel so alone. I have and will keep contact of 20 of my friends who have expressed interest in reforming, however, none of us were officers in MA and would not want to lead (can you blame us heh). <br>
<br>
If a guild reforms out of the ashes of MA know that you will have much support from many MA members and even non-MA. And if a new guild is not to be, then I urge many of my friends and family to look into New Dawn Rising. They have a leadership council that is led by not one not two but three individuals who are on often and they really care about their members. They have many 50+ and we are even going to raid Hate today at 5:30pst. <br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in checking out other options send me a tell or for any questions about the guild send a tell to Prurience. But if a new guild is going to come from MA then I wish to be included and know many others that will want to too. Ok lets keep in touch all.<br>
