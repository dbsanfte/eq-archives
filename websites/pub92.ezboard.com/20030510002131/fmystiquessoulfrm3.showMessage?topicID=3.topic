Something was acting up with her computer as you can see, and it added all that extra space to the top of her chart.  She put *ALOT* of time and work into that thing, and it is just awesome.  Trying to print it out however, was a bit of a chore.  I pretty much just condensed a quick reference list that fits into about a page and a half.  It will only have the name and the status of the person.  If you want the more comprehensive list, I would definitely refer to Sashah's previous post, as it has the levels/classes etc.  It will look strange pasted below due to the format, but it's ok, just copy it and stick it into Word or Excel then print it and it'll come out in the proper rows/columns.  Here it is below.  MAD kudos to Sashah for all her work *even if she neglects her poor lovesick boyfriend in the process *SNIFF*  =)<br>

  That other post just didn't seem to want to fully load so responding in this one.  <br>
<br>
  Was not on much after the delete sorting stuff out.  My plan is to join Price of Sacrifice where Razon/Effis and Zammis/Sihaya/Shawke went since we've been together for over a year now.  Doesn't mean I don't miss you all though!<br>
<br>
  Always happy to help out with any one of the three characters needed as long as I am not already committed to something.<br>
<br>
  Shnookums, as Ntol said, had rejoined old friends from the first guild we had been in.  He was away for a long time due to his daughter being hurt badly in an automobile accident and has only been on rarely lately.<br>
<br>
  Ozadian/Zanzabar is still MIA and I for one am starting to really worry about him.  He lives in New York and as far as I heard, near the former towers.  Sintin had said he talked to him after the disaster, but no one I know has seen him since.  My hope is that he is, a) Volunteering all his time to relief efforts or b) Just has no connection right now.  Anyway, hoping everyday to hear from him....<br>

Chaos causes things to pass through without notice and things to be forgotten.<br>
<br>
If you are hurt that your toons were forgotten, then I am sorry.  But realize, we had no list to work against.  Nothing in writing.  And the people that did the majority of the work in recreating the list were, for the most part, new to the list.  <br>
<br>
Many left for other guilds, in particular, the very people who have the most chance of knowing most of the people in the guild.   We recieved little to no help from these people.<br>
<br>
You once called me the most laid back person you know. May I pass on to you some of that peace.<br>

Long time... =)<br>
<br>
Tons of negetive energy surrounding Brine around the time I logged in one day and found no guild. =(<br>
<br>
I can now be found as Omna the Barbarian Shaman.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone is doing well.  It has been a pleasure to run into old guildies from time to time, though I have a new face.<br>
(Thanks Docq, that was my monk you rezzed in solA =)<br>
<br>
P.S.  If you know anyone that is doing a Hole raid, I have an Icon burning a hole in my pocket.<br>
P.S.S I'm also open for Fear raids =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E6CC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/uriket.showPublicProfile?language=EN>riket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Honored Guest</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#000000>(11/16/01 1:01:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/fmystiquessoulfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://riket.homestead.com/files/gosh.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Condensed List</span><hr size=1>   Been actually having to do work at work instead of lurking around boards so a little late but Ozadian/Zanzabar returned this past Saturday from his &quot;since 9/11&quot; absence.
