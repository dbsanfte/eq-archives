<br>
But you are so full of bullshit it isn't even funny.<br>
<br>
Guild recruitment was nothing like that. You have no idea what it took to keep some people in the guild. They want their cousin, sister, brother, best friend in guild... well we need this person so we bring these other people in. Some are good, some are not. Fine let the person leave you say, well then we are short the class we need to do the next thing we all want to do (whatever it is that week). The guild was full of casual gamers with erratic playing times, this was great, but you need people to do the bigger events so we tried to combat it by having a larger player base. We did not do enough events nor did we have a good enough a reputation for successfully doing things that we could make people jump through hoops and wait and wait to join us. Making people wait just encourages them to look elsewhere, which many did because I was pretty slow to follow up on recruitment. If you thought recruitment went with as much thought as you indicated then you are just plain ignorant of the facts.  Your blaming of Lysyndia is bull as well, I think there was maybe 10-14 days where the full weight of guild admin was on her and maybe she invited a few too many people... but what you can't seem to get through your thick skull from day one is that a lot of those people were alts, family and friends of guildmembers. The guild was largely social, thats what attracted a LOT of the members and thats why we tended to invite family and RL friends of guildmembers. That was MA. Sure a few bad apples got in, but few were worse than being a minor pain internally and they generally got weeded out over time.  Recruitment has always come in surges... we lose a bunch of people.... we recruited a bunch... weed out a few... wait..... lose a bunch of people... repeat... over and over. I got a bit tired of the revolving door and was not interested in doing another batch.<br>
<br>
Clearly you exaggerated about growing by 50 people over a weekend. Regardless it sounds to me that you just wanted to remove everyone who wasn't in your social clique, we had several cliques within the guild who hung out and tended to do stuff together. Sounds to me like you wanted to remake MA into something it never was, sounds an awful lot like what Candili wanted done. Well we just did not have the right mix of players with the right play schedules to make that happen. So I tried my damndest to make a social, casual, diverse guild that was capable of doing some of the higher end stuff without the associated power gaming pressure of the smaller power guilds who could do far more with far less. Another problem I noticed was that in the last month or two there was a rash of new players entering the higher level of the game... a lot of new people that were unknown and scary. Lot of us spent a long time getting to this level while these newer people typically had an easier time (changes in game, more mature economy, velious, etc, etc). People were afraid to meet new people in a way, wanted to stay within the set of people they &quot;grew up with&quot;.<br>
<br>
If I had the balls you suggested both you and your sister would have been out on your ass given the rulesets and procedures you suggest.<br>
<br>
You think its so easy to do, go build your own guild, watch your good friends leave for higher end guilds... make new friends... watch them leave... make new friends... watch them leave... see how many cycles of that you can take. Watch even better friends stick with you and know that you can do nothing to help their goals without more levels of class X or Y and some people who know what they are doing.  Watch a guild that by and large was afraid to take risks and a few deaths without jumping all over the event leaders to the point they leave the guild. Watch it happen over and over. Think you can take a tough guy stance to membership behavior. You will wind up with no one in your guild.<br>
<br>
Probably my fault for not being a better leader, I lacked the experience in EQ to really be effective and lacked the ability to set frequent uninterrupted playtime to go do more things. Worse of all I am a druid which just leaves you out of so much.<br>
<br>
I am getting sick of those holding some bizarre grudge against Lysyndia. Sure she overreacted to many events (though perhaps if people treated each other a bit better there would not be events to overreact to!) but its not like thats all she did. She was one of a VERY VERY small handful of people who led any events or daily went out of their way to help others. And the only person we had to run a Hate (and likely Fear though that never got a chance) raid... at least the only one who had the gumption to try no matter how much it scared them. Sure other could do it, but they didn't because we tended to beat people to death on these events when they don't go well or fast enough or get to all the mobs people want. Why the hell would anyone *want* to do it under those conditions. Without her, MA would have collapsed far sooner. Sure you can criticize her, but until you do the same work she did for MA you really shouldn't talk.<br>
<br>
I did consider the mass house cleaning you suggested, but I made a different choice instead. The resulting guild would not have been MA, it would have been something else. The fact that you all couldn't reform under anyone else suggests that I was right.<br>
<br>
I made a boat load of mistakes with MA, I admit that. I should have put more offline time into it and kept a firm reign on the roster and rules. Should have enforced guild policy rather than politely put up with old friends who wanted to do something different than the guild path. Should have never gotten my epic and should have had a firm groundwork for doing epics in place. I was coming up with one that was practical (if not unpopular) but it was too late. Should have strictly made some kind of rule about treating guildies with more respect even in their errors (guildies should always get instant forgiveness and any lapses in judgement assumed to be an honest mistake, an accident or taken in the best possible light).<br>
<br>
Thinking back over all that we had sooo many phases. From bumbling through permafrost and mistmoore in our early stages.... to Blooddrive and Wisperwind's attempts to move us forward [they left after the lovely feedback they got], to Dukie and Thantos [they left after the lovely feedback they got plus their own set of problems], to Landili and Candili [they left after the lovely feedback they got, plus their own set of problems], to Kikanak and Lysyndia trying to pick up the slack, to Hammerhands and Niaru trying to pitch in and expand our selection of events. So many different phases, so many friends come and gone.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I was too easy going. Never been in any other guild really to know how others are different. I got a lot of advice from the other major guilds in the last couple months, but so much of it was just not practical with our playerbase.<br>
<br>
I am sure you have noticed that a lot of other guilds have gone away or dwindled since MA as well, and several in the weeks prior. Says something. Not sure what though.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I came off sounding pissy or like an ass here, was getting a little pissed off. Now I am just melancholy....<br>
<br>
I really didn't mean any of this to sound like I am blaming the guild. It's a wierd social dynamic that I failed mold into what was needed at the higher level of the game. Perhaps my mistake was even trying to get to that point. I wanted to because others wanted to and I wanted to please them and didn't want them to leave. Bah, clearly I am rambling now.<br>
<br>
I wonder now why I even wanted to be guildleader. I think back and it was to find a good home for my original guild's members. Who was left of that in the end. Hammerhands, Laziter, UUland (semi-retired on alts, etc), and Gauyelle returned after nearly a year away. Maybe I am forgetting someone... Ahlana came back... who else I wonder.  Can't recall when Galaron came, it was right around the time MA formed... think he came from WoM and Chaeky/Zecky side of things. So now my original reasons are moot, so I was/am forced to think about current reasons.<br>
<br>
I thought I had the right idea for a guild... maybe it's time just came and went.<br>
<br>
You all say it was was your guild too.  True. But not on the same level as I had it, Lysyndia was the only one who even came close in the end to the day to day practicalities of keep the guild even slightly together. But she didn't have the same emotional attachment as I did to go with it. Others had the emotional attachment, but not the involvement. But I will say again, if the guild was that cohesive then it should have been able to reform very quickly. The fact that it did not to any significant degree is very very telling to the state the guild was in (and pretty much had been in since about May or June).<br>
<br>
And he rambles on and on...<br>
<br>
To everyone who has sent me tells in game the past few days it has been a pleasure. You have been very understanding and I will continue to help you when I can whenever you call.<br>

    It has been a long time my friend since I have heard from you.  I realize that I was not in the inner circle of your friends, but felt a bond with you that I have not with any other guild leader.  I wasn't in MA very long and I was still trying to find my niche in the guild but I became attached with several of the people in the guilld.  The friendly enviroment that you and the officers in the guild presented was refreshing and sincere.  Along with it though, came the feeling that one could express oneself openly and candidly.  Some people do not take criticism well.  It would be very hard to controll that type of enviroment.  I think that you did that job admirably for as long as you did at great sacrifice to you and your family.  I do not understand your thought process for your ending, but I am not you.
