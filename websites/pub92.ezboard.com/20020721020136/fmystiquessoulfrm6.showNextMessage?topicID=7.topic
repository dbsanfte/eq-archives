     <br>
    It seems that our two guilds have the same morals and we are about the same lvls. We have about 40 members and are lvl cap has recently been moved to 40(in other words u most be 40 to join) but dont get me wrong we have a bunch of people in there 30's the main portion of the guild is lvl 35+. <br>
     <br>
    Are guild is based on being a family hunting together when possible help and share stuff with guild mates, but we dont not like selfish people and that will not be tolerated in this guild if u are in a guild just for u then this merger will not work. and i believe you guys are not like that from wat i have heard from Aladain. <br>
     <br>
    Now i dont even know if this could work, but i think since we are all around the same lvls and have the same morals that we would fit together quite nicely. <br>
     <br>
    My guild leader Etern lvl 54 wiz would like to set up a meeting with the leader of Fate's Presence and would like the officers from both guilds to attend. <br>
    <br>
    Now if u have any questions i have been put incharge of this merger so if u have any questions at all u can send me a tell in the game and i will do my best to answer. <br>
<br>
    Most of our members are on anywhere after 6 or 7 est. So if u would like to send them a tell and try to arange some groups with them. That way u can see weather or not u like the way u guys hunt together and such. And maybe after the meeting with the leaders and officers if we are going to attempt this we can set up a raid for both guilds to join and meet each other. <br>
<br>
    I i hope that we can join forces and have one of the stronger guilds in the game as we all mature in lvl and such. I will see u all in the game. Have fun and good hunting to u.<br>

I'm glad that you guys have taken in interest in our ideals as a guild.  I think I can speak for us all when I say that we are eager to meet people who hold those same ideals in precious regard.  Just as Sandoz mentioned, we must take things slowly and cautiously to avoid the problems that we have all experience in the past at one point or another.  Let's use our heads and take our time with this, and not jump into anything that we will end up regretting later on.  <br>
<br>
I encourage members from both guilds to try and get in contact with eachother.  Need a group member?  Look for a WoE or FP.  Going on a raid and need bodies?  Ask a WoE or FP.  Our guilds are very close level-wise.  I think grouping will help us all get to know each other which is the first step towards bigger and better things.  Sashah (our webmistress, 54 enchanter, for any of you WoE members reading this) hinted to me about possibly forming a strategic alliance as a first step, which I think would be an excellent idea.<br>
<br>
I'd like to get any suggestions or opinions from both WoE and FP members on this topic.  <br>
<br>
-Al<br>

<br>
With recent lag and buggy play issues, perhaps now is not the best time to sample people's connectivity and ability, as exampled last night in Chardok.<br>
<br>
But that said, I think a series of raids is a good way to feel out each other.  Clarity on loot and exp distribution, as well as perhaps some charity even post Christmas might be nice. (I have found that many new people come to the game after Christmas. Go figure.)<br>
<br>
Weekends are good for many people.  Perhaps a raid this Saturday, to a place of moderate difficulty, such as Kael or Emerald Jungle.  Ports are easy to those locations and allows for people to phase in and out as they need to.<br>
<br>
I would also think about raiding a more advanced place like Chardok or SolB Fire Giants, but I would suggest another time once the code of the client is more stable.<br>
<br>
Again, I think alliances are good things.  People of like mind and heart should seek each other out to allow for greater acts of Good.  <br>
<br>
Core issues as I see them are:  1.Similarity in play style and mentality and 2. leadership.  Leadership is the actually the smallest of the concerns I have but for the destruction of the guild at the hands of single upset person.  The way we have FP set up, this cannot happen.  Something I'd like to see us continue. <br>
<br>
1. is MUCH more important.  Responsiblity, kindness, and joviality are the attributes that come to mind the most quickly.<br>
<br>
Just a ramble, I hope this helped.<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>
