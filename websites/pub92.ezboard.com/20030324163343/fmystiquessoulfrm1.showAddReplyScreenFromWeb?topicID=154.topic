But if you don't here it is...i came into some money problems, and had to sell my main account Gladewalker which was in FP, on ebay.  As sad as i was to do this it had to be done, because rl holds top priority over eq life.  so heres why im writing to u guys now:<br>
<br>
1)  i have recently made a new account with a Barbarian Shaman named Talulaa on the same server (torv)..and since u all have been the nicest guild, and most of u have become close friends of mine, i was wondering if I can be allowed to join ur guild again with this character.  I understand if u guys say no, because shes only lvl 6, but it would be a great honor to be let back in...this shaman will be my sole character until planes lvl.<br>
<br>
2)  i have been informed that when the Gladewalker account got sold, that the buyer gave all my items, that were on my characters to the guild.  Which was really nice of him.  My concern is this (please do not take it the wrong way):  seeing as none of my items were aquired thru FP, all were aquired thru my own hard work, none of my items were from the FP vault...i believe those items are STILL mine, and i am still entitled to them.  So if someone can post a reply and let me know when/where to meet the banker, id greatly appreciate a meeting to collect &quot;what's left&quot; of gladewalkers (lvl 40 druid) and Debborah's (lvl 14 TWINKED shaman) items.  I hope u havent distributed it all out....but if u had i wont be mad, becuz u had no way of knowing id be back...but please be honest, and let me know if most or all of my stuff is still in the bankers hands..so i can retrieve them..theyd be agreat help..seeing as that my new char is totally broke...and starting from 0...<br>
<br>
thanks so much guys, and please let me know what the status is on any of my questions or concerns on this board, or in email..either way.!<br>
<br>
Thanks and Much Love,<br>
Talulaa (lvl 6 barbarian shaman)<br>

<br>
But I would like to take a moment out of my RL workday to say this:<br>
<br>
It is the policy of Fate's Presence not to condone any actions which violate the EULA of Everquest.  This is in our charter and we stand by it.<br>
<br>
This is not a reply in any way by the Council, simply a statement of fact.<br>
<br>
Neither should this been seen as a condemnation of any kind for people who partake of such violations.  Real Life concerns are very, very real and very, very hard.<br>
<br>
Glade, we'll chat about this in Council and then chat in members if we can.  I would expect a reply via email.  <br>
<br>
Peace and happy to see you back in the game.<br>

<br>
Re-admittence to the Guild<br>
<br>
The Council was unified in its vote to decline an invitation to you. The reasons were varied but centered on two core issues. 1. Ebaying a character is in violation of our Charter. Rationalization of needing to do something cannot justify the violation of the 'law'. 2. With no warning given of leaving the guild or of ebaying due to necessity, coupled with the tone and attitude in the post, not only in the bank area but the public channel and in the alliances section, you have called into question the compatibility of yourself with the average member of this guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Retrieving the items<br>
<br>
The Council was not unified in its vote to decline returning the items to you. The majority of the votes were for 'No', with a single vote of 'Are there options?'<br>
<br>
As way of explaining, I think an exposing of a sequence of events coupled with some experience will be useful here.<br>
<br>
In /gu we heard from Gladewalkers' toon that the person controlling the toon was someone who had purchased the character on ebay. I immediately typed '/report gladewalker' Typically this is followed up by a /petition to initiate action, but I had done my duty in terms of providing documentation and did not yet feel the need to follow that up with a /petition.<br>
<br>
Ebay-gladewalker then said that he was transferring to a new server, he wanted to know what he should do with real-gladwalker's stuff. He could give it to newbies or give it to us. I said that I would make a mule to take things for the guild bank. We met, He had given some items away and gave the rest to me from a variety of characters. The items have stayed on that mule.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to yesterday: RL-Gladewalker posts not that he was wondering if he could get a start up kit or some help with a new character, but roughly and aggressively says that the items are still his and that they should be returned to him.<br>
<br>
People respond in a variety of ways and RL-Gladewalker responds to that as well. All the while people in the council area are posting their thoughts and I personally was wrestling with all the facts and possibilities.<br>
<br>
Finally, we have a high level friend on another server who tells us that people have been 'banned' for accepting 'gifts' from hacked accounts. I research this and find posts that suggest that those people who are 'working with' account hackers are indeed 'suspended' during the course of the GM investigation. <br>
<br>
In light of possible risk to my account, the banker's account and any other account in question, the items in question are going to be destroyed. The accepting of those items in the first place were, in the hindsight, troublesome at best and down right stupid at worst.<br>
<br>
Returning the items has turned out to be a very intense issue. The idea of a 'start up kit' was the idea that I thought would be the most likely and helpful. I had even thought of suggesting that these items come from the guild bank, instead of personal caches.<br>
<br>
Now, in the light of all these issues, I find myself voting 'No' with the Council. It is too much risk for us as a Guild, it violates the spirit of our Charter (in that we would in effect aiding a violator of the EULA), and it aides someone who speaks with a voice and a tone that is not in the spirit of how we would want Fate's Presence to be recognized.<br>
<br>
I suspect that the majority of this argument will be misunderstood and misinterpreted but I also suspect that this attempt at explaining our rationality for this decision will be viewed in a kinder light by those that understand we speak for the good of the guild and not any one person, no matter how deserving.<br>
