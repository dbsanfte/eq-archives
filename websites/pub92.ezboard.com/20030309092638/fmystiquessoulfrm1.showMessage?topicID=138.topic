- "Just" would be totally objective application of the Law. Judges would have no power to 'commute' or increase sentances.  Penalties would be known and applied once guilt of a charge was assertained.  Equality of Race, Religion, Financial status and so on would be necessary.  This would be extemely difficult if not impossible.  Its funny, America is such a wonderful country.  We have overcome several major hurdles towards this 'just' society.  The Rule of Law is the key to this success.  Our greatest challenge lay before us, but its a challenge I dont know we can solve at this time.  The problem of 'Have and Have Nots' is a real problem.  The lower dregs of society suffering due to a lack of proper and aggressive defense before the Law is a problem. /shrug A problem I dont know we will ever solve.  Judges getting to change the sentancing for a crime really pisses me off.  Its nice for movies, but in RL it sucks Hard.<br>
<br>
2) What country (or state or province of a country) most closely resembles your utopia? Even still what changes what you have that region make?<br>
- American 2002, without a doubt.  No other government has come close to the respect for universal human dignity, empowerment of the poor and underpriveleged and aggressive defense of the rights of its citizens.  OH there are problems, Huge ones.  Largely centered on the bureaucratic system surrounding that government.  The two party system also has problems.  Largely 'historic' or bureaucratic ones.  We have the weight of generations of ideas pressing on really smart, really good people, forcing them to take stupid positions so that they can get the money to get elected.  A good example of this is Al Gore Versus BillClinton.  Gore 'believed' strongly in the party line and the socio-economic plans he wanted to implement.  Clinton believed only in success.  He said whatever the majority of the people wanted to hear.  This will take you very far in our world.  But the price is high.  Clinton as a Republican would have cut a VERY interesting figure.  Gore would never fit in that box, but Clinton easily could.  I am not saying Clinton was all bad, but I am saying that the two party system has really screwed up the conversations that we should be having about good person to rule the world.  I refuse to believe that the ruler of the world should be limited into Repulican or Democratic shoes.  There has to be another way.  Not simply a third party, but a new way as a whole.  Something where neither party or any party gets money from the government.  I honestly dont know the answer to this one.<br>
<br>
3) If you could make one change to your country's consititution or basic law, what would that change be?<br>
- This will not be very popular I know.  I would make 2 changes and if I had to pick one, I would pick the first one. 1. 1. 6year term for all members of the Senate and House and Executive. 2. I would remove the death penalty.  <br>
1. Two terms on pres and multiple terms on Senators leads to compromise and deal making that has NOTHING to do with the right way to run the country.  The majority of the 1st term is spent A. Proving the people were right and B. Trying to set up for the next election.  Versus the active and aggressive pursuit of policy which will have impact. <br>
2. People make mistakes. Guilt is rarely certain.  I would make life sentances REAL.  I would make prison for Lifers VERY different than for shorttermers and longtermers.  I would make Lifers go to a different prison, perhaps a more central and horrible place like New Mexico.  This allows for appeals and review of court data and the advancement of tech to research actual events.  No I have never had anyone in my family murdered.  I am not talking about the emotional release as you watch a man fry.  I am talking about the Rule of Law, the equal application of punishment, and the conflicting message between our current State policy on YouthinAsia and the death penalty.  Some states kill faster than others.  Some states also teach evolution is a poosible theory, with the same weight as the Creationist story.  Some states need to have guidance which will help the country as a whole.<br>

I hadn't thought about strict term limits, but what you say makes some sense. I'm going to have to mull that over. As for the death penalty, I used ot be very much against it, but doing criminal defense brought me reluctantly pro death penalty. I'm for it only under certain special circumstances. treason, as defined by the US Constitution is one. The other, is after someone is convicted of murder, there should be a separate trial to determine if the person is 'to dangerous to live'. What I have in mind is someone who is incapable of reform and poses a threat to anyone he comes into contact with. In other words, a sociopathic serial killer. I've met 3 men like that, believe me you can tell what they are when their mask is down. Very scary people indeed. But the execution rate in the US would drop to 3-4 a year for the whole country if the change I outlined was made. As it is we execute too many.<br>

LOL</span><hr size=1> As far as being mostly against the death penalty, it's for a number of reasons. One, there are cases (very rare, but extant) of people being wrongly executed. To kill someone an innocent person for a crime he did not commit is an atrocity in my view. Two, while reformation in prison is not likely, I do hope that it may happen. If you kill the person, it isn't possible. Three, I worry about what legalized killing does to us as a society. I think it hardens us when maybe we don't need to be so hard.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the murderer who gets executed will never murder again, and I do appreciate that argument. But life without parole is a very harsh and effective punishment. <p><img src="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/criminal/elizabethbathory.jpg" title="I am Elizabeth Bathory."><br \><a href="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/criminal/">Which Evil Criminal are <i>You</i>?</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E6CC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/uzantoz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zantoz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Centered One</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#000000>(1/10/02 2:11:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/fmystiquessoulfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.looroll.com/thesheets/wallpapers/m/manifestation_thumb.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Death Penalty</span><hr size=1> I am against the death penalty for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1. Killing is wrong.<br>
2. Human error<br>
<br>
1.<br>
"Killing is wrong" is a moral stance which alot of us agree on.  We see that the ending of another person's life is not a good thing.  This is not only because of some hope that if we treat others well, they will treat us well. (ie. I dont kill you, you wont kill me.) But rather, this life is all we know.  Whatever belief I have about the post-life events, they are simply that, beliefs.  This is the only world we can all agree on exists.<br>
<br>
The State should not kill its members because this 'violates' the contract that exists between the State and the Citizen.  One can argue that the Citizen that violates the rights of another Citizen forfeits their own rights.  That is a valid stance.  This then allows the State to end the life of the Offending Citizen.<br>
<br>
But, in my opinion, the actions of a Citizen does not change the 'properties' of the Citizen.  A Citizen is a Citizen is a Citizen.  Each Citizen should have the same rights as the other Citizens.  That said, clearly some reasonable steps must be taken to protect the 'innocent' Citizens from the criminal Citizen.  The 'protection' should be 'reasonable and appropriate'.<br>
<br>
The killer Citizen cannot be trusted to exist with other Citizens.  He/she should be removed from the general population to protect 'innocent' Citizens.  This is like padding a cell so that an insane person does not hurt themselves.  You are not padding the cell to torture or get revenge on the patient, you are trying to protect them.  Likewise, removal from the 'innocent' Citizen pool protects without the motive of revenge.  "I am not doing this to punish you.  I am doing this to protect my Citizens."<br>
<br>
"Killing is wrong" can not only be applied toward death penalties but towards war as well.  When a conflict arises, one party wants to inflict their will on another.  They attempt to do this using 'power.'  Power of bomb, power of gun, power of stick and stone.  In war, the objective is not to kill the enemy, but to remove their power.  They can possess the will to hurt me, but if they have no power to do so, then I am safe. (True, it is better to change the will, but I am not talking about policy of relationship, but rather the act of war.)<br>
This is an ideal.  An ideal which is hard/impossible to realize.  But I think it is something we should aim for.  You can only go as far as you aim.  I think we need to raise our sights.<br>
<br>
Everywhere I look I see "God Bless America."  I agree with this.  Then I see CNN footage of soliders, putting writing on bombs saying "Up yours Osama."  I wonder if this is revenge or justice.  I wonder if this is the tactical application of power to remove the power of the enemy or is this the application of power to kill alot of the people we hate today.  But I digress.<br>
<br>
The State should not kill it Citizens because to do so, we tell our children it is okay to kill sometimes, we tell the world that we are killers of our own people, we tell ourselves that we are 'better' than 'that other guy in the box'.  We stand in moral, mortal judgement over people who, but for the grace of God we would be.  The line is grey and blurred between what you would kill for and what I would kill for. Some would kill for treason.  Some would kill for drug dealing.  Some would kill for murder.  The Will of the State is made up two things: 1. The Constitution underwhich it was created, and 2. The current Will of the People.<br>
<br>
The State should speak to 'the greater angels of our nature.' And not the vengful, fearful heart./1.<br>
<br>
2. People make mistakes.  Executions cannot be undone.  If even one person is killed wrongly, then the system collapses.  The safest course of action is to kill no one.  I am a safe player./2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, while it is hard on the State to keep alive the long term killer, if a true cost analysis was made of how much it costs to fight a death penalty, I think that we would find the killer is costing us alot more to kill than to keep around in a cell.  The killer can be made to work for their keep.  The killer can be taught skills which can then be used to help society.  The killer can work to make up for, somehow, the death of the person they killed.  Once the killer is killed the 'karma balance' ends.  There is no chance of understanding or redress.  There is no chance of change of heart.  All we will have done is had two deaths instead of one.<br>
<br>
Our hearts have brtuals animals in them.  I know I have one in there.  I want to rend the flesh from Osamar.  I want to carpet bomb various areas around the world.  I want to see the screaming burning bodies of the people that bombed my country.  I want revenge......<br>
<br>
But I can't have that.  I can't have my revenge and my high moral ground.  I can't have revenge and dignity.  I can't be the devil of my nature and the better angel of my nature.  I can't drink the blood of my enemy and turn to my chilren, bloody lipped, and say, "Be like me.  I love you.  Love others."<br>
<br>
<br>
Seriously deep and perhaps a bit screwed up, but that is me.<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>

That's not to say it still isn't wrong. It's just, to be very selfish and pragmatic, I'd rather the enemy die, than myself, my loved ones and my country. It's funny, when I was 18, I was a pacifist, vegetarian, socialist. 1/4 of a century later, I eat meat, have several guns (inherited from my brother) and have started voting Republican. At this rate, when I retire, I'll be in a pickup truck with both a Pat Buchanan bumper sticker and a bumper sticker that reads &quot;you''ll get my guns when you pry them from my cold, dead fingers&quot;, eating Slim Jims and picking up Marines in sleazy (dark) bars.<br>
