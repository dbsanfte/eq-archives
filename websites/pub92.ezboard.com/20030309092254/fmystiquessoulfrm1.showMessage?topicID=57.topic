<br>
Guild Council -<br>
<br>
Fates Presence will be run by a Council.  This Council will elected from the general pool of members.  All members of the Council will be officers.  <br>
<br>
No Council member shall take a guild wide action, except for the guildMOTD, until they consult with all or the majority of the rest of the Council.  The majority being needed for minor actions, Ally, Guild Raid, etc....  All the Council for major items, Making a new officer, potential removal of a guild member, etc...<br>
<br>
The 'owner' of the guild, as defined by Verant as 'GuildLeader' cannot be on the Council or hold any title with the guild.  The 'owner' of the guild will never delete or remove anyone from the guild.  The 'owner' of the guild shall make officers or members only at the direct order of the Council.  All other invites shall be done by the serving officers.<br>
<br>
This Council will meet once a month to discuss the direction of the guild.  Council members will be expected to read and be completely up to speed on guild activities, via the guild board, and guild web site, every other day. If for some reason, the Council member is not available for comment or vote on a topic for more than three days, they much contact the rest of the Council and make some arrangements for keeping the lines open or their Council seat is called into question.<br>
<br>
There will be a board section just for the Council.  Only active members of the Council will have the password.  If at any time a person leaves the Council, the password shall be changed.  <br>
<br>
Various members of the Council will have different jobs.  The initial Council Seats are: Recruitment, Raiding, Communications, WebMistress/Master and Banker.<br>
<br>
Recruitment:  In charge of rounding up old MA people and in general observing people for potential adding to the guild.  You will need to have a public email for people to contact you directly and a special section of the board.<br>
<br>
Raiding: Organizing and assigning various guild raids.  A large variety of levels and types of raids is expected. You will need to have a public email for people to contact you directly and a special section of the board.<br>
<br>
Communications: Responding to the various posts around the web regarding our guild AND handling in game issues.  You are the PR person for the guild. You will need to have a public email for people to contact you directly.<br>
<br>
WebMistress/Master:  Handling the development and maintence of the web site and the web boards. The Web board passwords shall be known to the WebMistress/Master and Communications.  The Board shall not be deleted or locked. You will need to have a public email for people to contact you directly.<br>
<br>
Banker: Storing those items that are for the general good of the guild.  Loot policy and what items go into the guildbank are topics for another area. You will need to have a public email for people to contact you directly and a special section of the board.<br>
<br>

At this point and time I was with WoM and we had just merged with MA, these were some of my suggestions that eventually found their way to our origional Code.<br>
I know, it is outdated but I think it would serve as a base of what we were about.<br>
<br>
&lt;Thank you for responding this quickly, it only shows me how much you care about the wellfare of us and the Guild.<br>
It only demostrates what kind of a leader you are.<br>
I had written a very long response and for some reason it did not forward to you so I will try again:<br>
We as a clique, He he he (well put) know exactly what you are talking about but as a clique we care very much of what happens as a whole, we are ready to follow and participate as much as possible. But we need to have a clear understanding of where we are going.<br>
These are the things we need to know:<br>
The Code:<br>
We joined and participated in the WoM because we believed in the code; to us playing the game is as  much fun as to modeling a behavior that we are proud of.<br>
In the long run this will make us be a respected and looked up to type of Guild.We believe that all members should foster this type of behavior.<br>
Our goals should also go hand and hand with this Code.<br>
Definition of what is accepted and what is not; Anonimity should be a no-no since grouping with like players is made easier when all know levels.<br>
Interaction between the Council and the Members is a must!<br>
We need to know what is about to take place and have a say so in matters that affect the Guild.<br>
Raids? yes we love Raids! who does not? he he he<br>
But they should be coordinated and assigned so as not to be a complete suicide mission.<br>
BTW I have been hunting at Unrest and for level 30'sh it is good for loot and exp a thought?<br>
You have members in this Guild who are bright and energetic (Nitack he he he)<br>
Use them let their creativite flow, You as a leader should delegate BTW Thank you for the offer of making me an officer again I humbly accept, even in my limited playing time I will try to help as much as I can.<br>
Rosters:<br>
Very important, it not only makes grouping and knowing each other easier it also would provide a forum for better coordination of raids, knowing when the most populated time or day of the week is.<br>
This forum can list ppl's interests the quests they are working with and what they would like to archieve.<br>
List items that the Guild now holds; and make members work for them, it does not have to be hard but at least show the effort, maybe giving up or trading for something else, free is nice but it creates lasyness he he he<br>
Structure:<br>
People need leaders and soldiers alike, all are very important, a sound chain of command will go a long way.<br>
I do have a lot more but I am at work so wil have to cut it short I look forward to spending a long time with you.<br>
BTW Did I mention that all of us are leaning into staying? LOL&gt;<br>
<br>
When I read this my eyes watered.<br>
See you all Sunday.<br>

<br>
Happy to see a conversation about creating a new guild. <br>
<br>
I would love to volunteer to be a part of building something with you all. <br>
<br>
Based on the council post listed, I would like to volunteer to organize and administer the guild bank. I currently have 3 active accounts, which affords me a HUGE! amount of storage space. <br>
<br>
I would be willing to keep and post an active inventory on the guild boards. While my face may be new to many of the MA refugees, I believe that those who know me well would vouch for my integrity, credibility and maybe more importantly availability (I am ALWAYS ON!). <br>
<br>
While I would be happy to serve in another capacity, I believe I can make the greatest contribution as the guild banker. <br>

It isn't at all complete, but I think it compliments Zantoz's ideas quite nicely. :-)  <br>
<br>
Ownership- Who is the main GL? By verant's title only?  This respect should be entrusted to a member within the guild... <br>
<br>
&lt;Edit&gt; Zantoz's idea about not being in the council is an interesting idea.  I think it depends who we're thinking, else simply if their even temperment and accessability will work. O_o<br>
<br>
Council - Council members are positions held to ease workloads, communications, and to make sure things get done...<br>
<br>
&lt;Edit&gt; Read Zantoz's post again, that's my same idea, HE STOLE IT! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Proposed Council Members:<br>
<br>
1.) Events Coordinator - (Tactical Officer): Assists with organizing/researching raids, and/or raid leader.  <br>
<br>
--1.a) This member, or the raid leader, should assign someone to keep track of who gets what on a raid.<br>
<br>
2.) Recruitment Organizer- Oversee the status of interested Norrathians, and watch and monitor their progression.<br>
<br>
3.) Historian/Article Supervisor:  If there is a marked raid to come, or even something fun to document, you are responsible for either describing what happened, or assigning this responsibility (beforehand) to another member.  Share our stories! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
4.) Photography Supervisor: Help keep our history proud and memoriable by: if there is a marked raid to come, or even something fun to document, you are responsible for either perhaps takgin a few photos, or assigning this responsibility (beforehand) to another member.  <br>
<br>
5.) Guild Treasurer: (You know what that is ;-)<br>
<br>
6.) Intra-Guild Communications Outlet:  Or simply someone who  is there to watch and help to catch tensions before they rise and sort out problems.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Responding to the various posts around the web regarding our guild AND handling in game issues. You are the PR person for the guild. You will need to have a public email for people to contact you directly.&quot; -Zantoz<br>
<br>
7.) Webpagemaster: &lt;Insert Zantoz's comments&gt;<br>
<br>
I think the basic thing I like about the council structure is that ALL of those members have a specific task to focus on, yet aren't limited to that.   They upkeep things in running order with their common cause.<br>
<br>
It is also understandable that at times we might reach out to ally ourselves with another guild.  In this case, often one or two people will be overseeing this relationship, and should be scribed as ambassadors.  The same shoudl be said for keeping track of who is THEIR guild ambassador.<br>
<br>
ALL recruitment applications will be completed online and once reviewed by the appropriate council member, posted online (in a forum) for the guild to review. ALL council members must respond/reply to this and at least ten (?) members in order to be considered for admitance. <br>
<br>
To aid this end, each  Saturday at noon (?) PST, members are asked, whenever possible, to join in a weekly Pow-Wow to supercede possible scheduled raids/events.  This ensures a chance not only to renew intra-guild companionship, but so that prospective members can further contacts.  Other guilds may be invited to such events to strengthen server-wide friendship and our possible allies.<br>
<br>
Members are kindly asked to stay n /roleplay vs. /anon in order to show guild pride, and for ease of communication.<br>
<br>
&quot;No Council member shall take a guild wide action, except for the guildMOTD, until they consult with all or the majority of the rest of the Council. The majority being needed for minor actions, Ally, Guild Raid, etc.... All the Council for major items, Making a new officer, potential removal of a guild member, etc...&quot; -Zantoz<br>
<br>
If you are having problems with a particular member, or even someone outside the guild, you are asked to contact hte communications officer, whether in-game or via-email.  Settle problems before they grow, for the good of everyone.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are a family within another realm, brought together by fate and common cause: we are proof of Fate's Presence.&quot; -Sashah<br>
<br>
There's a start on my thoughts.   Any C&amp;C?<br>

I think moving way from the monarchy structure of a guild to more of a democracy will help strengthen the guild as a whole and help everyone feel that their opinions matter and can make a difference.  <br>
<br>
Oh and just for the record, if you guys notice that I'm missing for awhile in a couple of weeks, do not be alarmed!!  I will be back!! hehe.  Yeah like anyone even knew I was here in the first place =).  I'm on an interview spree right now for a bunch of jobs etc., and I will be relocating in a couple of weeks, and I may not have a connection for quite some time thereafter.<br>
<br>
Anyway,  I'd like to help anyway I can with developing the new structure of the guild.  If anyone needs me for something, hit me up online or email me at undine56@hotmail.com.<br>
