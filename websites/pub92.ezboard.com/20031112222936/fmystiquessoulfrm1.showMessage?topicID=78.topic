<br>
For me alot of u see me as ditching MA to be &quot;uber&quot;..For a few days and numerous hours ofter i left MA i recieven nothing but tells of... Oh thats cool use MA to get your epic then u ditch us....I cannot tell u how hurt i was to see this.<br>
<br>
For as many times as i could remember i was always there to help everyone in the guild out with something..there was not a day that went by that i was not involved in helping the guild at some level and there was not a day that went by where i did not hear bitching from other players..Yes it seemed as if all our high levels left to go become uber at one time and my reaction to that was always that loyalty overcame all...But in the end when it came down to having a meeting with others and hearing were we wanted to take MA as well as some steps to make it go as smoothly as possible things never happened..Guild raids were made only to be taken lightly..no shows late commers whiners...etc etc...<br>
I took this all in stride as i still saw the light at the end of the tunnel..NOW dont get me wrong this is not a me me me post im trying to be far from that..but also im trying to exsplain why i decided months before why i was gonna leave MA..In the end it came down to the total lack of what was to me maturity on peoples parts..And at that point it tossed me over the edge.<br>
<br>
As to u trying to refom MA i wish u all the best of luck in doing so.. A good friendship with others it what makes a guild work..respect understanding ...all things that u all posess..<br>
<br>
TO all the old MA's who camp the boards..Be at peace i wish u well in your real life as well as game life<br>
<br>
IF u need me all u have to do is call and i will make time to come.<br>
<br>
To Keril....why??..everymember deserves an exsplination of what u did and hiding and passing your words thru Lys is not the answer..if u have time to log on then u have time to post here..merly passing it thru lys who can filter out what she wants when she wants is not acceptable..but then again i can demand all i want till im blue in the face and it dont mean @#%$ to u does it...aparently in the end keril..one who i once respected and called a friend that i could rely on for help in some times of need whether it be in game or in RL has forsaken MA is beyond me...<br>
<br>
I understand that RL has priority behind the game trust me bro i do understand that...SO i wish u well in real life man i hope u can get everyting worked out and in good order...but alas when u return to EQ if u ever do i will be requesting some answers for your actions... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5EB><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/umarkax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Markax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#000000>(10/2/01 8:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/fmystiquessoulfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remenants of a once great guild</span><hr size=1> Well, Angues, I was in the zone at the time you deguilded.

Contrary to popular belief MA wasn't a perfect guild that suddenly went to hell in the course of a few days or even a single night. Our large numbers helped hide to many the festering wounds that brought us down. People having disrespect for guildies was a large part, whether by not showing up at events or being late, by flaming others in guild whether on the boards or in chat, etc etc. <br>
I understand why people left, some have limited time and need to get stuff done and want to be in a results driven guild, not Pee wee's playhouse. For some pee wee's playhouse is fine. I like a mix of both and had no problem with MA, but do understand those that did. Don't flame those that left because they want to enjoy there EQ time somewhere else, be thankful for the friends you got and play in a way that makes you happy. Just my 2cp, all those that didn't reform or who left already i wish you the best, as well as those of you who refuse to let MA die. I am torn between those 2 extremes and might just fade away from EQ because of it. The guild deletion debacle has taken away alot of the fun for me, but please don't spread your pain by harrassing those you feel are responsible for it. Just my 2cp <p>Roddo Manetheren

I cannot talk to Gilanthas, Zantoz. I, like Gilanthas, have left Mystique Alliance. I have no more (or less in this case) authority over MA board than he does. It is Fate's Presence and Imperium Alliance who carry MA spirit and gather MA members back together. And You are doing a great job at that too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
So it should be you (councils or officers of those guilds) who should talk to Gilanthas, especially since it is your website which he placed there.<br>
To Sashah:<br>
I cannot see any reason why links to this forum and/or website address (or addresses for both guilds) could not be placed on MA board in addition to Keril's last words. But I believe that the message should come from you and not me nor Gilanthas.<br>
<br>
I find it strange (and a little offensive) that when everybody demends explanation from Keril, it was his words which had been deleted. <br>
I hope I didn't offend your feelings and I do wish You All only the best, please, believe me. I may feel a little guilty that I have left MA, who was my family too, and blame myself for not being there for Keril when he needed me. I will never know whether if I were there, the things would work differently.<br>

<br>
He didn't discuss this even with his closest friends and officers, it seems, so I honestly can't see why you would take offense to our sadness of not understanding what went on...that seems out of place to me since you weren't inside what went on, but then I wasn't as close as others, and they too just wanted to know: &quot;why?&quot;   <br>
<br>
It all comes down to a question of whose guild MA was, I'm afraid, whose castle and plaything.  If one assumes it was Keril's alone, then no, i can see why he'd owe us nothing.  However, if you saw MA as a living thing with officers. friendship and organization far greater than a single person alone, it raises the question of why something so drastic was done by way of a single hand.<br>
<br>
That, right there, is why some people are still traumatized and worried for Keril about what happened, and might have gone on behind the scenes.  Even the officers didn't know!  Others (like I) logged on and only later guildchat was awefully silent, before noticing it no longer existed. :-/  Boards were locked (including all the personally researched information within), and people became upset, asking questions of who should claim to it, etc etc.   But we're not going to find more answers, and this forum was put here moreso to re-connect people, and spread support.<br>
<br>
I think people really need to let this be.   Aside from first reactions I see nothing of people yelling at Keril or anything more.  MA has lived to it's fullest, and now it's what spirit we carry with us that really matters most: what we learned.<br>

I cannot talk to Gilanthas, Zantoz. I, like Gilanthas, have left Mystique Alliance. I have no more (or less in this case) authority over MA board than he does. It is Fate's Presence and Imperium Alliance who carry MA spirit and gather MA members back together. And You are doing a great job at that too  <br>
So it should be you (councils or officers of those guilds) who should talk to Gilanthas, especially since it is your website which he placed there.<br>
I cannot see any reason why links to this forum and/or website address (or addresses for both guilds) could not be placed on MA board in addition to Keril's last words. But I believe that the message should come from you and not me nor Gilanthas.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Gil's the only one with access to editing the MA website, Laima, besides me.  I'm not going to edit it.  You seem to be the only one who wants it edited.  Therefore, you ask Gil.  It's quite easy to talk to him.  Wonderful contraption called sending a tell in-game.  I do it frequently.  Don't be surprised when he doesn't agree to edit, though.<br>

<br>
Keril's &quot;pearls of website wisdom&quot; left us with no answers, no explanation.  I don't see a reason to bring them back.  Gilanthas's message is actually a lot nicer than Keril's, I like it better.  <br>

<br>
It doesn't matter who was there for Keril.  We were all there for him.  He still did it.  Don't blame yourself, because you wouldn't have made a difference.  Like you said, you don't consider yourself someone who &quot;carries the MA spirit&quot; anymore.<br>

Gilanthas was the one who got us that URL. I believe it was he who paid for it. Gil asked me to help out with the web page and eventually I became the main web page manager. You can understand how annoyed I was when Keril went in and deleted everything that I made. I have a backup on my machine here and I still have access to set up the website as I wish. <br>
When I left, I asked for someone to take over, which no one did. I don't believe anyone cared about the website at all except for the roster and the message board. The hell with it, I had fun building it, I had fun updating it. <br>
Do you guys want me to put up something different?<br>
Keril's original 'goodbye message' web page is gone for good. <br>
My 2 cents, the website belongs to whoever bloody pays for it. If that is Gil, then so be it. He can do with it as he wishes.<br>
<br>
One more note. If you ever said anything to Angues such as he described, I want you to apologize immediately. He gave himself to the guild without ever asking for anything in return. To hear people chiding him like that makes me mad as hell. True I wasn't around for those final months, but I've known him since MA started.<br>

I had a fairly decent new site design getting ready to go live just as Keril deleted.  So the site was being cared for, albeit slowly and by me, which prolly isn't much better than not at all.  Heeh. <p>Tyenu Heffleflekker<br>

Interesting Angues.  I did not filter what he said, I did refuse to give out real life information due to his right to privacy, and I did try to help with what limited information I had. If you and others saw it as something else then I am sorry for that.  It was only an attempt to help understand what happened.  <br>
<br>
Yes he was in contact with me and a few others under an alt.  He is a friend still to me. <br>
