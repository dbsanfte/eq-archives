As we comence a new chapter in our EQ history and our New Home, I want to encourage all of our members to post ideas and suggestions.<br>
We can make this a beautiful place, something to be proud but it will take the whole village to accomplish this, so please say your peace, become active.<br>
These are my comments:<br>
<br>
Loot:<br>
Very touchy subject IMO the root of all evil, we have to make sure from the very beginning, that we follow strict rules and we do not make exceptions.<br>
1.- NEED OVER GREED; yes I believe in it, needs should be posted before any raids, if you did not post do not expect it.<br>
2.-Class specific should go to that class, if class not present a roll should be called for.<br>
If someone calls for a Raid for a specific item and that person organizes it, the item goes to that person first, all other loot goes back to rule 1, again, all other is rolls.<br>
3.- Loot should be picked up by Leaders of groups and passed on to the Leader of Raid no one else should loot, items to be passed out at end of Raid, again, see rules 1 and 2, if it is a No DROP rule 2 applies.<br>
I know there is more here but just a few suggestions.<br>
I will continue in other posts.<br>

I have personally always believed on dividing loot for the needy. I mean why would a person who has ALMOST full planes outfit get the piece if there is another person (guild member) who has hardly any. Does giving it to the person with almost full set benefit the guild more with that piece?<br>
<br>
I have always been against randoming among everybody unless it's something that nobody uses or the group is a pickup group. This is the main reason why I like to group with people I know, usually less arguing about the loot.<br>

I'd also like to consider an e-mail list to keep in touch.  The council is a priority, but I think guildwide woudl be a good idea.  *nods*  I've headed them before, and I'm sure I coudl help get one started if there's interest<br>

Website: what do people think of the colors/general layout?   Do you think a draconic/stary logo is the right idea?  (even if I still need to finish it.. ~_~).   More to be added when this P 116 starts running faster...<br>

This is part 2 of my input on Zantoz thread.<br>
<br>
Raiding Rules:<br>
<br>
I have copies of drafts we had put together for publishing and never got done, IMO there were some pretty sound rules I will dig them up and I will post tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Alts in our guild, Mains in others:<br>
<br>
The only ones we should allow under those conditions are former MA members and Liason alts for communication with our sister Guilds ( If there is to be any)  period.<br>
We wouldn't want new comers to come and just use us.<br>
It would demoralize the membership and might lead to discontent.<br>
<br>
Alliances with other guilds<br>
- Who are our top three targets?<br>
<br>
I only have one that comes to mind at this time.<br>
Imperium Alliance ( Former MA members )<br>
Kikaran's alt will be guilded with us if ok with all. and act as liason.<br>
<br>
Board Layout<br>
- Passworded areas<br>
<br>
Board:<br>
Links! That always makes it easy to look for information when raids or items are needed.<br>
Informational link for specific quests or items i.e. Thurgadin gate potions, ring or shawl quests.<br>
<br>
Pasworded areas:<br>
<br>
Members only, a must!<br>
Council only, a  MUST!!!!!<br>
Maybe a rants and flames where people can vent? Hmmmmm I don't know about this one but I will throw it out see if anyone agrees.<br>
The others I am not as concerned the tipical stuff, trade, bazzar, funny stuff, whatever.<br>
<br>
Nights and Time to aim for play:<br>
<br>
Definetely have a Guild nigth! Pick a spot where all can attend and have fun exp and maybe have raffles, we can sell tickets at 5 pp aticket and have an item given out the monies go to the treasury for later Raids or whatever.<br>
The item raffled can be donated by someone and 50% of the proceeds go to the donor and the rest to the bank, that way the donor can also have something in return.<br>
I have seen other Guilds who, when a person is invited, they do maybe 2 or 3 at a time and they do it at this functions that way all can meet the character and have a chance to maybe group and have punch and pie with them.... hint, hint I want MORE PIE! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well I will look for the Raid and Raid loot rules and post them here. <br>

<br>
                                Raiding<br>
I noticed you were setting up something of a &quot;Tactics officer&quot;.  This is a good start.  Such an officer should help in recruiting necessary classes for a raid.  However, the person intending to lead the raid should do most of the active recruitment.<br>
<br>
There should be some kind of consequence if you don't show up to a raid that you have confirmed.  Personal opinion would be that such a person no come to the next raid by that raid leader.<br>
<br>
Also, once the raid has started, no late comers.  If there is one thing that will cause a wipe out in many raiding situations is when trying to bring in new people into a raid.  If the raid is somewhere such additions are easy to merge in, this part can be ignored.<br>
<br>
                                 Loot<br>
Honestly, I hate the topic in general.  More fights are caused over loot items than anything else.  Definitely should be need before greed.  If during a raid, droppable loot should be turned over to one individual, the Raid leader, or a person designated by the leader.  After the raid, the Raid leader should ask for the attendees that could use the item to send them a tell with the stats of whatever item they are currently using that is similar.  The Raid leader should then make a call as to who has more need for such an item.<br>
<br>
Certain loots should be determined ahead of time, such as epic items, major no drop items, etc.  Where such determinations cannot be made ahead of time, use NBG/rolling/deferrment.  Those that can and WILL use the item may roll, but those that could benefit more should be deferred to.  This requires people to use their hearts and their better judgement.<br>
<br>
                                Alliances<br>
I have proposed to have my alt Caladdare join Fate's Presence and act as a liason with Imperium Alliance.  Such liasons I think should be formed with Price of Sacrifice as well as many former MAers went there.  Although it would be nice to have a liason with FC and ToD, I'm just not sure if this would be possible.  However, I suspect that Galaron/Gaerill could act as an FC liason, but I will not speak for him.<br>
<br>
With such alliances, we need to keep good communication and a good working relationship working both ways, i.e., joint raids, assistance, etc.  One good starting point would be in helping Galaron in PoA when he sets a new date.  As always, I can have Kikanak at most any event you might need him at and I can probably get an IA member or two to help as well.<br>
<br>
                                Board Layouts<br>
I understand a members only section and I would be fine with that.  However, areas on the board that members are locked out of I think is a bad idea.  Such areas cause suspicion among the ranks.  This could be problematic.  Much of the site could be open to the public and act as a source of information to others thinking of attempting the same thing (such as a raid and possible tactics to use).<br>
<br>
                                Mains and Alts<br>
Having someone's main in another guild is not a bad thing.  For instance, my main Kikanak is in Imperium Alliance while I'm hoping to get my alt Caladdare in to Fate's.  Such is a similar case with Galaron in FC and Gaerill in Fate's.  This would allow better communication with the other guilds and I believe this should be encouraged, to an extent.  If the alt in FP can serve a useful purpose, this is good.  If it's just there to level up in preparation to move on to another guild, very bad.  Obviously this is a judgement call area.  Case by case would have to be examined and determined.<br>
<br>
Seeing as I'm not really a member, you can take or leave these comments as you see fit.  Having been an officer in MA and seen some of the behind the scenes problems that there were, I think some of these suggestions could help.<br>

<br>
If the members in BOTH GUILDS are wholy aware of it, and it's done to aid communication and the like, I see no problem with it, it can only help us.   The downside ot this is if it's done stealthily, so each and all will have to be careful with reasons for having this, and to make sure it doesn't get out of hand (aka: having 20 alts in our guild would almost seem more of a spy-tactic than fun time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
