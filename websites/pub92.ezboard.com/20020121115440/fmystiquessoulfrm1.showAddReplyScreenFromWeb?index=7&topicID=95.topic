<br>
So far the game is very slow paced. Nice and relaxing though, if I want to relax and not worry about losing my body. It feels weird to sit there and wait for hp/power as skeletons that are red to you just walk right over you.<br>
<br>
I think the designers went way too far in trying to bait EQ players by offering things like: Never losing your corpse, never losing level due to death, insanely fast HP/power(mana) regen, easy quests, easy as hell camps, no rare spawns (everything respawns in like, 5 minutes), just about every other class can rez (restores constitution), seperate chat channels in a split window, ZERO med time, spells instantly gained when you level, no having to hunt, buy, or research for spells, and memorizing them is instantaneous as well. Everyone can bind just by finding a rock and typing /bind. They've taken about every single thing that frustrates (some) EQ players and &quot;fixed&quot; it in their game so it is a non issue. So this will make some people happy. The casual gamer definitely wins with this tactic.<br>
<br>
I do think all this makes the game pretty boring, at least on the PvE aspect of it. I'v not yet experienced RvR combat, but I've read up everywhere about it, and it's just a zerg attack. The side with the most people who happen to make it to the battle wins. Other times, people rush to attack some other realm, only to find no one around to fight. If that's the high end encounter, where you have to run around picking a fight, it's not for me.<br>
<br>
Again, the biggest problem I have with the game is the interface. But it also runs slow, it's way too quiet. I do like that you can't /shout in every zone, but it makes the world feel dead. PvE combat in the game is no different from EQ, other than most low level mobs will not aggro you, some do run away for &quot;help&quot;. The different melee &quot;special&quot; abilities are no different from the discs in EQ, only you can use them more often at the cost of endurance.<br>
<br>
The fact that spell casters IMMEDIATELY get their spells; to me at least, loses the fantasy aspect of it. The life of a caster is hard in study and research before they can control arcane magicks dammit. They don't insta-learn Fireball! I also hate that if the person who buffed you dies, you lose all your buffs. Their concept of &quot;concentration&quot; I found to be a nice touch. It makes sense that a caster can only &quot;concentrate&quot; on a certain number of people and maintain their spells of buffage or whatnot and be unable to cast on too many people.<br>
<br>
And my favorite class, Bards... can't twist songs. I know that's a purely EQ thing, but I liked it. )<br>
<br>
I'm not sure that I want to keep it beyond the free month. With the recent changes in Chardok, I've been having lots of fun lately with Kathrea and some friends. Great exp in a zone that's fun to explore and requires teamwork.<br>
<br>
Basically I've not had the urge to exp grind on DAoC. I've not gotten beyond level 6, it just couldn't hold my interest.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say I liked Asheron's Call much more than I liked DAoC. I didn't like Anarchy Online at all. That thing was crap.<br>
<br>
I *might* try getting Asheron's Call + expansion... the epic sword there gives you a halo graphic that glows over your head. The Sword of Light. 12 damage, 0 delay (somethin' like that). Not the best weapon in the game, but I think that thing is spiffy. =) Too bad I'd have to start over.. that was my first 3D Online game, UO being my first online game.<br>
<br>
My opinion might be different if I leveled higher and experienced RvR combat... but so far it's just a pretty new world for me to explore and relax in. If you want a game that's less challenging than EQ, DAoC seems to have looked at EQ, and taken what people most people dislike of it, to try and construct a game that would cater to those specific individuals.<br>
<br>
I had high hopes for UO 2, but Electronic Arts is a bloated corporate machine that's devastated the creative talent of what used to be Origin with all their red tape and propaganda.<br>
<br>

Takes less than 2 hours to get to that level. You say its slow paced then say about the insane hp/mana regen, how is that slow paced?<br>
<br>
Once you get higher up, mana/hp is not so insanely fast either.<br>
<br>
Not sure how you say its less challenging than EQ, how is it any less challenging then sitting killing greens for hours waiting for named_mob_03 to spawn? AI is immensely smarter in DAoC the EQ, and pets actually follow your exact path too ;P<br>
<br>
Also, you lose your buffs when the person dies since they use the concentration skill, not mana, to maintain your buffs...kinda hard to keep concentrating when you are dead.<br>
<br>
Interface is kind of odd at first, but that is just because it is new to ya...its all second nature to me now, learning curve on the interface seems easier to learn to me then EQ did. Only thing I miss is the mouse look with the right mouse key.<br>
<br>
RvR is not really a zerg rush, well it is in the extent that you have to zerg rush the archer (since they are gods in RvR).<br>
<br>
It sucks that all the rogue classes (shadowblade, infiltrator and nightshade) blow. <br>
<br>
I got a new system recently and the game is not slow at all, and the quietness is Realm dependent pretty much...Midgard is awesome for getting groups and meeting people, real sense of camraderie there (and all seem to be ex-EQ players). Albion seems to be 'first character' realm in both to the game and mmorpgs in general. Hibernia is filled with lots of folks that are clueless about life in general in addition to the game.<br>
<br>
EQ is based off of old MUDS and they added all the annoying factors like binding, massive downtime, camps, etc., Camelot is built under a different philosophy in that its a game and should be enjoyable, not feel like a job.<br>
<br>
Besides, the way I see it, if I played camelot first, then EQ came out and I wanted to try it and had to put up with spending an hour looking for a bind, losing my corpse, screwed up tradeskills, massive exp loss for death, fighting over spawns, possibility of endless hours looking for a group in order to do anything, needing to dedicate a 4-5 hour period of time once I get into a group...I would never try EQ.<br>
<br>
UO is a waste since 'Lord British' left...I will never buy another Ultima based game again. Beta tested AC for awhile, I still think thats the worst online game out there with the exception of AO where you pay 10 bucks a month to play a single player game with no content.<br>
<br>
Camelot had my interest since I first heard about, has exceeding my expectations since its been out. I have absolutely no desire to even log on to EQ, let alone continuing to pay Sony for, in my opinion, an inferior product with poor customer service, poor AI, and the current 'Monty Haul' mentality.<br>
<br>
Ah well, gaming styles and choices are a personal decision, and I choose camelot over EQ. <br>

I would add that the quests/epics are thought differently of too. You dont need a group/groups but you need to think what you are asked to do, more like in Baldur's Gate than EQ.   <br>

I also hate that if the person who buffed you dies, you lose all your buffs. Their concept of &quot;concentration&quot; I found to be a nice touch. It makes sense that a caster can only &quot;concentrate&quot; on a certain number of people and maintain their spells of buffage or whatnot and be unable to cast on too many people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If you rather spend HOURS of killing one monster trying to get a spell to drop is more fantasy...go ahead<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I personally don't have time or intrest to waste hours trying to get that 'one' good spell each level which will make a difference if you get into group or not.<br>
