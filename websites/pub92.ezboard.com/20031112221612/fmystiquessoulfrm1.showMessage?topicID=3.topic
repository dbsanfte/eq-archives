After reading what Keril wrote I understand why he did it, and although it sucks there are some of those who were in the guild I'm glad I'm not guilded with anymore. Really only one person but who's counting. I'm undecided as to wether or not I want to go guildless or try to climb the food chain to a more stable guild. unfortunately mid 40's rangers and mid 50's druids aren't really high demand. If I do come back know that its not that i have settled on Ma for the sake of being guilded but because I want to be with you all. <br>

I am grateful and impressed that you would volunteer to take this on.  I am sorry if it seems as though people are not responding.  I believe most of us are still reeling from the shock of it all.  It is a bit much to take in.  My heart is MA and I would like to see us continue.  Please give it a little time.  Do not hesitate to contact me in the game. <p>Polaedra Galan <BR>

Even if Keril does come back and rebuilds the guild I think it wouldnt hurt to have a temporary guild so we can all keep in contact and network, and even function properly.  <br>

I feel you'll be a great leader. My initial post is based on that. Its after I thought about this some more that I decided that maybe I need more time to think. I spend probably 20 hours a week playing EQ, some weeks more some less. I also spend at least 2 hours a day monday to friday on the MA boards. This has tore me up pretty good, I'm mad and I'm confused. My anger isn't directed at anyone in particular. Keril felt that we had come to a point of no return. He obviously felt that we were not capable of being what we wanted to be. i could flame lots of people now but I won't. Its the fault of everyone who ever was late to anything, who failed to help when they said they would or who left the guild because they couldn't get more out of it. Its those assholes who left and flamed the living crap out of us all, even though they never hinted there was a problem except Candilli. Its my fault as much as anyones. I never condemned anyone for improper actions, as my family I have the right to let you all know what i feel is appropriate actions. There was no accountability from anyone until it was to late, then we all paid for the actions of more than a few but less than a majority. We paid because Keril loved us so much he couldn't reprimand anyone for anything they did wrong until finally he snapped. We are all to blame, but we are all faultless, Keril included. Maybe Keril is right, maybe we should all move along. But maybe he's wrong, maybe we just need a leader who isn't afraid to spank our ass if we're bad. We either need to do this right or not at all. The entire server always felt that MA was capable of great things but we were to social. Thats fine, but if people wanna do serious @#%$ they gotta be serious about. Say what ya will about BoW but they don't mess around when it comes to raids. Ya show up on time, ya stay as long as needed or ya don't go again til they say ya can. And i'm sure if it continues ya go join some pansy guild that can't kill all the dragons in veeshan's peak or wherever the hell they kill 7 dragons in 1 day. If you've never been to there site go. It shows ya what dedication to a goal can do in this game. Yes they are cocky, yes they think they own every spawn they deem worth killing. But until someone proves them wrong they are right. Ma should never be so dedicated that we lose sight of the fun. But we were so much fun we lost site of our goals. Unless we find a happy medium we will continue to lose good people who want what BoW has. We will continue to be a feeder guild for BoW, ToD, FC, SC, BotP, etc etc. IF all my guildies are gonna end up there anyways I'd rather go and beat the rush. But if you all want to do this and do it right then count me in. If ya want me as just another member thats fine. If ya want me as an officer thats cool to. Hell I'll even lead if ya think I can handle it. But if we do it we do it to fruition, no one joining thinking just a few more levels til I'm eligible for this guild, just need this one item for this key to join this guild. Join to stay or don't bother. We don't need that @#%$. I joined Ma to be with a friend who left EQ. I met over 100 friends that I love and respect. I'm either in for keeps or gonna bug out now if people aren't serious about this. I play EQ for the relationships, I can get the gear from ebay hehe. Just my 2cp<br>
<br>
<br>
Ps sorry for anyone offended by my rant. I love you all, even those who left and those who won't come back.<br>

This is crazy i had no idea. whats been going on with MA lately? I havnt been playing, due to school and my renewed interest in RL.  When i was playing alot it was due to the fact that i was going through some tough times with my girlfriend.  We would argue all the time, and EQ and especially MA was my escape... I Loved that =).  Me and my girlfriend broke up recently. Now I am concentrating more on my Punk band (the Tie me ups), and school (I get my associates this semester w00t $$).  Now there is a reason to go outside, make new friends, go on RL adventures with my band! But i have not forgetten my good friends in MA. I would be proud to follow you Galaron, where ever you go my friend.<br>
