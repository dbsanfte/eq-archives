So you have software to help recover?  There's major damage to the HDD so even with another HDD as my master and the messy one as the slave I can barely get access to anything (though .docs have been fine, it's the larger video things and programs that are a mess. :-/)   I'm  most upset about that and the fact that most of the programs I no longer have disks for (my father (grrr) kind of &quot;borrowed&quot; many of my nicer programs and neglected and now refuses to return them.  That includes my webpage editors and video/music creation software among other things.

Perhaps the computer guy was talking about something I dont know about but I find it highly, HIGHLY unlikely that the eq installer did something catastrophic to your computer.  It is much more likely that a directx8 issue arose, which may have caused some display problems.  Or your system ran out of resources and your hard drive wrote things in a bad area due to physical damage.  But these are both extremely unlikely events.  MUCH more likely a loose cable or loose memory or loose something caused intermmittent writing and thus damage.  In most cases, its best just to blame the last thing installed and get new hardware, like a new hard drive. (sorry to hear you are running windows ME, with regards to networking your computer to other computers its hoooooorible, but for just playing EQ you should be fine.) win98, IMHO is still the OS to aim for.  <br>
<br>
2. You should post somewhere what programs you need for what task.  I am sure that something can be done.<br>
<br>
3. Data retrieval from a 'damaged' hard drive is actually mostly luck.  I have access to some programs and people that can and do accomplish miracles on a regular basis.  There are two kinds of 'damage':  lost or misconfigured or badly mangled sectors AND phycial platter damage.<br>
<br>
The reason that larger files are damaged and smallers ones are not is because of the way that we store data these days.  Basically we store files as blocks.  Large files requiring lots of blocks.  Now you can take as many blocks as you need, but your system does not keep all the blocks in one place.  It places some here and some there.  Each OS decides which kind of 'block storage system' to use.<br>
<br>
WinFam uses a block system that is horribly out of date and makes little to no sense in our large hard drive, lots of RAM, lots of clock speed world.  OH it made a WORLD of sense back in the day, but our limitations and our needs are very different now.  Long story short, WinFam places these blocks of data in a variety of places with little tiny pointers to keep track of the blocks.  Some times the pointers get damaged and you can lose ALOT of data, some times you lose a area of blocks, and only those files that have blocks in that area get 'damaged.'<br>
<br>
So I'd be very interested to hear what the verdict was on what 'happened' to each of your hard drives.  Physical damage is BAD.  Like pack up your bags and go home bad.  Lost sectors or lost pointers is not so bad.  there are programs that can stiff out, based on common file types, blocks that may or may not belong together and jam them together for your review to see if they make sense.<br>
<br>
4. Whew I wrote alot there.  <br>
<br>
5. Finally, I do a lot of writing and trusting any one file system to keep things is a mistake I made once in my life.  Once.  Right now, zantoz.com is a back up for my files as well as a perma mail drop.  I highly recommend looking into some kind of off site back up for really critical files.  My files are flat text so I dont take up alot of room.  Also CDs burnt and then shipped to my parents is also a good idea.  Not everyone lives in the world that I do, but if you are getting to the point where your life's work is being digitally written or stored, then the time has come to think about getting serious about data storage.  Every system I own has at least two hard drives, except the laptop.  One hard drive is the OS and the system files for the games or programs I run.  The other hard drive is the data drive.  Its where I keep my wirten files or downloaded images (*cough*) or whatever interests me.  9 times out of 10 it is the system disk that goes bad first.  I have only lost one hard drives' worth of data but it was a costly mistake.<br>
<br>

<br>
yes, I think I did have a directx8 issue - for last couple of weeks - well ever since Luclin patches started, I've been booted from game maybe 5 or 6 times a night, and would get message:  eqgame has caused an error in eqgfx_dx8.dll file - I had installed directx8.1 and had updated my video driver, then last week I got message while playing EQ that eqgame had caused error in some display file and I was booted out of the game and puter shut down on its own - and after that I could not even get the puter to boot up at all.<br>
<br>
When my techie checked my hard drive, it showed that I had a lot of corrupted files.  Its now been defragged.<br>
<br>
For some reason, after I installed Win Me etc. and EQ to the new hard drive, EQ would not work at all.  I had been using a Nvidia GEforce 2 video card.  He experimented with diff cards, and finally got everything to work with a new Ati Radeon 7200 64 Meg AGP card.<br>
<br>
He also suggested that I have two hard drives, so I took his advice, and now have my business and personal data files on one drive - and my games on the other.  Also, I hear what you say about Win Me, but since I am not networked, hopefully will not be a prob for me.<br>
<br>
I also do as you do, having learned the hard way a couple of years ago when I lost all my data, and I use a CD back up system on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, you will be able to help Sash with her probs -  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5EB><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/usashahdreamspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sashah Dreamspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am, Batwoman! -Rwar</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#000000>(12/17/01 10:16:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/fmystiquessoulfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://Dreamspirit-studios.com/images/tica-hi04.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well, some thoughts</span><hr size=1> *nods*  Well, Gateway has the comp now, outfitted with a page and a half treatsie I did outlining what occured/was done, and emphasizing NOT TO REFORMATT THE DRIVE.    More than likely I'll simply need to save up for a DVD-RAM (writer) so I can save my gig + files.  I had one of the first, but it died ages ago, and though I don't have the $$ on hand now, it's something to take even more seriously now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
# of drives in Sashah's comp: 4<br>
<br>
Yes I'm serious. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Swapping is fuuuun.<br>
<br>
1.) 20 gig -system drive (programs, Win98b (I LOVE it!), and some random files.  &lt;--this is the one that went poof.<br>
<br>
2.) 60 gig -Animation modelling/rendered drive.   Screencaps of them, models, and blah.<br>
<br>
3.) 40 gig (?  or 60...) &quot;all that personal stuff&quot; drive.  If it's not yet on a disk somewhere, it's prolly here in duplication.  All my word files, important chats, stories, roleplays, EQ screen caps, and LOADS of other people's art to browse for inspiration as well as specific studies. <br>
<br>
4.) 60 gig -Films, music, and core art files I've done.  <br>
<br>
Even now I can't think which drive I'd rather this happened to... just sucks it took all my programs with it. ~_~   in 3-5 business days they said they'd call and tell me what the verdict is.  I'll keep you updated, hon. *HUG*<br>
<br>
And I'm so sorry to hear that, Nal. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   These sorts of things are horrid.. from all my experience though, having 2+ drives really helps.  I think of it like 2 record players: the one is always on (your system one, where windows and other often-accessed things are, like explorer, etc), and the other drives are &quot;optional,&quot; and therefore get worn a LOT less quickly.  So I try to even my own system out so only 2 are running at once.  If I'm doing art, it's usually 1 and 4 (I listen to music while I do), that sort of thing.   It also allows that when one goes down, you don't lose it all.  (If I had, I'd be in a mental hospital cryig right now... to lose ALL my art, films... writing... stories... chats... omg... that's beyond comprehension...).  <br>
<br>
When I get back, we can exchange stories. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I hope you saw my post of those photos in the members section, as I can't add captions and edit for awhile yet.   I'll try to get a listing of programs I have no disk for again... how depressing...<br>
<br>
If anyone wants to laugh, I edit with Dreamweaver (4?) and old fashioned HTML.  That's one of the programs I have no disk for (though I prolly have my serial # somewhere.  I was told they won't send me another disk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Zantoz:  Something you might appreciate... Fear me being on this old comp that uses only fat16 and networking it with a spare drive to expand into a 486. $$<br>
<br>
*HUG*  Well, I'll be trolling on and off over the next week, if you feel bored and/or want to chat, just poke me, I'm missing my comp bad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I miss all you guys, and I miss being able to sit at a DESK and type (I'm sitting on the floor now with the monitor on the case... lord help me...).<br>
<br>
