<br>
1. Stable governments are a result of.... Many factors, including: political maturity of the ruling class, a large ruling class (preferably as large as the adult population), widespread education and community involvement, and an identification by the ruled with the government. See Luttwak in Coup D'Etat.<br>
<br>
2. A staple crop, growable by primitive people, which is easy on the environment is.... non-existent. Any monoculture in agriculture does things to the environment. Part of agriculture is altering the environment to serve the grower's needs. Climate and region differences mean that there is no one perfect crop. Having said that, the new varieties of maize, rice and wheat can come close.<br>
<br>
3. The role of religion in a society is.... various, depending upon the society. Religion plays almost no role in some western european societies, many religions play significant roles in the USA, Catholicism plays a huge role in several modern countries. Some countries have a dominant religion that is largely apololitical. Others have strident minority/majority religions. Poland is a country were the Catholic Church played an open and overt role in the recent past. <br>
<br>
4. Corruption in a long standing government can be stopped by... political action by the ruled. It can only flourish by acquiesence on the part of the ruled. Think of the effect light has upon cockroaches.<br>
<br>
5. What caused the 'realization' at a social level, that men and women should 1. possess equal rights under the law, and 2. be equally respected as valued members of society. <br>
<br>
I am so tempted to smart off here. Education of women made it obvious to men that we are intelligent and mature enough to handle political roles. And to be fair, that was only possible once women stopped dying in child birth. In early european and american societies there was no point in going to the expense (and unless you were rich, it was very expensive) of educating someone who was likely going to die young. Once we stopped surviving childbirth, then it became an advantage to have a literate and numerate wife, someone who could mind the store and educate the children. Women's rights really do correlate to a great degree with reproductive rights.<br>

Stable governments are a result of....  I go with education on this one, not neccessarily HIGHER education, but education of the real, existing-education-level public.  This is why newspapers are: a) so hot on freedom of the press and b) written at about a 6th grade reading level. (if you look at some of the most unstable places in the world, their press--if there is any--is for the intellectual elite)<br>
<br>
2. A staple crop, growable by primitive people, which is easy on the envrionment is... name your carbohydrate here.<br>
<br>
3. The role of religion in a society is.... to teach morality and ethics which many people are unable to discuss at an intellectual or philosophical level even as adults.  Unfortunate side effect:  religion often causes people who would be capable of such philosophical discussions to discount those methods.<br>
<br>
4. Corruption in a long standing government can be stopped by... ooh tough one.  in many cases, a coup ersults in a new boss, pretty much the same as the old one . . . US intervention? (insert laugh track here)<br>
<br>
5. What caused the 'realization' at a social level, that men and women should 1. possess equal rights under the law, and 2. be equally respected as valued members of society.<br>
The proper question; &quot;why would it ever have not been so?&quot;  has pretty much been answered in Impatiens post  but i feel like ranting sooooo:<br>
 Way back in the day . . . a woman who was barren did what?  got educated, took up a profession.  Kings took concubines why?  to get heirs without killing the queen.  Regular men took multiple &quot;wives&quot; why?  Odds in his favor he would always have at least one left and get children too.  Even in societies that revered women, there was a concubine class which would bear the next generation because we're talking about dying young at like before 18 years old.  Aside from the monetary issues for treating women equally, the image of women in the eyes of men would grow to be that they were helpless and incapable -- they regularly died as children! (or what we now would consider children). and of course they would not have or seem to have as much care and love for their women, humans are generally smart enough that if you kick them enough times, not only do they learn to dodge it, they teach their children to dodge as well.<br>
 I think a great deal of the fallout from the days when mothers and children died in childbirth on a regular basis is still with us today.  Generations of socialization and training does not go away quickly.  <p><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="http://dreamspirit-studios.com/images/EQ-Tag-Heleth01.jpg" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=288 BORDER=0></p>
