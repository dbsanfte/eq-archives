Please be prepared to discuss everything listed here as many members have limited online time and we want to take care of as much as we can at the meeting.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to add your items, announce candidacy, propose charter clauses or rules in this thread but also be prepared to re-present anything you posted here in /gu at the meeting.<br>
<br>
I, as a former MA member, would like to put the following on the agenda:<br>
<br>
1) Vote :  will the former MA reform as Fate's Presence or create a new guild? <br>
        -- please note that the status of the original FP members must be entirely at THEIR disgression.  If the <br>
            former MA members choose to create something new and wonderful under the FP tag, all the original <br>
            FP members may stay.  This is NOT NEGOTIABLE.<br>
<br>
1a) Proposal :  if the former members of MA reform under a new tag, we should extend an invitation to any current or original FP member in recognition of thier help, support, and tolerance during this time.<br>
<br>
2) Call for leadership candidates <br>
       -- all candidates should prepare a short statement of platform so that members have something to base <br>
           a vote on.  Feel free to post that here as well.<br>
<br>
2a) Proposal :  we should hold elections AFTER items 3 and 4, below as those discussions may aid members in making a decision.<br>
<br>
3) Discussion of charter/proposal of clauses<br>
       -- if anyone has a copy of the MA charter, please post it here ASAP as I think that would greatly aid this <br>
           discussion.<br>
       -- if it is possible, please post your proposed clause ahead of time so that people can think about it <br>
           before it is presented at the meeting.<br>
<br>
4) Discussion/Proposal of guild rules/raid rules<br>
       -- if it is possible, please post your proposed rule ahead of time so that people can think about it <br>
           before it is presented at the meeting.<br>
<br>
5) Election of leadership<br>
<br>
5a)  Proposal : that the newly elected leadership will draw up a charter and rules based on the outcome of items 3 and 4 OR for items not explicity covered during the meeting, in the SPIRIT of those discussions and then post it in a location (to be determined) where all members may read it and comment on it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I know, it seems like a lot of work, but I think the more we can prepare for this meeting ahead of time the smoother it will go.<br>
<br>
I tried to format things above so that something like 1a is a proposal on my part that is related to or dependant on the outcome of 1.  Hope it isn't too confusing. <p><P><IMG SRC="http://wsphotofews.excite.com/031/IK/VX/oS/t042139.jpg" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=239 HEIGHT=179 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC, fantasy"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Heleth

<br>
I would add option 3 - Just move on and disband from each other.  Not my personal choice, but many are taking this option and thus its real.<br>
<br>
2) Call for leadership candidates <br>
<br>
Being leader is alot of work.  Dont do it unless you have 5-8 hours a week you can donate to the guild.  You wont get exp, you wont get loot.  Its hard work.<br>
<br>
**5a) Proposal : that the newly elected leadership will draw up a charter and rules based on the outcome of items 3 and 4 OR for items not explicity covered during the meeting, in the SPIRIT of those discussions and then post it in a location (to be determined) where all members may read it and comment on it.<br>
<br>
Public discourse and decision is clearly superior to other methods.  Many things that Keril was 'going to work on' never got done.  I think that a distribution of work is VERY needed here.<br>
<br>
I also would like to thank Heleth for working on this.  It should be noted that Heleth does not want to be leader or governess, she is simply doing to help ex-MAers in a hard time.<br>

Many guilds have two distinct roles in the officer board:  Leader and Administrator.  The Leader is just that, and in some guilds is an actual officer, but NOT the &quot;Guild Leader&quot; that has powers to appoint officers and disband the guild.<br>
<br>
I know Zantoz mentioned it, but after speaking with some others, I thought the title &quot;Administrator&quot; should be put forward.  ;)<br>

<br>
<br>
<p><br>
The Mystique Alliance (MA) is a guild of all races, classes, and religions in the hope that the guild, as our common bond, will strengthen our mutual understanding and further our common goals. Our primary goal is to explore Norrath fully, to learn the nature of all the places and entities in this world so that we may find the true path. The concepts of "good" and "evil" are often relative ones. Exploration and understanding of each may be necessary for us to properly understand each other and thus end conflict between peoples and within ourselves<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
We have no requirements on members other than that they be able to participate in the guild peacefully and help us pursue our goals. To that end, we must understand what it means to participate. First, we must protect the knowledge and experience we gather, thus we must protect the guild and its members. Race, class, PvP status, and religious beliefs are secondary to the protection of the knowledge we each hold as a part of our "reservoir of enlightenment." Thus, in The Mystique Alliance as in no other place, you may see a Paladin coming to the aid of a Shadow Knight, and vice versa. We must protect our brothers and sisters for we do not fully understand the role each of us may play in eventually unraveling the mysteries of Norrath.<br>
<br>
Similarly, senseless destruction and killing rob Norrath of knowledge. Once lost, we cannot know the contribution someone might have made to our enlightenment. Who knows? Maybe the key to understanding one of the mysteries of Norrath is carried by just one individual. If we allow indiscriminate destruction and killing we may have lost the path to enlightenment. Consequently, as members of The Mystique Alliance, we seek to aid those in trouble and share our knowledge with everyone. So, we will help when we can, and when feel that we can do so constructively. <br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
Finally, (out of character) The Mystique Alliance expects that its members will conduct themselves as "good citizens" in the context of an Online RPG. We will avoid foul language (since some take offense at such language and minors are playing), shun the use of "cheats," be prudent of our use of "broadcasts" (/ooc & /shout), and generally try to enhance everyone's enjoyment of the game, rather than seeking fun in disturbing others. We will also avoid selfish (even if legitimate) activity which interferes with others enjoyment of the game whenever possible (guard camping, quadkiting in crowded zones, etc).<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
Taking a moment to give a friend a rare find item for which they have been looking. Fighting back to back with people you trust. Leading a group of younger brothers and sisters to a new place and teaching them the ways of the place and how to fend for themselves. Bravely descending into dark depths of a dungeon to help a fallen comrade. Sharing a “virtual beer” with a buddy and discussing the mysteries of life while you prepare for the next battle. A lone warrior watching her life ebb away as she holds monsters at bay so her fleeing brothers and sisters may escape -- dying to save those she loves.<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
These are all commonplace events among MA Brothers and Sisters. To be a part of MA is to be a part of something special – something that is greater than the sum of its parts. To be a part of MA is to share your time, accomplishments and failures with others. Being a part of The Mystique Alliance is an honor that brings immeasurable benefits, but also carries responsibilities. This Charter is intended help MA member and prospective members understand both those benefits and the responsibilities that go with them. <br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
One of the most wonderful things about the MA family is that we can help each other learn to become better people while we share and play together. So, even as we lay out a Code of Conduct, know that Love, Compassion, and Kindness comprise the true Soul of the MA, and the framework that these ideas are hung upon. If your actions stem from these ideals then you are a rich person and you will enrich those around you. <br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
This is what is expected of a member of the MA. This way of life is not for everyone. Do you think that it suits you? Decide carefully.<br>

<p><br>
<br>
Rules and guidelines are very important in any large organization. However, life is very complicated and right and wrong are often a matter of perspective. Our Code is intended to give all our members a core idea of what kind of behavior we expect of them. They are intended to make our time together more fun and enriching than it <br>
<br>
would be in the absence of these guidelines.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
We will strive to never lose sight of the individual in any situation. However, our goal is <i>The Good of the Many</i>, or <i>The Greater Good</i>. In our quest for this ideal it is sometimes necessary to issue warnings and reprimands to guildmembers or even to remove them from the guild entirely to protect <i>The Greater Good</i> and the soul of MA. The Code is as follows:<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>Loyalty</b> - Members of MA are expected and required to be Loyal to their <br>
<br>
guildmates and guild ideals. One does not have to like every member of ones <br>
<br>
guild, every ideal, or every officer, but loyalty requires that you work as <br>
<br>
best you can within the group. If there are problems or differences of <br>
<br>
opinion, we will deal with them as a guild and accept the decisions of the <br>
<br>
guild.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>Responsibility</b> - Our members are expected to be responsible for their <br>
<br>
actions. Our officers have responsibilities to the members and to all of <br>
<br>
Norrath. The responsibility of each member is no less. Take time to help your <br>
<br>
guildmates. We each have our individual strengths and weaknesses. It is each <br>
<br>
members responsibility to share what is best about them, and your fellows <br>
<br>
will help teach you in areas where you are weakest. This has nothing to do <br>
<br>
with power or level. This has everything to do with making our guild greater <br>
<br>
and more wonderful than the sum of its entire fantastic people. <br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>Appreciation and Expectation</b> - One must not expect or rely on the <br>
<br>
guild to help them in most situations, or give them powerful items. Members <br>
<br>
must also not expect others in the guild to always come help them at any given time as that leads to frustration and anger in everyone involved. Becoming ultra-efficient and powerful is not what our guild is about. I can not say this strongly enough, as this seems to be an expectation of many new members. While your friends may help you when you most need it, or give a gift out of friendship and love, to expect such <br>
<br>
treatment is wrong. One cannot learn responsibility, or values, if all is <br>
<br>
given to them or if they regularly use others. This is not what we want our <br>
<br>
members to learn, or worse yet, to teach others. To succeed in a game such as <br>
<br>
this one has only to enjoy it, and it is even better if in your enjoyment, <br>
<br>
others have fun as well. This can be done at all levels of play, and what <br>
<br>
you do and who you do it with is far more important than what you are wearing <br>
<br>
or how powerful you are. This is easy to forget. Try not to.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>Assistance</b> - If an MA brother or sister dies and needs assistance with <br>
<br>
body recovery, anyone of an appropriate level and within reasonable proximity <br>
<br>
should come to help if they are at all available.  However, if you die, you must allow the guild time to respond.  People have gotten upset because they died multiple times trying to recover a body, even though help was on the way.  You must be patient.  If <br>
<br>
you do not have time to wait, leave the body and it will be there when more<br>
<br>
help can be organized or when next you come on. Remember, it is a member's <br>
<br>
responsibility to help their fellows, but expecting such help too much or <br>
<br>
too quickly is unrealistic and leads to unjustified bad feelings. Contact an officer directly if you need help arranging assistance.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>Passion</b> - While passion is not truly a required behavior, it does <br>
<br>
underly many a good deed.  If you see something wrong, fix it. If you think <br>
<br>
that there should be more newbie quests or guild events, organize one. If you <br>
<br>
would like to see changes or new policies, promote them. Use your passion; it <br>
<br>
is a wonderful part of who you are, and what you can share with your friends.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>Behaviour</b> - While no one can dictate your behavior in the game it is important to realize that what you do directly reflects on the guild. Anything you do that is perceived negatively by others can become a serious problem for the guild as a whole. It is also important to realize that your individual reputation is critical to your success in the game, and words of misdeeds or poor behavior spread quickly. It is also important to realize that people will assume everything you do is condoned by your guild. So play nice with everyone, even if they are being unpleasant to you. Generally behavior to be avoided is Profanity, Harassment, Kill Stealing, Training, Not Respecting Camps, Ninja Looting, not abiding by loot rules, general whining, leaving groups in anger, being greedy, lying, cheating. <br>

<h1>Mystique Alliance: Guild By-Laws</h1><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Guild By-Laws describe how the guild is run and lays down specific rules for specific situations. While the code above gives a general outline of what is expected it is clear that a number of issues need to be spelled more clearly. <br>
<br>
<p><br>

<b>1.0 Guild Organization</b><br>

<br>

<p><br>
<br>
<b>1.1 Guild Leader.</b> Every guild in Everquest must have a guild leader, <br>

the guild leader has the unique ability to promote players to guild <br>
<br>
officership, declare and end guildwars, and delete the guild. Furthermore in<br>
<br>
Mystique Alliance the guild leader has final say over all issues related to the<br>
<br>
guild. Should guild leadership change these by-laws are subject to change by <br>
<br>
the new guild leader. The current guild leader is Keril.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>1.2 Council of Advisors.</b> Each councilor has the implicit trust of the <br>
<br>
guild leader. The decision of a councilor is final. The current council of<br>
<br>
advisors consist of Bloodrive, Pitas, and Avezes. (not all councilors are officers, though currently they all are).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>1.3 Council of Officers.</b>Each officer is responsible for upholding the <br>
<br>
good name of the Guild and leading by example. Each officer is expected to <br>
<br>
organize regular events for members of the guild. Each officer is also responsible for arranging help for any guildmember in need. The current council of officers consist of Golaliel, Nitack, Meskr, Lysyndia/Catinan, and Wisperwind.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>1.4 Council of Generals.</b> Each general is responsible for the growth <br>
<br>
of the guild and leading major events (Planar and Dragon Raids, Epic Quest <br>
<br>
Encounters, New Zones). This includes attending raids with other guilds, increasing<br>
<br>
interguild cooperation, and in general just learning more about the game to<br>
<br>
help the members of the guild. The current council of generals consists of <br>
<br>
Blooddrive, Reghar and Dukie. (not all generals are officers, strange though that may sound).<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>2.0 Policies</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>2.1 Guild Policy on Camping</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
While Verant does not support "camps" in Everquest it is guild policy to both respect other people's camps, yet abide by the Play nice Policy (PnP). What does this mean? This means if another group is camping a location/spawn/item that you will respect that camp and move on. On the other hand if you have a camp and another party wishes to share the camp and invoke the PnP you will cooperate. Don't be bullied out of your camp, make a fair arrangement and stick to it. More than likely the other party will break the agreement and you can /petition them or they will get tired of the camp and move when they see they couldn't bully you out. <br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
These guidelines apply to all recognized (even if controversial) camps. This includes the Ancient Cyclops in Southern Ro, Hunter/Forager/Named Cycle in Trakanon's Teeth, Named Cycle in Frontier Mountains, etc. If there is a group working one of these semi-random spawn camps please cooperate with them or move on. <br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Conversely if you are working one of these camps and have a problem with someone interfereing or KSing the final spawn then handle the situation without being rude, profain or obnoxious. First of all, technically if you didn't get the first aggro then the other party committed no rule violation. If the offending party is not reasonable then take it to an officer in the guild who will attempt to deal with the individual(s) and their guild and escalate it to a public report if required. Making an ass of yourself will not help your case and will make you look less like a victim and more like a no good pharmer that deserves to get KSed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>2.2 Guild Policy on Kiting/Multi-Kiting</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Kiting typically requires a rather large area to work in. As far as the server community is concerned the kiter has lowest priority in any given area. So if a group sets up camp in the middle of an area you were quad kiting in then it is your responsibility to avoid them. Regardless of your kiting ability you should not kite mobs near other groups. If you have no other option in the area then communicate with the group(s) in the area, remain polite. The other groups may move their camp or give permission to kiting in their vicinity if they know you can handle it. Never kite in anger near other groups. In general do not kite in crowded areas, through common pull paths, etc. This may sound pretty harsh to the kiters, but its for everyone's own good that you try to abide by these guidelines.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.3 Guild Policy on Training</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Never, ever, train a mob on another person or group no matter what the provocation. Even if they did it 600 times to you that does not excuse the behavior. If you find yourselves frequently training unintentionally to zone then reconsider your strategy and plans. Especially if you are in a dungeon, frequent trains to zone can be very disruptive to any zoneline camps. Do not pull a large group of mobs to get at a named mob and leave the large group at the feet of other camps to deal with. You pull it, you deal with it.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.4.1 Guild Policy on Auctioning/Price Checks in Guildchat</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Do not offer items for sale in guildchat (if you are doing tradeskills you may offer your services in guildchat). Use the Trade Hall forum on http://pub45.ezboard.com/bmystiquealliance to sell items. You may query guild chat to see if anyone has an item, but do not repeat the query more than once per hour. If you are looking for a laundry list of items post it on the message boards. You may query guild chat ONCE for a price check on an item that drops for your group or are about to buy an item. If you want a Price Check out of curiosity or to sell an item you can check outside the game on numerous websites. With over 100 primary characters in the guild if everyone asked for every price check they were interested in it would get overwhelming. Use good judgement based on how much chat spam there is at any given time. If an officer gives you a warning, desist without question. Use good judgement, these rules aren't meant to be enforced strictly. If guildchat is busy then you shouldn't add to it period, if its quiet then the rules can be relaxed some.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.4.2 Guild Policy on Profanity</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Refrain from excessive use of profanity in guildchat and in the game in general. Try not to use langauge that most people would not use in front of their children or parents. Never let it get vulgar or outright abusive.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.4.2 Guild Policy on requesting aide in Guild Chat</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
You may ask once in guildchat for a teleport or ressurection exactly ONCE per hour. If you do not receive a response then request those service in direct tells to the appropriate players. If a player is completely Anonymous (not /roleplay) do not ask as that indicates they are not available even to guild members. If they are playing an alternate character do not ask them to log in their main to help you. If the player is in the planes or a dungeon do not ask. It is entirely possible that you could be in dire need of help and no one will be available. You must be prepared to deal with that. If you are unable to solicit help or it is truly an emergency (at risk of losing corpse, need help with bad corpse recovery, in death loop, etc) then talk to an available officer (again not much an officer can do if they are deep in dungeon or in a raid) who will then work on your behalf outside of these rules.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2.5 Guild Policy of Powerleveling</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
The guild will not powerlevel members. If members wish to arrange powerleveling amongst themselves then do so in private and not in guild chat. Do not request powerleveling in guildchat. Do not request powerleveling from guild members you do not know well. If you have particularly close friends within the guild that want to powerlevel you or your twink then keep the arrangement private. That is not guild buisness, that is an arrangement between close friends.<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>2.6 Guild Policy on Cheating</b> - Don't. MA members do not use Pathing Bugs, Duplication Bugs, or any other kind of cheat or exploit. (these can all get you banned from EQ in any case, a foolish risk).<br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>3.1 Loot Distribution</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Whenever you enter a group it is advisable to check what the looting rules are for the group so you don't get surprised. The default looting arrangements for Mystique Alliance are Need Before Greed as outlined below. If you are a group/raid leader this is the model you should follow.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
The idea behind Need Before Greed is that only those characters who can and WILL use an item may roll for it.  <br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
NEED: The item will immediately replace an item already being used by the character in attendance.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
GREED: Item is not needed by the character, will be used to sell or twink or whatever.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Disqualification. You are disqualified from a roll if you have already won an item of equal or lesser quality. (group/raid leader can make this determination, if its close you are disqualified... it should be clearly another level of item). Use common sense here, if a warrior wins a Kunzar cloak in KC then he should not be disqualified from rolling on Cobalt Gauntlets.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
<b>3.2 The selling of loot</b><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
If you won an item in any guild grouping or raid (majority of participants from Mystique Alliance) on any NEED basis then you should not sell that item. When you get a replacement item the old item should be given to someone else in guild who needs it, or donated to the treasury. The guild helped you get it, it is only fair they should benefit from it when you are done with it. The guildleader will make exemptions on a case by case basis.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
If you won an item in a non-guild grouping or raid on any NEED basis then you should not sell the item. Selling the item is a slap in the face (tm) to all those in attendance at the raid or grouping, especially those who would use the item. However if the item is later replaced you are free to do with it as you please. <br>
<br>
</p><br>
<br>
<p><br>
<br>
Since not all classes get loot in the same area you are encouraged to group and raid in areas where you do not need loot. Players showing a pattern of only attending events or groups that directly benefit them may not be invited on guild events and may be removed from the guild entirely. Remember helping others is a sure way to be able to get help yourself when you need it.<br>

<br>
I, as a former MA member, would like to put the following on the agenda:<br>
<br>
1) Vote : will the former MA reform as Fate's Presence or create a new guild? <br>
<br>
-I don't think the name is as much an issue to me as whether or not a guild forms at all.  At this point I really think it's worth a go.   We can ally ourselves with Imperium and other friend-guilds (even ones with former MA members! *gasp*) and try to build from the ground up. &lt;Sashah reminds the reader this is her OPINION, and to take it at that&gt;  I've seen great things and sad things come from those trying to achieve a mid-high lvl guild this way, but with the endless love and support I've seen here and all around, I can just see us DOING it.  At worst, the guilds we think of moving to aren't going anywhere, and we could always merge later on as a group.  I'd rather like to get to know you all even better, and this is the perfect opportunity. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I look at all Reign in Power, and smaller (as in less than 100) people do, and it just AMAZES me...  that's just how I see things now, and my resolve keeps growing day-by day.   Oh, and we could always use &lt;Slash Guild Remove&gt;  *snickers at Aladain*<br>
<br>
<br>
1a) Proposal : if the former members of MA reform under a new tag, we should extend an invitation to any current or original FP member in recognition of thier help, support, and tolerance during this time.<br>
<br>
Very much so, it's the least we can do, especially if a FP guild superstructure really wasn't in existance beforehand.  I'm just hoping the numbers are reasonable. *laughs*<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Call for leadership candidates <br>
-- all candidates should prepare a short statement of platform so that members have something to base <br>
a vote on. Feel free to post that here as well.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have opinion on how this is done?   I saw this website a few days ago:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.crimson-dragons.com/index3.html">www.crimson-dragons.com/index3.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  It's a guild on Fennin Ro, and I talked to a few members today when I created a temp character there.  OMG do they have their act together.  Look at their Officer structure!   While I don't think we'll have quite the numbers for that, I sincerely DO like the idea of more than just &quot;head of guild&quot; and &quot;members.&quot;  I'd be highly interested in keeping the website safe and sound in addition to some sort of leadership position.  I'm not aiming to say: &quot;OMG, lemme lead!&quot;  It jsut becomes a little frustrating after awhile offering so much, but having people go: &quot;no no, it's okay, we're fine.&quot; ~_^   COMMUNICATE, people!   Sure, I might be long-winded, at times, but I really think I have something to offer the guild aside from sig-images. ;-)  I'd like to think you guys get that impression too. *chuckles*  Dedication, or something weird. ~_^  I'll try to add a formal statement when it's not such an hour, and I see where matters stand on my being online Sunday.. drr that bites. :-/<br>
<br>
2a) Proposal : we should hold elections AFTER items 3 and 4, below as those discussions may aid members in making a decision.<br>
<br>
Sounds fine, but how are we doing elections?<br>
<br>
3) Discussion of charter/proposal of clauses<br>
-- if anyone has a copy of the MA charter, please post it here ASAP as I think that would greatly aid this <br>
discussion.<br>
-- if it is possible, please post your proposed clause ahead of time so that people can think about it <br>
before it is presented at the meeting.<br>
<br>
I'll get on that. *slaute*<br>
<br>
4) Discussion/Proposal of guild rules/raid rules<br>
-- if it is possible, please post your proposed rule ahead of time so that people can think about it <br>
before it is presented at the meeting.<br>
<br>
5) Election of leadership<br>
<br>
5a) Proposal : that the newly elected leadership will draw up a charter and rules based on the outcome of items 3 and 4 OR for items not explicity covered during the meeting, in the SPIRIT of those discussions and then post it in a location (to be determined) where all members may read it and comment on it.<br>
<br>
Well, I can help with the posting thing, I can prolly get a rough site up in the next days to aid things in a timely manner, assuming this is the direction we're going in.<br>
<br>
All from me for now. *nods and goes back to work*<br>

**EDIT:  oh, and i just checked that site ref'd by Sashah.  WOW.  Although I agree that pretty much everyone currently involved would have to be an officer of some sort to have a council that big, there are some FABULOUS ideas there, especially as it seems so few of us have tons of time to devote, but many of us are willing to contribute some time. **<br>

Although I have joined Tuvus, Bahala and a few others in creating Imperium Alliance, I would like to still help where I can.  To help promote this, I would like to guild Caladdare (my most played alt) in whatever guild most of you decided to stay with/create and act as both a liason between the guilds and help where I can.<br>
<br>
p.s. I will not be using the guild as a vehicle to boost up Cal and then deguild her.  I've got her set up pretty well on my own with Kik.  Anything else I add to her will most likely be gotten by Kik as well.  So, no worries on that front.  I know some might be leery about my comments above for this very reason.  I just want to reassure you it won't happen with me.<br>
