This is an EXCELLENT conversation piece article.  I will leave my opnions out at this time, but focus in on the '54 and lower' versus '56+' guild topic.  This is an important question for us as a guild too. <br>

Reply  To BOTP members and ex-members<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 This will be my first post since leaving BOTP and maybe alot of people will disregard it, but nonetheless, I wish to write.........<br>
<br>
First of all, I would like to say that it is saddening to see people's feelings get hurt over issues that could be resolved over clear communication lines. <br>
<br>
Before I or anyone else in Sacrosanct had left BOTP, there was a general feeling of discontentment from raids. This hinged upon the fact that many people of too low a level were allowed to go on raids that are designed for the higher level folks. What this does is slow the raids down considerably, or in some cases, stops them cold in their tracks with wipeouts, thereby wasting countless hours of people's time. <br>
<br>
Being an officer puts you in a no-win situation, or a win-win situation depending on how you handle the situation. BOTP in the past has not been guild where hard and firm decisions have been made, for fear of offending certain people, mostly those of lower levels, and this is where all the trouble begins. <br>
<br>
Many people play for various reasons, and for various amounts of times, for many reasons. However, the level 58-60 crowd has proven that they are committed to playing EQ for extended hours and for specific goals. To treat the 51-54 crowd exactly as the 55-60 crowd lends itself to trouble, and here's why:<br>
<br>
#1. On upper end raids the 51-54 level people will take a dis-proportionate amount of damage to AE's and DD's from the mobs you are attacking. They will not save VS. Fear near as well, and will add to the lag. LEVELS mean EVERYTHING to upper end encounters.<br>
<br>
#2. During these raids, the 55-60 players will continue to see the 51-54 players allowed to attend raids, and notice time and time again that the raids are slower, less efficient, and in some cases completely stopped cold. 24 level 55-60 can routinely do much more, than 48 51-54, or even 24 level 60's and 30 level 51-54. It is simply because when the lower level folk are there, even WITH all resist gear on, they will suck the mana from the clerics so fast doing heals and worse yet, rez's, it slows you down to a crawl.<br>
<br>
What now happens is a growing resentment from the upper end crowd (hence Trew viewing the younger folk as expecting higher end loot than they deserve for thier level, and on that I whole heartedly agree). <br>
<br>
Now, Trew screwed up, there's no question about it, but I can understand where she was coming from, even so, there is no excuse to treat Xerton in that matter....none.....period. <br>
<br>
Before I left BOTP, a few officers in the guild asked me what I think should be done to hold the guild together, now at that time I was too frustrated to even reply to that, but, if anyone is willing to read, this is what I WOULD have wrote even then.....<br>
<br>
BOTP needs to make a decision on whether they are going to cater to a level 55-60 crowd, or a 54 and under crowd. The leader and officers need to start making a HARD stance on this and enforce STRICT level requirements for attendance to raids, based on logical thinking of EQ mechanics. Those not of the sufficient levels should be encouraged to work thier asses off to attain a appropriate level to attain the aforementioned raids. <br>
<br>
The lower level folk need to understand that when the 55-60 crowd gets to rocking on equipment, that their old equipment will OFTEN be handed down and they will get upgrades to make them more efficient in their quest to garner experience. When your upper level folks get more and more outfitted, the loot upgrades will continue to fall down the ranks, making your guild stronger and stronger over all and furthermore, will allow the next wave of 55 people coming to join raids, get equipped more easily.<br>
<br>
BOTP also needs to take a long hard look at how they distribute loot. You want to reward people based on their contribution to the guild. Do they play often? Do they attend a majority of raids? Are they willing to help others when there is no loot in it for themselves? <br>
<br>
These are all hard questions that need to be answered and no matter what decisions you make, there will be someone who gets pissed off, deal with it, it happens you cannot please the whole guild. You MUST make a choice, steer your guild towards upper end encounters for your 55-60 crowd OR leave everything as is and watch your 58-60 crowd dissipate into other guilds. It's pretty simple really.<br>
<br>
In closing, I would like to say that the majority of us who left for Sacrosanct did so with a heavy heart, and much hurt. We tried for months to see changes take place but were shut down repeatedly, and even then we were VERY hesitant and nervous to strike out on our own. Fear of failure keeps many a person from reaching towards the stars, and if it wasn't for the strong bunch that helped support each other, Sacrosanct would never have formed. I post this wishing you well, and can only hope that you will get out of EQ what you are searching for.<br>
<br>
Fare thee well old guildmates.<br>
