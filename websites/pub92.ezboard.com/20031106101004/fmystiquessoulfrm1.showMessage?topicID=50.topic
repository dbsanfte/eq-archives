Let's start with me (Neom the wizard that's always on). Although I have a large amount of friends on the torv server, I have made some mistakes and burnt some bridges. I have in the past let a stupid game conjur the emotion of anger and have said things I have regretted. I have been suspended once for things I have said. I have also written an apology to Verant, the guild I was in at the time (MA), the person I had a incident with, and the Torv message board. I learn from my mistakes.<br>
<br>
Now let's backtrack a bit. I am a lvl 30 wizard (april 2001). I am guildless. I am bored. I like to help people. I have ten friends. We make a guild called Eye of the Reaper. We play games like drunken nekkid sewer racing. We give away prizes that seem valuable to levels 30 and under. We have lots of fun. We grow. No one in the guild is above level 35. We have lots of meetings and play games. I become a sort of role model for many young players. I ask a lady friend to become guild mistress (Carissamarie). For awhile all seems perfect. <br>
<br>
Then the tells start to come: I need a port. I need money. Help me I died somewhere in Timourous Deep. Your guildmate is Ksing my camp. Gimme &lt;insert phat lewt here&gt; or I am leaving the guild. Thanks for the officer position Neom but I am gonna start my own guild (taking 10 ppl from my guild to do so)....<br>
<br>
All this I am able to work with...for awhile...<br>
<br>
Then I start to have less patience...I ask a guildmate to not ks, and he ks'es..I ask a guildy not to beg, he continues to beg...After warning these members more than twice and they continue to cause problems, I remove these guildies from the guild. All is well again.<br>
<br>
First major Guild Drama hits...I have a disagreement with my guild mistress Carissamarie over guild rules. Its about level requirements. She wants lvl 10 I want 20. The argument gets into guildchat. The guild wonders whats going on. I try to compromise...level 15? She wants 10. She groups with her friends for a few days and is quiet. Then all of a sudden she leaves the guild, with 4 officers and about 6 other guildmates. I am shocked. Although I still have 50+ guildmates in EoTR, I am hurt. I send tells to some of the ppl I feel betrayed by, and attempt to hurt them. Very childish looking back on it. I have since apologized to every one of them, and still talk to all of them frequently. I con amiable now. Cari makes the Mystik Dragon Knights guild and moves on. <br>
<br>
I realize I am level 39. Only a couple others are too. I realize I am spending way too much of my playing time helping others and stressing out over guild bullshyte, and I'm not having fun. I begin to check out my options. I notice this Mystique Alliance guild always doing really cool stuff. I am interested. My interest in leading a guild dies. I talk to Lysyndia. She tells me about the guild and what to expect. I like what I hear. I talk to a loyal Eye of the Reaper member. I tell him I would like him to have the guild and let me move on. I know how he feels about the guild and that he can carry on it's spirit. He reluctantly accepts but understands my decision. I join Mystique Alliance. Eye of the Reaper loses a lot of people but eventually rebuilds.<br>
<br>
I join Mystique Alliance. I meet lots of new people and begin my new path in the game. I consider Lysyndia my officer/leader contact since she is very nice to me and fills me in on what I need to know about the guild. At level 39, I am too low for raids so I level up in Dreadlands. As I level I begin to witness some guild drama. Someone named Candilli is taking shots at someone named Angues. Angues leaves the guild. Backarus leaves too. Then Angues comes back. Backarus comes back. Enter Keril. This is the first time I have seen him on after being in the guild for a few weeks. He gets lots of praise as all good guild leaders do. He asks for any guildmembers that have anything they would like to talk about to come to Tox forest for a meeting of sorts. I go just to say hi. There seems to be some issues going on. I being new to the guild decide it is best not to intrude.<br>
<br>
Then Candilli leaves the guild. Landilli leaves the guild. Flames from hell ensue on the MA message board. <br>
About a month or two later that member password is changed.<br>
<br>
The guild has random raids. I attend a Kael raid. On this day I also have an altercation with two friends of mine, Belthamel and Morelin. It was really stupid how it started. But we argued and reverted to lil schoolgirls. Then we grew up and agreed this was stupid. And we all apologized. But not after making fools of eachother in guild chat. This is where I first meet Galaron. He is interested in what is going on. I tell him, and then tell him we have let it go. And Belthamel, Morelin and I become friends again.<br>
<br>
Time goes on...I am in Dreadlands. I am LFG. Someone I had an altercation with in the past (another wizzy) over a camp issue shouts in the zone for any groups not to group with me. I should keep quiet and let him say his peace but I dont. I send him bad words. Really bad words. I make my stupidist move yet in game. I am reported. Few days later I am in Eastern Wastes camping Rygorr Fort. I go LD. I attempt to log back in. I get a message saying I am suspended due to inappropriate behavior. I am suspended a week. It feels like a year. Reality hits. I find life without EQ kinda boring. Other games just dont cut it. I have a lot of time to think about my actions. I write apologies as named in first paragraph. I have been woken up.<br>
<br>
My suspension ends. I have lower self esteem because I do not have great communication with the officers/leaders of the guild and feel I am looked down upon for being suspended. I attend a CoM raid. I am in the 7th group. I feel useless. I am a high level raid virgin. I act stupid and leave MA. I regret it. I am gone for a week. Many MA members send me tells. I realize how many friends I made. I miss them. I read tons of boards and websites about high level raiding. I realize this is how it is in high level raiding. I feel like a doofus. I ask to come back to MA. I am reinvited and rewelcomed. I have a new appreciation for the guild, as well as respect.<br>
<br>
Enter Liladile. She is a level 40 Enchanter in the guild. She is very nice and likes to talk a lot. We hit it off and become friends. She wants to group together. I am now level 51. One day I get an idea of maybe going to the Hole to try and powerlevel her. I ask in guild chat if anyone wants to go. Enter Gruntas, Quedaan, Bahk and Okwam. We all go to hole. They dont know Liladile is only 40. Me being not a chanter does not realize she cannot mez anything in the zone. We go near the pit. We die. Gruntas, Que and Bahk (close friends I assume) wish to group elsewhere. I understand. Liladile feels bad. We try to go to Kael. Gruntas disbands. Invis drops enroute. Lots of mobs get on Liladile and I. I am lost. I panic. I gate, and I disband out of frustration. Liladile dies. I feel terrible.<br>
<br>
I get some guildies and come back. We rez her. All seems well.<br>
Except Gruntas (also known as Tuvus), has a bone to pick with me. He did not like the way I handled things. I understand and try to move on. The group is entirely frustrated at all gone wrong. <br>
<br>
The next day I check the boards. I read a new thread entitled &quot;How to be a GOOD wizard&quot; written by Tuvus. It is your basic do's and don'ts thread, stuff I already knew. But I knew this was a vent on me, and the way I handled situations in game. The thread turns into flames. Maybe I started it maybe I didnt, who knows. Bahala posts supporting Tuvus. I feel ganged up on over again stupid crap that I should just let go. I talk to Bahala. We argue over stupid crap. We later apologize to each other. Then Tuvus leaves the guild. Quedaan leaves the guild. Bahala leaves the guild. Possibly others left too. <br>
<br>
Liladile thinks this is all her fault.<br>
<br>
The day before Bahala leaves the guild, we have a guild event in Wakening Lands for us casters getting pheno focus. I am grouped with Keril. Keril is aware of the situation between Tuvus, Bahala and I. Never once does Keril ask me about it. Never once do I tell him about it. Keril and the guild help me get a pheno focus. Ironically my proudest day in the guild, shrouded in chaos. I now feel I may have added fuel to the fire. Whatever was going on with the guild I caused ten fold.<br>
<br>
I may have been one of the reasons Keril deleted the guild. And if this is true I am really sorry MA. I would have rather been booted then get in the way of a great great guild being deleted.<br>
<br>
I know how Keril feels. I've been there. I was in his shoes. Not quite as big of shoes but I was in them. All the stress of people leaving and petty arguments and wants and needs and crappa crappa crappa can make someone destroy what they have created. And that's what happened. <br>
<br>
Just another Rant...<br>
