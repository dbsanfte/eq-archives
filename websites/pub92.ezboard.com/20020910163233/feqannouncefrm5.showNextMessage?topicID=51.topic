POST A REPLY HERE - He'll check in from time to time.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>A bit of a background...  To get this approval I tried many different routes including emailing everyone I could think of at Sony, going to the developer's forum and posting.  None of these avenues appeared to have fruitioned to much.<br><br>Taking a gamble, I decided that I felt this didn't violate the spirit of the game and decided to release publicly -- unanonymously.  This was scary as hell for me.  As those of you who know me know -- I have like 8 lvl 50s characters -- a big loss to me were I to get banned.<br><br>I was then clued in by a friend who I have remained in dialogue with for some time now -- EQWatcher2001, who informed me that I might be in violation of Article 14 being the distributor and that since I wasn't anonymous, I could have already painted a red &quot;target me&quot; sign on my forehead.<br><br>As such, as many of you know - I immediately shut down the downloads, waiting for Sony/Verant to evaluate and give permission.<br><br>Then, out of the blue, I get an email one day.  This guy is firm about his company's stance, yet very nice about it all.  I still don't know what department he works in -- just that it has to something with legal and development and that it deals with &quot;this sort of stuff&quot;.  He had apparently seen the &quot;public announcement&quot; on one of the major EQ sites and decided to investigate.<br><br>After a few days I decided to ping him with an email and he said, I've been pretty busy as of late and haven't had time to look at it yet.  I'll see what I can do over the weekend.<br><br>/e says to self... Sony... Weekend... Me and my little program?  ya, right -- that'll be an act of god...<br><br>In what seemed like no time at all, I got the approval (as long as I put the right disclaimers in) and he has been nothing but helpful in cheering me on.<br><br>--<br>Thanks &quot;David&quot; - That's all the private info I'll give out -- lol!<br><br>--<br>Glimwin Nettlefoot aka EQAnnounce <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/ueqannounce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQAnnounce</A> at: 10/16/01 11:28:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/ucshae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cshae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(10/17/01 2:14:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HISTORY - AND THANK SONY / VERANT HERE</span><hr size=1> I am a new user of EQannounce, but I know already that it is going to be of huge assistance in keeping my groups buffed on time, in timing the room spawns etc.<br><br>I want to add my thanks to the person in Sony/Verant who took the time to evaluate this package and deem it was not in violation to the EULA, and give it approval. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/uhakov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hakov</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(10/26/01 11:48:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HISTORY - AND THANK SONY / VERANT HERE</span><hr size=1> Thanks David!

I don't understand SneakyAmp very well, but I did do a little bit of looking into it and I *think* it read memory, or &quot;wrappered&quot; DirectX.  One or the other.  Reading memory is a direct violation.  Wrappering DirectX is as well (keystrokes could be trapped, etc.)  If it didn't do either of these two things, quite frankly, I don't know why it was &quot;banned&quot; -- if in fact it even was.

In so doing Hotmail waxed all my historical emails including his address, but I feel I could get it (from a friend that I sent the email to ... actually EQWatcher) if he still has it.  If you really are still concerned and I can't get that email, I could probably track him down at Sony.  <br><br>But believe me -- do you really think I would be so stupid as to release a public utility were it not approved being &quot;not* anonymous?

Reading my original post a couple weeks after I wrote it, I can see where it might have come off a little...confrontational.  You didn't take it that way, however, and I'm glad, as that was not my intent.  <br><br>Being an 0|d5ch00| geek from the dawn of the internet age, I'm a firm believer in the maxim &quot;if something seems too good to be true, it probably is&quot;.  Which is why Verant's civility and co-operation with you seemed so far-fetched.  &quot;Reasonable&quot; and &quot;co-operative&quot; are historically not words most EQ players would associate with Verant.  <br><br>Incidentally, I did test out EQAnnounce on one of my machines that was not upgraded to the SoL expansion, and still had the no-connectivity-required EQ Interactive demo thingie.  I was quite impressed with the amount of info EQA gleans from the logs.  My only complaint about EQA, doesn't actually have anything to do with the software itself: I wish Microsoft had more voices. Specifically, more female voices. What geek wouldn't want to get all those reports from Jeri Ryan or Cameron Diaz?  <br><br>I'm still leery of using the program on a live connection/account, but I hope your continuing communiques with Verant go well.<br><br>BTW, you wouldn't happen to know where I could download additional voices for MS Speech, would you?<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Aahzmandius<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=35.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=35.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.threadControl?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub92.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqannouncefrm2">Announcements<option value="eqannouncefrm5">General<option value="eqannouncefrm4">Wish List<option value="eqannouncefrm3">Support<option value="eqannouncefrm6">Bug Reports<option value="eqannouncefrm1">Developer Chat<option value="eqannouncefrm7">Documentation<option value="eqannouncefrm8">Friends</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/beqannounce>EQAnnounce</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/feqannouncefrm5>General</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://pub92.ezboard.com/beqannounce">EQAnnounce Message Boards</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script --><div align="center"><script language="javascript"> document.write(adbottom); </script></div><!-- End BOTTOM AD Script --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
