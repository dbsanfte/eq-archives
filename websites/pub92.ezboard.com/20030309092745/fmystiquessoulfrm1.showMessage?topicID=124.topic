<br>
I am running a PIII with 256 ram and have upgraded to DirectX 8.1 and have upgraded my Nvidia GEForce 2 driver.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any suggestions?  Faim did suggest I go to the castersrealm.com site and look into modifying my system.ini file, but as a puter dummy, I dont want to start fiddling with my system files, Faim.<br>

I sent EQ tech support an email, and received the following reply:<br>
<br>
We are currently aware of the Installation and Technical problems that <br>
are occurring with the new Shadows of Luclin expansion and the update to<br>
the existing EverQuest game client. Listed below are some fixes for most<br>
of the installation and technical problems. If you are still having<br>
problems, after following all of these steps, please refer to the bottom<br>
of the page, where it has detailed instructions on the files that we<br>
require to further troubleshoot your problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Direct X and Video Card driver information.<br>
<br>
Due to the upgrade of the existing game client, EverQuest now requires <br>
that you have Direct X 8.1 installed. This is REQUIRED to be installed <br>
or you will not be able to run the EverQuest game client. You may<br>
download Direct X 8.1 from the following link:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp">www.microsoft.com/directx...efault.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This download is for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating systems.<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that Windows 95 does not support Direct X 8.1, we can no<br>
longer offer support for the Windows 95 system.  In order to play<br>
EverQuest, Windows 95 users will need to upgrade their operating system<br>
to Windows 98 or greater.<br>
<br>
<br>
EverQuest also requires the latest video card drivers for your system. <br>
Please visit the following link for the list of drivers specific to your<br>
card:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/compatability_matrix.jsp">everquest.station.sony.co...matrix.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
The cards listed there are the only video cards supported by EverQuest.<br>
Any cards not listed there have not been tested and we can not offer<br>
support for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Hold old is your hard drive?  One of the problems I was having on my primary system was lag spikes due to the system being very pissed about trying to get files it needed to display some stuff I was looking at.<br>
<br>
2. I am getting random black screens.  not blank, not white, not blue, black.  Pure black, mostly when I zone.  <br>
<br>
3. I used to get the eqgame.dll error.<br>
<br>
My thoughts.<br>
<br>
Error<br>
1. I upgraded my hard drive to a 8.3ms IBM 6.1GB.  My PC is smooth as a gravy sandwich now.<br>
<br>
Error<br>
2. This is a problem with the eqclietn. This eqclient is Fubared.  We are paying Verant to beta test the crap they shipped so that it would be in the stores by christmas.  I cannot express how this angers me.<br>
<br>
Error<br>
3. I no longer do.  I have no idea why.  Because I bought a new hard drive for the system files and the eqclient files, I reinstalled Windows98 and copied over the eqclient folder.  Eq works fine now but for Error2.<br>
<br>
/soapbox on<br>
<br>
This is beyond words the darkest days of eq.  why?  Because now we have Gordon and alan and other telling us that the team is working entirely on optimization of cool looking crap that I have turned off.  Why have I turned it off?  Because I want a game I can play, smoothly and cleanly and not choke on the rod of mighty good looks.  I'd rather have a good relationship with an ugly under tooled person than a shitty relationship with a real beauty with a goooood looks.  My opinion is that most people are like this.  In the end, we will turn off your good looking models because we have systems that arent right down the hall, given to us free by Falcon in exchange for advertising and in short, not geek gods with hordes of money and T3's out the arse.  Verant has really really really let me down on this issue and its getting worse.  Its only going to get worse.<br>
<br>
That said, its a great game and I will keep playing it cause frankly 1. I have too much invested in it, and 2. nothing else on the market comes close.  NOTHING.  Camelot is a playground for PvP junkies venting some small unit issues. Ultima, oh PUHLEASE!  Verant marketers and biz bev people should remember the lesson of AO.  yea it looks cool, but cool looks aint content, Cool looks aint no subsitute for connecting to the server and not lagging so badly you think you are about three wine bottles too drunk.....<br>
<br>
/soapbox off<br>
<br>
In short, Turn off the models, see what happens.  What kind of processor are you running?  Can you reinstall windows?  I would burn a CD of your EQclientfiles or just reinstall everything and upgrade the HD whilst your pants are down.<br>
<br>

It doesn't matter where you put it that, but your system.ini file probably already has  [386Enh] heading, so, I'd just tuck it in as the first line under that heading.<br>

<br>
Nov 30th post copied from castersrealm:<br>
<br>
Hardware TnL is now automatically disabled for all items including flora on low end video cards. To force it to disable on other cards insert UseTnL=FALSE in your eqclient.ini.<br>
<br>
Note: Some people have emailed in saying this fixes  a lot of general graphic problems.  If you do not know for certain that your graphics card supports hardware T&amp;L then you should insert this line into your eqclient.ini file if experiencing problems with the new directx8 dll (this will be live on Tuesday).<br>
<br>
<br>
Question:  how can I tell if my graphics card supports hardware T&amp;L - I have a NVidia GEForce2 card which I have updated<br>
<br>
Is my card considered a low end video card?  Should I disable this Hardware TnL, as suggested above?  My problem seems to be in my EQGFX_DX8.DLL file - as stated in my first post under this thread<br>
