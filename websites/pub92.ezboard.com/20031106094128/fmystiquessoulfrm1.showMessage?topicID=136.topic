Okay, here are the next series of questions, some based on the answers given:<br>
<br>
1. Education of the masses helps how?  The teaching o logic?  Informed people are more likely to buy into the government's view?<br>
<br>
2. If you could add one or two 'attributes' or 'side-benefits' to a staple crop, say rice, what would it/they be?  For example, flouride or iodine....<br>
<br>
3. Is a monotheistic or polytheistic religion better for a stable government?<br>
<br>
4. History has shown that when a council is given absolute power over its people, that the members of the council tend to infight until there is a single dictator.  What can work against this trend?<br>
<br>
5. Is the recognition of the State required for a woman to have reproductive 'rights' or can she not have at her hands a non-self-lethal means of abortion or conception halting?  Does the State need to take a stance on the right of the woman to do such a thing to herself or can not the actions of the woman 'assert her rights?'<br>
<br>
6. If reproductive rights are needed to balance out the rights of men and women, what are the factors which 'allow' this to happen?  Is it simple technology or understanding of the internal nature of women's bodies or???<br>
<br>
7. Given the 'nature' of women, more collaborative, multi-signal processing, more gathering and community based versus male, single focus, competition, more hunting and pack based, would not the woman archtype, described here, be a 'better' leader for a higher technology world?  Why do we have so very few examples of 'success' stories of cultures and countries recognizing this?  What could have changed this?  Handguns?  Some religious or social tool?<br>

<br>
1. Education of the masses helps how? The teaching o logic? Informed people are more likely to buy into the government's view?<br>
<br>
It helps and hinders. An informed populace is an absolute requirement for democracy to flourish, but an informed populace does not guarantee that the governement will be democratic. And education does not equal informed. The Commies spent a lot of time and effort seeing to it that their population was educated (better workers, more skills and easier to propagandize if literate and numerate), but uninformed of the truth. Singapore is a good example of a well educated, well informed totalitarian state. Cuba is a good example of a well educated, uninformed totalitarian state.<br>
<br>
2. If you could add one or two 'attributes' or 'side-benefits' to a staple crop, say rice, what would it/they be? For example, flouride or iodine.... Main benefit is of course calories with enough nutrients to stave off deficiency diseases. Potatoes, for example, have vitamin C.<br>
<br>
3. Is a monotheistic or polytheistic religion better for a stable government? The nature of the religion is irrelevant for governmental stability. Pakistan is monotheistic but unstable. India is polytheistic and fairly stable. China is atheistic (although one can argue that communism is the state religion) and reasonably stable. Ireland is monotheistic and stable.<br>
<br>
4. History has shown that when a council is given absolute power over its people, that the members of the council tend to infight until there is a single dictator. What can work against this trend? The trend works both ways. What doesn't last is stability. The ony certain thing is change.<br>
<br>
5. Is the recognition of the State required for a woman to have reproductive 'rights' or can she not have at her hands a non-self-lethal means of abortion or conception halting? Does the State need to take a stance on the right of the woman to do such a thing to herself or can not the actions of the woman 'assert her rights?'<br>
<br>
I'm a nominalist, so to me the morality of a thing generally precedes the legality of it. For example, the law may be totally silent as to how a woman's spouse is chosen. If the society's mores say that the woman chooses her mate, then that is a reproductive right. If her parent's choose her spouse for her, then things are different. This governs the more efficientn and more important right of not starting conception. In terms of abortion rights, I can argue both sides well, but I wind up getting upset, so I won't<br>
<br>
6. If reproductive rights are needed to balance out the rights of men and women, what are the factors which 'allow' this to happen? Is it simple technology or understanding of the internal nature of women's bodies or???<br>
<br>
We can have babies. Well, I can't anymore. Men can not. One man can father a village, one woman can at best (worst) have ten+ children. The sexes are not equal. No amount of pretending can make them so. What is going in our society is a dialogue about how technology has allowed the roles, privileges and rights of the sexes to change. Both sexes have a great deal more choices these days than in years past.<br>
<br>
7.

- 'the only certain thing is change.' yes, but how can we funnel or channel that need for change away from a formative government.

<br>
Sure, and religion can be subversive as well. The Romans, who were pretty tolerant religiously, saw Christianity as deeply subversive for several centuries. As humans we crave political stability, we are deeply conservative and religion tends to feed into that. I've thought for years that the commies practice an atheistic religion. It sounds contradictory, but its a dogma and belief system that underpin the structure of their states. My answer is the nature of the religion is irrelevant to the nature of the state, what is relevant is how well it is incorporated into the society. A stable society requires a shared belief system. A good secular modern example of this is Sweden, where it is very difficult to tell the political parties apart. They differ only as ro degree, not as to what issues are important.<br>
<br>
4. History has shown that when a council is given absolute power over its people, that the members of the council tend to infight until there is a single dictator. What can work against this trend? <br>

The price of bread was stable for 500years...... <br>
<br>
Umm, no it wasn't you know, famine and surplus was and is a constant cycle in this world. human needs are pretty stable. We all want food, water and health. Once we have those things then the divergence begins in our desires. I haven't a clue as to what a perfect society may look like.<br>
<br>
5. Is the recognition of the State required for a woman to have reproductive 'rights' or can she not have at her hands a non-self-lethal means of abortion or conception halting? Does the State need to take a stance on the right of the woman to do such a thing to herself or can not the actions of the woman 'assert her rights?'<br>

<br>
6. If reproductive rights are needed to balance out the rights of men and women, what are the factors which 'allow' this to happen? Is it simple technology or understanding of the internal nature of women's bodies or???<br>
We can have babies. Well, I can't anymore. Men can not. One man can father a village, one woman can at best (worst) have ten+ children. The sexes are not equal. No amount of pretending can make them so. What is going in our society is a dialogue about how technology has allowed the roles, privileges and rights of the sexes to change.

-What gives those sexes those choices? Wealth? Over population? NO longer the need to populate a village for survival? What if we could reduce child mortality at an earlier stage in social evolution, what affect would that have?<br>
<br>
A lot of our choices come from better medicine (technology) and a better understanding of how reproduction works (education). Both of these do result from greater wealth. Even without the pill or condom use, many primitive societies successfully regulated population growth with marriage customs. many societies require the prospective husband be of certain wealth to marry, with the result that the groom's tend to be older, sometimes a lot older than their brides.<br>
<br>
I have some ideas about what would happen if we could reduce infant mortality, say for example, in 1600, but they're of course speculative, so I'll leave them out.<br>
<br>
7. Given the 'nature' of women, more collaborative, multi-signal processing, more gathering and community based versus male, single focus, competition, more hunting and pack based, would not the woman archtype, described here, be a 'better' leader for a higher technology world? Why do we have so very few examples of 'success' stories of cultures and countries recognizing this? What could have changed this? Handguns? Some religious or social tool?<br>

-Men DO have their uses, getting things done NOW. I was wondering if you could look at my question again from a leadership or ruling body perspective.<br>
<br>
Well, from a ruling perspective, you need them both. Maggie Thatcher, Inidra Ghandi and Golda Meier showed that women can be effective war leaders. Ghandi, Gorbachev and Mandela showed that men can be great peacemakers. In terms of leadership, the sex of the person is irrelevant, it's the individual's qualities that matter. In terms of followers, both sexes have their share of sheep.<br>

&quot;Is the recognition of the State required for a woman to have reproductive 'rights' or can she not have at her hands a non-self-lethal means of abortion or conception halting?&quot;<br>
<br>
I object to and challenge the notion that abortion rights and reproductive rights are the same.  Reproductive rights would include:<br>
<br>
1)  choosing your own mate<br>
2)  choosing whether or not to conceive a child<br>
3)  being allowed to carry a pregnancy to term without governmental interference (you are too old or have too many children, etc.)<br>
<br>
A woman should have the right to avoid undesired pregnancy.  Do we forget that given the opportunity to choose ones mate (ie. not rape, etc.) pregnancy is 100% avoidable?  Choices are made.  However, once a woman is pregnant, it is reasonable to argue that we are no longer simply discussing her rights over own body.  It is argueable that we are then talking about two human beings, not one, and while you may disagree with this view, you cannot prove otherwise.<br>

Back. When a society respects a woman's right to choose her reproductive options, then the battle is largely won. Having said that, as an older woman, I really don't have a problem with parents controlling their children's reproductive activities. In other words, I think father should meet their daughters dates and set curfews and other restrictions, until the daughter is an adult. It is such a good idea. I was an idiot at age 14, and if it hadn't been for very strict parents who set limits, something bad may very well have happened. <p><img src="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/criminal/elizabethbathory.jpg" title="I am Elizabeth Bathory."><br \><a href="http://squirming.net/meme/tests/criminal/">Which Evil Criminal are <i>You</i>?</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E6CC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/udarryntorv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darryn Torv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Honored Guest</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#000000>(1/14/02 11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub92.ezboard.com/fmystiquessoulfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=136.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Social engineering Part Deux</span><hr size=1> 1. Education of the masses helps how? The teaching o logic? Informed people are more likely to buy into the government's view?<br>
<br>
- Education of the masses is a double edged sword. It helps a 'free' society by partially alleviating ignorance, sexism, racism. Allows for a more 'informed' public to elect more suitable leaders. Sparks creativity and invention which benefits the society (i.e. the State). <br>
<br>
On the flip side, people always believe that they are more intelligent than they really are, that they are informed and wise enough to make just and rational decisions. This allows for the State to manipulate and deceive the masses in more indirect and subtle ways which is more effective then saying I will burn your crops or kill your family. There are better ways to motivate then fear. Boils down to the old adage that a person is smart, people are stupid. <br>
<br>
2. If you could add one or two 'attributes' or 'side-benefits' to a staple crop, say rice, what would it/they be? For example, flouride or iodine....<br>
<br>
- Potassium Nitrate AKA Saltpeter. Typically poor agricultural areas have too great a population to sustain an adequate diet for all that live there, hence most of them starve. By reducing the rate of childbirths you would increase the amount of food per person. Granted most of the above is not to be taken seriously but the issue remains of too many people for the food supply. A couple vitamins thrown in to the malnourished won't stop the problem, but perhaps take it longer for them too starve. In the words of the late Sam Kinison, 'Move! Move to where the food is'.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Is a monotheistic or polytheistic religion better for a stable government?<br>
<br>
- Moot question, the number of religions is irrelevant compared to WHICH religions. A government with Lutherans and Baptists would be much more stable than one made up of a Jewish/Muslim one.<br>
<br>
4. History has shown that when a council is given absolute power over its people, that the members of the council tend to infight until there is a single dictator. What can work against this trend?<br>
<br>
-Checks and Balances. Never let one council have absolute power. There will always be corruption and infighting, but when a 3rd party can preside over another, it will be reduced. I am still amazed at how wise our forefathers were.<br>
<br>
5. Is the recognition of the State required for a woman to have reproductive 'rights' or can she not have at her hands a non-self-lethal means of abortion or conception halting? Does the State need to take a stance on the right of the woman to do such a thing to herself or can not the actions of the woman 'assert her rights?'<br>
<br>
- Ideally abortion rights would only involve the immediate family and their decision on what to do. However, whatever they do ultimately effects the State both directly and indirectly through shopping habits of a 'family' unit vs. individual, population increases, taxation, if the child or family will then need to be supported by the State....<br>
<br>
6. If reproductive rights are needed to balance out the rights of men and women, what are the factors which 'allow' this to happen? Is it simple technology or understanding of the internal nature of women's bodies or???<br>
<br>
- Disagree with the premise of the question. We all have equal rights, well on paper anyway. Reproductive rights are too much of an apple/oranges arguement.<br>
<br>
7. Given the 'nature' of women, more collaborative, multi-signal processing, more gathering and community based versus male, single focus, competition, more hunting and pack based, would not the woman archtype, described here, be a 'better' leader for a higher technology world? Why do we have so very few examples of 'success' stories of cultures and countries recognizing this? What could have changed this? Handguns? Some religious or social tool?<br>
<br>
- Based upon the assumption of your skillsets, we find so few examples of 'success' because women are not treated with the same amount of respect as men, by men. We have 'always' (using that term very loosely) a male dominated society. Men respect men in leadership roles, men are reluctant to accept women in those same roles. They will fall under more scrutinization than any man in any comparable role.<br>
<br>
This will take more time to change then a few decades of women having 'equal' rights. And we will probably stay as such up until the time of a complete dissolution of the family unit (which may or may not occur and is beyond the scope of this response <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

<br>
Already we have seen a shift from tribe to clan to family to nuclear family to single parent.<br>
<br>
So in essence, as people of the past would define it, the family has already begun to 'dissolve'.<br>
<br>
That said, I think that we are currently in a time of 'sound byte' and 'keyword' over substance.<br>
<br>
That is to say, our mental training has been shaped by commercial breaks and a visual and audio medium.  CNN and TV in general can easily be pointed to as radical shapers of how problems are looked at and issues thought about. <br>
<br>
'Mr. President, you have 3 minutes to discuss world peace.'  Umm what mongo could express how world peace would look like in 3 minutes?  No one.  So we listen for keywords that make us happy or we identify with.  We don't read the entire article.  We don't read the book.  We watch the debate and cheer and nod when our 'man' uses the right words.  Or worse, makes the OTHER guy look dumb versus answering the question.  Serious issues has been reduced to a sitcom.<br>
<br>
I spoke about that because 'a return to family values' will be meaningless to say to the majority of people in this country.  But I think that looking at daycare costs, healthcare costs, costs of living, costs of moving, costs of seperate cars, costs of whatever, I wonder when people will get the idea that living together is cheaper and has the net positive effect. <br>
<br>
We lead lives of increasing seperation and isolation from our community, our family and even ourselves. And I believe this is a trend that will/has peaked and will flow back the other way.<br>
<br>
So, no, I don't think that the dissolution is good.  But things may get alot 'worse' then they are now.  I don't know.<br>

<br>
This world is now a connected world. Family members are just a phonecall, email, or instant message away.<br>
<br>
The ease of communication now available to us gives a false sense of security and closeness.<br>
<br>
Also playing into things are media, social activities, transportation, and economics.<br>
<br>
Through the internet, through media, and by having social activities occurring more frequently outside the home, and beyond parental guidance and/or awareness, our youth are at once more exposed to independant experiences, as well as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> allowed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> be</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> independant at an earlier age than their parents.<br>
<br>
Television and movies especially open the eyes of our youth to a much larger view of life's complexities than previously experienced by ourselves. Love, hate, joy, pain, suffering. All of this is fed into their minds both consciously and unconsciously. This results in their having a foundation to build on when they are confronted with similar experiences in their own lives.<br>
<br>
Which means in a sense, they are more &quot;knowledgeable&quot; about how life, or at least, have a very good idea how social interactions work. They may not feel the need to consult their parents concerning particular experiences due to having seen it played out in so many different scenarios in the media. As a result, they are &quot;maturing&quot; at a more rapid pace, and unfortunately, they are maturing in a less parentally guided environment as well.<br>
<br>
In metropolitan areas, even traffic plays a role in the family structure. A mother or father may not be getting home in time to make/attend dinner. Or they may be late in arriving, which results in the forgoing of a home-cooked meal, and ordering take-out or prepared meals. Thus, family members may not always eat together, which may also reduce in the sharing of each other's daily activities. This then results in less bonding, and widens the distance between family members, essentially opening the door for each member to have their own activities outside the family.<br>
<br>
Of course, all of this is just generalization. I just wanted to point out that times are changing, social mentality, social morals, and social beliefs are changing, and it's affecting all of us.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say that the family unit is being dissolved. But the dynamics of a family are without a doubt, changing. I believe that families need to do things together more often, but with children having such a wide range of activities, more places to do them at, as well as being able to reach those places and activities more easily, as well as having to schedule things around time, traffic, and what-not.. it definitely doesn't make it easy for parents to accomplish.<br>
<br>
By the time kids realize they should be spending more time with their parents, and be more close to their parents... it's often late in the game, and the gap by then is large.. and will take quite some effort to deal with.<br>
