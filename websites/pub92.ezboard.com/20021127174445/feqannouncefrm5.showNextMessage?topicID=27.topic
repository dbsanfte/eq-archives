I have received a total of 2 emails from him and have had a phone conversation with him so far...<br>
<br>
For those who don't want to read the whole thing, here is how things stand.<br>
<br>
1) He still needs to review it.<br>
<br>
My guess is: as it doesn't do things that it obviously shouldn't do, it is very grey at the moment.  Because of this, it doesn't really rank high on the priority list for evaluation.  He'll get to it when he can.<br>
<br>
2) His findings will then have to go to &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;SIT&quot; whoever they are.<br>
<br>
3) They will most likely make a final decision.<br>
<br>
Now, on to the emails for you nosey buggers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The First Email</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (name and personal information withheld for his privacy)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I am interested in knowing exactly how your program is designed to interface with the game engine, as it relates to item 14 &amp; server and or client manipulation. Please send me a copy of the program along with all documentation ASAP.<br>
<br>
Your prompt response is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  My response</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <br>
Sorry - I just checked my email. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the reply! <br>
<br>
I sent a message to the developer's forum giving them instructions about it as well. Downloads were ceased sometime last week as someone clued me in that it might be in violation of article 14. They are still available (this email and the one sent to the developer's forum are the only public statements as to it's location) at (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://"></a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  URL withheld for obvious reasons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) - if that doesn't work let me know. <br>
<br>
On to what it does... <br>
<br>
It does nothing more than monitor the NOTES.TXT file, and currently active (charname)_log.txt file.  It runs while the game runs. <br>
<br>
It looks for commands in the NOTES.TXT file instructing it to do certain things, such as start a timer.   When the timer expires - it &quot;speaks&quot; (using the text-to-speech engine) that the timer is about to fire. <br>
<br>
It also, will &quot;watch&quot; for a keyword that the user defines such as &quot;blue diamond&quot; and say something like &quot;blue diamond has been spotted&quot; if the user were in say an auction zone. <br>
<br>
It will (very buggily I might add) total up the damage one does to a mob and say that total along with a damage per second calculation upon killing a mob (watching the log once again). <br>
<br>
All of these things, require the user to tell it to &quot;do&quot; via /note commands. <br>
<br>
The only point of interface that my software has with EverQuest is: <br>
<br>
a) reading of NOTES.TXT <br>
<br>
b) reading of LOG.TXT <br>
<br>
c) logging to disk (mirroring the log file) the line where a keyword shows up. <br>
<br>
d) logging &quot;debug&quot; activity of EVERY item I do. - if you need to, that would be a good flow analysis -- watch the debug log. <br>
<br>
e) It uses the microsoft text-to-speech engine to convert the messages to be spoken to the user to a .wav file, which it then uses directsound (no i don't tap into some client based sound handle) to then play that &quot;spoken&quot; .wav file. <br>
<br>
If you would like the source -- let me know and I'll send it to you.  It was written in VB.  The only reason I would think you might want to see it would be too look for malicious stuff, but I can do that too if you would like. <br>
<br>
A good comparisoon might be to take my source, compile it then do a fc /b against the distro.exe to ensure that no hanky panky was going on before you got my emails. <br>
<br>
Do reply - look forward to talking to you.  If I do have to shut down distribution of the software, maybe I can help with some ideas for the client at least. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Phone Conversation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After sending the email I got to thinking maybe he was fake.  I decided to call him and verify that he was indeed from Sony and not someone trying to spoof me into getting a copy.  We discussed briefly what it did, and more specifically what it did not do (sniff packets, keystroke/mouse automation or recording, or hex/memory hacking to any degree).  He said he would look into it.  -- Nice guy imho.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Second Email</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Since I hadn't heard from him in a few days, I decided to just see where things were.  Here is my email and his reply.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <br>
<br>
  Just thought I'd drop you a line and see how it was coming evaluating it.<br>
<br>
Am I far from getting permission to distribute?  Am getting tons of emails.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And his reply...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <br>
Sorry,<br>
<br>
I have been really busy. At the moment I haven't even had time to use your program to evaluate it. I am hoping I will have personal time this weekend to play and I will try it out then. Did you know that the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 is a rather hefty download, weighing in at just over 68 meg? Does your software require that the user have this installed? Becuase I wouldn't think that the average joe would have a huge software developers kit installed on their system already, and would have to download and install the big sucker. :P<br>
<br>
At any rate, as I said... HOPEFULLY, I will be able to check it out this weekend and give a copy of my findings to legal as well as SIT, and see where it goes from there.<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I replied that I knew this was a requirement.  <br>
<br>
That's where it all stands at the moment.<br>
