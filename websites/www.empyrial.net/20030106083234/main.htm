<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Check out the Forums new topic layout.
I've deleted a few of the ones that were not seeing any posts and consolidated
others to try and get it to a point where there weren't so many topics that you
couldn't find what you looking for. I've also added a couple that could be very
useful if people decide to use them. The first is a RAID!!! topic where you can
announce up and coming RAIDs!!!. Hehe. The second is the Bazaar Advice topic.
This is a place where you can look for help on making MONEY! I have high hopes
that both of these topics will become THE place to visit often because I believe
that ALL of us want to do more RAIDS and make more money. As in voting, post
today and post often and lets have some fun.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;This web page is an attempt to recreate the very cool
    web site that we had before. My personal goal for this website is to try and
    recreate the the old website with a simplified structure. (Given my website
    development experience, &quot;Simple&quot; is the best we can hope for.) By
    simplified, I mean that they main page will be basic link and news site only.
    All&nbsp; of the important elements like member lists, forums, event
    calendars and what-nots, will all being hosted&nbsp; third party services
    like bboard, guildmagic(This one may take a bit to get up). This way, just so long as there is an internet, at
least parts of the EL web
    site will be there for your amusement. Unfortunately, the old web site is
down and it looks like it is for good. I'll try and talk to the old administrator
and see if we can recover some of the old data but for now we'll have to accept
that fact that we're going to have to start over. With a bit of planning though,
we won't have to deal with this type of disaster again in the future.</p>
