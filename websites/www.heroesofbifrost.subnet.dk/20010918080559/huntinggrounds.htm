Again it has been some very exciting times since my last update. The heroes are now larger and more powerful than ever. We have had a lot of additions to our ranks, and all has proven to be worthy heroes. Take a minute all to read the message board and the tales of Heroes working together, overcoming obstacles outsiders deemed impossible. We are truly all great players.<br><br>
The average hero is now 30+´in level, and it is time to update the huntinggrounds to reflect this new situation.<br><br>
We seen to have players on the distinct levels: a group af people ranging from 15 to 23; a large amount of players from 29 to 35; and almost an even number of players 40 or 41.<br><br>
The first group are autonomous in the sense that i will not point out a specific area to accomodate these people, since most are very stationary in this level, and all have their own idea of what area is the best. I will however encourage all our members to support and powerlevel the lowbies as often as possible, since it will do us all a greater good in the end.<br><br>
Second group seems to already have found eachother, and has these past weeks been a very solid and active group in the area around Frontier Mountains. To break the monotomy of doing giant all the time, and to suit their need for larger prey, we will as a test, try out the dungeon Kaesora in the coming weekend (01-19 to 01-21). We will bring in our highlevels to support untill we have a more certain sense of the lay of the land. Kaesora should be adequate for a while. If not, then I suggest doing the Firiona Vie wilderness, where the Drolwargs are numerous and the xp is plentyfull.<br><br>
Our highlevel brethern will start out helping in Kaesora. After this I still feel that City of Mist has a lot to offer, and I belive that we will do well here at least untill level 45. At this point I hope we all have upgraded our weaponry, and we might consider doing something about our armor. For armor upgrades, no place (except the planes) are better than Karnors Castle, which we should be able to survive at lvl. 45. Come lvl. 49 and the HoB enters the planes...<br><br>
Hope to see most of you.<br><br>

First of all, it has been some very exciting times since my last update. It all began when our glorious HoB surprisingly to us all was wiped by Verant in their "no guilds with less than 10 people" swipe of the servers.<br><br>
This of course lead to immediate reaction from our fearless leader, who after a lot of emailing, finally succeeded in getting the guild recreated. <br><br>
To avoid being wiped again in the next server sweep, we have begun an unusually active recruitment, which have included most of the older members, plus a number of newcomers, with whom I have confidence we will take the HoB to new heights.<br><br>
This influx of new members also have the consequence that we now longer are one homogenous group of characters at approximately the same level. Therefore I will alter the format for the huntinggrounds a little to reflect the greater variation in levels.<br><br>
From now on I will probably elect a certain area as huntinggrounds, instead of a more specific dungeon.<br><br>
The place to be the coming week or two will be in Kunark. I have had a long list of requests to move the HG to Kunark, since our experience shows that the frequency of Pking in Kunark is minuscule compared to Antonika proper.<br><br>
That being said, the HG will be Frontier Mountains in Kunark. FM are rated 25 to 40, where 25 is an absolute minimum, and only capable of zonepulling. However FM borders to Lake of Ill Omen (1 to 40), where all characters between 20 and 27 should be doing Sarnak castle or goblin ruins - tons and tons of mobs, and the chance of getting very nice rare items.<br><br>
FM also contains two dungeons for those of us that might not want to hunt in the open. These are the Mines of Nurga (25 - 45) and the Temple of Droga (35 to 45). These two wil suit the great mass of HoB's that are in their 30s.<br><br>
For a nice change we can take a stroll in the neighbouring forest of the Dreadlands (35 to 50) or Burning woods (35 to 55). Finally its sort of close to both the good city of Firiona Vie, and the evil city of The Overthere.<br><br>
As always there are no obligations to participate, but if you want to have an improved chance to meet-n-greet with your fellow HoB's (and maybe score a descent item or two from your friends vault), Frontier Mountains and the surroundings will be the place to go the coming weeks.<br><br>
Hope to see most of you.<br><br>
