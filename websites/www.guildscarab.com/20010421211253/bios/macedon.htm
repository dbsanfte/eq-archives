His father was a fisherman and his mother was a local schoolteacher.  He lived the typical childhood and was on his way to living a normal life like his parents.  They taught important things like to be kind to his fellow man and that love and caring for the world and all that is good is the most important thing to having a peaceful world.<br><br>	All this was fine till the day the orcs from the fort south of cove stormed the town of cove in full force.  The entire town was destroyed and only a handful of the inhabitants escaped.  Macedon, only a teenager forced by his father to flee during the battle, grabbed his sword and ran as far as he could.  From a distance he was able to see the flames of his burning village rising and heard the cries of his mother and father as they we consumed by the horrors.  Macedon was left with nothing, nothing but hate for everything including the world that allowed this to happen.  He wandered the forests trying to decide what would be the better life: living the life as a brigand and living a life of pleasure at the expense of other or to perhaps try to start a life like his fathers.<br><br>The time came for him to decide when he witnessed the death of a man in a blue robe and grey cloak.  Minutes later the resurrected body of this man came by and introduced himself as Elbereth of Scarab.  Macedon has choice to make.  Run with the dead mans belongings,thereby starting the life of the brigand, or handing the items to Elbereth and continue wandering as the poor man with no armor except the clothes he was wearing.  Macedon made the right choice, the noble choice.  Elbereth invited him to meet members of his guild.  Macedon was impressed with their codes and ideals and gave him great hope for the future.  He joined them and there they helped teach him the arts of combat, magic, and being a leader and a doer of good deeds in the world.  Macedon once again had a family he loved.<br><br>He was living a great life in this world with his guild but everything changed for him, horrible events occurred in this world leading to the disbanding of his guild.  Losing his family once again crushed Macedon.  He wandered the world once again but knew the path of light was the only path he knew he should follow.  He traveled the world becoming a scholar, learning all that he could about everything.  In his studies and philosophizing he came to several realizations:<br><br>1. Great knowledge and a well-trained mind have as much power to shape the world as physical power.  The combination of these is an unstoppable union.<br>2. The preservation of tranquility and peace in the world is the only way for all people to advance themselves as beings.  War and fighting only leads to destruction although it is necessary at times to preserve existing peace.<br><br>The preservation of peace and pursuit of knowledge became Macedon's reason for living in this world.  As soon as he thought he knew all that he could of his world he was torn out of this plane of existence and thrown into another.  This new world he existed in was the land of Norrath.  He was completely confused at the fact that he could not figure out what happened and how and why he had this new existence.  As he was about curse the world for removing him from a place where he was comfortable he decided to seek out someone who could explain things such as planar shifting and such.  He sought out the famous enchanter guild master Kinool Golsinger.  He gave vague explanations to Macedon about these occurrences and motivated him to seek out to study and explain all the mysterious magics that exist in the world.  He told him somewhere in the world there might be some kind of enchanted item that can take him back to his old world and many others.  Here he adopted the name Macedon Planeshifter.<br><br>At this same time he began to hear about members of his guild Scarab were also alive in this new world.  Macedon made it his new motivation to continue to bring peace and tranquility to the world through the advancement of knowledge and the magic of enchanting he possessed.  This combined with the shared knowledge and power of his fellow guildmates are great enough to make Scarab a great force to be reckoned with.<br><br>Macedon has served his guild as an Inner Circle member, Assistant Guildmaster, and Counselor.  He enjoys sitting by the water fishing while discussing ideas and philosophy or debating topics.  He also has a great fascination with creating enchanted items such as jewelry and weapons.  All he hopes for is that one day the world can become a peaceful place and live under the codes that define him and his guild.  He is extremely happy that he is with his family again but also realized that even if they were not to be in the same world they would still be together in mind and spirit!</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
