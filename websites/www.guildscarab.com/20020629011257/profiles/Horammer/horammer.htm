<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><B>Skills:</B></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>Dinaden is master of many combat skills, and it particularly adept at 2
      handed slashing and dodging. A master blacksmith, Dinaden has now largely
      abandoned his family’s occupation (but more on that later). A veteran of
      the pub as well as the field of battle, Dinaden always runs to the nearest
      source of Honey mead and makes sure to max out the essential skill of
      alcohol tolerance to celebrate the acquisition of each successive level of
      experience. He has recently tried his hand at archery, the brewing of fine
      beers, and binding the wounds of injured adventurers, but he has far to go
      on these paths before he will reach an acceptably high level of expertise.<BR><BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><B>Appearance,
      mannerisms, equipment:</B></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>Dinaden is in many ways a typical barbarian in appearance--tall, muscular,
      long hair braided in the back; yet he also has a quiet grace about his
      movements, and a relatively neat appearance that hints at a past rooted in
      pursuits other than brawling and barbarous culture. Dinaden’s hair is
      not as light as many of his Northern brothers, nor as wild and unkempt. He
      has a neatly trimmed goatee and a simple hair braid that he keeps tucked
      up in his helm most of the time. Although he enjoys the rough company of
      the road and the tavern, Dinaden is suspiciously vain about his hair for a
      barbarian, constantly adjusting it after every battle and maintaining its
      jet black shine with oils and potions gathered in his wide travels across
      Norrath.<BR><BR>Dinaden is a couple inches shorter than the average barbarian and quite a
      bit more nimble (or at least he likes to think so). Even so, Dinaden
      towers over most of the other smaller adventurers he comes across, and
      finds many human and elven merchants rather apprehensive of his large size
      (although this fear is somewhat ameliorated by his fame as a monster
      slayer and all around nice guy). In his early adventuring days, Dinaden
      favored a leather kilt and traditional polar bear cap in the manner of his
      homeland, the Northlands, but has now come around to the necessity of
      placing skillfully wrought pieces of steel (go go Crafted armor) between
      him and the harsh world we call Norrath. From an early age, Dinaden was
      exposed to a wide variety of jewelry in the shamanistic style so prevalent
      in the Northlands, and since his wide journeys in the last few years,
      Dinaden has gained an appreciation for the various gold and silver
      trinkets of the various peoples of Norrath, and is regularly seen wearing
      both bone and string necklaces interspersed with goblin teeth as well as
      simple onyx ear studs and, of late, a short, intricate necklace of silver
      adorned with a single, glowing black pearl.<BR><BR>Throughout his adventuring days, Dinaden has favored axes, though also
      acknowledges the keen efficiency of a decent sword, as introduced to him
      by Caedyien, a gruff but generous dwarf who gave him his first sword, a 2
      handed blade that was sized for barbarians. His first weapon was a small,
      rusty old battle-axe, which the young Dinaden affectionately cared for
      until finding the rather clumsy axes of the Minotaurs. After these, he
      turned to the 2 handed sword Caedyien had given him, a weapon of the
      finest steel. Soon after, Dinaden took to the road with the skillfully
      wrought and rather shiny golden colored halberd, given him on his
      induction into Lord Hrothgoomba’s Knights of the Crimson Poodle, an
      order of men who had done service to Hrothgoomba. Presently, Dinaden’s
      beloved Langesaxe of the Wolves, given him as reward for tracking down the
      infamous criminal Paglan, splits swing time with his Silvery 2 handed War
      Axe, which he is quite attached to and is currently pondering an
      appropriate moniker (maybe &quot;Gobbo,&quot; since it came from Perma
      Gobs).<BR><BR>In the recent past, Dinaden has taken several day long layovers in
      Freeport or Rivervale, bolstered by the essential honey mead, and has been
      seen to participate in decidedly un-barbarian activities such as reading
      the Freeport City News as well as scholarly treatises on the latest
      magical and scientific research being conducted in Felwithe and Erudin.
      Although he comprehends little of the complex mathematics involved, a
      natural curiosity intrigues Dinaden into the inner workings of the
      Universe. Some younger adventuring friends speculate that Dinaden is
      growing tired of the harsh life of adventuring and, having accumulated
      enough wealth to retire on, is showing signs of slowing down, maybe
      retiring in another year or two. Dinaden vehemently denies such rumors,
      claiming &quot;I’m gonna chop till I drop,&quot; which, while being a
      rather trite barbarian cliché, is also probably true.<BR><BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><B>Life History,
      Short Version:</B></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>The Gahalantine family has been a family of craftsmen and artisans for as
      many generations as anyone in the Northlands can remember. When Dinaden
      was but a lad of 10, Dinaden’s parents left Halas to travel Norrath in
      hopes of bettering the family business. In recent years, Halas had become
      glutted with young smiths, and Bandin, Dinaden’s father, stubbornly made
      up his mind that business would improve in lands less cluttered with
      fellow smiths. For the next few years, the Gahalantine’s traveled to all
      parts of Antonica, selling their high quality wears and generally enjoying
      life.<BR><BR>When Dinaden was 19 and Bandin was advanced in years, Dinaden struck out
      on his own, traveling Norrath and selling his own version of the
      family’s heritage. One day, riding upon the path on his trusty horse
      Ni(!), he happened upon a man lying broken and bleeding at the side of the
      road. Dinaden jumped off Ni to see if anything could be done to save the
      man’s life. Seeing Dinaden’s approach, the man gestured weakly toward
      his throat. Horrified, Dinaden saw that the man’s throat had been torn
      and slashed by some vicious beast. The man’s breath came ragged and
      shallow, and blood was steadily streaming out of his many wounds. Dinaden
      desperately dove into his backpack, dug out an armor buffing cloth, and
      pressed it to the man’s throat. Miraculously, the bleeding soon subsided
      and the man drifted off to unconsciousness, breathing somewhat easier.<BR><BR>After nursing the man back to health, the man introduced himself as
      Betrand. Betrand was an adventurer, a man who traveled the world seeking
      fame and fortune through his wits and his sword. Dinaden was entranced by
      Betrand’s stories of adventure, beautiful maidens, and gold coins
      spilling like water out of an overflowing purse. After restoring Betrand
      to full health and repairing his armor, Dinaden bid Betrand a wistful
      farewell, as Betrand had grown restless and sought to return to his
      wanderings. Dinaden now considered which way his life would lead. The once
      sturdy market for Dinaden’s banded armor had, truth to tell, dried up,
      and so Dinaden decided that day that he, like Betrand, would take up sword
      and travel Norrath to seek his fortune.<BR><BR>The next day, having forgot to purchase a weapon, Dinaden strode eagerly
      away from the familiar gates of Freeport and promptly got lost. Fifteen
      minutes after this, he was attacked by a skeleton. Somehow, Dinaden was
      not surprised by this, for was this not what &quot;adventuring&quot; was
      all about? Luckily for Dinaden, he was carrying his smithing hammer, which
      he thought he would skillfully used to smash the skeleton to pieces. The
      skeleton had other ideas. Attacking soundlessly, the skeleton leaped upon
      Dinaden with surprising speed. Out of the corner of his eye, Dinaden saw
      the glint of a weapon, then - agony. The skeleton had swung the axe
      directly into the right side of Dinaden’s head. Screaming with fury,
      Dinaden proceeded to smash the skel to pieces with his smithing hammer. If
      Dinaden had been thinking clearly at the time, he would have reflected
      that he should have done this initially and skipped in intervening step of
      combat. However, at the time, Dinaden was not thinking clearly but rather
      bleeding profusely. He managed to stagger back to Freeport, where a kindly
      passing cleric healed his wounds. Dinaden bought an eyepatch. The
      shopkeeper was rather insulted as Dinaden slammed down the coins in
      payment and broke the display case, but wisely he said nothing but
      &quot;um, thank you, come again.&quot;<BR><BR>Since those early days, Dinaden has traveled the length and breadth of
      Norrath, from Erudin to Felwithe, From Permafrost to Cazic Thule. He met
      many fine friends, and joined the band of adventurers known as the Norrath
      War College. Sadly, due to the incessant squabbling of the NWC leadership,
      the NWC permanently parted ways, and Dinaden was once again on his own.
      After a banquet honoring the famous paladin Cloudx Mistwraever at Highkeep
      one night, (to which Dinaden was invited on account of his being
      &quot;friends&quot; with Princess Lenya) Dinaden met a cleric named Ozwyn.
      Impressed by Ozwyn’s knowledge of healing and the local political scene,
      Dinaden soon fought at Ozwyn’s side at the behest of the Lord of
      Highkeep, who admonished all willing adventurers to &quot;clean out those
      damned pickclaw goblins once and for all from my cellar.&quot; In Ozwyn,
      Dinaden found a new friend, and one day, after a particularly nasty
      battle, Dinaden noticed the tattoo that Ozwyn sported. Explaining that it
      was a mark of his band of adventurers, Scarab, Ozwyn described Scarab to
      Dinaden. Dinaden had heard of Scarab, and knew of their honorable
      reputation. Dinaden thought them a likely group with which he could share
      his future journeys.<BR><BR>Soon after, Dinaden met Borgu, a bard of Scarab. Borgu sang of Scarab’s
      exploits and code of honor, and Dinaden was impressed, for not every
      adventurer Dinaden had met had bothered to look at Norrath and their place
      in it in such an honest and vituous manner. Dinaden if he might join the
      Scarabs in their adventures, and was told to seek out Jayfoot, a reclusive
      halfling. Traveling to Rivervale, Dinaden found Jayfoot and asked of
      joining Scarab. Jayfoot was impressed by Dinaden’s appearance, but he
      knew that a fine appearance could hide an evil or immature nature.
      Stroking his chin, Jayfoot suggested seeking out other members of Scarab.
      Dinaden did so, meeting Lord Hawke and his wife LadyHawke and many other
      Scarab members, first in the frenzied battle against the pickclaw hordes
      in the cellar of Highkeep, and later at a more relaxed yet enthusiastic
      Scarab party in the Ocean of Tears. And so, Dinaden’s story goes on to
      today as he seeks the open road, fine adventures, and stout companions to
      share them with.</FONT></P><BR></FONT></FONT>
