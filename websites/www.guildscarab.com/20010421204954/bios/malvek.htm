      <p>Malvek stood before the chessboard, Screaming Mace in hand, panting for
      air and bleeding from several spots. He hefted his gray shield and counted
      his wounds. It seemed that no matter how many of these undead pawns he
      smashed to bits, another would come to takes its place. Some would say it
      was a futile effort. Malvek generally didn't listen to such talk. Evil was
      evil. Marshalling up his energy, the large barbarian called forth to the
      winds and the soil to grant him mana for a spell. As his arms wove the
      invisible sigils taught to him by his Shaman teachers, he thought back to
      when it all began.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">*****</font></b></p>
      <p>It was a particularly warm day in the high barren mountain peaks that
      young Malvek called home. The children of Halas were playing in the
      streets flinging snowballs at one another and slaying pretend polar bears
      with icicle swords. Most of those who had reached the proper age were
      already being placed into guilds so some of the revelers wore the tunics
      given to them by their masters. Malvek had just recently been introduced
      to the head of the Halas warrior guild though he was still a season from
      joining officially. Despite that, his family was quite proud that their
      young son would turn out to be a warrior (his older sister had discovered
      a knack for sewing which dismayed the long time warrior clan). </p>
      <p>Malvek gave a killing blow to his first wooly mammoth and watched as it
      fell alongside the mountain of other imaginary creatures at his feet. As
      he peered about at the pretend carnage, he was struck from behind. The
      force was not great, but the shock sent him sprawling. The pale skinned
      boy (he had not yet earned his tattoos) now lay face first in the snow,
      the wet slush of a snowball melting down the back of his head. The
      laughter that reached his quickly reddening ears could only come from one
      boy, Tilset. Tilset had always been a little bigger, a little stronger,
      and a lot more arrogant. Being a season older he had begun his guild
      training just after the first snows. Now there he stood, laughing at
      Malvek's predicament. </p>
      <p>&quot;Hey Mal, you think they'll let ye into the Wolves?&quot; laughed
      Tilset, &quot;You better take up sewing like yer sister!&quot; </p>
      <p>Malvek's face reddened and he clutched at the snow beneath his clenched
      hands. Quickly he sprung up and with a fierce bellow hurled the snowball
      at his long time rival. Tilset unfortunately was further away than Malvek
      had judged. The snowball arced through the air and softly struck the snow
      a few feet in front Tilset who doubled over in laughter. </p>
      <p>&quot;Will ye even be able to hold a sword with that arm, Malvek?&quot;
      He barely was able to get the words out through his guffaws. </p>
      <p>This burned the young warrior-to-be more than ever. For years he had
      been on the sharp end of this prickly, arrogant youth's barbs. He grabbed
      another fist full of snow and prepared himself to not miss this time. He
      pictured Tilset laid out on his back, his face covered in frosty justice. </p>
      <p>With another great yell he threw, his anger surging into his hands. As
      the sphere of snow and ice left his hand it flew much faster than Malvek
      had thought it would. In a heartbeat the icy missile sped forward in such
      a great rush that Malvek himself looked on in disbelief. By the time a
      second heartbeat could be counted, the packed snow flew straight into the
      face of the laughing Tilset and sent him sprawling. </p>
      <p>All the children in the area stopped their make believe battles and
      looked on in wonder. Malvek approached the prone boy (who was most
      certainly unconscious) and looked down at him. Tilset's face was frosted
      white as if he'd been out hunting with his family for too long in the
      cold. </p>
      <p>&quot;MALVEK&quot;, yelled an elder's voice from behind him. Quickly
      Malvek stood up and began to protest. He had not gotten out his first
      syllable before being cautioned to stay quiet. The woman who approached
      him was Cyndl from Mac's Kilts. &quot;Stay yer tongue lad, I saw the whole
      thing. She checked to make sure Tilset was not seriously hurt, which he
      wasn't, and had another child help him home to rest. </p>
      <p>&quot;I think we need to have a word with Warrior MacNaff about you
      young lad&quot;, she led a very sorry Malvek to The Pit where the warriors
      could be found practicing their art. Why was he the one in trouble? Tilset
      threw at him first! </p>
      <p>Soon he was standing before Lysbeth McNaff. The imposing warrior
      gleamed in her noble armor, polished to a shine meant to inspire the new
      recruits and to give them a small lesson in humility. Cyndl was first to
      speak. </p>
      <p>&quot;Warrior McNaff, I understand that ye intend to bring this young
      lad into yer fold with the rest of the Wolves of the North.&quot; Cyndl
      was teaching Malvek's sister in the arts of creating patchwork, so she was
      privy to his near acceptance. &quot;Before ye give him his tunic I think
      ye should think twice.&quot; </p>
      <p>Malvek hung his head in shame. Before he had even had a chance to take
      his first lesson, his anger had proven him unworthy. </p>
      <p>Lysbeth considered the young (almost) warrior and the seamstress that
      stood before her with a quizzical look. &quot;What has he done that should
      make me reconsider this child, Cyndl? He comes from a warrior family, he
      is almost of age.&quot; </p>
      <p>Cyndl then explained the fight and how Malvek had struck down the
      annoying Tilset (whom she agreed had started the exchange). After a moment
      she inched her way closer to Lysbeth until they were whispering back and
      forth just quiet enough that no matter how he tried, Malvek could not hear
      their conversation. Finally they parted and Lysbeth looked down at the boy
      who was awaiting news of his fate. </p>
      <p>With an almost sorrowful look the shining warrior spoke to the boy.
      &quot;Malvek, I am sorry but the Wolves of the North will not be able to
      accept you.&quot; The boy looked up with a crushed expression and began to
      plead his case. He was willing to do anything to make it up to them. They
      just had to take him, for his family's honor if for no other reason!
      Before he could continue, Warrior McNaff raised a finger and silenced his
      outburst. &quot;Margyn McCann of the Shaman's guild can use ye
      however.&quot; She said this with a slight smile. Now the young barbarian
      was simply confused. &quot;Cyndl witnessed yer exchange with the other boy
      and knows that ye did not hit him with a snowball. What struck him was an
      elemental force that some Shaman call a Frost Strike.&quot; Malvek
      searched his mind for the meaning of all of this. The warrior continued,
      &quot;You have shown the ability to use the forces of nature to assist ye.
      That is something the Shaman of Justice will have to cultivate. I'm sure
      that ye will do well there, and bring glory unto Halas.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">*****</font></b></p>
      <p>A few seasons later Malvek was a full Shaman with a number of victories
      to his name (and not a few embarrassing episodes as well). He had filled
      his spellbook with all the wondrous spells he could learn and afford at
      his age. He had fought off more bears, skeletons, goblins, and cowardly
      gnolls than he could count. He had killed his first polar bear a full
      cycle before that pompous Tilset, and he wore the helm that was made from
      it proudly (his sister had sewn it for him). He made sure to wear it often
      when Tilset was around. </p>
      <p>While many of Malvek's kindred stayed within the range of Everfrost
      Peaks, this noble Shaman looked beyond. He heard the Bards in the taverns
      sing of far off lands and the dangers that lurked within. He was sung
      songs of evil which he could never have imagined (and were well beyond his
      ability to defeat) as well as songs of those who fought for loyalty and
      honor and the protection of the weak. Often these heroic songs would
      reverberate with a single name: Scarab. It seemed that wherever there was
      evil, a Scarab was there to counter it. Whenever a young adventurer
      struggled, a Scarab was there to assist. Soon he would frequent the
      taverns in hopes of hearing more tales of these brave adventurers and
      would constantly quiz the bards as to the veracity of the stories they
      sang. In the stories, they lived by a code that Malvek had always hoped he
      would live by as well. Soon the battle wizened, but still young, barbarian
      made a decision. He would explore the world and lend his arm to protect it
      from the evils that seemed to increase their fight with every waxing of
      the silver moon. He hoped that if his will and arm were of sufficient
      strength, that one day maybe he too would be allowed to fight for the
      noble Scarab. </p>
      <p>He would not stay in Halas and the Everfrost Peaks, his mind was too
      full of far off lands and his soul desired to visit them all. As for his
      homeland in the mountains; they were well protected by the rest of his
      kin. </p>
      <p>After making the arduous journey from his snowy homeland to Rivervale
      he met a Scarab by the name of Miri (just Miri, as she had not earned her
      last name yet). She gave him advice and told him what would be required if
      he meant to join with Scarab in their cause. From the stories he had
      heard, he knew that he would be a good Scarab. All he needed to do was
      convince them of this fact! </p>
      <p>So he fought. He slew the orcs and goblins that had been harassing the
      good folk of Rivervale. He assisted those in need and never demanded
      payment for his services (though he certainly did not turn down donations,
      as he knew that his next range of spells would be expensive). He kept in
      touch with Jayfoot and Miri and asked often for their assessments. </p>
      <p>Eventually Malvek had been allowed to become a recruit of Scarab and
      had been so for quite some time. Despite the elation at such and honor and
      opportunity, he was beginning to feel that he might never be allowed to
      join. </p>
      <p>He eagerly attended Scarab's first birthday party at the Jade Tiger Inn
      of Freeport. While the others were getting ready for the festivities by
      drinking, catching up with old friends and drinking, Malvek stood in a
      corner in reverent awe. These brothers and sisters of Scarab were the
      legends come to life. Their weapons gleamed with magic. Their armor had
      been made from the hides of creatures that the youngster from Halas had
      thought were just legends. Their leader, Lord Hawke, bore a sword that
      when pulled from its sheath burned with the fire of the righteous. Malvek,
      being so young, had never laid eyes on most of Scarab's soldiers. They
      fought in the deepest of damp dungeons while Malvek fought just outside of
      towns where he could run to the guards for help. Seeing them seemed like a
      waking dream. They stood around and talked the talk of old friends and
      comrades in arms, not realizing that they were the idols of the tattooed
      barbarian in the corner. </p>
      <p>Soon Jayfoot arrived and sought out Malvek. He told the lad that he had
      done well, and would ask him to recite the code of Scarab. Though he had
      it memorized, his excitement at being able to take the last step made him
      fumble somewhat, but not so much. Jayfoot then asked for everyone's
      attention and announced that the Shaman from Halas was the newest member
      of Scarab! The cheers and offers of fellowship from those who once were
      just songs in a tavern made the strong and battle scarred Shaman well up
      with tears (though he might not admit it today). </p>
      <p>As the raucous party proceeded, Lord and Lady Hawke called members of
      Scarab forward and presented them with gifts that would be worth a king's
      ransom if brought to market. Needless to say, Malvek was quite surprised
      when Lady Hawke called him forward. He had been a full member of this
      illustrious group for but ten minutes and did not think that he would be
      included beyond his acceptance of Scarab's Code. </p>
      <p>The Lady handed over a Screaming Mace (the same one he carries today)
      and told him to use it well. When they looked at his faded and ragged
      armor, they replaced it (what was it his Scarab cousin from Halas said?
      &quot;I'll have no kinsman of mine wear leather armor&quot;). The shaman
      tried to be firm, but it was so much more than he expected. Not the gifts,
      for he had never been one for objects. It was the acceptance and trust
      that they gave to him, the newest and certainly least experienced of their
      members, which touched him most. It would be a long, long time before this
      spellcaster would be able to fight on the same level as his new family,
      but they did not care. He was one of them.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">*****</font></b></p>
      <p>As the light of the spell swirled around him, Malvek could feel his
      wounds healing. He was still sore, but he could fight. As the shimmering
      whirlpool of light faded he saw that another pawn had appeared to replace
      its fallen comrade. To its left was a skeletal knight! Once again the
      shield was brought to bear and the sigils of power were scryed into the
      cool night air. The little pawn was rooted to the spot, but the undead
      knight began to shamble its dry bones towards the caster who had
      interrupted a game of chess that no one understood. So the dance played
      itself out again. The mace screamed out its magic and the shield received
      another dent. A smile played itself over Malvek's lips as he thought of
      his adopted family and in a whispered voice spoke aloud for no one in
      particular: &quot;For Scarab&quot;.</p>
