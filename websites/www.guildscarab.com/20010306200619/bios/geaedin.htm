Not so for Geaedin, he sat on the docks, legs dangling over the edge, staring out into the expanse of sea dreading the hours to come.  Soon it would be time to go out thieving, he didn’t like doing it but he didn’t know anything else, he had been doing this for as long as he can remember (besides Molly would slit his throat if he didn’t do it).  With a sigh he got up and pulled his coat around him and set off towards the northern part of the city.  <br><br>His job tonight involved breaking into a room at the Jade tiger inn, word had been round that a wealthy merchant was staying there and a healthy stash could be acquired.  The sound of merriment wafted out of the inn as he approached, good, it was busy and the wine seemed to be flowing, it made his job that much more simple.  He stepped through the door, and recognised the merchant sitting in the middle of the room from the size of his belly and the number of people round him making him feel the lord of the land to gain his favour.  He smiled and made his way to the stairs at the back of the room, the upper corridors were deserted, even better, and found the room that the contact said held the stash.  Looking up and down the corridor one more time he got to work with the lockpick, it didn’t take long, the door was quite old, as was the lock, he quietly slipped inside, closing the door behind him.  The room was dark, the candles having burnt out, so he pulled a fire beetles eye out of his coat pocket which illuminated the room just enough for him to get to work.  <br><br>Just as he was about to start, he heard one of the floorboards creak outside the door and with a crash the door was kicked through.  He rolled forward and turned round to face his attackers and found at least five men standing at the entrance to the room.  The odds were not good, and Geaedin always played the odds, and so with a final smile he chucked the eye he held in his hand at his assailants and jumped through the window.  The room was on the second floor but he knew that outside that particular window was a patch of grass that would soften his fall somewhat. It still hurt though, he thought he had twisted his ankle, but he picked himself up and starting running down the road towards the docks.  <br><br>He heard the sound of pursuit, there was no way he would outrun them with his injury,  so he slipped into a dark alley and hid.  The pursuers ran by, oblivious to the man hiding round the next corner, by now his ankle was killing, it looked swollen but he was not sure if it was broken or not.  He hobbled along, clinging to the wall, but it was hopeless, he knew he couldn’t make it, so he propped himself up against a wall and looked round for someone who could help him, but the streets were empty, empty except for a man striding purposefully in the middle of the road heading towards where he had come from.  Geaedin recognised the man, he was a member of the guild Scarab, a guild he knew were honest and noble and so would definitely help him.<br><br>  "Hail friend," said Geaedin.  <br>"Hail," came the reply.  <br>"Dismal evening isn’t it?" Geaedin said jovially. <br> "Aye, tis that," the man said.<br>  "I hate to bother you but I seem to have twisted my ankle on the way to the docks to meet some friends of mine, we are hoping to catch the late boat over to Butcherblock and if I don’t hurry I shall miss it and the next boat isn’t until the morning."  <br>"Let me see," said the man, and before Geaedin could object, the man bent down to inspect his leg. <br><br> Before Geaedin knew it the man was muttering some incantation under his breath and the pain in his leg vanished, so did the swelling.  He tested the leg by standing on it and it felt as right as rain, he stared at the man in astonishment and before he could mutter a "thank you" the man said, "Take care friend and know that you always have friends at Scarab if you wish to abandon your current way of life, and live a true and noble existence."  And the man was off, Geaedin stared at the space he occupied in the street dumbfounded, the words 'how did he know?' going through his mind, after a while the words changed to 'Why did he bother to help me!'. <br><br> Geaedin made it back to the hideout and got quite a rollicking for not going through with the job, then spent about a week lost in thought, just thinking about the incident and the man.  Eventually he found himself standing round Freeport looking for this man, and when Geaedin did see him, again striding purposefully down the road, he moved to talk to him knowing that his life was about to change forever...............................
