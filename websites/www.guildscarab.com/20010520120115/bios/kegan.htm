As a boy growing up he was known as Kegan Andrews. He grew up with his
Mother, Kate,  and Father, Johann, in a village named Surefall Glade.
This village was mostly made up of Human and Halfelvs who practiced the
Druid and Ranger ways of life. Johann, was, in fact a magician and was
tolerated buy the local population only because of his great powers of
summoning which were beneficial to everyone.<br><br>
     Johann was a simple man who enjoyed the peace and quite that was
offered in the Glade. He would sit and read, always searching for ways
to improve his skills and knowledge. Kegan was just the opposite. Since
the age of 5 he showed great potential and was easily able to summon
food and drink even before he began his training with his Father. Johann
was very proud of his son's abilities but thought he should spend more
time studying and less time treasure hunting.<br><br>
     By the time Kegan was 12 he could summon lesser elementalings who
would roam the countryside with him in search of anything wonderful that
might have been dropped by much more powerful and experienced
adventurers. Sometimes he would come home with many items, some even
magically enchanted and other times he would just come home tired and
bruised. His mother would always patch him back up to health and his
father would always punish him, usually by sending him off to his room
with a dozen books or so. Kegan enjoyed this though as it was always fun
to learn new spells and become more proficient and the ones he already
knew. It was never as fun as treasure hunting though so usually by the
next morning he would have read the books and learned the new spells.
After showing his Father he actually had read the books and learned the
new spells, usually it took about an hour, he would be off again.<br><br>
     Kate and Johann knew it would not be long before Kegan left on one
of his treasure hunts and would not return. He had already become twice
the magician of his Father and this place just didn't offer the
excitement and challenges he needed or wanted. So on Kegan's 20th
Birthday, Johann and Kate handed Kegan a backpack. Inside this backpack
was a robe. Kegan's eyes gleamed, A Flowing Black Robe that had once
belonged to a most powerful enchanter was now in his hands. His father
had been keeping it for him since he was born although it looked like it
had just been made. He gazed at it knowing it was the most powerful item
he had ever possessed. He also knew it was his parents way of saying,
You're Free.<br><br>
     Johann handed Kegan some reagents and a few Platinum pieces he had
been saving and told him of a city far away. This city was known as
Freeport and was a haven for brave adventurers and powerful spell
casters. He told him of a Magician Guild Hall where he could find
everything he needed including the training his father could not give.
"You have a "Wild Heart" Kegan, it's time you followed it." said Johann.

With that Kegan set off in search of this city called freeport.<br><br>
     The journey was much longer than Kegan expected and was beginning
to wonder if he was headed in the right direction. He looked at his map,
then up at the sky and continued on his way. He would summon a pet for
company and only had a few skirmishes. The light was starting to fade
away one day and Kegan began to make camp and summoned some food. He was
about to lay down for the night when he heard shouts and hollers of
battle in the distance. "Finally!" he thought "Some Action!" He got up
and ran toward the noise. He began to see brilliant flashes of light and
heard the clashing of swords. Quickly he summoned a pet and sent it off
to battle hoping he would be of great help to those adventurers. He
arrived at the battle just in time to see his pet demolished with a
quick blow by the Hill Giant. A sudden feeling of worry came over him.
"Who are these people who would fight a creature this strong" he thought
to himself. "Stand Back" the party of adventurers shouted at him but his
pride would not allow it. He began to cast his most powerful firbolt
spell. The spell had very little effect on the Hill Giant and Kegan
looked up just in time to see a giant fist smashing down upon
him.........<br><br>
     "He's waking up" someone said. Kegan opened his eyes and saw a
Paladin in shining armor standing over him. "Wha...Where... Who...What
Happened?" said Kegan. "You were very lucky we had a Cleric with us
young mage".. "Who are you?" said Kegan "I am Lord Hawke, Guildmaster of
SCARAB and this is Lady Hawke, my wife, she is the one who saved you".
Kegan sat up and was introduced to all the members of SCARAB. "You have
shown great bravery mage, you have also shown great stupidity. Never
attack a creature without knowing it's potential. Whats you name?"..
Kegan began "Kegan Andr... Kegan Wildheart" he said proudly. "Well met
Kegan Wildheart, I think with a little work you will make a fine
Magician. Would you be interested in joining our family Kegan?" Without
hesitation Kegan's eyes beamed and he said "Lord Hawke It would be my
honor to join and adventure with SCARAB" he smiled brightly. This is
what he had been searching for all along. A family of great adventurers
and a place to call his own within this group.</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
