I can assure you that it is not a
glamorous or exciting story, but if you must know, sit close and let me
share my life with you. I was born in Kelethin, city of the trees. It is an
unusual city and easy to get lost in. But, I loved my time there.
<br><br>
I had a happy childhood for a brief time. My earliest memories are of my
mother humming and baking pies in the kitchen. I remember her patiently
teaching me to sew and at night she would sing beautiful songs as the family
gathered around our large old stove to share our day. She had the most
melodic and wonderful voice. And she was so beautiful when she sang. It was
if her feet lifted right off the ground as she danced about our home, doing
chores and teaching my siblings and I.
<br><br>
My father was a large man, stern but loving. He seemed to tower over my tiny
form when he came close. I was hugged often by my father, as were my brother
and sister. During the day, my father hunted and at night, as mom sang, he
would carefully and expertly construct weapons to sell for a living. How
beautiful they were! The bright, shiny blades and glorious decorative
handles took my breath away. His work was regarded throughout the land as
the best and hunters journeyed far to purchase my father’s weapons.
<br><br>
My siblings and I got along well and I loved playing and learning with them.
My mother taught us to sing and sew. I remember her telling us once, "As
long as you know a skill, you can survive and as long as you can sing you
will be at peace."
<br><br>
My life changed when I was only nine years old. I had been very ill and had
just started to recover when my parents had to suddenly leave for the
Kithikor Woods where my grandmother lived. She had taken deathly ill and my
parents felt the need to bring her back to Kelethin so they could take care
of them. I, being as sick as I was, was left in the care of a neighbor.
<br><br>
My family never returned to Kelethin. Shortly after they started out, they
were attacked by a band of renegade orcs. Their mangled and decayed bodies
were found only because the neighbor taking care of me became worried when
they didn’t return when planned. This turn of events also sent my
grandmother over the edge. She died of a broken heart as soon as she heard
the sad news. Even at the tender age of nine, I knew that my neighbor could
not afford to take care of me and an orphanage or slavery were my only
options if I stayed in Kelethin, the only place I had ever known.
<br><br>
So, I ran away. I wandered Norrath  for a year or so until I found a little
place called Rivervale. The halflings there immediately took me in and kept
a watchful eye on me. In a little wooded area outside Rivervale is where I
spent the next several years.. In Misty Thicket, I honed my battle skills by
hunting young kodiaks and the goblins who were terrorizing the people of
Rivervale.<br><br>
From time to time, I journeyed to nearby Freeport. When I was a teenager, I 
had decided to make use of my musical ability that had been passed from my 
mother to me. Soon I joined the Bard’s guild in Freeport and played my 
instruments to passersby, in the hopes that they would give me money or 
food. It was not easy to survive, but I did it. Occasionally I played for 
visiting dignitaries and officials and these were fantastic paydays for me. 
I always saved my money for new songs and finer instruments. I rarely had 
time for fun.<br><br>
I always returned to Misty, but as I grew older, the halflings began to 
nudge me out. They said I needed to see the world and visit far off places. 
I was content to stay right there, but eventually they convinced me and I 
left, with a heavy heart and many tears. At first, I returned to Kelethin, 
but it had been many years since I had been there and I did not like it. It 
was not as I remembered, but then again, nothing ever is. I had forgotten my 
way around the city and the elves seemed cold and unfriendly to me.
I soon returned to Freeport and began to make my home there. I continued to 
play and sing for money and I also tailored clothing for extra cash. As I 
was sitting in North Freeport one day, playing my mandolin, a young man 
approached me. I wasn’t sure of what he wanted and I was slightly 
frightened, but he simply sat and listened. He sat there the entire day. As 
dusk fell, the young man finally introduced himself as Dolvin Brightblade, 
of Scarab. He was quite handsome and intriguing. He asked if I would like to 
go sit and talk with him and so I agreed. We shared a wonderful dinner of 
wine and fruit and I learned much about this fascinating man.
He told me about his past, which was much different from mine, and about 
Scarab, the guild he had joined. "They are a second family to me," he said. 
Somewhere in my heart, I felt a sharp pang...I had wished for another loving 
family ever since mine had been murdered. Dolvin was very lucky, but he knew 
this and counted his blessings.<br><br>
After our delightful evening, I really never expected to see this handsome 
stranger again. He was a Holy Knight in Scarab! I was a mere bard, with no 
roof over my head and no food most of the time. To my surprise, I saw him 
the next day as I was hunting in the Commonlands. I was thrilled. We spent 
the next several days together, almost inseparable. Dolvin taught me how to 
hunt more effectively, how to sing louder and clearer and even how to laugh 
again. That was something I had not done in ages.<br><br>
Shortly after we met, Dolvin introduced me to his Scarab family and after I 
had proved myself, they accepted me as a full member! Finally, after years 
of lonliness and wondering if I would ever be loved again by a family, I had 
one! It is an amazing feeling and I am reminded every day of how lucky and 
blessed I am to have such a family.<br><br>
So that is my story. Currently, I am working hard every day on my various 
skills. The Karanas are where I am spending my time lately, dodging griffons 
and ridding the land of gorge hounds and crag spiders. At last, mine is an 
enjoyable life and I would not let go of it for anything in the world.
