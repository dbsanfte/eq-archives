					<TD valign="TOP" colspan="2"><FONT class="text1">I’ve been listening to a
      lot of the SCARAB stories, and it seems a common theme is early trauma.
      I’m no different. The story is short, because the topic is ugly: Mom was
      a Freeport dock whore, and my father was a sailor - don’t ask me which
      one - Mom had no idea.<BR><BR>So I grew up on the Freeport docks. Didn’t want to follow Mom’s way of
      life - mostly because I thought she was a loathsome b*tch (we fought all
      the time). By the time I was five I had left her and was running wild with
      a batch of young punks - well, thieves really. Taking what we wanted,
      getting into places no one else could, conning the rich and
      gentle-hearted, etc. Special note: Paladins are a push-over for the hungry
      young child routine! (Apologies to all the guild paladins, but it’s
      true.)<BR><BR>I’d also hang out around the Thieves’ Guild under the docks, picking
      up special tips and tricks from those older than I. One person I
      particularly remember was this little hobbit named Jayfoot. He was about
      my height, so I got him to show me some moves for short folk because there
      were things I just wasn’t big enough to do yet. While he taught me, he
      told me about this guild he was in - a sort of family thing. Noble and
      generous and all that. I pretty much ignored him at the time.<BR><BR>Well one day I got caught by the militia after a break-in went
      particularly wrong. Off I went to jail - a young ruffian girl in jail. It
      was NOT a good time, but we’ll leave it there.<BR><BR>Those of you who have never been there may not know that the city sends
      clerics and monks to the prisoners to try to counsel them, to reform their
      evil ways (whatever!). I pretty much ignored the clerics, but the monks
      fascinated me. The way they moved - I was in awe.<BR><BR>Eventually jail time ended, and I was released back onto the streets. I
      began stalking the monks (when I wasn’t busy stealing a living) because
      I liked to watch them practice. I started following this one monk in
      particular, because he looked the youngest of the bunch - I had never
      tried to cut a monk’s purse before, so I wanted to know if I could!<BR><BR>I couldn’t. I snuck up behind him and reached, and he disarmed and
      pinioned me before I had the slightest idea what was happening. Well I was
      thoroughly embarrassed and not a little angry, and struggled with all my
      strength until I realized that it was doing absolutely no good. And all
      the time this monk guy was just ... looking ... at me. Like he was judging
      my soul or something. At first I started calling him an arrogant
      son-of-a...but then I quieted. There was something ... compelling ...
      about the look on his face. Like the whole world could go to hell around
      him and he’d still have that look. I was fascinated.<BR><BR>Finally he shook his head, released one of my arms and marched me back to
      the Ashen Order. Imagine my surprise when he took me right upstairs to
      meet Puab Closk, and told him &quot;I believe this one wants to join our
      Order, sir.&quot; I stammered something incoherent about ‘what-who-me’
      while Puab looked at me the way this other monk had. He apparently agreed,
      for he nodded and the young monk led me away to the trainer and handed me
      over. I was so stunned I went along peacefully.<BR><BR>As the years flew by, I was continually amazed to learn how right this all
      felt. I grew to maturity (in any number of ways). But I was a monk without
      a purpose.<BR><BR>Then one day, while fishing down off the docks of Freeport waiting for the
      boat, I saw Jayfoot again. And I remembered what he had told me about
      SCARAB - the codes of Conduct and Chivalry, the family atmosphere and the
      love ... I realized in that instant that I had never had love, had never
      had a family. And I WANTED it, I suddenly realized, with all my breath and
      bone.<BR><BR>So I approached Jayfoot, and had him put in a good word for me with the
      Elders of the guild. Soon after that I contacted the Elders myself, and in
      time proved myself worthy of the great family they had built. Not that
      it’s always been easy! As the perennial youngster of the guild, (ok so
      I’m the family brat - want to make something of it?!) I’ve
      occasionally had to miss out on family trips, but by Marr! I'll get there
      someday! :)<BR>Blessings of Quellious upon you all, my brethren!</FONT>
