                        into the early morning sun, I pull my
                        cloak tighter around my body. Snow drips
                        noisily from the eaves of the cabin,
                        smoke gently wafting from the chimney.
                        Walking across the valley towards the
                        group of cabins nestled against the hill,
                        I notice the wind start to blow a little
                        crisper, foretelling some lower
                        temperatures.</font><p><font size="2"
                        face="Comic Sans MS">Hailing the
                        shopkeeper, I step inside his small but
                        well stocked store. Loading my pack with
                        the essentials, I then pay him and walk
                        back to my camp to prepare for my
                        adventures. Slinging my backpack over one
                        shoulder, strapping my scabbard over my
                        pack, I heft my axe and point my feet
                        down the trail.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
                        early morning was quiet, eerily quiet.
                        The only sounds were the sounds of my
                        feet treading on the trail&#133;..a noise
                        in the trees gets my attention. Looking
                        closely, I see what appears to be a giant
                        rodent. Stepping closer, the giant rat
                        growls angrily at my trespassing and
                        lunges. One swing of my axe brings the
                        frenzied rat down. Sliding my axe into
                        its scabbard, I skin the rat, taking the
                        valuable hide and ears for the bounty on
                        them. Back on the trail, feeling good
                        about ridden the woods of diseased-ridden
                        vermin, I drift into that world of waking
                        dreams. Thinking about the adventures
                        I&#146;ve had, the ones yet to come with
                        the great friends I have found in
                        SCARAB&#133;.my drifting is interrupted
                        by a sudden scream. Rushing towards the
                        sound, I find a human woman fighting off
                        a horde of cackling skeletons, piles of
                        bones evidence of the ones she had
                        already slain. Pulling my axe from its
                        place on my back, I wade into the fray.
                        Back to back, we fight of the undead
                        onslaught&#133; The rhythm of the battle
                        is hectic, our swings in synchronization,
                        never interfering with each other, the
                        fight lasts for what seems like
                        hours...probably more like 2-3 minutes.
                        After the dust settled and we caught our
                        breath, gazing upon the woman, I finally
                        get a good look at her. Curly blond hair,
                        emerald green eyes, thin and lithe, she
                        seems to shine with an inter-light, she
                        tells me her name. The sound of it was
                        like musical notes, I felt
                        dizzy&#133;awestruck&#133;all emotions at
                        once. My mind cannot comprehend the waves
                        of emotion&#133;..</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Awakening
                        in the small clearing where the battle
                        took place, the woman is gone. I feel
                        refreshed like I had slept a hundred days
                        and a hundred nights. A small purse rests
                        on my chest, holding gold pieces, some
                        silver and copper pieces, and a small
                        piece of parchment. I grip the
                        parchment&#133;trying to read the
                        feathery writing&#133;.</font></p>
