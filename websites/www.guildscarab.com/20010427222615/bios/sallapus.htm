I so much longed to get out and explore the world I lived in, but my parents, cousins to King Ak'Anon would not hear of it, and insisted on my staying in the library. Because of their stubbornness (we Gnomes can get that way) the only way for me to get out and explore was to sneak out of the library and stay unnoticed to everyone else (after all, everyone knew who I was after nearly burning down the library after one of my fire bolts that went astray,  torched one of the clockworks) After doing this for some time, I came to find a home away from home in the Abbey of Deep Musing where I found many a good rogue that I came to learn a great deal from.  Being home to quite a few clerics as well,it was quite nice to get rid of all the nicks and scratches I might have gotten from my nights adventures. <br><br>   Seeing that I always loved a good practical joke, and getting into mischief was 2nd nature to me, becoming a rogue was a perfect fit. After wandering around the Steamfont Mountains for many a year adventuring with my rogue friends my eyes were opened to a whole new world when a couple of travelers from afar happened to visit.  Upon their arriving in Steamfont,the Hawkes were interested in getting to the Abbey, for it was there that Lady Hawke had needed to travel to get one of her spells.  I gladly escorted them, and en route to the abbey they told me of their pledge to rid Norrath of all that is evil and promote the virtues of Honor Valor and Loyalty through the guild they had formed which is well known throughout all Norrath as Scarab.  Hearing of this potential for adventure and actually fighting for a good cause I was immediately hooked, and although I could not go with them when they had left, I had vowed that I would join them in their quest in Freeport as soon as possible.<br><br>  After about a month, the time had come to bid farewell to Ak'Anon and come to terms with my parents who were glad to hear of the noble quest I was about to begin (finally realizing that I was not going to be a wizard they figured this was a lot better than just sneaking around town all the time).   I then packed my bags and set out for Freeport with my trusty dagger, sewing kit (I had to read up on SOMETHING while trapped in the library and tailoring seemed to be the most interesting) and toolbox (all of us gnomes have tinkering on the mind, it's a curiosity thing).  Thus beginning my lifelong quest which I continue to this day as a proud member of Scarab.</font></P><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></BODY></html>
