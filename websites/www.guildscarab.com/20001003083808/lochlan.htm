Carilyne and her family were musicians bound for the Harvest Festival at the Kaladim docks.  The long drought had broken this year and a great joy had spread across Faydwer as crops grew tall and bountiful.  The trip to the docks was quiet as the caravan was large and well-protected and after a stop at the dwarven capital, they arrived and began to setup their tents.  The festival was the largest anyone could remember and the boats brought merchants and entertainers from as far as Erudin.
<br>
<br>Carilyne had just finished her morning practice session and was wandering the maze of merchant tents that filled the area when she saw a particularly busy tent.  Curious she walked over and saw a young smith crafting arms and armor.  He was clearly quite gifted and the line for his goods wound around his small tent.  Although he was dirty and sweaty from the work, she could tell has was a handsome man.  He was working feverishly to keep up with the orders and the sound of his hammer was musical and magical.  She found herself captivated like the others and the morning passed quickly.  When he finally stopped for a break, he looked up and saw her.  He smiled, grabbed a small piece of metal and quickly turned into a small tree sculpture that he offered to her.  He introduced himself as Angus MacLean and asked if she would like have lunch, after he cleaned up.  She accepted and after lunch they made plans to meet again in the evening.  It was clear that were soul mates.  They spent the evening together and decided to marry the next day as part of the festival climax.
<br>
<br>They were married the next day and that evening conceived their first child.  As a gift for his bride, Angus made a wonderful, lightweight tunic to protect her from harm.  At dawn, they awoke and began to pack their things, they were unsure where they would go now that the festival was over, but they were happy and did not care.  Most of the others were still sleeping off the great party, but Angus and Carilyne were eager to start their new life.  As they packed his shop, they heard a low rumble coming from the hills.  Angus looked out and saw an army of orcs racing down the hill towards the docks.  The orcs set upon the guards and soon overwhelmed.  The sounds of battle woke the revelers, but most were groggy and hung over.  The orcs plowed into the masses killing without regard or remorse.  Angus grabbed a sword and shield from his supplies and with Carilyne headed for the ship.  The orcs were closer now and the screams echoed off the mountains.  Angus and Carilyne jumped aboard the ship with a handful of others and set sail for Freeport.
<br>
<br>The blood turned the sea red and the Ocean of Tears was born.  You were born in Freeport as we recovered from the trip, and when you were old enough, we moved to this village in West Karana.
<br>
<br>Young Lochlan, only 5, sat on his bed listening to his father's tale.  After his father left, Lochlan remained awake late into the evening, finally he knew what he must do.  He swore vengeance on the Orcs of Crushbone and all evil in the world.  With his father's strength and his mother skill's he would become a bard, though he did not know this at the time.  Lochlan trained hard from that day forward.  Every evening as his brothers and sisters played, Lochlan would work on his swordmanship, singing all the while as was the custom in his family.  They all sang all day, almost without thought.  This was the gift that their mother bestowed upon all her children.
<p>By his 10th birthday, Lochlan was the best swordsman in town and his heart was set upon becoming a warrior.   A few years later, Lochlan traveled to Qeynos to sell his father's wares and test his skills against young adventurers from all across Norrath.  It was here that he met Vhalen Nostrolo.  Vhalen watched him compete and realized that Lochlan was a natural Bard.  He offered Lochlan an apprenticeship on the spot.  With mixed emotions, Lochlan accepted and begin to train in his new found career. 
<br>
<br>Lochlan's skills grew fast in Qeynos and the gnolls of Blackburrow substituted nicely for the orcs he hates so fiercely.  Before long, Lochlan met others who shared his passion, honor, and valor.  He would hunt with these folks many times and strong bonds of friendship were formed.  From these bonds the Guild Scarab was born.
<br>
<br>Lochlan then traveled to Freeport to meet the leaders of Scarab and pledge his loyalty to them,  Here he also found the hated orcs.  He spent many days slaying the Deathfist orcs and other evils, until he was ready to board the ship for Faydwer.
<br>
<br>Lochlan arrived at the docks and was overcome with emotion.  This was the place where his life started and so many had died.  He spent two days here, grieving for the dead and writing songs in their honor.  Then it was time to journey to Kelethin and pay his respects to his mother's parents and his own elven heritage.  Then began the hunts, daily travels into Crushbone to slay the orcs.  He would return each evening covered in blood, a little stronger, a little richer, and a little more hateful of the vile orcs.  He would free what prisoners he could, but others would be left behind and that would fuel his hatred even more.
<br>
<br>Lochlan's easygoing, kind nature hides his burning passion.  His eyes and smile welcome you to the table like an old friend.  He is always willing to help those in need and share what he has with his new family.</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
