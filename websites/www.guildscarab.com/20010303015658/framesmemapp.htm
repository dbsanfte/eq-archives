        the family. If you want to be a part of the guild, then
        be a part of the guild. At Scarab, we honestly believe
        that the person behind the screen is important. We try to
        look beyond the character, and just like any Pen and
        Paper gaming group, everyone involved are friends, and
        such is it with the people behind the characters in

        seeking the truth, and the path of righteousness, members
        must strive to escape their own personal gain and instead
        be just. Members who seek out justice without bending to

        HONOR and LOYALTY. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sacrifice</b>- &nbsp;Generosity is a main
        characteristic of a Scarab member. &nbsp; In order to
        counter the weakness of gluttony, members are to be as
        generous as their resources will allow!!!! &nbsp;
        Generous members are better able to walk the fine line
        between mercy and cold justice. Giving rather than taking
        makes the name of SCARAB known and respected. Sacrifice
        serves HONOR. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Compassion</b>- The weak and Innocent are our charges,
        their defense and safety are our duty. The might and
        wisdom of the SCARAB member allow those not capable of
        their own well being to stand boldly behind us. The meek
        may rest weary heads on the strength of our shoulders.
        Compassion serves HONOR and VALOR. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Spirituality</b>- &nbsp;Members must seek to be
        masters of their own minds and bodies.&nbsp; From this
        prowess we must seek to humbly serve those to whom we
        have sworn our lives and duty. Spirituality serves both
        LOYALTY and HONOR. <br>
        <br>
        THIS IS THE SCARAB WAY!!! To these ends we strive to
        serve! Thanks to Lord Gregor, who provided the model for

        face="Arial">We take the recruitment of new members very
        seriously, and getting into Scarab is no easy task.
        However, most people who have put in the necessary effort
        to be admitted to the guild believe it is well worth the
        wait.<br>
        Here are a few guidelines to help you become a recruit,
        as well as some information about what to expect from the
        recruitment process.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To become a
        recruit, you must do the following:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">1) Introduce
        yourself to us on our public message board. Tell us about
        yourself and express your desire to join the guild. Be
        sure to tell us your reasons for picking Scarab as your
        guild of choice, let us know of your current guild
        acquaintances, and tell us what you hope to bring to the
        Scarab family.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">2) Send an
        email containing a similar message to the </font><a
        href="mailto:ggardiner@flashmail.com"><font size="2"
        face="Arial">Master of Admissions</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> expressing your desire to join the
        guild.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">3) We are
        recruiting by invitation only, so if you are serious
        about joining Scarab you must get at least three elder
        members to sponsor your admittance into the guild. Please
        ask them to post a message of recommendation about you on
        our Recruitment Message Board.<br>
        We are a large guild, and we pride ourselves on the fact
        that we've been able to maintain a family feeling and
        atmosphere in the guild where everyone knows everyone. We
        feel that if you are unable to find at least three
        friends in the guild to sponsor you, this probably isn't
        the right guild for you<br>
        As a general rule, the more friends you have in the
        guild, the better your chances of being admitted will be.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Once we've
        received this information and at least three messages of
        recommendation, we will add you to our waiting list. We
        usually accept recruits in &quot;batches,&quot; typically
        3 - 5 new recruits at a time. When the time comes to
        select the next &quot;batch&quot; of recruits, we will
        review our waiting list and select the most promising
        candidates. Please note that the time between
        &quot;batches&quot; might be several months.<br>
        Please note that our waiting list is not on a
        first-come-first-server priority basis. We evaluate each
        person individually and select those who most closely
        match our values and friendships.<br>
        So, don't be discouraged if you are &quot;last&quot; on
        the list. Your position on the list has no bearing in
        regards to your acceptance into the guild.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If we select
        you from the waiting list, you will officially become a
        recruit and we will add you to the &quot;guildstone&quot;
        (our term for /guildsay chat) but you must go into
        /anonymous mode so the Scarab tag is not shown above your
        character's head until you've completed your recruitment
        period.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Expect to be
        a recruit for quite some time. The minimum recruitment
        time is two weeks, but it often takes over a month for a
        recruit to be admitted into full membership status.<br>
        This long waiting period gives us a chance to get to you
        know better, but more importantly, it gives you a chance
        to see if Scarab is the right guild for you.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After we feel
        that we've gotten to know you fully, you'll be presented
        with a verbal membership test in-game presented by the
        Master of Admissions. This test will include questions
        about the nature of the guild, its leadership structure,
        important guild concepts, the guild charter, and
        questions about your personal character. If you review
        the information contained on our Membership page and put
        forth a good effort toward getting to know your
        guildmates you'll do just fine on this test.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Lastly, you
        along with your fellow recruits will be faced with a
        Recruit Quest presented by the guild for the initiation
        of the recruits. These quests are detailed, involved, and
        very enjoyable. They give you a good taste of what being
        in Scarab is all about. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In
        conclusion, the # 1 best way to get into the guild is
        this: Hunt with us, group with us, hunt with us, get
        drunk with us, hunt with us, and when you've done all
        that, do it all over again.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
        recruitment process is long and detailed, so it will take
        time for the &quot;paperwork&quot; to be handled. So,
        your main goal should be that when the Master of
        Admission says &quot;Do we want to let So-And-So become a
        recruit?&quot; everyone will say &quot;What? You mean
        he/she isn't one already? Why on earth not?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Good luck!</font></p>

        Games can petition the Scarab Inner Circle to become an
        officially sanctioned Guild by following these
        provisions.<br>
        1) At least ten Scarab members have played the game for
        at least three months<br>
        2) The in-game world would logically support a guild of
        Scarab&#146;s nature, beliefs and rules (i.e. no Unreal
        Tournament, Half-Life, etc.)<br>
        3) Follow the Code of Conduct and the Code of Chivalry
        stated in the Charter.<br>
        4) The players ask the Inner Circle to become official
        emissaries of Scarab to that Game.<br>
        If approved by the Inner Circle, the active players in
        that game would be welcome to:<br>
        1) Use the moniker &#147;Scarab&#148; with their names.<br>
        2) Apply for official guild status with the new game,
        under the name Scarab.<br>
        3) Recruit members from the game to be part of Scarab.
        These players would be allowed to participate as a Scarab
        in ANY of our supported games.<br>
        4) Be allowed to select one of their numbers to serve on
        the Inner Circle as a representative with full voting
        privileges.<br>
        5) Create an organizational structure to facilitate
        in-game needs. Examples are positions that are not
        leadership oriented (i.e. not guild master). Acceptable
        positions are those needed to make game life easier such
        as controlling the flow of resources (i.e. armourer,
        treasurer, librarian, etc.)<br>
        Although Scarab does believe in supporting as many games
        as their player&#146;s desire, most resources will be
        focused on a single MMORPG. Currently this is Everquest.
        It takes a 75% full membership vote to change this focus.</font><font

        should be a -PVP guild on Norrath. There are limitations
        in the way that -PVP players can interact with +PVP
        players (from the functionality of the game), and thus we
        need to all be &quot;in the same boat&quot; for optimal
        group interaction. There is a lot of PVP interaction in
        -PVP, such as dueling and Guild Wars, which provide
        honorable PVP fighting situations. <br>

        1) Members of the Inner Circle provide leadership through
        shaping policy and voting on key issues.<br>
        2) The Inner Circle is not an in-game role-playing
        leadership body. Its purpose is to handle issues that
        affect the guild as a whole (recruitment, website
        administration, discipline issues, involvement in
        non-core games)<br>
        3) Members of the Inner Circle must maintain an active
        presence by participating in all official discussions and
        all votes unless they have given some prior notice that
        they will be unavailable<br>
        4) At times real life may make it difficult or
        undesirable to participate as a member of the Inner
        Circle for an extended period of time. In such cases it
        is acceptable to honorably step down from the position.<br>
        5) The Inner Circle will abide by the Code of Leadership.
        They will not treat their position as one of authority
        and will at all times perform their duties to the best of
        their ability and treat all members with respect<br>
        6) Inner Circle members have no individual authority. In
        order to prevent possible abuse, the Inner Circle must
        approve all actions. There will be an election every 6
        months to keep the Inner Circle and the Leader of the IC
        active and representative of the guild as a whole. If an
        IC member steps down, that position will not be filled
        until the next general election. There is no limit to the
        number of terms a member may serve. The IC is encouraged
        to delegate certain responsibilities such as recruit
        mentoring or running quests to volunteers. Willing
        volunteers are our greatest assets. The IC and
        Guildmaster will select officers as needed (treasurer,
        librarian, armourer, player advocates, etc)<br>
        7) The Inner Circle will have a secure forum to discuss
        issues.<br>
        8) The Inner Circle will have a ratio of 1:7 with Scarab
        members. This ratio is to be used when electing a new
        Inner Circle. </font></p>

        role-play as necessary. The Guildmaster is an equal
        member of the Inner Circle with full voting privileges.<br>
        The Guildmaster will hold this position until they decide
        to step down, the guild decides to stop playing the
        current game they are actively involved in, or by a vote
        to remove the GM is passed by a two/thirds majority of

        </b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">Excellence - The
        tasks and responsibilities of a leader can at times
        become difficult, time consuming, discouraging, and
        frustrating. However, no matter what the circumstances
        the leaders of Scarab perform their duties to the best of
        their ability to benefit the entire guild. A leader takes
        no short cuts, does not look for an easy way out, and
        always tries to do the best job possible.<br>
        Service - A leader will always put the needs of members
        before their own. Leaders will never use their position
        to degrade or put down another member. A leader in Scarab
        is not in a position of authority. A leader serves the
        membership.<br>
        Integrity - Leaders of our guild are held to a higher
        standard. Any action taken by a leader reflects upon the
        entire leadership body and upon the entire guild. Leaders
        will at all times think and act carefully with the
        highest level of integrity. A leader is a leader at all
        times, even when nobody is looking.</font></p>
