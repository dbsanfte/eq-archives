The wind moves slightly through the leaves of an old
oak, deeply hidden in the forest. Almost invisible
from human eyes, Farold, an elf of almost 500 seasons,
leans against the trunk. Although slender of build his
graceful movements reveal a body much stronger than it
appears at first glance. His long brown hair covers
his face partially, but when a gust of wind catches it
his gray eyes appear. They are almost closed, but like
a cat they observe everything around him. He is very
alert and his leather-clad body appears to be ready to
change from standing totally still to running in one
second to another. This serves him very well, when he
hunts for pelts or guides inexperienced people through
the deeper woods during summer. His clothes look very
old and worn but a closer look shows that he feels
very comfortable in them and that they fit him like a
second skin.</p>
A young deer moves through the undergrowth but it does
not notice Farold at all until it is almost beside
him. It stops, stands perfectly still and looks at
him. Then after a second, sensing no danger, it moves
closer to him and he starts to stroke its flank. The
young deer settles down at his feet and is very calm.
A thought slips through Farold's mind: " Why can I
deal so good with animals of the forest and why it is
so difficult for me to be around humans?" He thinks
about the great wizards daughter, who he longs to talk
to but cannot find the words at all.</p>
He thinks about this very often but never finds a
satisfying answer for himself. At home in the forest
among the animals and the trees he is somehow aloof
around the humans. He is well liked and respected and
many call him friend. But when asked to characterize
him most fall silent. Many look confused when they
realize that they know him not at all. He is not
really complaining about this, because he likes to
keep his own council. He will never be dependent on
others, even though it causes loneliness at times.  Of
course, he never speaks with anybody about this.</FONT>
