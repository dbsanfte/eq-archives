<p><font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, my friends! The popular
gameshow &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; is invading
EverQuest, and YOU get to be a part of it!!<br>
Join me for a night of excitement, thrills, suspense, and fun as
I give some of you a chance to become a MILLIONAIRE!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Once again, as I boldly go where no
Scarab has gone before, I proudly bring you a Scarab event that
you won't want to miss.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Who:</strong> All Scarab members
and recruits<br>
<strong>What:</strong> Scarab gameshow, Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?<br>
<strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 12, 9:00 pm EST<br>
<strong>Where:</strong> Jade Tiger Inn, North Freeport, Antonica<br>
<strong>Why:</strong> For fun, and to possibly get rich!!<br>
<strong>How:</strong> For those of you who aren't familiar with
this gameshow, I'll describe the rules below.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Arial Black">The
Rules</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">At the beginning of the game, I will ask
the audience a question. The first person from the audience who
/tells me the correct answer to my question will become the first
contestant who will attempt to become a Millionaire.<br>
<em>NOTE: All questions will be given directly at the Jade Tiger Inn,
not via guildsay. So, if you want to participate, you'll have to
be there in person.</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The first contestant will then join me
in the "hot seat" and I will begin quizzing him/her.
All questions will be multiple choice and EverQuest-related. Each
question will be assigned a money value. The contestant will
start at the 100 question and will work his/her way up to 1
Million.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There are 15 questions in all, and their
difficulty increases as the show goes on. When the contestant
reaches the 1000, 32000, and 1 Million mark (every five
questions), they are guaranteed to leave the game with at least
that amount of money, even if they answer a following question
incorrectly.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">During each question, the contestant has
the option of simply withdrawing from the competition before
answering the question and he/she will get to keep all the money
that has been earned up to that point (take the money and run).<br>
The contestant will also have the option of using
&quot;Lifelines&quot; that will help reveal the correct answer.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Arial Black"><img

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Each contestant has 3
Lifelines that can be used at any point in the game, but each
Lifeline can only be used once. Lifelines are used to help the
contestant answer a question that he/she doesn't know the answer
to.</font></p>

hspace="0" width="74" height="50"></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> <strong>50
: 50</strong><br>
The 50:50 will eliminate two of the incorrect choices, leaving
two choices remaining (one correct, and one incorrect).</font></p>

When this Lifeline is used, the contestant may send a /tell to
anyone else who is online at the time to ask for help. This is
the <strong>ONLY</strong> /tell that the contestant will send
during the entire game. All contestants will be on their Scarab
Word-Of-Honor to uphold this condition. This /tell conversation
may only last up to 30 seconds.</font></p>

align="left" hspace="0" width="74" height="50"></font><font
color="#FFFFFF"> <strong>Ask the Audience</strong><br>
When this Lifeline is used, each person in the audience will send
me a /tell about which answer he/she believes to be the correct
answer. I will then tell the contestant what percentage of the
audience voted for each of the choices.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">More than one Lifeline may
be used for the same question, but each Lifeline may only be used
once during the entire game.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Arial Black">Other
Odds &amp; Ends</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">When the contestant answers the question
incorrectly or chooses to &quot;take the money and run,&quot; a
new contestant will be chosen from the audience through the same
method as before and the game will start over. This will continue
until a) we run out of contestants, b) we run out of time, or c)
I run out of money.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">
This game promises to be a ton of fun, and I look forward to
seeing you all there!</font></p>
