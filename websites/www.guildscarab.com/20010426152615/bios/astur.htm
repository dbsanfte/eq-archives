heroes and heroines past and present and yet to come. Its meaning is simple, yet weighs far
more heavily on them that bears it. ‘The Holy’ ‘tis the meaning in the more vulgar Common
Tongue, but ‘tis a name given by the ancients as they battled Innoruuk and his foul hoard.
<br><br>
‘Haps I should be startin’ from the beginning of me tale. Pull up yer chair and get out yer best
Ginesh, stoke up yer pipe and listen to me do the talkin’ at ye for a while.
<br><br>
Me name in the ancient Elven is Astur il’Ayan, or in yer Common tongue “Star of the Holy.”
I’ll be tellin’ a tale of a war long ago, of days when the gods walked among us, when the
ancients fought for their lives and Norrath was a place of sheer and utter beauty. If ye haven’t
figured it out by now, I’m speaking of the time of the Elders and the War of Takish-Hiz.
<br><br>
Takish-Hiz was the fairest of cities, or so I’ve been told. Twas a splendor to behold and the
children of Tunare were beautiful beyond words. Even Brell Serilis himself was tempted by a
young Elven maiden, such was their beauty! This caused Innoruuk’s evil heart to be enraged
with jealousy and so began the War of Takish-Hiz.
<br><br>
Me fadder’s fadders could not stand idly by while the bloody bastard Innoruuk took over,
and so began the fight! The battle raged for what seemed ages and despite the valiant deaths
of many and the help of me family, Innoruuk was able to capture the king and queen of
Takish-Hiz through his deceit. 
<br><br>
It was because of valor in this battle and the aid of their holy powers from Brell that me family
was given the name of which we are now known. It weighs heavy on me heart, however, that
we were unable to defeat Innoruuk and the race of Teir’Dal were born. To this day I be
wearing the Guise of the Deceiver in tribute to the brave fallen King and Queen of Takish-Hiz,
for it is from their deformed and twisted souls that Innoruuk created the Teir’Dal.
<brr><br>
Twas not only the name, however, that has passed from generation to generation. Me healin’
arts have been a gift from Brell and me family has been truly blessed from his hand to help
others. If ever yer in need, ye just be givin’ me a call!
