Regular members: <br>
            &#8226; These members wear the SCARAB tag, but may also join other 
            guilds and/or play on other servers in sanctioned (have an Official 
            Scarab presence) games. <br>
            &#8226; Regular members have access to all non-secure SCARAB message 
            boards. <br>
            &#8226; Regular Members will be granted access to the secure message 
            board for the game(s) they are involved in. <br>
            &#8226; Regular members have voting privileges in any game they are 
            involved in. An example of this would be if the Guildmaster(GM) asked 
            the players if they wanted to absorb another guild. <br>
            &#8226; Regular members may join SCARAB in other games by petitioning 
            the game's GM and Master/Mistress of Admissions(MoA) and following 
            their recruitment system. <br>
            &#8226; Regular members may petition the Inner Circle to be admitted 
            to Elder member status.<br>
            <br>
            Elder Members: <br>
            &#8226; Elder members are Scarabs who have chosen to forego joining 
            other guilds and who have dedicated themselves to building the Scarab 
            family. <br>
            &#8226; Elder members may join another guild in games where there 
            is no Scarab presence. <br>
            &#8226; Elder Members have voting privileges for any non-game specific 
            vote and any in-game vote for which they are a member of that game. 
            <br>
            &#8226; Elder members are automatically granted membership in all 
            SCARAB sancioned games. <br>
            &#8226; Elder Members will receive access to all secure game boards 
            plus the General Secure board and the Scarab Get Together board. <br>
            &#8226; Only Elder Members may volunteer to serve on the Inner Circle. 
            <p> Inner Circle: <br>
              &#8226; Members of the Inner Circle provide leadership through shaping 
              policy and voting on key issues. <br>
              &#8226; The Inner Circle is not an in-game leadership body. <br>
              &#8226; Its purpose is to handle issues that affect the guild as 
              a whole (website administration, discipline issues, involvement 
              in non-core games, policies that impact multiple games, etc). <br>
              &#8226; Members of the Inner Circle must maintain an active presence 
              by participating in all official discussions and all votes unless 
              they have given some prior notice that they will be unavailable. 
              <br>
              &#8226; The Inner Circle will abide by the Code of Leadership. They 
              will not treat their position as one of authority and will at all 
              times perform their duties to the best of their ability and treat 
              all members with respect. <br>
              &#8226; Inner Circle members have no individual authority. In order 
              to prevent possible abuse, the full Inner Circle must approve all 
              actions through votes called by the Inner Circle Leader. <br>
              &#8226; There will be an election every 6 months to keep the Inner 
              Circle and the Leader of the IC active and representative of the 
              guild as a whole. <br>
              &#8226; If an IC member steps down, that position will not be filled 
              until the next general election. <br>
              &#8226; There is no set limit to the number of terms a guildmember 
              may serve on the IC. <br>
              &#8226; The Inner Circle has a secure forum to discuss issues. <br>
              &#8226; The IC will have a minimum of nine members, with a ratio 
              of 1:7 IC to full members. If the ratio dictates more than 9 members, 
              then as many IC positions that correspond to the ratio will be elected. 
              <br>
              &#8226; If you serve in a game, or the guild in general, in a capacity
              that allows you to be on the IC and have voting privileges, you may not
              run for IC (i.e. GM). If you step down, or the chapter is disolved you 
              will retain full IC access, as well as normal voting rights, until the next
              term. At that time, you would need to run for the IC. <br>
              &#8226; If you serve in a game, or the guild in general, in a capacity that 
              allows you to have access to the IC board but you do <i>not</i> have voting 
              privileges, you may run for the IC so that you can have voting rights 
              (i.e. an MOA, Webmaster, Guild Historian). <br>
              &#8226; Inner Circle members will be granted access to all Scarab 
              message boards.</p>
            <p> Inner Circle Leader: <br>
              &#8226; This position is voted upon by the Inner Circle Members 
              at the start of each term by simple majority. <br>
              &#8226; The Inner Circle Leader shall report weekly to the guild 
              on the General Secure board a summary of discussions being held 
              by the Inner Circle. <br>
              &#8226; The Inner Circle Leader shall call all votes being held 
              on the Inner Circle board. <br>
              &#8226; The Inner Circle Leader should cast the final vote so that 
              his/her vote may be used to break a tie.</p>
            <p> Guildmaster: <br>
              &#8226; This position is the highest level of in-game leadership 
              and inter-guild diplomacy. <br>
              &#8226; The Guildmaster should be well spoken and levelheaded, intimately 
              familiar with guild policy and game mechanics, and be willing and 
              able to lead Scarab in in-game activities. <br>
              &#8226; Only Elder Members of the guild may serve as Guildmasters. 
              <br>
              &#8226; You can only serve as the GM of one game at a time. <br>
              &#8226; The GM is the permanent representative of that sanctioned 
              game to the IC and has equal voting rights with elected IC members. 
              <br>
              &#8226; The Guildmaster is responsible for delegating in-game officers 
              as needed to ensure the success of Scarab. <br>
              &#8226; The Guildmaster will hold this position until they decide 
              to step down, the guild decides to stop playing the current game 
              they are actively involved in, or by a vote to remove the GM is 
              passed by 3/4 vote of the Inner Circle. <br>
              &#8226; The Guildmaster of each game will moderate an officer board 
              to discuss in-game issues with their appointed in-game officers. 
              <br>
              &#8226; The GM is responsible for setting up a system of recruiting 
              in that game consistent with the needs of the guild in that game 
              and in keeping with the Scarab tradition of finding quality members. 
              <br>
              &#8226; No formal approval of the recruitment policy is required 
              by the IC per se, but the GM should remember that any Regular Members 
              added in one game may eventually petition for Elder Member Status 
              and therefore a diligent effort should be made to find quality candidates.</p>
                <p> Game Officers: <br>
                  &#8226; These positions are created by the GM of a game and 
                  may be either appointed by the GM or elected from the game's 
                  population at the GM's discretion. <br>
                  &#8226; The GM has complete latitude over the role and quantity 
                  of the officers for that game. <br>
                  &#8226; Game Officers are not by themselves granted Inner Circle 
                  access, however, Inner Circle members may be game officers and 
                  are strongly encouraged to participate in games.</p>

                <p>We support our members in their desire to play games, and therefore, 
                  Scarab provides secure message boards for other games for which 
                  there is an interest level. Scarab members in another Massively 
                  Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game can petition the Inner 
                  Circle to become an officially sanctioned guild (in that game) 
                  by following these provisions. While we certainly do not expect 
                  all Elder Member Scarabs playing games to form a chapter, wherever 
                  there seems to be a passing interest in a game a guild chapter 
                  should at least be attempted before Elder Members begin tagging 
                  in other guilds.</p>
                <p> &#8226;1. At least (3) three Elder Scarab Members are intending 
                  to play the game.<br>
                  &#8226;2. The in-game world would logically support a guild 
                  of Scarab’s nature, belief and rules.<br>
                  &#8226;3. Follow the Code of Conduct and the Code of Chivalry 
                  stated in the Charter.<br>
                  &#8226;4. Created a basic list of rules for that chapter that 
                  includes what the approach to crafting, raids recruitment.<br>
                  &#8226;5. One of the Elder Members in the guild agrees to serve, 
                  and is elected by simple majority, as Guildmaster for the game.<br>
                  <br>
                  If approved by the Inner Circle, the active players in that 
                  game would be welcome to: </p>
                <p>&#8226;1. Use the moniker “Scarab” with their names.<br> &#8226;2. Begin recruitment 
                  of additional players from the game to join the guild as Regular 
                  Members.<br> &#8226;3. Have a General, Secure and Officer Message board 
                  started for members of that game.<p> To assist with our membership 
                  in their enjoyment of online gaming it may become necessary 
                  to remove an official Scarab sanction from a game. The rules 
                  governing this are as follows: <br>&#8226;1. Three of fewer Elder members 
                  are currently maintaining active accounts. <br>&#8226;2. The Inner Circle 
                  has voted and passed the motion to remove the guild sanction 
                  with a 75% vote.</p></td>
