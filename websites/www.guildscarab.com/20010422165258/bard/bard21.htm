        stood on the balcony and watched the goings on in the
        Keep with a sharp eye. Things had gone well during the
        move from South Karana to Everfrost Peaks. He had called
        a favor in with the wizards he knew and their combined
        effort had magically teleported the entire keep and
        it&#146;s occupants here to Everfrost. He smiled as he
        thought of Arulin and Tannis sneaking into the Keep the
        day before just as it was teleported. They had both
        screamed when the cold hit them suddenly and Arulin had
        made it a point to gather all the extra blankets he could
        for their room. They both slept now, enjoying their
        repast from adventuring. Briggs had told them both that
        they only needed to ask for something and it would be
        taken care of. Slowly he walked back into the room
        Morigane had chosen for them all those years ago.
        Smiling, he sat on the edge of the bed and ran his hand
        over her hair as she slept. Here was the woman who had
        tamed the reckless beast within him with but a kiss.
        Slowly he traced her face with a finger and smiled as she
        stirred and mumbled an &#147;I Love You my husband&#148;
        as she drifted off to sleep. He stood and walked to his
        study and looked over the maps and parchments. He smiled
        when he saw the one that had been sent to all of SCARAB.
        It was a simple message stating that all were welcome in
        BlazeRose Keep and any could seek sanctuary here at any
        time.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat slowly and
        suddenly smiled as he thought of Hawke and LdyHawke. They
        had been the last to visit before the move and had spent
        many days with their son and daughter-in-law. Mother and
        daughter had spent hours talking of spells and scrolls,
        while father and son had spent hours in endless combat
        practice, both teaching the other new techniques and
        stances. They had all enjoyed the small time together and
        he knew the time would come again soon. Without thinking
        he picked up his journal and walked out onto the balcony.
        Slowly, he sat in his favorite chair and flipped thru the
        pages until he stopped at one very special page and his
        mind wandered to that day&#133;&#133;..</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&#133;&#133;.&#148;Damnit
        Nwalka find them. Those damned Orcs cannae be allowed to
        live after what they did to your lady. They ambushed my
        sister and she lays wounded badly, their lives are
        forfeit to me now.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Aye
        brother you are right and we will find them they are
        close&#133;listen.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;Both had
        stopped and suddenly the sounds of battle came to them.
        &#147;Over the dune someone battles Orcs.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">They both scrambled over
        the dune and the sight before them enraged Briggs to the
        point of battlefury. With a scream in ran down the dune,
        his swords gleaming as the sunlight hit them The orcs had
        beset a elf maiden and she was fighting them off as best
        she could. His swords flashed and a orc fell, his head
        beside his body. Nwalka moved to fend off a pair who were
        trying to corner the lass as Briggs stepped to the main
        pack and snarled a challenge. &#147; You sons of a desert
        whore&#133;.face me and find sanctuary in the death which
        awaits you.&#148; The orc leader snarled and spit on the
        ground, &#147;Foolish barbarian who seek death and now we
        will send you to hell.&#148; As one they charged and
        Briggs moved like lighting, his blades flashing as Nwalka
        and the female Ranger watched with wide eyes. The first
        fell with no sound as he spun to meet the next, their
        weapons drew his blood but he would not stop, the
        BattleLust had him and would only be sated by the blood
        of these before him. Soon there were none save for the
        leader and he cursed a challenge for unarmed combat. As
        he dropped his blades Briggs did the same and the orc was
        upon him. The Orc was larger but nothing would save him
        this day. Briggs&#146; hand flashed out and caught the
        orc in the throat and,&nbsp; with a savage twist his neck
        snapped neatly in two. He dropped the body and picked up
        his swords as Nwalka gaped at him. &#147;Close yer mouth
        lad flies will get in.&#148; Suddenly he felt weak and
        dropped to his knees in the sand as all went black.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke many
        hours later in a tent with the elf female sitting near
        him, her eyes never leaving his as they fluttered open.
        &#147;So you live afterall, good would be a waste if you
        did not. My name is Kytaria Goldenbear and from what your
        friend told me you are Briggs Blazerose. Your friend had
        to leave to check on his lady and I assured him you were
        in good hands. We healed you as best we could but
        you&#146;ve slept the last two days in healing.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp; He gaped and
        looked at her &#147; Two days?&#148; Suddenly he looked
        under the blanket and saw he was without clothing and his
        face flushed slightly. &#147;Your friend and I undressed
        you to allow your body comfort.&#148; Slowly she moved
        closer. &#147;I would thank you for what you did in
        helping me with the orcs.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; His eyes flashed and
        he smiled slightly, &#147;Nae m&#146;lady tis I who thank
        you, for staying here with me during my healing
        time.&#148; Slowly he drifted off, but not before
        catching a glimpse of her standing and removing her armor
        and moving towards him&#133;.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:321.0pt"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&#133;He suddenly smiled as
        he felt his wife curl up in his lap and kiss him gently.
        &#147;What were you thinking about m&#146;love?&#148;
        Slowly he smiled and stared into her eyes, &#147;That I
        am the luckiest man in all of Norrath to have you for my
        wife.&#148; That said he sat back in the chair with her
        in his arms and watched the sunrise over the peaks.</font></p>
