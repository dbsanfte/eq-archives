					<p>Scarab is much more than a typical online gaming guild. Scarab is a family of close friends, both online and in real-life, who uphold the values of honor, valor, and loyalty. Our guild is a large family and we take great pride in the fact that every person in the guild really enjoys being a part of the family. At Scarab, we honestly believe that the person behind the screen is important. We try to look beyond the character, and just like any Pen and Paper gaming group, we are all friends. If you are looking for "phat lewt" or a guild to power-level you up to "uber" standards then you have come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a guild that stays in character constantly then you are also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a friendly family atmosphere where you will make real life friendships, read on.<br />
<br />
Scarab has two sets of laws which dictate our actions: the Code of Conduct and the Code of Chivalry. These codes are the heart and soul of a Scarab member, and are to be followed at all times.</p>

					<p><b>Honor</b> - The ability to adhere to and uphold your beliefs; to do what is right over what is easy.<br />
<b>Valor</b> - The courage and strength of heart to face both your greatest fears and your strongest enemies without backing down.<br />
<b>Loyalty</b> - Devotion to your friends, guildmates, and allies; the ability to put their needs before yours and the good of the group above personal gain.</p>

					<p><b>Justice</b> - In courageously seeking the truth and the path of righteousness, members must strive to escape their own personal gain and instead be just. Members who seek out justice without bending to temptation will be members of renown.<br />
<br />
<b>Sacrifice</b> - Generosity is a prime characteristic of a Scarab member. In order to counter the weakness of gluttony, members are to be as generous as their resources will allow. Generous members are better able to walk the fine line between mercy and cold justice. Giving, rather than taking, makes the name of Scarab renowned and respected.<br />
<br />
<b>Compassion</b> - The weak and innocent are our charges; their defense and safety are our duty. The might and wisdom of a Scarab member allow those not capable of their own wellbeing to stand boldly behind us. The meek may rest weary heads on the strength of our shoulders.<br />
<br />
This is the Scarab way! To these ends we strive to serve! Thanks to Lord Gregor who provided the model for this code.</p>
