He is slender and has a whipcord-like appearance rather than bulky muscles. It is immediately apparent to all that he is in peak physical condition. However as a late bloomer physically, at age 18 Dornen has yet to grow into his full stature. He has slightly curly black hair, which he keeps short for easy care and to prevent an opponent from being able to grab it in a fight. His face is almost always calm and his rather large rounded eyes and penetrating gaze lend him a wizened look beyond his young age. While standing still or meditating in a lotus position, he appears ageless and immovable. Like a hunting cat, he is capable of transitioning from complete rest to extreme action in the blink of an eye and opponents often make the mistake of thinking his placid appearance denotes an unprepared target. Many creatures have found this to be untrue.<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="blue"><b><i>Goals/Beliefs: </b></i></font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dornen's strongest motivation in life is to explore, discover, and understand as much as he can about his body, mind, and spirit. By doing this, he believes he will come closer to understanding all that Norrath has to offer, whether live or inanimate. He strives to perfect the union of his body, mind, and spirit at all times and use this knowledge to further his understanding of the world and the beings around him.<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="blue"><b><i>Traits and Behavior</b></i></font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dornen is a driven personality devoted to achieving his goals. He is a very happy and cheerful person around those he trusts and admires and he is generous to the point of extravagance due to the fact that he has very little concept of the value of money in and of itself. He is the kind of person that would give anyone asking for help whatever he had at the time, whether it was a few coppers or several platinum bars. His self-knowledge makes him a realist as well as honest with himself and others. He tends to be very practical in his approach to problem solving which is not to say he lacks imagination, as imagination is essential in developing mentally and spiritually. Dornen tries to avoid extremes of passion and is generally level headed. Others consider him secretive, although this probably stems from his belief that lessons learned through self-examination and development are far more valuable than those taught by another. With all of that that said, Dornen is an 18-year-old human boy, raised entirely in the company of his brother monks and has only recently been exposed to the fairer sex. While considerate and respectful, he is sometimes over anxious about developing friendships with the women that he meets. He has a quick,dry sense of humor, and was considered sarcastic, but good-hearted by his brother monks.<br><br>He is proud of his martial abilities, and holds others who are skilled mentally, physically, and spiritually in reverence. Therefore, he admires most skilled adventurers, whether they are warriors, holy men, or practitioners of the magical arts, for their devotion and high levels of development. He does believe however, that only through the ways of a dedicated monk can all of these abilities be brought into harmony and lead to a full understanding of the world and its inhabitants. His determination to increase his knowledge and ability has a definite affect on his adventuring habits. In his search for perfection of form, he will often battle creatures of the same type many times in order to fully understand their nature and incorporate it with his own, including creatures that would otherwise appear harmless.<br><br>In battle with a group, he prefers to be in the forefront of the battle as this gives him the best opportunity to learn about his opponents first hand. He seems to have an innate grasp of group tactics because of his training with the brothers of his Order. He trusts and relies on others with him to either heal his wounds in battle or break his current foe's concentration. He is by no means careless in battle, as his loyalty to his friends is equal to his drive for perfection. He will not hesitate though, to test his abilities alone if his companions are unavailable. In the end, he believe sthat with meditation and consideration, all actions lead to a greater understanding of the world.<br><br>Dornen is amazed and grateful for any magic that can increase his abilities. He uses each instance as a reaffirmation of how much more it is possible for him to improve. He believes that these spells tap into power that is dormant in all of us. And, would scoff at the idea that these spells enhance anything beyond that achievable with dedication and practice. He sees the magic-user and shaman's abilities to bring this out in others as stemming from their in-depth knowledge of the mind and spirit. A type of knowledge that he realizes he will never equal because of his attempt at integration of mind, body, and spirit.<br><br>While dedicated to Quellious, Dornen is the type of worshipper who embodies his God's ideals rather than preaching them. His worship consists of becoming the ideal himself, and in that way spreading the beliefs and ideas of his chosen God. He leaves the preaching to Quellious' capable clerics and paladins.<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="blue"><b><i>Past History</b></i></font><br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other than the fact that Dornen was raised by the Monks of Quellious, he has never spoken of his early years to anyone. Perhaps he will come to trust in his new guildmates enough to write or tell the tale in the coming months.<br><br>Dornen encountered SCARAB on the first day out of his abbey home of 18years. After many hunts and a testing period supervised by Lord Hawke, Dornen was initiated as a full Scarab member on May 18th, 1999. He hunts regularly with Gyst, Emry Lynn, Dadilie, Caradin, and Grimden and hopes to add Zephina the Druid to his regular band of adventurers. </font></P> <br>                                    </td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table>		      </BODY></html>
