        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The air was crisp, almost
        chilling, even to a barbarian born and raised in
        Everfrost. The outlying areas of the frozen tundra that
        was the province of Kunadral lay before Frostfyre,
        seemingly unending and as foreboding as a frozen hell. In
        spite of this, Frostfyre was striding determinedly
        against the wind, and would let nothing deter him from
        his goal: A friend in need. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">As
        Frostfyre&#146;s crossed the icy surface, his mind
        wandered, back to earlier days when he and his friend,
        Lilla, (</font><a href="bard12a.htm"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">click here for image</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">) had spent time together
        hunting Pumas, Fire Beetles and Bears in the outlying
        areas of Freeport. He and Lila had become friends as both
        belonged to the Guild SCARAB, and had hunted together
        many times. Frostfyre had become protective of his fellow
        barbarian (though she could fully protect herself), many
        times sacrificing his own safety for that of Lilla (and
        she for him). Frostfyre often referred to Lilla as his
        &#145;Little Sister,&#146; a sibling term used by many
        within the Guild. Monotonously trudging forward, his mind
        drifted backward.... </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Hail, large
        one!&quot; A light, singsong voice reached
        Frostfyre&#146;s ears in a manner akin to a wind chime.
        He turned to see who was speaking in such lilting tones,
        but when he swung around, he did not believe his eyes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;My face be
        higher..&quot; The tone had changed dramatically, but the
        essence of the voice remained the same. &quot;Do not
        force me to smite you with my Great Staff,&quot; the
        voice said. (</font><a href="bard12b.htm"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">click here for image</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">) Frostfyre was a bit
        unnerved. Standing, right in front of him, was a fellow
        barbarian. A female Barbarian. A lovely female Barbarian.
        An annoyed, lovely female Barbarian. &quot;If thou dost
        utter any comments other than &#145;Hail,&#146; I shall
        be forced to cause thee great harm,&quot; as she was
        smiling as she said this, Frostfyre was almost sure she
        was jesting. Almost. Frostfyre was staring in amazement.
        Not that she was a Barbarian, not that she was,
        attractive, but the female in front of him had a presence
        that he found most alluring. &quot;My luck,&quot; she
        moaned,&quot; Mute. By The Tribunal, I must have been an
        Orc in a previous life.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Nay, &quot;
        said Frostfyre finally,&quot; I be not mute. I be
        Frostfyre. I know not any Barbarian named Mute. At least
        none from my Clan.&quot; Frostfyre was very serious, as
        his lack of a sense of humor was well known in the Guild.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Very
        funny,&quot; she laughed as she slapped the
        barbarian&#146;s upper thigh,&quot; My name is Lilla, and
        I have sought thee out for a reason, large one.&quot;
        This made Frostfyre curious to find out why she sought
        him, but was still confused as to why she was laughing at
        him. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Be it my
        kilt?&quot; he wondered to himself.&quot; Art there parts
        of me exposed? Ahhh, these new customs are very
        confusing. My head hurts.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The female
        continued, &quot;I be applying for membership into the
        great Guild SCARAB, and was told that thou art a member.
        This was true, as a party of SCARAB members had saved
        Frostfyre&#146;s life, and he was invited to join their
        esteemed group. &quot;Was told to seek thee out to hunt
        and learn the SCARAB ways. Thy name was given to me by
        Lady and Lord Hawke as they said we each possess
        qualities the other does not, and so may create a balance
        that may prove beneficial to us both.&quot; I </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Huh?&quot;
        Frostfyre grunted as the words swam in his head. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;The Lord and
        Lady believe we would make a good team,&quot; said Lilla,
        revising her previous statement. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Oh. Why
        didst thee not just say so?&quot; His head still hurt. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">She laughed again.
        Frostfyre could not get angry for some reason. He could
        not quite explain it, but her laughter had a calming
        effect on him. He enjoyed her company already. . He still
        wondered why she was laughing, though. He checked his
        kilt just to make sure. At this she fell to the ground,
        and laughed harder. Try as he might, Frostfyre could not
        get angry. The only thing he could do was...laugh. And
        laugh, and laugh. The more he tried to stop, the more he
        laughed. His laughter was reminiscent of a bear&#146;s
        growl, only more fearsome. As the sound emerged from the
        depths of his stomach, it growled and grumbled and
        exploded full force from his lips as if it were the only
        thing his body was capable of doing. As is the case with
        barbarians, whenever they do something, they do it with
        every part of their being. Laughter is no exception.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Lord Ozwyn, a
        member of SCARAB&#146;s Inner Circle, walked by, and
        stopped short in his footsteps, staring at the sight of a
        6&#146;7&quot; Barbarian on the ground, in tears,
        laughing all by himself. &quot;Art thee in pain, Brother
        FROSTY (this being Frostfyre&#146;s nickname in the Guild
        , though actually, his REAL nickname, unbeknownst to
        Frostfyre, was Windbreaker)? I heard the bellowing sounds
        of great suffering and pain, and felt obliged to find the
        source of such discomfort.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Nay ....
        heheheh ... Lord Ozwyn ... heheheheh.. my lit.. er ...
        eheheh .... my brother...&quot; he giggled in a most
        unbarbarianlike manner. &quot;I be fine. I merely hath
        been amused by my new friend.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Lord Ozwyn tilted
        his head, perplexed by this statement. Then nodded, as
        another figure became visible when the huge barbarian
        rose to his feet. Lord Ozwyn bowed and. hailed Lilla.
        &quot;Ahh&#133;. a thousand pardons milady. I didst not
        see thee behind my preponderous friend here. I have heard
        many great things about thee, milady and wish thee good
        luck, not only in thy membership application, but also
        ...Lord Ozwyn rolled his eyed toward the figure of
        Frostfyre, still hunched over, heaving but making no
        sound as he tried to stifle the all consuming laughter. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Thank thee,
        Lord Ozwyn. I believe I will need all the good fortune I
        possibly can get, considering.. &quot;said Lilla, then
        flashed a smile so broad and pure that Lord Ozwyn could
        tell she already had taken as much of a liking to the
        Shaman as had the members of SCARAB (although many would
        not admit it, at least not with the barbarian in the
        room). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">After Lord Ozwyn
        had taken his leave, and Frostfyre had finally stopped
        laughing (he still wasn&#146;t sure why he was laughing,
        nothing was funny as far as he could see), Lilla started
        anew. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;My large
        friend Frostfyre,&quot; Lilla said as she began looking
        in her bag,&quot; be thee ready to begin a hunt? Hast
        thee need for any supplies?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Nay,milady,
        I be always ready for an honorable hunt. What shall be
        our prey?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Well, thee
        wouldst be the judge of that, my friend. &quot;said
        Lilla, her hand now holding a soft brown square of some
        sort of food. Not a type of bread, as it was too soft,
        but not quite a pie, as it was also too rigid. A bit
        flaky, almost a biscuit ..... Frostfyre was getting
        hungry. Well, actually, hungrier.. Frostfyre was always
        hungry. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">.
        &quot;Mmmmmmmm...... Frostfyre ran his grimy hand over
        his unshaven face, trying to act deep in thought while
        eyeing the female as she munched on the brown morsel.
        &quot;Methinks Fire Beetle, or perhaps even Black Bear,
        mayhaps shouldst be our beginning targets. What say ye,
        milady?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Amyfing
        youuu shay,&quot; she giggled as she spoke, realizing her
        words were muffled by the food in her mouth. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Huh?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Chapter
        Two </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A shadowy figure
        appeared from nowhere, shattering Frostfyre's daydream.
        The figure was recognizable to the barbarian .... Gnoll.
        Hated, reviled killers of the woman he loved, Frostfyre
        has always taken every opportunity to kill these
        disgusting doglike beings. They had taken his love from
        him, but they would not take his friend. Frostfyre
        crouched behind the snowdrift upon which the Gnoll was
        standing. (</font><a href="bard12c.htm"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">click here for image</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">) He cast a quick glance
        behind, making sure the snowshoes had done their job
        masking his trail. They had. The Gnoll seemed to be an
        advance scout, meaning there were more to follow. Perhaps
        many more. Frostfyre's heart began to pump with
        anticipation and bloodlust. This would be a good day
        after all. A good day to die ... for the Gnolls, that is.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Frostfyre surveyed
        the lay of the land while the Gnoll scout did the same
        from his perch on the snow bank. It had come through a
        small pass into the valley they now shared. Perfect.
        Frostfyre readied his massive warhammer. The warhammer,
        christened Skullcrusher, was a gift from his father on
        the day Frostfyre left Halas. The head of the huge mallet
        is carved in the shape of a skull, complete with long
        teeth and empty eye sockets, indeed an intimidating sight
        to behold. A whisper of a rush of air was all the Gnoll
        scout heard before its skull split from the vicious blow
        delivered by the enraged 300-pound barbarian. The snow
        turned red. Once again, the warhammer had proven the
        truth of its naming.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">From the precipice
        atop the Mountainside overlooking the small pass through
        which the expected Gnoll party would have to travel,
        Frostfyre prepares for a long wait. Generally, scouts
        were hours perhaps days in front of their expedition, as
        they invariably were in hostile territory. This raiding
        party, however, seemed to be the exception, as within two
        hours, Frostfyre heard the unmistakable shuffling
        associated with Gnoll footpads. A small party as well,
        consisting of a total of twenty Gnolls. The leader,
        apparent due to his treatment of the others, was in the
        middle of the pack, flanked at all times by six Gnoll
        Guards. Frostfyre couldn&#146;t believe his eyes. He
        recognized this disgusting Gnoll. It was Ragnork, the
        Gnoll General in charge of the raid that killed
        Chillseeker, the Gnoll who cowardly retreated into the
        bowels of Blackburrow when defeat seemed imminent. The
        thought of that terrible day filled him with a rage that
        could only be quenched with the death of this vile
        creature. This would be his last day on this planet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The party was
        still a good ten or fifteen minutes from reaching the
        pass. Frostfyre knew he must meditate for the proper
        spell, and he may just have enough time. Sitting down, he
        covered himself in the snow, creating a warming blanket
        effect and hiding himself from any overly curious animals
        on the mountainside. He closed his eyes and began his
        prayer to The Tribunal.... </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Minutes later,
        Frostfyre heard the Gnolls as they entered the pass.
        Patience, patience. Must wait for the right
        time....timing is everything his father had taught him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The Gnolls were
        right where Frostfyre wanted them. As they approached, he
        came out of his makeshift hideaway, and began the
        mystical gestures, which brought forth the energies
        needed for the spell he was casting. Then the words
        escaped his
        lips&#133;..&quot;Kanandi..Ekirijfka..Malgarazi!!&quot;
        bellowed Frostfyre, his body spasming as a solid wall of
        flame spewed forth from his very being. The firewall was
        jettisoned across the pass to the opposite mountainside,
        causing a violent explosion. This melted an immense
        portion of the frozen wall, and sent it crashing into the
        pass. Of the twenty Gnolls that entered the pass, there
        were five left alive. Four guards and Ragnork the Evil
        One. No contest.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Wielding his
        warhammer as if it were but a hand tool, Frostfyre became
        his namesake, a relentless, icy storm that nothing could
        abate. The four guards were dispatched with amazing
        alacrity. (</font><a href="bard12d.htm"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">click here for image</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">) The first one, attacking
        without thinking, Frostfyre simply swung and let
        Skullcrusher perform its wonderful magic. The snow went
        red. The second and third, more cautious than the first,
        attempted to attack from either side, alternating their
        swings with bites from their powerful doglike jaws. Not
        good enough. Implementing the &quot;Dragon Whips Its
        Tail&#146; maneuver taught to him by his father,
        Frostfyre crouched down, making himself a smaller target,
        then whipped Skullcrusher to one side, destroying the
        knee of one attacker. Then in one motion, used the
        momentum of his warhammer to raise himself back up,
        Frostfyre released his grip on Skullcrusher&#146;s
        handle. As Skullcrusher raced through the air straight
        for the other Gnoll&#146;s ugly face, Frostfyre was
        already breaking the neck of the Gnoll whose knee he had
        destroyed. Three down. The remaining guard stood between
        Frostfyre and his real target. A feint to the
        guard&#146;s head with Skullcrusher was the Gnoll&#146;s
        downfall. A swift blow to the windpipe and it was over
        before it began. There remained only
        one&#133;&#133;..Ragnork. (</font><a href="bard12e.htm"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">click here for image</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The putrid Gnoll
        General began to plead for his life in the unintelligible
        speech that is common to the tick bearing dog people.
        Unheeding, Frostfyre descended on Ragnork as would a Snow
        Lion on a defenseless fawn. Merciless. Unfeeling, but for
        the pounding in his ears. The blood rage that enveloped
        him was driving him mad. He had no thoughts save
        KILL&#133;KILL&#133;KILL!!!!!!! Ragnork then changed his
        strategy. When Frostfyre was within a few paces, Ragnork
        sidestepped. Frostfyre raced past, allowing the Gnoll to
        slash his side with razor sharp claws. Frostfyre tumbled
        to the ground. The snow turned red, but this time, it was
        with the Shaman&#146;s own blood. Frostfyre turned, put
        his hand to his wound. He looked at his fingers, then
        touched the bloody fingers to his lips. The coppery taste
        merely incensed him more.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;This be the
        day you die, monster!!!&quot; Frostfyre knew the Gnoll
        could not understand him, but also knew the tone would be
        recognized. &quot;By The Tribunal and for
        Chillseeker!!&quot; cried Frostfyre as he charged.
        Frostfyre flung Skullcrusher with all his might,
        following close behind his flying warhammer. The Gnoll
        ducked, as expected, but also slashed at Frostfyre with a
        dagger it had hidden on its torso, which was unexpected.
        For the second time, Frostfyre had been surprised, and
        this time the wound was deep, very deep. He backed away
        from the Gnoll, injured where the Gnoll was not, tired
        where the Gnoll was fresh. The odds were not in his
        favor. Ragnork began to move in slowly. Frostfyre saw his
        opportunity as the Gnoll was showing great caution.
        Quickly chanting &quot; Ohnas turbil kantfsks&quot;,
        Frostfyre confused the dogman, and it stopped for a
        moment. The healing spell worked, and Frostfyre felt
        well, felt revitalized. He wanted Skullcrusher, wanted to
        fell the handle of the mighty warhammer in his hands, but
        it lay in the snow twenty meters away, and the Evil One
        was between it and him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Onkhableth
        Fandakre Judkethnba!&quot; yelled Frostfyre. The Gnoll
        brought its hands to cover its eyes, but too late. The
        spell blinded the Gnoll, allowing Frostfyre to lunge,
        attacking the Gnoll with a barrage of kicks a punches
        that left the monster in a heap, gasping for air.
        &quot;There is only one way to satisfy my thirst for
        vengeance and the Tribunal&#146;s thirst for
        justice..&quot; Frostfyre said to himself, as he walked
        to his warhammer. He picked up Skullcrusher, walked back
        to the figure on the ground, and waited. When the Gnoll
        regained its sight and saw Frostfyre standing above it
        warhammer at the ready, it once again began its pleading
        cries. The snow turned red one more time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Frostfyre crumpled
        to the ground. The pain and anguish he had kept inside
        for so long could no longer be controlled. He began to
        weep. His body convulsed uncontrollably, his sobs a
        cacophony of relief echoing in the small pass that was to
        be known hereafter as Frostfyre&#146;s Revenge. He wept
        for hours. Then he slept through the night. No more
        Gnolls appeared. When he was fully rested, he once again
        began his journey to Blackburrow, homeland of the Gnolls
        to rescue his friend, Lilla. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Chapter
        Three</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Once again the
        incessant walking triggered his memory. He remembered the
        first time he and Lilla went hunting. Always talking,
        always cheerful, Lilla almost got the two killed by a
        Black Bear. The thing was resting, making no sounds.
        Lilla was remarking on the beautiful flora and fauna.
        Frostfyre became distracted when Lilla shrieked in
        surprise as she had found a rare herb she used in her
        healing potions. Her scream of delight startled the bear,
        and it attacked Frostfyre from behind, stunning him. The
        bear began clawing him while he lay defenseless. Lilla
        reacted quickly, summoning a Fire Spell, charring the
        filthy monster&#146;s hide, sparing Frostfyre any further
        attacks. The problem was, now the bear turned it attacks
        to Lilla&#133;..</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">She bravely staved
        the thing off with her spells and potions, but soon her
        Mana began to wane, and things looked bleak. Then
        Frostfyre regained consciousness, regained his senses,
        and retaliated. One swing of the mighty warhammer. The
        grass ran red, but in his weakened condition, the blow
        did not kill the monster. It slashed at Frostfyre, then
        turned back to finish off Lilla. With all his remaining
        strength, he raised Skullcrusher, then brought it
        crashing down on the vile thing&#146;s ugly head. It was
        over. Frostfyre turned to Lilla to make sure that his
        fellow barbarian was all right, but she had already begun
        an incantation to heal. Surprisingly, the spell healed
        Frostfyre, not Lilla. After both had recovered, they
        skinned the bear, and found some gold coins and a rusty
        dagger in the thing&#146;s stomach. They made the trek
        back to Freeport to trade the items for a hot meal. Any
        excess money would be given to the Guild. Soon they would
        be able to make their own armor and weapons. After some
        meditation and practice, they would also be able to
        summon their own food and drink. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">They made their
        way back to the SCARAB GuildHall so as to rest and regale
        the Guild members with their horrific tale. Frostfyre
        told Lord and Lady Hawke of the bravery with which Lilla
        had performed, not fleeing when facing the Black Bear
        alone, but standing and fighting even when she could have
        perished. Soon after, Lilla was made a full member of
        SCARAB. She and Frostfyre became fast friends and went on
        many a hunt after that day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Chapter
        Four</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Once again,
        Frostfyre&#146;&#146;s concentration was broken. Not by a
        figure, not by a sound, but by a place. THE place.
        Blackburrow. Home of the Gnolls. The HATED Gnolls. The
        place where he would find and rescue his friend.
        Frostfyre crept up to the cavernous maw that was the
        entrance to Blackburrow. He had been here before on
        similar business. He hated this place. He would see it
        destroyed one day. He stripped off his snowshoes and made
        ready for a stealthy entrance. Covering himself with
        black tar to better hide himself, he entered the lair of
        his enemies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The security had
        been beefed up since Frostfyre had been here last. Now
        there were two sentries patrolling the mouth of the cave
        and four guards at the entrance prime. The sentries were
        no problem as they never knew what hit them. Two quick
        strikes of Skullcrusher and the ground turned red. The
        four guards would not be so easily downed, however.
        Frostfyre reapplied tar to his exposed body parts while
        plotting his strategy. He approached the entrance with
        great caution, using all his talents to make as little
        noise as possible. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Wanting to give no
        notice of his arrival, FROSTFYRE left his lantern behind
        and crept slowly along I the dark tunnels of Blackburrow.
        While trying not to, he could not help but cast his
        memory back to the day this episode began&#133;..</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Three days ago,
        Lilla had heard of a family in need of healing. They were
        not an important family, but that was of no matter to
        lilla. Someone was in need, and she would see to it that
        the need was satisfied. The family lived on the outskirts
        of Everfrost, quite near Blackburrow, but near enough to
        Barbarian population that the Gnolls generally stayed
        away. This day, however, they didn&#146;t. Somehow, the
        hated Gnoll were alerted to the fact that a barbarian
        healer would be in the small town. When Lilla arrived, a
        Gnoll patrol was waiting. The village was razed and
        nothing was left standing. Lilla was captured and taken
        away by the Gnolls and put into slavery. A youngling from
        the destroyed village had hidden and was spared death. He
        reported the destruction to the High Council in Halas,
        who in return reported it to SCARAB. As fortune would
        have it, or perhaps The Tribunal, Frostfyre was in Halas
        that day, visiting some friends of his family, and heard
        of the incident. As the messenger was carrying news to
        the SCARAB Guildhall in Freeport, Frostfyre was already
        on his way to Blackburrow. In his mind, the visualization
        of the hardships Lilla would have to endure were more
        than he could stand. He could not wait for Guild
        approval. He had to leave NOW. That was three days, four
        lost trails, and 45 dead Gnolls ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Frostfyre paused.
        There was light up ahead. Noise as well was abundant.
        Laughing, if one could call it that. A Gnoll&#146;s laugh
        was like a dog coughing after having eaten a large ball
        of Polar Bear fur. Taking a cautious approach, Frostfyre
        peered around the last corner into the open area of
        Blacburrow, the center of the Gnoll Empire. There were
        literally hundreds of them. Most injured, waiting to be
        healed by the figure in the center of the mass-Lilla.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">She looked
        terrible. She obviously needed rest. Her haggard
        expression showed a lack of food and rest. The Gnolls
        allowed her enough rest to regain enough Mana to perform
        one heal, no more. This kept her formidable powers at bay
        and allowed for the healing of their injured troops. Not
        one of the monsters paid any attention as Frostfyre crept
        along the back edge of the large dank cave until he
        reached the bridge in the center. The crowd was intent on
        watching the performance of the new slave, so not one
        Gnoll noticed as Frostfyre readied a powerful healing
        spell,</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">All of a sudden, a
        bolt of mental energy wracked Frostfyre. &quot;HELP
        ME!!!!&quot; The words were felt more than heard. It was
        Lilla, undoubtedly, but where did she get this mental
        power? A powerful Shaman she was, but mental telepathy?
        &quot;Why I be getting the message,&quot; pondered
        frostfyre,&quot;I be no telepath.&quot; But receive it he
        did, and it gave him an idea. Summoning all of his
        concentration, Frostfyre attempted to send a message
        back. Nothing</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;By The
        Tribunal!!&quot; he thought, &quot;once more.
        Concentrate, stupid barbarian.&quot; He began to sweat
        with the concentration. &quot;Agggghhh. Not so loud,
        Frostfyre. I hear you.&quot; The sweetest words he ever
        &#145;heard.&#146; Even in his head, they took on the
        lilting tone associated with Lilla. Having established a
        connection, he relayed his plan to Lilla, forgetting for
        the moment his amazement at the fact that he had just
        accomplished something he should not have been able to.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Lilla continued to
        heal injured Gnolls, her effectiveness steadily
        diminishing with the strain. The faint glow in from the
        bridge went unnoticed by the Gnoll conclave. A Gnoll
        Leader dog-coughed an order and Lilla was brought to her
        knees by a leather thong tight around her neck. As the
        Gnoll Leader turned, Lilla stood upright, gesturing and
        chanting, appearing as if awakened from a long restful
        sleep. The Gnoll Leader collapsed as if suddenly hit with
        a monstrous plague. Spasms racked its digusting body as
        it flailed around on the ground. Explosions began to rain
        down on the Gnoll horde. Lilla was completely forgotten
        in the confusion as she crept around the edge of the cave
        to the exit. One scrawny guard took notice, but thought
        to take her himself. A deadly mistake. Lilla performed a
        technique that Frostfyre had learned from his father and
        had taught her, &quot; Serpent Seeks Its Path,&quot; as
        she grasped the Gnoll&#146;s left forearm, snapped it
        back in the opposite direction, snapping it. At the same
        time, she clamped her free hand over the dogman&#146;s
        muzzle and landed a forceful kick to its
        &#145;sternum,&#146; knocking it senseless. With the
        thong that had kept her captive now in use as a whip,
        Lilla was ready to fight her way back home, but she knew
        there was something else to do first.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">She began to cast
        more explosive spells, as Frostfyre had done before her.
        This once again distracted the Gnolls, and allowed
        Frostfyre the time he needed to race to the exit where
        stood his Guildsister. The spells cast by the two Shamans
        were by design on the fringes of the mass of Gnolls. As
        Lilla cast her spells, a mound of dead Gnolls began to
        appear in front of the opening. As more Gnolls attempted
        to get to her, more died, causing a larger mound. She
        only hoped Frostfyre could make it before the mound
        covered the exit as they had planned. She cast a glance
        in Frostfyre&#146;s direction. He was using that damnably
        ugly warhammer of his to split open the head of yet
        another dogman, and was running in her direction. Then he
        was there. They both backed into the small tunnel
        opening, killing Gnolls with their spells as they fell
        back. This had the desired effect, as soon the opening
        was almost totally covered. A quick fire spell ignited
        the dead bodies, sending the remaining live Gnolls into a
        panic. The Shaman pair smiled at each other and turned.
        They faced 3 of the largest, ugliest Gnolls either of
        them had ever seen.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Frostfyre&#146;s
        mind raced. Low on mana, tired from the effort, what
        would they do? Something tugged at his mind, but he tried
        to shut it out. &quot;Not now,&quot; he thought,&quot; I
        don&#146;t want to remember my childhood now. Not
        NOW!!&quot; He turned his head to say something to Lilla,
        but she had turned to face the third Gnoll, who had crept
        around behind them. As she swept her hair from her
        shoulders, Frostfyre caught a glimpse of a tattoo on the
        back of her neck. His mind swam&#133;&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">He was only 5
        summers old. His mother had mentioned something about her
        brood sister coming to visit. As he was so young,
        Frostfyre had never asked what that meant. He accepted it
        as any child would, as fact from his mother. In several
        clans, including Frostfyre&#146;s, young maidens are
        chosen to breed with the Great Shaman in order that the
        line of Shamans never die. These maidens would then marry
        and have families, raising the progeny of the Great
        Shaman in their household. This was no disgrace. Rather,
        it was an honor to be chosen to further the Shaman
        lineage. Two such maidens were Crystalgaze and Almath.
        They met after their choosing and before the mating
        ritual in which they would be with the Great Shaman of
        Everfrost himself. They were secluded for a few weeks.
        There were quite a few maidens chosen, as this increased
        the odds of children being born. The two became fast
        friends and vowed to remain in touch after they had their
        children, and to support the other in case one did not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Both had beautiful
        children. Crystalgaze a boy, and Almath a girl. Though
        they lived in separate clans, the two young mothers
        stayed close. They both married soon after, being very
        sought after as mothers of possible great Shamans.
        Crystalgaze named her son after his propensity to be
        happy one moment and angry the next. Frostfyre she called
        him. Lilla was the given name of Almath&#146;s daughter.
        The two children played together as they grew, but when
        they turned 4 summers the visits became fewer. The two
        mothers knew that their lives were moving in different
        directions and so decided on an action that would
        solidify their friendship and the destiny of their
        children. The half brother and sister were given tattoos
        on the nape of their necks to signify their lineage.
        Tattoos of a Snow Lion, regal ruler of the frigid
        wasteland that is Everfrost peaks. The two children had
        not seen each other since. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">When his mother
        announced the coming of her brood sister Almath,
        Frostfyre did not realize of whom she was speaking. Upon
        meeting his half sister, there was a dim recollection,
        but being children, the moment passed. They did however,
        remember how to play. Play they did. In the snow, around
        the glacial peaks of Everfrost they romped. The second
        day of the brief reunion was marred by an unfortunate
        incident. As the two young barbarians played
        &#145;Capture the Wolf&#146;s Tail,&#146; a gang of three
        older males wandered by. Known bullies, these three saw
        an opportunity for some fun. They were wrong.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The three took the
        wolf&#146;s tail from Lilla and dangled it in front of
        her. She became angry and threw a punch at the smallest
        of the three, bloodying his nose. The bullies became
        violent after that, striking Lilla and knocking her to
        the ground. Frostfyre helped her up and whispered to her
        &quot;back to back, whip-o-snap.&quot; The three bullies
        surrounded the two youngsters. As they closed in, the two
        intertwined their arms. Lilla lifted herself up,
        balancing on Frostfyre&#146;s back and began to kick. She
        kicked one bully, knocking the breath from him. Frostfyre
        swung around, evading a swing from one of the aggressors,
        allowing Lilla to kick him in the throat, immediately
        dropping him to the ground gasping for air. The third,
        seeing a cause lost, turned to run. &quot;Now!&quot;
        yelled Lilla. She dropped her feet, and at the same time,
        Frostfyre flung himself backward. Releasing their grip,
        the force of their movement sent Frostfyre into a full
        backflip, which landed him in front of the fleeing bully.
        Completely surprised, the bully was not capable of
        defending himself against the two. They took back the
        wolf&#146;s tail and ran home to tell their parents what
        they had done. That was ten summers ago.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Back to back
        whip-o-snap,&quot; whispered Frostfyre to Lilla. She
        threw an astonished look at him, then nodded. In thirty
        seconds they stood alone, on the ground lay three large
        Gnolls. They did not speak on the trip back to Halas, but
        once safe in the home of Frostfyre&#146;s family, tears
        flowed as if from waterfalls. Embraces were exchanged by
        all. Tattoos were compared, Frostfyre&#146;s looking more
        like a Kodiak Bear due to his larger frame, whereas
        Lilla&#146;s appeared to be more of a hairy puma,
        Nonetheless, the tattoos identified them as brother and
        sister. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The two left for
        Freeport and the SCARAB Guildhall the following morning.
        &quot;What a tale we be telling to our
        Guildbreth&#133;fellow guild members.&quot; grunted
        Frostfyre. &quot;Aye,&quot; agreed Lilla,&quot; a tale of
        Sibling Chivalry.&quot;</font></p>
