        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp; Briggs stood on the
        rise as his eyes searched the snowy canyon before him.
        &#147; They should be just beyond that rise on the other
        side of the canyon.&#148; Slowly, he turned and looked
        over those behind him slowly. They had followed him out
        in search of the lost supply train from Halas to
        BlazeRose Keep. Now they were deep into the territory
        occupied by the Snow Orcs and still had seen nothing. He
        mounted his horse and nodded to the scouts and they rode
        on ahead. He turned and looked at his wife and smiled
        slightly, &#147;M&#146;love you should have stayed at the
        Keep. There was no need for you to come on this
        patrol.&#148; </font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes flashed and
        she coolly spoke, &#147;Nor was there any reason for you
        to come here either my husband. We go together or not as
        all as I&#146;ve told you in the past. Now let us get
        this done and find these lost men and get back to the
        Keep.&#148; Briggs laughed as he spurred his horse and
        followed the scouts. Behind him he heard one of the men
        try to whisper to his wife, &#147;M&#146;lady only you
        can speak as such to our Lord. He&#146;d have us swimming
        naked in Everfrost River if we tried that.&#148; Her
        high-pitched laugh made him smile as he heard her
        response, &#147;Bah! He&#146;d prefer I swim naked with
        him in such water.&#148; Briggs chuckled as he heard the
        man begin to cough. He flashed a smile at his wife and
        she blew him a kiss with a sly wink, which made him shake
        his head and look heavenward, &#147;Rallos Zek save me
        from this vile Druidess and her charms!&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">All
        the men broke out in laughter at the look on the Lady of
        Blazerose Keeps face, even though it was a mock look of
        astonishment at her husbands&#146; prayer.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suddenly Briggs brought his horse to a stop and held a
        hand up for the men behind him to halt as well. The
        scouts were returning with their faces set in grim
        scowls. Anmard stopped beside his lord and spoke deeply,
        &#147;We found them m&#146;lord and ye won&#146;t like
        it. Those damned Orcs staked them out in the cold and
        hacked away at them. Most of the supplies are gone as
        well as the horses. We found tracks leading deeper into
        the bluffs and came back to see what ye wanted us to do
        sir.&#148; Briggs gripped his axe hilt tight and growled
        deeply. His voice was a slow growl as he spoke, &#147;I
        want them tracked to wherever they went then I want them
        killed, slowly.&#148; He turned and spoke to 6 of the ten
        behind him, &#147;You men move ahead and take what you
        can of the supplies back to the Keep. Take the bodies
        also because those men deserve a proper burial. Be
        careful on your way back. Morigane began to weave her
        spells of proctection upon the men who were staying and
        then turned and nodded to her husband as they and the
        remaining four men followed the scouts as they tracked
        the orc war party. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They left the horses and made their way up the small
        rise. Briggs smelled the cooking fires; the stagnant
        smell of horseflesh being boiled filled his nose. His
        ears heard the laughter and the deep voices of the orcs
        as they celebrated their ambush. He counted 15 orcs and
        then slid back down the rise and locked eyes with
        everyone as he dropped his cloak and clenched his
        axe&#146;s hilt. &#147; We hit them fast and hard, no
        wounding you strike to kill or you stay here.&#148; The
        men nodded and then his eyes locked with his wife&#146;s
        and he smiled at the fire he saw burning within them.
        They all moved up the rise and then stood and charged
        down into the camp as Briggs&#146; warcry ripped the air
        apart. The Orcs were caught by total surprise as the
        party moved upon them. Steel flashed and blood flew,
        Morigane&#146;s spells sent orcs to fiery deaths and the
        sounds of battle raged. Suddenly, Briggs heard the sound
        of a spell cut off in miscast and spun as a heavy set Orc
        slammed his wife to the ground from behind. The orc stood
        over her as she lay there with a smile on his face.
        Briggs saw blood on the club the orc held and went into a
        rage, he covered the distance between them in seconds and
        just as the orc raised the club Briggs&#146; fist slammed
        into the side of his head. Time seemed to stop as the orc
        staggered. His men had finished off the rest of the orcs
        and were seeing to the Lady of the Keep as their Lord
        stood between her and the remaining orc.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Briggs stood there, his breath coming in slow movements
        as his hands clenched the hilt of his axe until blood
        seeped around his fingers. His voice was steady and
        filled with hate as he spoke, &#147;Tell your chieftan
        that I will soon come for him, wait I will tell him
        myself.&#148; His axe flashed and the orcs body fell one
        way as his head fell the other. Slowly he turned and
        pulled his wife into his arms and kissed her gently.
        &#147;Round up the bodies and burn them. Take what
        supplies we can carry and save what horses you can and
        then we go back to the Keep.&#148; He mounted his horse
        and pulled his wife up in front of him and spurred his
        mount into movement.&#148; &#147;Lads, the lady and I
        will meet you back at the Keep. Nothing will bother you
        on your journey back. Don&#146;t worry about us
        we&#146;ll be safe and sound.&#148; Suddenly Mori weaved
        and spell and the men and the equipment were gone. &#147;
        Nae worry love they are safe at the Keep. I just wanted
        some time alone with you&#148; With that he kissed her
        again and together they rode towards home.</font></p>
