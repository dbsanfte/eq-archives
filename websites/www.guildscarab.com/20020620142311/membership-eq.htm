We take the recruitment of new members very seriously, and getting into Scarab is no easy task. However, most people who have put forth the necessary effort to be admitted to the guild believe it is well worth the wait and effort.<BR><BR>
Here are a few guidelines to help you become a recruit, as well as some information about what to expect from the recruitment process.<BR>
To become a recruit, you must do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Introduce yourself to us on our public message board. Tell us about yourself and express your desire to join the guild. Be sure to tell us your reasons for picking Scarab as your guild of choice, let us know of your current guild acquaintances, and tell us what you hope to bring to the Scarab family..</LI>
<LI>Send an email containing a similar message to the <A HREF="mailto:membership@guildscarab.com">Master of Admissions</A> expressing your desire to join the guild..</LI>
<LI>We are recruiting by invitation only, so if you are serious about joining Scarab you must get at least three Elder Members to sponsor your admittance into the guild. Please ask them to post a message of recommendation about you on our Recruitment Message Board.<BR>
We are a large guild, and we pride ourselves on the fact that we've been able to maintain a family feeling and atmosphere in the guild where everyone knows everyone. We feel that if you are unable to find at least three friends in the guild to sponsor you, this probably isn't the right guild for you.<BR>
As a general rule, the more friends you have in the guild, the better your chances of being admitted will be.<BR></LI>
</OL>
Once these three steps have been achieved, we will accept you as an official recruit and add you to the "guildstone" (our term for /guildsay chat) but you must go into /anonymous mode so the Scarab tag is not shown above your character's head until you've completed your recruitment period.<BR>
<BR>
Expect to be a recruit for quite some time. The minimum recruitment time is one month, but it may take longer for a recruit to be admitted into full membership status.<BR>
This long waiting period gives us a chance to get to you know better, but more importantly, it gives you a chance to see if Scarab is the right guild for you.<BR>
<BR>
After we feel that we've gotten to know you fully and feel that you would be a good addition to the guild, you'll be presented with a verbal membership test in-game presented by the Master of Admissions. This test will include questions about the nature of the guild, its leadership structure, important guild concepts, the guild charter, and questions about your personal character. If you review the information contained on our website and put forth a good effort toward getting to know your guildmates you'll do just fine on this test.<BR><BR>
In conclusion, the # 1 best way to get into the guild is this: Hunt with us, group with us, hunt with us, get drunk with us, hunt with us, and when you've done all that, do it all over again.<BR>
<BR>
The recruitment process is long and detailed, so it will take time for the "paperwork" to be handled. So, your main goal should be that when the Master of Admission says "Do we want to let So-And-So become a recruit?" everyone will say "What? You mean he/she isn't one already? Why on earth not?"<BR><BR>
Good luck!<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="head2">Recruits</FONT><BR>
Recruits are players who are seeking membership in Scarab and have been added to the guildstone so they may communicate with guild members.  Recruits must stay in Anonymous mode during their recruitment period so their guild tag does not appear. This is a probationary period that will last a minimum of one month and is gives the us a chance to see if the recruit would be a good addition to the guild. After this recruitment period is over, recruits will meet with the Master of Admissions and will be given a final test. Upon passing this test, they will be made a full member of the guild and will be granted access to our secure web pages.<BR><BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Members</FONT><BR>
Once promoted from the status of Recruit, the member is now a member of the Scarab family. Members are the heart and soul of the guild and are able to vote in guild affairs, elect new Inner Circle members, and be part of a tight knit family of true friends and comrades.<BR><BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Guildmaster</FONT><BR>
This position is the highest level of role-playing leadership and inter-guild diplomacy.  The Guildmaster should be well spoken and levelheaded, intimately familiar with guild policy and game mechanics, and be able to role-play as necessary.<BR>
The Guildmaster will hold this position until they decide to step down, the guild decides to stop playing the current game they are actively involved in, or by a vote to remove the GM is passed by a two/thirds majority of the guild.<BR>

<FONT CLASS="head2">Excellence</FONT> - The tasks and responsibilities of a leader can at times become difficult, time consuming, discouraging, and frustrating. However, no matter what the circumstances, the leaders of Scarab perform their duties to the best of their ability to benefit the entire guild. A leader takes no short cuts, does not look for an easy way out, and always tries to do the best job possible.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Service</FONT> - A leader will always put the needs of members before his or her own. Leaders will never use their position to degrade or put down another member. A leader in Scarab is not in a position of authority. A leader serves the membership.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Integrity</FONT> - Leaders of our guild are held to a higher standard. Any action taken by a leader reflects upon the entire leadership body and upon the entire guild. Leaders will at all times think and act carefully with the highest level of integrity. A leader is a leader at all times, even when nobody is looking.<BR>
