				  It is with Great honor that we announce that <b>Sir Tharian Lightbringer</b>,
Paladin of Scarab has been appointed to the High Council. He has served our
guild with Honor, Valor, and Loyalty and will now take his dedication for
our guild to the next level.<br><br>

he has already been assigned his first Pre-Recruit, whos name is <b>Shau</b>. If
you see <i>Shau</i> please make him feel welcome.<br><br>

least. Shau is one of a few who emailed us prior to closing recruitment, and
were told that they would need to be patient. Those who remained patient are
now getting the chance to join us.<br><br>


<h4>MEDALS AWARDED...</h4>

It is with great honor that we award the following members with the Scarab<br><br>

<b><i>Torch of Loyalty:</i></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Locnar</b> - Who was nominated by a fellow guild member for actions of valor and
loyalty in the dungeon of Befallen. In a hopeless situation Locnars
groupmate told him to save himself, Locnar refused, and through skill and
valor managed to make sure both survived.

<li><b>Geaedin</b> and <b>Russof</b> -  here is a small piece of the nomination email we
received

  <blockquote>"It had been only minutes since our newest member Geaedin and Our
Newest Recruit Russof had left the scheduled meeting Friday Evening
that led to their new titles within the family of Scarab. I
joined with the two of them to celebrate their new positions in the
family. After a few short ales in a tavern we all walked to North Ro
Desert jsut chatting when suddenly a Dwarf named Aamedin (sp?) ran up
to the 2 newest members of the family and told them he was only a
level 5 and had been murdered somewhere in the Desert of North Ro by a
foul beast. (fortunately the gods took pity and gave him a new body)
Aamedin could not remember where his body was in the desert though.
So.....Out 2 newest members took it upon themselves to begin a patrol
around the desert to help the Poor Unfortunate Dwarf find his murdered
body and loot the small amount of items he had acquired in his short
life. It took Geaedin and Russof a bit of time (perhaps 45 minutes)
but they were ble to find the Dwarves body and stood guard while they
brought him to the place he had died and stood watch while the Dwarf
gathered up his belongings. Then they escorted the Dwarf to a safe are
within North Ro and bade him farewell. NEVER did they stop to even
think of themselves during this time!"</blockquote>

<li><b>Selgus</b> - A most heartfelt nomination by a fellow guildmate described a noble
act, After dying and requesting help to recover a corpse, Selgus answered
the call and came from 7 or 8 zones away and proved his loyalty to his
guildmates by standing fast and making sure the corpse recovery was
completed.
</ul><br><br>



<b><i>Blue Star of Scarab:</i></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Ozwyn</b> - Those of you who went to Scarabfest need no further information. His
loyalty, dedication and full out love of this guild and its members is
ALWAYS evident. His purchasing of Scarab polo shirts to hand out and
REFUSING to accept any compensation just is more proof of Ozwyns commitment
to this guild and his guildmates.<br><br>
</ul><br><br>
<b><i>Spirit of Sacrifice:</i></b>
<br>for the month of July for turning in the highest donation amount.
<ul>
<li><b>Amorphia</b>, monk of Scarab. your generosity is incredible.

hail Amorphia, you are hereby awarded the Spirit of Sacrifice.
</ul><br><br>

				 <b>Scarab</b> is proud to announce its first official <b><i>"Tuesday Night Quest"</i></b>.<p>
				 This continues our wonderful tradition of Monday Night Quests, but from now on they
will be on Tuesday nights!<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Who:</b>  All Scarab members, recruits, and friends are invited to attend.<br><br>
<li><b>Where:</b>  Meet in West Freeport.<br><br>
<li><b>When:</b>  9:00 - 12:00 pm EST.  The quest will begin promptly at 9:00, so don't be
late!<br><br>
</ul>
<p>This week's quest is designed to be difficult.  It will demand teamwork,
organization, quick thinking, and above all, ROLE-PLAYING.
Prepare yourself for a solid night of pure role-playing.  This is a quest you
won't want to miss, so come with the intent of having a good time.<br><br>

<p>Very few details about the quest have been released.  For weeks the story has
been shrouded with mystery.  However, several rumors have surfaced.  Here they
are, but be warned... none have been confirmed.<br><br>


<i><blockquote>"Rumor has it that a dwarven warrior who claimed to have information about the
existence and location of the legendary Green Splinted Plaitmail has
mysteriously disappeared.  Kaladim authorities suspect foul play."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A wise oracle of Tunare has suddenly become deathly ill.  Her disease has a
cure, but its ingredients are only found in the farther corners of Norrath..."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A local in the Jade Tiger Inn overheard that Annuit has returned!  Angry at
Gwern's recent marriage to Reighna, she has been gathering an army of undead to
march against Freeport.  She must be stopped!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Phil has been kidnapped!  He was last seen drunk at the Freeport Port Authority
building.  The Freeport Militia have no concrete evidence, but locals suspect
the involvement of a certain "Garant."  A slightly chocolated monk is also known
to have feelings of ill-will toward Phil, but the motives are in dispute."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An oversized tomato has been spotted in multiple locations around Norrath.
This new presence has caught the attention of the evil baker Virten.  The tomato
is powerful, but Virten has many friends.  The future of bakers everywhere is in
jeopardy!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The powerful monk of Scarab named Savatchio has been captured and an imposter
has been put in his place.  Who can tell the difference?  And how can the
imposter be stopped?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A strange new breed of gremlins have surfaced and are currently running amuck.
They have been known to steal experience points while people camp.  They must be
located and stopped or Glolfandil will never reach level 20!"</blockquote>

</i>
None of these rumors have been confirmed, mind you. The only way to find out
what is REALLY going to happen is to come to Scarab's first official Tuesday
Night Quest!<br><br>

</ul>

<b><i>TORCH OF LOYALTY:</i></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Cazora</b>, Enchantress of Scarab - For always being there to enchant for the
guild when called upon, her efforts have helped the guild with jewelry!
Many times she has come running from hunts just to sit and enchant metal
bars.
<br><br>
<li><b>Gwern</b>, For using his secondary character, Nilen, to enchant for lady
whenever called upon. Gwern is always willing to give up play time on his
primary character to help the guild. Many of the silver and electrum jewelry
distributed to the guild was made possible by Gwern.
<br><br>
<li><b>Annuit</b>, One of the prizes given out was a brutechopper axe, a really nice
magical  two handed slashing weapon for dwarfs, trolls, ogres and barb
warriors. Stats almost same as a BBC. Lord Hawke really wanted to add one to
the prize list for the quests. Well, we did, Not because of Hawke, but
because of Annuit. She helped us locate the quest NPC, and then waited
almost ALL day with a secondary character for the NPC to spawn. It was her
selfless devotion to Scarab that helped procure the Ogre War Maul that was
given out as well.
<br><br>
<li><b>Qyen</b>,  Who went and escorted someone he didn't know from Qeynos to
Rivervale, It just so happened to be Aethelwulf, a new recruit, and when
there was problems, Qyen made personal sacrifices to help Aethelwulf without
saying a word to the guild. Aethelwulf made sure to say something though,
and we want to recognize Qyen for his honor, and loyalty to the guild.
<br><br>
<li><b>Rosey</b>, Who on a hunt with fellow members, threw herself in front of Dorn so
that her guildmates could escape. Valor, and loyalty..  She had no chance of
beating Dorn at her level, but the life of her guildmates was more important
then her own. She died in the attempt.
</ul>

				  <b>The Master of Admissions</b>, or the MoA, will be soley responsible for the screening, a
				  ssigning, and promotion of new recruits. <br><br>

The new recruitment procedure will now happen like this:
<ul>
<li>An Email is received to either <b>Guildmasters</b>, or a <a href="mailto:recruitment@guildscarab.com" target="_self" name="Master of Admissions">recruitment@guildscarab.com</a> address.<br><br>

<li>Email forwarded to the <b>MoA</b>.<br><br>

<li>Email screened by the <b>MoA</b>, and then if approved the <b>MoA</b> assigns to the <b>HC</b> for evauluation.<br><br>

<li>During the pre-recruit (or candidate) stage, they (the candidate) must find a full member who is willing to sponser them to full
 member status. This is done by adventuring with as many people as possible. This will also give the guild members more say in the
 overall recruitment procedure.<br><br>

<li>Once the HC feels they are ready, the HC presents the pre-recruit to the MoA. The MoA can consult with the HC and the
 sponser to get information about the candidate. If the MoA feels they are ready, they must adventure with the MoA, and then one
 of the guildmasters. Once approved, the MoA awards them full Recruit status, They are added to the guildstone,
 and moved into /anon status.<br><br>

<li>Recruits are required to remain in that status for at least 14 days. After the 14 days the recruit, his sponser,
and the HC member assigned to him/her will appear before the MoA, a member of the IC, and at least one Guildmaster
to be verbally tested. This will no longer be done in tells. This will be done in the back of the Jade tiger. If the Recruit
 passes all of the questions, then the Gm's, IC, HC, and full member sponser must all vote the recruit as passing
 to full member status. The voting is done live, and in front of the recruit. If the vote passes, the recruit is made full member.<br><br>
</ul>
As you can see, the MoA will assume all duties pertaining to the recruitment of the guild. <br><br>

At <b>no</b> time will there ever be more than 4 candidates/recruits. When one recruit is promoted, then another candidate
can be accepted. <br><br>


This information will be added to the membership page immediatly, and will take effect effective today. <br><br>

Current pre-recruits and recruits are exempt, and will progress according to the old procedures. <br><br>

By vote of the <b>IC</b> and <b>HC</b>, <b><i>Lord Jayfoot Bloomrose</i></b> will now assume the role as Master of Admissions. <br><br>

<h4>Medals awarded</h4>
<i>Torch of Loyalty</i><br><br>
<b>Luman</b><i>, Shaman of Scarab </i>- Always doing for the guild, His ventures with
learning and teaching languages have caught the eye of several of his
guildmates. Combined with his dedicated jewelry selling routes we are proud
to award Luman this Medal.<br><br>

<b>Xixe</b>,<i> Magician of Scarab </i>- For donating the message board script and server
space and putting our guilds name on it. Xixe's dedication to our name is a
humbling thing indeed.<br><br>

<b>Xixe</b>, <i>Magician of Scarab</i> - ( again ) We were hunted down and forced to agree to
recognize you. :) For those of you who havent read it, Xixe took a good deal
of time to help a fledgling Magician learn his way around Norrath. Little
did Xixe know that it was really Gazamel, a vocal member of KOJ trying out a
new class. Xixe lived the Scarab way and now she has to suffer the penalty,
:).<br><br>

<b>Qyen</b>, <i>recruit of Scarab</i> - During a hunt in the Karana's, Qyen gave his life
so that a guildmate could survive. we wish we could post the original
Nomination email, because it really puts things in a much broader
perspective. We award Qyen a Torch of Loyalty.<br><br>

A Torch of Loyalty is going to the following people for their quick response
and dedication to help <b>Bren</b> recover after a loss of equipment. Truly a more
noble and loyal act we cannot think of.<br><br>

<h4>INNER CIRCLE RETIREMENT.</h4>
It is with great sadness and dismay that we announce the retirement of
JaVanno from the Inner Circle. He has stepped down with honor, quoting real
life issues and time constraints as the primary reason. JaVanno has served
the guild and the Inner Circle with Honor, Valor, and Loyalty and his input
on the leadership decisions of Scarab WILL be missed.  He will remain a
member of the guild in full standing.<br><br>

<h4>Medals Awarded</h4>
<i>Bluestar of Scarab</i><br><br>
<b>Bren</b><i>, Dwarven Cleric of Scarab</i> - Maybe Brens new nickname should be Bren,
Giant slayer of Scarab. While in the desert of Ro Bren witnessed a lower
level character who was under attack by a sand giant. Using SoW the lower
level character was barely able to stay away, but one more hit from the SG
would end his life.  Without thinking of his own safety, Bren ATTACKED the
SG, therefore causing it to forget the running lower level, and a life was
saved. This is the ULTIMATE persona of Scarab and deserving of the bluestar.
<br><br>
<b>Thorok</b><i>, Recruit of Scarab</i>- (Wait a second, are we giving a recruit a Blue
Star?) Yes, we certainly are. Without cutting and pasting the nomination
email, lets just say that the person who nominated was having a VERY bad
day, and had suffered one to many deaths. One the verge of what seemed to be
yet another death, Thorok threw himself into the path of a HIGH level mob,
saving a guildmates life with his own.<br><br>

<h3>Guild Meeting Minutes</h3>
<p>We started with a "cleaning" of the bank box, taking 3 backbacks full of
spare gear and handing them out to the guild, Including Lockjaw vests, Mana
bracelets, and mesh armor.<br>

<h4>Election Results</h4>
<p>By popular vote of the guild, High Council members <b>Fishie</b> and <b>Jayfoot</b> have
been promoted and now serve on the Inner Circle. Congratulations to them!
<p>Then came the High Council, Promoting Jayfoot and Fishie left a hole in the
High Council and we needed to fill it. Congratulations go out to:&nbsp;<b>Whip</b>, <b>Renae</b>, and <b>Sivad</b>.

<h4>Medal Awards</h4>
<i>Torch of Loyalty:</i><br><br>
<b>Shurn</b>, His work on improving our web site has been so quiet... Shurn is
always giving, giving and giving and NEVER asking for anything in return.
His dedication to our guild and our family is incredible. Hail Shurn.<br><br>

<b>Sivad</b>, Read his post on the secure page, enough said. Sivad (He also has
reminded us that he has help from Bocaj) has become a one man merchant
route, and he is always bringing things uncommon to our area and freely
gives them to guildmates. His sacrifice and generosity with the guild has
been on a high level since the day he re-joined us. He spends time working
with recruits and we appreciate all of his efforts!<br><br>

<b>Borgu</b>, Always worrying about someone else, and single-handedly acquiring two
sought after weapons and freely giving them to Lord and Lady in the name of
the guild, not to mention the countless times he has sacrificed his time to
assist others. as an example during a MNQ a few weeks back he dropped out of
the competition for a short time to assist a guildmate who had died.<br><br>

<b>Fishie</b>, Without whom the guild would have no money, lets face it, banded
sales have really given us money to spend on jewelcrafting, and on items for
quests. We tried to make sure every spellcaster had a runed totem staff, and
those were purchased with guild funds. Fishies dedication to slave away at
the forge will never be forgotten.<br><br>

<b>Andrak</b>, Another big reason this guild is successful, Andrak also smithed,
without a word of complaint, Guildmates who needed armor, or for making
armor to sell, Andrak has always been there strong in support of the guild
for a long time, and his dedication and honor continue to show!<br><br>
<i>Medal of Honor:</i><br><br>
<p>Then, the Inner Circle made a medal presentation. Lord and Lady Hawke tried
to refuse, but the Inner Circle pulled rank so to speak, and quoted a bylaw
which allowed the Inner Circle to award to the guildmasters the Medal of
Honor. Quoting endless and dedicated service to the guild, The Inner circle of
Scarab awarded <b>Lord</b> and <b>Lady Hawke</b> the Medals of Honor.<br><br>

<i>Spirit of Sacrifice:</i><br><br>

With a total of <font color="Red"><b>1400pp</b></font> personally accounted for, the medal goes to <b>Lady Hawke</b><br><br>

<b>Aanar</b> also turned in a large sum, and is awarded a Spirit of Sacrifice for
his efforts!<br><br>

Thank you all for making this family so successful, together we will only
get better!!<br><br>

And the end of the meeting, <b>Bocaj</b> was invited to join us as an official
recruit! Welcome.<br><br>

Also, just a few nights ago, <b>Cazora</b> and <b>Caradin</b> were promoted to full
member! Congratulations!!<br><br>

DONT FORGET:  Scarabfest 99, Atlantic City, New Jersey, August 6,7,8,9!  Any
of the newer members who would like more information, just email us!<br><br>
