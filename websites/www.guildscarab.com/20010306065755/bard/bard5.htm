                        at night in Surefall Glade. They call it
                        this because newbies are sure to fall
                        into the moat and drown. </font><p><font
                        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I read in
                        the UO Vault (thanks to the link on the
                        SCARAB Contacts page), that I had to find
                        the Ranger guildmaster and give him a
                        letter. So, lo and behold, right there in
                        front of me is a house. I eagerly walk up
                        to the front door (stubling over hidden
                        roots and slamming against trees in the
                        dark - darn these human eyes!). But
                        something's wrong. It doesn't open at my
                        approach. Has the motion detector failed?
                        &quot;Arch&quot; I call out, hoping that
                        something has gone wrong with the
                        holo-emitter. Nope. Nothing. I guess I'm
                        going to have to figure this out by
                        myself. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">So
                        I do what any intellgent person would do
                        when a door doesn't open at their
                        approach. I backed up and got a running
                        start. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm
                        SURE that there are web pages out there
                        that have newbie spawnign points on
                        &quot;internet cams&quot; to watch stuff
                        like this. Someday, someone will compile
                        a tape of these and it will show on
                        America's Most Idiotic People. Needless
                        to say, stampeeding the door didn't work.
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I
                        was about to click on the SIT button and
                        think things through when I saw someone
                        run by. I peered around the corner of the
                        building and saw some other people. Being
                        male, I had absolutely no intention to
                        ask directions on how to open a simple
                        door. At the very least, someone would
                        eventually come out and I could slither
                        past them into the building. Granted, I'd
                        be stuck there until someone opened the
                        door again, but I didn't really consider
                        that at the time. Then the people I was
                        watching started casting spells. Pretty
                        neat looking, but I was a little
                        concerned about WHY they were casting
                        spells. Is there combat going on this
                        close to a newbie spawning point?!?! Then
                        I heard someone say something about
                        bears, and I backed up out of the way. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Now,
                        I had seen another building out there -
                        one with an open doorway. But not only
                        was it on the other side of the glade
                        from me - across bear-infested meadows -
                        but everyone knows that anything worth
                        having will have a door between you and
                        it. I was sure that there was nothing of
                        interest in such an open place. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">As
                        I turned to reconsider the door, the
                        server crashed and I was booted from the
                        game. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A
                        little while later, Lila called me on the
                        phone. As we talked, I managed to
                        reaquire the server (it was very stuborn
                        about letting me back in - probably
                        figured a guy who couldn't open a simple
                        door shouldn't be playing). Well, she
                        talked me through a lot of the details of
                        playing. Like how you need to use the
                        MOUSE to do things. Geez - never crossed
                        my mind to actually CLICK on the door. I
                        was pressing the spacebar, as if I was
                        toting a .45 and expected to see mutant
                        super-nazis on the other side. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Under
                        her expert tutalage, I was able to track
                        down the guildmaster (without falling in
                        the moat), and give him my letter. It was
                        only after this 15-minute long search
                        that I found out it would have been a lot
                        easier if I had just clicked on the Track
                        button. How green can newbie rangers be
                        if this isn't the first thing they do
                        when they drop into Norrath? But once I
                        was able to track, I wanted to track
                        EVERYTHING. I noticed one of those
                        grizzly bears people were yelling about
                        in the Track menu, so I clicked on it and
                        set out. Unfortunately (or rather,
                        &quot;fortunately&quot;), I never got to
                        see a bear. They were all apparently
                        clustered at the top of an unscalable
                        cliff. And no matter how many dwarfs I
                        stacked on that pile, I couldn't climb to
                        the top. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Then
                        I saw a PK run buy. I just about lost
                        bowel control. Sorry - inbred reaction.
                        Then I realized that he was POWERLESS
                        AGAINST ME - MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I actually
                        followed him for a bit until he
                        disappeared down a dark tunnel. I tried
                        to pry a torch from a nearby wall, but it
                        wouldn't give. So I set off in the dark,
                        fully expecting to be eaten by something.
                        I could barely make out my feet in front
                        of me, but I managed to come through the
                        tunnel unscathed. By then, dawn had ...
                        well .... dawned, and I could see again
                        (well, &quot;for the first time&quot;).
                        Wonderful sunrise - red-tinged clouds
                        floating calmly past (oh - did I mention
                        the thunderstorm that I was caught in
                        while in the Glade? unbelieveable!).
                        There were also a bunch of friendly
                        looking guards, and several other people
                        who must have been other players. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">At
                        this point (right before I actually
                        encountered anything dangerous), Lila
                        said goodbye and hung up. Her advice was
                        to find a nice snake or bat to kill.
                        Well, why should I kill them if they're
                        NICE?! But, as always, I took her advice.
                        Using my newly discovered tracking skill,
                        I made out into the countryside in search
                        of prey. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
                        only thing I hadn't considered was that
                        the prey was out there looking for ME. No
                        - not the nice snakes, rats and bats of
                        the world (of which I killed many - both
                        my 9 yr old son and I laughing joyously
                        as they collapsed onto the 3D hillside).
                        My problems were with the skeletons. I
                        was tracking a particularly fat rat
                        toward an arrangement of monoliths. Then,
                        as I raised my sword to strike, two or
                        thee skeletons spawned around me and
                        quickly cut me down. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I
                        approached the monoliths a bit more
                        carefully when went back to retrieve my
                        one snakeskin, two bat wings and one rat
                        hide that comprised my accumilated
                        treasure. No skeletons in sight - good.
                        All the while, mind you, my son is
                        sitting behind me saying &quot;I told you
                        not to go up there, dad! I told you that
                        abandoned temples were bad places!&quot;
                        (elbow to the ribs - HIS, not mine) So I
                        managed to find my corpse and get back my
                        booty. Whilst killing a rat on my way
                        out, I noticed a skeleton spawn in the
                        background, then collapse into a pile of
                        bones. &quot;Cool,&quot; I thought. Free
                        booty. But it hadn't been explained to me
                        that skeletons play possum. I took two
                        steps toward it and it popped back up and
                        waxed me good. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">So,
                        my initiation into the world had begun. I
                        adventured a bit more after that, but
                        after another rat knocked me unconscious
                        and proceeded to chew my face off (the
                        program, of course, forcing me to watch
                        from above), the program locked up again
                        and I called it quits for the night. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm
                        looking forward more than ever to getting
                        together with everyone else next week. I
                        think that if we get six or seven of us,
                        and a running start, we might be able to
                        get through that door. :) </font></p>
