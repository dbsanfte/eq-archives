<td colspan="3">                     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jayfoot Bloomrose                       was born in Rivervale over 45 years ago. His parents were                       both farmers who enjoyed their life of tilling the soil.                       Jayfoot was always in inquisitive young man who would spend                       his days searching throughout Rivervale for something to                       do. He found it when the Fool's Gold was built in the center                       of town. At the Fool's Gold he learned what life was all                       about - Living life to its fullest and always take chances.                       
<br>                      <br>                      It was this desire to take chances that led this middle                       aged halfling to decide to see the world of Norrath. He                       traveled many years, learning to weild weapons and learning                       his mind was his most dangerous weapon. Jayfoot also learned                       to put the Halfling natural skills of hiding and walking                       quietly to good use. He became a usefull scout and adventurer                       especially when he learned that his inquisitve mind could                       quickly deduce where traps would be laid and how difficult                       locks could be undone. 
<br>                      <br>                      It was during these journeys that he met Sir Gregor, a member                       of Scarab (a guild that favored valour, honor and truth).                       He spent many a day and night traveling with Gregor learning                       of these values and beginning to believe that this young                       paladin was correct. He traveled to Freeport with Gregor                       and met Lord and Lady Hawke who convinced him that the ideals                       of Scarab were things he strived for in his own life. Jayfoot                       became a recruit of Scarab and begin the rigerous training                       he would need if he was to truly become a full Guild member.                       
<br>                      <br>                      One of the toughest things for Jayfoot to overcome was his                       innate curiosity, things had a tendacy to fall into his                       hands. He still loves shiny jewels, beautiful weapons and                       more but he is beginning to realize that these items have                       owners and when he finds them on the floor or laying around                       that he should try to return them to their owners right                       away instead of putting it off till later.Jayfoot is very                       proud that the members of the Inner Council saw fit to invite                       a Halfling into the glorious ranks of Scarab and he hopes                       that this guild will further his life goals of having fun                       and taking chances.
