We take the recruitment of new members very seriously, and getting into Scarab is no easy task. However, most people who have put forth the necessary effort to be admitted to the guild believe it is well worth the wait and effort.<BR><BR>
Here are a few guidelines to help you become a recruit, as well as some information about what to expect from the recruitment process.<BR>
To become a recruit, you must do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Introduce yourself to us on our public message board. Tell us about yourself and express your desire to join the guild. Be sure to tell us your reasons for picking Scarab as your guild of choice, let us know of your current guild acquaintances, and tell us what you hope to bring to the Scarab family..</LI>
<LI>Send an email containing a similar message to the <a href="mailto:dtamburin@yahoo.com
">Stallari</a>
  expressing your desire to join the guild..</LI>
<LI>We are recruiting by invitation only, so if you are serious about joining Scarab you must get at least three Elder Members to sponsor your admittance into the guild. Please ask them to post a message of recommendation about you on our Recruitment Message Board.<BR>
We are a large guild, and we pride ourselves on the fact that we've been able to maintain a family feeling and atmosphere in the guild where everyone knows everyone. We feel that if you are unable to find at least three friends in the guild to sponsor you, this probably isn't the right guild for you.<BR>
As a general rule, the more friends you have in the guild, the better your chances of being admitted will be.<BR></LI>
</OL>
Once these three steps have been achieved, we will accept you as an official recruit and add you to the "guildstone" (our term for /guildsay chat) but you must go into /anonymous mode so the Scarab tag is not shown above your character's head until you've completed your recruitment period.<BR>
<BR>
Expect to be a recruit for quite some time. The minimum recruitment time is one month, but it may take longer for a recruit to be admitted into full membership status.<BR>
This long waiting period gives us a chance to get to you know better, but more importantly, it gives you a chance to see if Scarab is the right guild for you.<BR>
<BR>
After we feel that we've gotten to know you fully and feel that you would be a good addition to the guild, you'll be presented with a verbal membership test in-game presented by the
Huskarlar-Jarl. This test will include questions about the nature of the guild, its leadership structure, important guild concepts, the guild charter, and questions about your personal character. If you review the information contained on our website and put forth a good effort toward getting to know your guildmates you'll do just fine on this test.<BR><BR>
In conclusion, the # 1 best way to get into the guild is this: Hunt with us, group with us, hunt with us, get drunk with us, hunt with us, and when you've done all that, do it all over again.<BR>
<BR>
The recruitment process is long and detailed, so it will take time for the "paperwork" to be handled. So, your main goal should be that when the
Huskarlar-Jarl says "Do we want to let So-And-So become a recruit?" everyone will say "What? You mean he/she isn't one already? Why on earth not?"<BR><BR>
Good luck!<BR><BR>

These guild ranks are for in-game activity and roleplaying purposes only. They are designed to give members a constant source of richness, depth, character, roleplay, and progression within the bounds of warring Midgard. Midgard is at war, and Scarab's structure reflects that of a military structure, but the ranks revolve around what Scarab is all about. They are designed to promote Scarab values and friendships through an ongoing series of quests which will both challenge, enlighten, and entertain.
They are NOT designed to promote segregation or the formation of cliques within the guild. Ranks are not meant to separate members, but rather pull them together as they work for their mutual advancement.
In past games, Scarab has always awarded people a roleplay title of "Knight," and these ranks expand upon those same lines. No one is required or compelled to advance through these ranks. They are merely in place for your benefit and enjoyment.
</p>
Also, please note that most of the ranks will not be listed here at this time. We're taking this one step at a time, so only the most pertinent ranks will be listed. We'll unveil the following ranks as they are more fully designed to suit the needs and wants of the guild.
</p>
That being said, here are the ranks of Scarab's new membership structure:
</p>
<strong>Jarl</strong>
The Jarl is the supreme leader of the guild.
Dolvin Stormblade is the Jarl of Scarab.
</p>
<strong>Stallari</strong>
The Stallari is the overseeing Marshal of Scarab's forces.
Spark Kokaubeam serves in this role. Spark basically takes care of all membership-related issues, as well as any other assignments delegated to him specifically by Jarl Dolvin.
These two ranks are on the high-end of the structure. Now, here are the more applicable ranks which include everyone else.
</p>
<strong>Nyr</strong>
Nyrs are the basic "Recruits" of Scarab. They are those who the guild deems worthy of a portion of trust, to the point of being evaluated on a personal level. They are granted a guildstone (access to guild chat), and for a period of at least one month they are to be evaluated by the guild members while they see for themselves if Scarab is truly the right guild for them.
After his or her one-month recruitment period and when the guild has evaluated the Nyr and feels that he or she is worthy of admittance, the Nyr will be presented a final test by the Stallari. Successful completion of this will qualify the Nyr for advancement to the next rank -- the Drengr.
To become a Nyr, an individual must confront the Stallari face to face, introduce himself/herself, and humbly request admittance into the guild under the rank of Nyr. If the Stallari deems the individual fit for service, he will then call upon the guild asking for three Guides to step forward, asserting their support and vouching for the character of the individual seeking admittance.
These three Guides must all be of the rank Huskarlar, and they must be available at the time the individual confronts the Stallari. If three Guides are found in support of the individual, the individual is promptly granted a guildstone and the rank of Nyr, thus beginning the recruitment process.
It will be the duty of the three Guides to ensure that the Nyr is taught in the ways of the guild. Guides will answer for any wrong-doings of the Nyr for which they pledged their support. Success of the Nyr will bring honor upon the names of the Guides, and failure of the Nyr will bring shame upon the names of the Guides.
</p>
<strong>Drengr</strong>
The rank of Drengr is that of those who have recently completed their recruitment process and are finalizing their membership through an Initation quest.
This Initation will be aided by supporting guild members, and the details of this quest are yet to be revealed.
Upon completion of this Initation, Drengrs advance to the rank of Huskarlar.
</p>
<strong>Huskarlar</strong>
The rank of Huskarlar is for all those who have diligently proven their worth to the guild. These Members hold great honor in the sight of their Jarl, even to the point of being entrusted with the responsibilities of admitting new members to the forces.
Huskarlars achieve their own progression not by striving for their own success, but rather by lifting up those beneath them. Symbolic of this, to advance to the following rank of Voror, Huskarlars must either serve as a Guide for a Nyr or serve in some capacity of a Drengr Initation quest. Thus, the prepetuation of Scarab's values and prowess is maintained by the service of the Huskarlars.
A Huskarlar wishing to vouch for the worth of a Nyr and serve as the Nyr's Guide ought to take great care. Volunteering as a Nyr's Guide implies acceptance of the responsibility to teach the Nyr the ways of the Guild and to accept responsiblity for the actions, both good and bad, of the Nyr. During the Nyr's recruitment period, three Guides will take the Nyr under their wings and prepare the Nyr for the upcoming final test administered by the Stallari. A Huskarlar may only have the charge of one Nyr at any given time.
When Huskarlars have served in their position adequately, they may be considered for advancement to the rank of Voror.
</p>
<strong>Voror</strong>
The rank of Voror is for those who watch over the guild, maintain an eye of vigilance, strive for the guild's benefit, and work for its success.
</p>
<strong>Pegn</strong>
The rank of Pegn, or Battle Commander, is primarily concerned with the guild's RvR capabilities. Therefore, Pegn's directly responsible for the following duties, and events planned or directives issued by the Pegn in these matters should be considered the same as coming from the Jarl.<br>
<br>
Planning exp groups<br>
Equipping of the guild<br>
Leading Scarab in alliance raids (when the Jarl is the Alliance Commander - when he is not, the Pegn is the second in command)<br>
Training the younger guild members in RvR (i.e., explaining the method of keep assaults)<br>
Training members in siege equipment operation, and developing new weapons for use such as catapults and ballistas<br>
Ensuring that guild craftsmen get advanced in their skill through multiple players on the account and dumping gold to the craftsmen.<br>

<FONT CLASS="head2">Excellence</FONT> - The tasks and responsibilities of a leader can at times become difficult, time consuming, discouraging, and frustrating. However, no matter what the circumstances, the leaders of Scarab perform their duties to the best of their ability to benefit the entire guild. A leader takes no short cuts, does not look for an easy way out, and always tries to do the best job possible.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Service</FONT> - A leader will always put the needs of members before his or her own. Leaders will never use their position to degrade or put down another member. A leader in Scarab is not in a position of authority. A leader serves the membership.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Integrity</FONT> - Leaders of our guild are held to a higher standard. Any action taken by a leader reflects upon the entire leadership body and upon the entire guild. Leaders will at all times think and act carefully with the highest level of integrity. A leader is a leader at all times, even when nobody is looking.<BR>
