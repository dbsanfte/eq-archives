                    <p><font face="arial">There seems to be some confusion about 
                     us. You are probably saying to yourself, "Ok, just what 
                      the heck IS SCARAB"? Allow me to help clarify. SCARAB is 
                      a guild, and the dictionary describes a Guild as a "professional 
                      group, union or society". Out of those three terms I think 
                      the work society best describes us. SCARAB is a guild, err, 
                      a society of people who play online games, most recently 
                      of which is EverQuest, a real 3D massively multiplayer online 
                      RPG. We do more than just play the game though. We interact, 
                      we roleplay, and we let some things about ourselves come 
                      out we normally would not. <br>
                      <br>
                      In both a roleplaying, and real life sense SCARAB was founded 
                      to promote Honor, Loyalty, and Valor. Members of SCARAB 
                      feel strongly about these issues in real life, and therefore 
                      strive to promote them in the media of an online Role Playing 
                      game. We do not promote Player Killing activity, which is 
                      the practice of killing a character within the game for 
                      malacious or unwarrented reasons. We do not activly seek 
                      out to hunt these people either, instead focusing our energies 
                      on the concepts we hold to be true, Honor, Valor, and Loyalty. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Within the game we hunt evil monsters, and play our characters 
                      to the full extent of the game, and we get to know our fellow 
                      guildmates. We become a family. If you believe that an Online 
                      RPG should be played with the concept of helping others, 
                      and having fun, without taking the fun away from others 
                      then perhaps SCARAB is what you are looking for. <br>
