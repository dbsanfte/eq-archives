My skills continued to develop at a rapid pace.  Master Jrool taught me well in all the arcane arts, but this was not all he taught me.  He told me great tales from afar and taught me the histories of the High Elven kind.  I learned about ancient empires and glorious civilizations.<BR><BR>
Master Jrool also taught me about the barbaric and uncivilized races that had overrun many parts of the land of Norrath.  Although he didn't go into many details, he told me that the foreign races were very inferior to High Elves, and that High Elves alone would be responsible for restoring Norrath to its former glory.  He taught me that my homeland of Felwithe, where I had spent my entire life, was one of the last outposts of civilized people.  I accepted this without questioning, because I knew that Master Jrool would not lie.<BR><BR>
And then it happened.<BR><BR>
One day, while running an errand for a local in Felwithe, I passed a strange traveler.  He slightly resembled drawings I'd seen of Erudites, but I'd never seen a real Erudite before, so I could not be sure what race he was.  He was young - only slightly older than I was (I was in my early teens).  I extended a common greeting to him as I approached, and much to my surprise he bowed before me.  This was entirely unexpected.  Sure, I'd seen countless travelers bow before the great magi of Felwithe, but I was only a small boy.  Why would he bow before me?<BR><BR>
I stopped in my tracks and inquired what business had brought him to Felwithe.  He replied that he had traveled from his home in Erudin to learn the arcane sciences from the Elves.<BR><BR>
"You've come to the right place, my friend," I said.  "There are none more masterful with things arcane than the Elves who live among these spires."<BR><BR>
He bowed before me again, and we went our separate ways.  I wouldn't have thought much of that incident, but the fact that he bowed before me impressed me somehow.  So, I told Master Jrool about the experience the next time we met.<BR><BR>
"The traveler is wise," Master Jrool commented.  "Anyone with half a brain would chose to come here."  Nothing else was said about the matter.  Obviously Master Jrool was unimpressed by the traveler, but I could not see why.  I was very intrigued.<BR><BR>
I saw the traveler again that day at roughly sundown.  He was leaving the tavern, and I asked him where he was planning on going.<BR><BR>
"I'm going hunting tonight," he said calmly.  "The are rumors that the Orcs are on the rise.  I intend to see for myself.  Would you like to come along?"<BR><BR>
"Now?"  I could hardly believe my ears.  "You hunt?  I thought you studied the magic arts…"<BR><BR>
"I do," he replied with an odd look in his eyes.  "But I've got to make a living somehow, don't I?"<BR><BR>
I didn't know what to say, so I just blurted out a question that I'd been wondering about him.  "How did you get here?  Aren't you rather young to be traveling?"<BR><BR>
An amused smile came across his face.  "You don't get out much, do you?  I had to cross three continents and two oceans to get from my home to Felwithe.  And, believe it or not, I made the trip when I was younger than you are now."  He looked at the setting sun.  "It's getting dark.  I need to hurry… my partner is waiting for me.  Do you want to come along or not?"<BR><BR>
"I… I…" I stuttered…<BR><BR>
"You don't hunt?  Then come along.  I'll teach you.  A good hunting group can always use another good caster."<BR><BR>
"You mean you hunt with magic?" I asked.  This thought had never fully occurred to me.<BR><BR>
Without even telling anyone, I followed the Erudite across the great marble bridge and out the Felwithe Gate.  I'd never before been outside the gate, and I was amazed at what I saw.  Awe inspiring trees stretched toward the stars that glistened in the night.  A path was worn through the undergrowth, and we followed this path until we came to an elf lying casually against a tree.  The Erudite introduced me to his partner, Feradoen, a Wood Elf Ranger who would be our guide during the hunt.<BR><BR>
Despite the Wood Elves' inferiority to High Elves, I was very impressed by the ranger's skill at guiding us through the forest at night.  Feradoen led us deep into the forest, beyond the path, and into the darkness.  I looked back, but there was no sign of the great bonfires near the Gate entrance.  Only an endless forest of majestic trees stretched out in every direction.<BR><BR>
We soon came to a clearing, and there it was.<BR><BR>
In the clearing there were several very large and very thick trees.  They naturally caused my eyes to look upward.  As my eyes started following them upward to see their tops, they were interrupted by something halfway up, roughly the size of a city.<BR><BR>
It was a city - what an incredible city!  A majestic city built of huge platforms and great bridges high in the trees stretched back into the mist.  It was huge, and it all was in the air!<BR><BR>
My jaw dropped at the sight.  Feradoen only chuckled.  "Welcome to Kelethin - my home," he said and then continued on his way.  I didn't follow him.  I was too busy staring in amazement at the great and wondrous city to notice that they even left.<BR><BR>
The sight of Kelethin stirred something deep inside me.  Up to that point, I'd believed that Wood Elves, as well as all other outside races, were inferior to High Elves.  But, if this were true, how then could they possibly construct such an amazing city?  Could a barbaric race build something so incredible?  I couldn't believe that it was possible, so there was only one other explanation.  Perhaps the Wood Elves aren't as barbaric as I'd been taught.<BR><BR>
And furthermore, if such an astounding city existed in my own forest - within walking distance from Felwithe - what other wonders lie beyond the reaches of the forest?  What other noble races are out there, and what mysteries do their civilizations hold?<BR><BR>
It was at that moment that I first knew that Felwithe was no longer my true home.  Felwithe could no longer satisfy me.  I had questions - thousands of them - that Felwithe couldn't answer.  I wanted to travel, explore, and see the wonders of Norrath!  However, I was soon to learn that'd I'd need much more experience in the wild in order to make this dream come true.<BR><BR>
When my group noticed I was no longer with them, they came back for me and found me pondering my new and incredible thoughts.  They snapped me out of my daze and informed me that they'd tracked down a small band of wandering Orcs that had been harassing the local people lately.  We immediately set out to put this Orc threat down.<BR><BR>
During the course of that night, we hunted and slew many Orcs.  I was disgusted at the vile creatures, and I felt a deep sense of duty to rid to world of them.  My Erudite companion had taught me how to use my spells to assist the party.  He asked me if I could summon a burst of flame.  Of course I could do that - it was a very basic concept that I'd almost mastered.  Then, he taught me how to aim my thoughts in such a way as to summon the flame burst right on the Orcs' skin.  To my amazement, it worked!  I successfully could cast a burst of flame, and I'd watch the vile beasts' flesh ignite and burn away.<BR><BR>
After a long and hard night of battling the vicious demons, we headed home.  As the dawn broke, I slowly plodded my way back through the Felwithe Gate.  I was gashed and bruised badly, yet I felt a deep feeling of satisfaction.  I'd used my powers for good, and I had an entirely new future open before me.<BR><BR>
Despite the severe punishments I received for my unwarranted actions, I was not to be deterred.  I made up my mind that I'd do much more adventuring in the future.  My new life had just begun…<BR><BR>
