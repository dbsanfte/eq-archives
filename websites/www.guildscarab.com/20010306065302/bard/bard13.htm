        face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Hail, elf friend, let us stop!
        Want a draught of real draft? Or do you insist on
        drinking that elvish wine?&quot; Grimden, dour as any
        dwarf, had kept up the fast pace across the desert. The
        dwarf stopped as Glolfandil did, just 2 steps ahead, and
        looked out across the desert, drinking deep and long from
        his leather quaff. The heat rose across the sand,
        shimmering, creating mirages of water pools. &quot;Well,
        Grim, me thinks we have quite a distance afore we reach
        the swamp. If we avoid those foul orcs, then perhaps we
        shall live to fulfill the quest!&quot; Glolfandil, a tall
        half-elf, broke into a handsome smile and laughed
        musically - tones of soft harp emitting from his chest as
        he laughed. The dwarf added, &quot;Aye, then to find that
        foul Froglok stronghold, kill a young tadpole then back
        again. Let us not be slain by giant folk either. Remember
        they wander this desert as well.&quot; </font><p><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Yes they do my
        friend, but as long as I can play this spellsong, we
        shall move too quick for them.&quot; Glolfandil finished
        off his pint of elvish wine - dark and oaky, like the
        forest near Kelethin. He laughed once more, brushed off
        his armor and began to palm-beat his drum, softly then
        quicker. A dazzling light broke out around Grimden and
        Glolfandil. Their legs begin to strengthen and burning
        energy filled them. Then in a quick lope, Glolfandil
        broke out across the desert, Grimden right behind him.
        Desert sand rose behind them -all for miles could see
        their dust. But it did not matter, no orc would catch
        them - not even a horse could run as fast as they! Nay,
        an eagle might not fly that fast. They ran like cheetahs
        but for miles not yards. They ran with a full breath,
        never failing, with the breeze of air cooling their face.
        They barely touched the desert floor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The sun began to
        fall to the east. &quot;The mountains are not far, Glol.
        We are near the swamp. We must have run 200 miles today.
        A half fortnight's march if there ever was one!&quot;
        Glolfandil laughed, musical tones again emitting.
        &quot;Aye, Grim, there is some use for a bard after all.
        But thee shall earn your treasure as well when the swords
        start to swing. Never forget that I sing, I dance, I love
        and I play. But thy blade shall ensure we live.&quot;
        Grimden grimaced. The thought of swimming through the
        mosquito and snake infested swamp begin to fill his mind.
        &quot;Perhaps we should rest in the canyon before we
        enter the swamp. Start fresh and anew at day's beginning
        in the morrow.&quot; Glolfandil smiled and nodded. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The last few miles
        to the canyon unraveled before them and at last they came
        to desert's end and the forest - the forest filled with
        orc marauders no less. &quot;We shall run pass the orc
        camps as quickly as we may. Then to the canyon. We shall
        camp along some cave or old, forgotten abode when we get
        there, &quot; declared Glolfandil. Through the forest
        they ran. It was a lightly treed oak forest. Cleared long
        ago by orcs, it was easy to run. The pair ran within
        spitting distance of an orc camp. The guards never knew
        they passed, but Grimden and Glolfandil could hear their
        harsh laughter and feel the heat of their large camp
        pyres. &quot;Probably laughing at the end of some poor
        troll babe, &quot; Grimden remarked, &quot;Mayhap a
        froglok's death - let us be swift so it is not about our
        own demise.&quot; Grimden grinned slyly. At last, 2 hours
        past dark, the two adventurers came to the near-safety of
        the canyon. A few moments later, Grimden stretched out
        asleep, pack and armor still on, as Glolfandil watched
        the small campfire crackling warmness across his face.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The two friends
        ate a breakfast of dried beef and crusted elf wafers in
        silence. The next several days would be unpleasant.
        Poisonous snakes, alligators and carnivorous frogloks
        infested a stagnant, gas-filled and rotten forest.
        Glolfandil's running song would not be of much use there.
        Quicksand and alligator nests (sudden deep round holes
        underneath the murky waters) were too frequent. Careful,
        slow steps would be required. They packed up slowly and
        began to walk down the canyon path. The canyon descended
        slowly. The air humidified till breathing was an exerting
        exercise. The trees changed from pine and maple to
        cypress, water oak and cedar. The soil became dark and
        loamy, each footprint began to sink into the earth and
        become filled with black water. The smell changed. From
        piney, fresh highland air to sulfurous, thick and
        decaying. Every dead thing seemed to wreak and fill the
        air. Then the canyon disappeared and a great misty,
        watery forest lay ahead. One final drop from the canyon,
        and the swamp's great maw engulfed all things. No wind
        blew.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">They trodded east,
        still silent, trying to skirt the depths of the swamp. It
        was an impossible task. &quot;Gukluk lies southeast of
        the swamp. Shall we skirt the swamp to its entrance or
        hunt the swamp itself?&quot; asked Glolfandil. Then the
        battle began. Frogloks, hiding in the watery blackness,
        leaped out and began to hop-run toward the two. Grimden
        pulled his axes out and ran to meet them.
        &quot;Khazad!&quot; the dwarven warrior shouted.
        Glolfandil pulled his dagger and sword and readied
        himself for the onslaught. They came in waves. Three
        leaped clumsily at Grimden and in cat-like fashion
        Grimden avoided their blows. Three chops with his dwarven
        axes and three Frogloks were howling, missing arms and
        legs. Glolfandil slipped his dagger into the side of one
        Froglok, avoided the claw of another and chopped down
        with Dragon's Claw, his magic sword, slicing into the
        skull, then brains, of another froglok. As quickly as it
        began, it ended. Three Frogloks lay dead. Several more
        retreated into the swamp. An alligator made quick meal of
        a severely wounded one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Let us leave
        this foul place and be hurried,&quot; Grimden shouted.
        &quot;They may come back with frog friends.&quot;
        &quot;Aye, dwarf, they may at that,&quot; the half-elf
        agreed. Quickly and fruitlessly searching the frogloks
        for their quest item, the pair half jogged, half waded
        the swamp. Hours of sweating, difficult wading through
        mud and water later, they fell exhausted onto a small
        islet. They slept unguarded and oblivious to the dangers.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Hours later,
        Glolfandil awoke, bird-sized mosquitoes feeding on him.
        &quot;Argh, you devilish, beasts! Away with you! He
        swatted one with his backpack. It staggered slightly then
        buzzed off for a less aggressive prey. &quot; &quot;Never
        such mosquitoes have I seen,&quot; Grimden rumbled.
        &quot;I think we need blade and armor to battle them
        rather than a flyswatter.&quot; They laughed heartily at
        such thought. &quot;The Lord and Lady would surely find
        in their hearts to award us both with a medal if we slew
        those beasts!&quot; blurted out Glolfandil as he lay,
        tears rolling down his cheeks. &quot;Aye, mayhap we
        should call Andrak and Frostfyre to battle them,&quot;
        Grimden guffawed. There, on that islet in the middle of
        doom's own swamp, the two roared in laughter till the
        thoughts of another day's dreaded travel entered their
        minds. They ate, spirits more upbeat, then washed as well
        as they could.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The swamp
        swallowed them once more as they continued their journey.
        The sun and humidity beat on them this day. &quot;Perhaps
        this swamp has its own mind!&quot; Grimden declared.
        &quot;Yesterday it fights us with frogloks, today it
        sends heat and insects!&quot; &quot;Aye,&quot; Glolfandil
        agreed, &quot;It knows we are not its children. I fear it
        seeks to expel us from its bowels.&quot; &quot;I do not
        like that analogy, Glol,&quot; the grim dwarf answered.
        The heat bore down on them more with every step, till the
        very air itself seemed a burden on them. The armor became
        heavier. Their clothes filled with water, boots mushy
        inside with warm, wet swamp cess. Yet they traipsed
        across the swamp till night fell once more. Grimden wiped
        his axes down with an oil cloth. The campfire's flames
        licked several fish they had caught in the swamp. The
        dwarf swigged another draught from his aleskin. &quot;Two
        hundred miles two days before and only 20 miles the last
        pair of days. How far must we travel?&quot; Glolfandil
        stared out into the swamp. He sipped wine slowly and
        nibbled on a wafer. &quot;I would guess another day,
        perhaps two.&quot; He paused. &quot;Assuming the troll
        bashers do not kill us. A ranger like Tialla we could use
        out here to avoid their kind.&quot; Grimden nodded,
        &quot;Aye, Glol, but then she would have a share of our
        treasure would she not?&quot; Grimden bit off a huge
        piece of hardened bread. &quot;We are better off finding
        our own way.&quot; Glolfandil looked serious for a rare
        moment. &quot;Your dwarvish greed shines through, Grim.
        It will not be long and we will miss both her wits and
        her sword.&quot; &quot;Likely enough,&quot; Grimden
        yawned. &quot;And for that, Glol, you keep watch the
        first shift.&quot; A second later, loud dwarvish snores
        rocked the swamp.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">It was two days
        later when the pair of friends found Gukluk. It was hard
        for even Glolfandil's sharp eyes to see, hidden in moss
        and trees. But alas, it was the entrance to the Froglok
        stronghold. &quot;I hear we need not go far in, Grim.
        There are tadpoles just inside and we should not risk
        going too deep.&quot; Grimden looked into the hole to the
        entrance. &quot;These frogloks are worse than goblins.
        They must have carved this out with their own claws and
        fangs. It's a wonder it does not collapse!&quot; Grimden
        did a few mental calculations of the weight to support
        ratios. All dwarves learn this before finished weaning.
        He paused. &quot;Mayhap magic supports it. Or maybe its
        not deep. But that entrance should not stand but collapse
        on itself.&quot; He scratched his banded coif absently.
        With eyes of determination he stated, &quot;Lets go
        in.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">With Glolfandil
        leading they entered the swamp cavern. It was cooler than
        outside but wet and the footing was treacherous. Green
        slime covered a slick mud floor. Roots and snakes and
        worse hung from a muddy ceiling. Eyes stared from
        darkness beyond reach. And the constant croaking of
        Frogloks filled the air. &quot;We only want their eyes,
        Grim. Just the tadpole eyes.&quot; The cavern wound for a
        number of yards, perhaps 40 to 50 before opening into a
        chamber. Beyond the chamber a hallway angled down. And in
        that chamber two Froglok tadpoles flopped in the muck.
        &quot;Weapons!&quot; shouted Grimden and hacked one down
        before it could move. Glolfandil quickly slit the other.
        He bent down over the dead tadpoles, &quot;We look for an
        open iris. The Lady said only an open iris.&quot;
        &quot;None,&quot; Grimden grimaced. Several hours later
        of ambushing tadpoles no sign of an open iris eye was
        found. &quot;Mayhap we are slaying them wrong!&quot;
        sniped Grimden. &quot;Perchance, Grim. Or maybe we hunt
        the wrong beast. Let us delve deeper.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The hunting would
        not take long. A pair of froglok guards awaited them in
        the next room and, by them, flopped a tadpole. Grimden
        quickly axed the tadpole into two wiggling parts. The
        guards croaked a roar and leaped onto Grimden trying to
        tear him apart bare handed. A quick swipe of his axe cut
        a deep gash into the arm of one pugler. It retreated
        screaming a croak to wake the dead as the other leaped
        onto Grimden. Glolfandil stabbed with his dirk, Dragon's
        Fang, at the froglok. It screamed as well. Grimden
        silenced its scream with a chop of his axe. &quot;Get the
        other,&quot; Glolfandil yelled as he chased the wounded
        froglok. Too late. The wounded froglok came back. And
        with him two more guards. Glolfandil and Grimden fiercely
        struck forward. Sword and dirk and axe hacked and stabbed
        at the guards. In less than a minute, all three guards
        retreated. &quot;They seek help me thinks, Glol. Let us
        return to the entrance where we can fight them, backs to
        wall.&quot; They raced to the opening chamber and just in
        time. Four guards poured into the room. Grimden was
        nicked by a froglok sword this time. Blood poured from
        his right arm. A froglok fell before his axe.
        &quot;Grimden, there are too many,&quot; Glolfandil
        panted, &quot;Each time we wound them, they leave to get
        more. Get ready to leave this evil place. I will fight
        them till thee is out of harm's way.&quot; Another pair
        of frogloks charged into the room. The fighting was
        fierce and another fell, sliced head to toe by
        Glolfandil's sword, Dragon's Claw. &quot;Dragon's Claw
        and Dragon's Fang strike true!!!!!&quot; screamed
        Glolfandil. &quot;Khazad!&quot; shouted Grimden. And in
        unision, &quot;Hail Scarab!&quot; Then, as quickly as it
        began, the battle ended. Three frogloks lay dead. Five
        retreated down the hall. Both elf and dwarf were bloodied
        from nicks and bites. &quot;Let us leave while we
        can,&quot; Glolfandil muttered. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Glolfandil turned
        and the pair exited, defeated, from Gukluk. &quot;That is
        an evil place of cowardice!&quot; shouted Grimden.
        &quot;Argh! They retreat and get more! Why can they not
        die bravely and quietly and without help?&quot;
        Glolfandil laughed, &quot;Mayhap they said same of you,
        friend. Especially those tadpoles.&quot; Glolfandil began
        to strum his lute. His voice, lovely as a lark, began to
        sing. Blue stars of light danced around the two
        adventurers. And each time one would touch a wound, it
        would heal just a little. Grimden grinned, &quot;I LIKE
        bards!&quot; Glolfandil smiled, &quot;I LIKE warrior
        dwarf friends too, my friend. Now don't you miss
        Tialla?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Hello?&quot;
        a squeaky voice spoke. &quot;Who are thee? Friend or
        foe?,&quot; it proclaimed. From a bush, a small gnome
        emerged. &quot;Ah, these are strange places, Grimden!
        Bushes grow gnomes!&quot; Glolfandil laughed. &quot;Funny
        you are, bard, funny,&quot; said the gnome. &quot;I am
        Grimley, a wizard. I seek the woven armor frogloks
        bear.&quot; The gnome wobbled to a stump and sat,
        indignant to the bush comment. &quot;Well, cousin gnome,
        woven armor, I know not of. But there may be a few
        wounded frogloks in that hole seeking company,&quot;
        Grimden replied. Grimden drank a swig of ale. Then
        offered the gnome a drink who happily accepted. &quot;We
        seek a tadpole's eye, with an open iris,&quot; Glolfandil
        stated, &quot;It is a quest item.&quot; &quot;Ah,
        tadpole's eye? Have thee not tried the swamp? They swim
        aplenty just yards from here,&quot; the gnome gargled in
        mid-drink of ale. Grimden's eyes opened wide.
        &quot;WHAT!!!??? Tadpoles swim in the swamp? What rubbish
        is that? We were told to go to Gukluk. We traveled 3 days
        through this swamp!&quot; The gnome giggled, &quot;Maybe
        you were told, but tis not true. Look out there. The
        waters boil with their kind. Sometimes one wanders into
        Gukluk, but it is quickly eaten by its bigger brothers
        and sisters.&quot;&quot; Glolfandil sat his lute down and
        pulled his Dragon's Fang from its sheaf. &quot;Here is a
        coin for your troubles,&quot; he tossed the gnome a gold
        piece, it landed on the grass, King Antonica's head
        showing. A few minutes and a dozen slain tadpoles later,
        the eye was in a pouch in Grimden's backpack. The gnome
        laughed once more and began to crawl down the slippery
        hole to Gukluk. &quot;I will say hello to your froglok
        friends,&quot; he laughed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;So we have
        our quest item, Grim. Let us journey back to
        Freeport.&quot; &quot;Aye, let us leave this goblin
        manure!&quot; Grimden agreed. The quest was complete, the
        journey back long. And each night when the pair slept,
        they dreamed of the treasures the Lord and Lady would
        bestow upon them, of frogs trying to eat them, of
        mosquitoes larger than mountains and of a gnome, born of
        a bush. And the gifts, at last, were better than the
        dreams.</font></p>
