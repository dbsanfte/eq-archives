                        size="2" face="comic Sans MS">I travelled
                        across the place known as the East
                        Commonlands looking for suitable
                        creatures to hunt. I was new to this part
                        of Antonica and things here were very
                        different than the hunting grounds of
                        Qeynos and West Karana. There was much
                        yelling about &quot;the griff&quot; and I
                        was pretty sure that these folks were
                        referring to a Griffon like the ones I
                        had seen in North Karana which are
                        formidable beasts worthy of the fear and
                        respect shown by these folks. Finally I
                        came to a cave entrance that seemed to a
                        good place to hunt from, I could see
                        skeletons and pumas and rattlesnakes and
                        headed out to do battle. </font><p><font
                        size="2" face="comic Sans MS">After a
                        particulary tough fight with two pumas, I
                        returned to the cave entrance to rest and
                        saw fellow SCARAB member Ozwyn aiding a
                        group that had been severly beaten by an
                        asp. Alas, even Ozwyn's skill couldn't
                        save Kaxxa the Enchanter and her spirit
                        was sent back to Freeport. After helping
                        the others, and greeting me warmly, Ozwyn
                        said he was off to hunt zombies. I
                        declined his invitation to join him, as
                        did the others there, as zombies are too
                        strong for me yet. After he left, Ramana
                        the Monk invited me to join her group,
                        Kaxxa and Moonmoth the Warrior were the
                        others, and I gladly accepted. We rested
                        and discussed our strategy while Kaxxa
                        made her way back and soon we were ready
                        to hunt. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="comic Sans MS">I
                        volunteered to act as bait and lure
                        creatures to the cave entrance where the
                        team could ambush them. The first victim
                        was a puma and using Selo's Accelerando I
                        dashed out and lured the beast back to a
                        quick death. We continued this pattern
                        for much of a day and an army of corpses
                        soon littered the ground around us. It
                        was a glorious hunt with no casualties
                        and when we were done, we were all
                        burdened with loot. The only
                        dissapointment came when I found Ozwyn's
                        body lying on the hillside during one of
                        my searches for prey. I was shocked that
                        he had died so close by without my
                        hearing him. I learned later that a
                        mighty zombie and a puma had combined
                        forces to defeat him. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="comic Sans MS">As
                        we headed back to Freeport for rest and a
                        well-earned ale, I thought of how well
                        this group had fought and was proud to
                        have been invited to join them. Later, I
                        would join Ramana and Kaxxa again in the
                        desert, but that is another story. </font></p>
