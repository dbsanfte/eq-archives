					Kyliar has hooked us up with a new message board system that we might use (if we like it) as a replacement to our current message boards which will soon be disabled.  Thanks a ton, Kyliar!<BR>
					Please check out the <A HREF="http://aegis.remoteserver.org/cgi-bin/scarab/wwwthreads.pl?Cat=">message boards</A>, test them, see how you like them, and post your comments about them so we can make our final decision soon.

					</FONT>
					<BR>
					<FONT CLASS="text1">
					Last night, Lady Vox awoke from the patch only to find hordes of Scarabs ready to move in for the kill. Her pitiful resistance was no match for our attacks, and Scarab adds yet another notch to its dragon belt.<BR>
					She dropped two Runed Bolster Belts, a Hammer of Divine Disgrace, and two Mystic Pouches! Shak won a RBB and gave his FBSS to Trystelnar! Kunkoh won one of the Mystic Pouches too!<BR>
					<BR>
					And last but not least, Vox dropped her Frost Book, which Tharian won, thus obtaining an item he's been trying to get for two years! It won't be long now until Tharian is wielding a flashy Fiery Defender!<BR>
					<BR>
					Also, due to an emergency patch, Vox is up again, so we'll attack again later tonight!

					Last night Scarab and Valorium slew the vile Lady Vox. A big thanks to Vox for dieing. A big congrats to Blackrabbit for winning the Mystic Pouch (10-slot, 100% weight-reduction). Also, Kitsu showed the world exactly what it means to be Scarab by giving his fairly-won White Dragon Scale to Divina to speed her along on her epic quest.  You rock, Kitsu!<BR>
					Divina plans to kill Phinigel soon in yet another attempt to get that piece for her epic.

					<FONT CLASS="text1">
					Last night we all gathered in Freeport for a guild meeting.  Here's what happened:<BR>
					<BR>
					Horammer introduced the ideas of having an official "Meeting Day" and an "Alt Day" on a monthly basis.  The Meeting Day will serve as a consistent and predictable time when guild meetings will occur.  Alt Day will be a day for playing alternate characters together just for kicks.<BR>
					<BR>
					The Hate Gem Jewelry project is underway, and those who attended the last Hate raid will be contacted if they are eligible for guild-crafted jewelry created from the gems gathered in Hate.<BR>
					<BR>
					Mountains of items and spells were distributed.  A big thanks goes to Nilla for her incredible generosity!<BR>
					<BR>
					ScarabFest is this coming weekend.  If you plan to attend, be sure to check the Secure Board for travel directions.<BR>
					<BR>
					<A  NAME="mvp"></A>Luxy, Corvax, and Divina all recieved a Torch of Loyalty medal and Trystelnar recieved the Spirit of Sacrifice medal.  The MVP medals for the 1st Quarter 2001 were distributed as follows: Corvax - caster, Peabodi - tank, Blackrabbit - specialist, Horammer - healer.  Way to go!<BR>
					<BR>
					<A  NAME="election"></A>Finally, our most sincere condolences to Kelagry, Etsalon, and Corvax for being elected to the Inner Circle.<BR>
