My life was full of harmony and love. My parents showered me with gifts and we spent long hours playing in our elegant home. I never stepped foot outside Felwithe and as far as I knew neither had they. They were my constant companions and playmates.<br><br>When I reached my 12th summer I was sent to explore our faire city on my own, a rite of passage of types. My life has never been the same. The city seemed so large on my own. I quickly became afraid of everything I saw. Spire and towers I had visited often with my parents now seemed ominous and threatening. Overcome with emotion I ran blindly through the streets to escape my fears and found myself in the temple of Erollisi Marr. In a heart beat my fears were gone and a feeling of love and serenity filled me. I had found the power and light of love.<br><br>Through Erollisi I learned I should use my loving upbringing to give me power and spread the light of love where ever I went. When I returned home, I shared my experience with my parents. They were not happy. They were both Wizards by profession and the arts they studied could be harsh. They had hoped I would follow in their foot steps and study to be a wizard myself. But, it was clear just by looking at me that I followed the light of love and would not be a wizard. So they bade me discover which vocation would be for me.<br><br>I learned what I could, though many of the guilds I entered would not tell me much without a parent's recommendation. Day after day I searched the towers of Felwithe with little success. I was at a loss until one day exhausted and ready to give up I took a seat on a comfortable looking bench. From nowhere I heard a voice, "You look tired my dear, let me assist you" Flashes of light engulfed me and I felt stronger. I looked around but could not see anyone. I thought mayhaps it was someone invisible speaking, but before I could ask the voice said, "I'll bet you never had a bench make you strong before."<br><br>Well as you can imagine I bolted off the bench and stared at it in wide-eyed terror.<br><br>It spoke again, "do not be frightened child, I am known as Zithroth. I am an Enchanter. This is just one of many forms I can take." Then right in front of my eyes the Bench turned into a Beautiful High Elf Man. "You see. It is an illusion." He waved his arms and then turned into something I had never seen before. He shrunk in size and became stout. An ugly little thing with big hairy feet wearing a grin."I can become a halfling, or a gnome, or a human, almost any of the sentient races."<br><br>I stared at him blankly, "A ....wh-what or a what?" I hesitated. I had never heard those words before and felt anxious looking at the little man in front of me. This creature was completely foreign to me. I was scared and nervous but also intrigued.<br><br>As Zithroth's voice issued from the form in front of me I felt that what I was about to hear would change the course of my life forever. "Beyond these beautiful walls," Zithroth began, "there are other beings, not just creatures great and small but other thinking, feeling beings, that are like us yet different many ways." He reach up his stubby hand and said, "Come Dadilie, it is time your eyes were opened..."<br><br>I studied with Zithroth for 5 years and learned many things, languages, spells, and even how to handle a two handed staff. But, I was most interested to learn about the other races that inhabited our world. My parents never referred to anything outside our gates except to say there were just animals out there. I yearned to meet these beings.<br><br>The day finally came. My master Zithroth approach me and said, "I can teach you no more until you have passed beyond the gates of our city and honed the skills you have learned." he handed me a pack filled with food and drink.<br><br>Tears welled in my eyes, " I am afraid" I squeaked. "Draw on the power of love, from you mother, your father, your friends and me. Use your knowledge and skill and you will do well. "He hugged me then and I felt love surge through me. My fear began to abate. "Now," he straightened his robes, " go and learn. When you are ready, travel to Freeport, across the Ocean of Tears. There you will find colleagues of mine who will continue your training." With that he cast a spell and I felt protected. Then he cast another spell and he changed form into a frightening sight, an Ogre (I had learned). He giggled, "Let's see how your classmates react to a surprise attack", and he lumbered off.<br><br>At the beginning I didn't go far from the gate. Fear overwhelmed me. Every creature seemed vile and aggressive. I was attacked by snakes and bats. At first I instilled fear in them and ran to the safety of the gate and the guards, but soon I gained courage and managed to club a snake with my staff. I had recalled my teacher's advice to go to Freeport, but I knew I would not have enough money to buy the food I needed for the trip. I looked down at the dead snake at my feet. Didn't I see snake skin gloves for sale at the local merchant shop. Maybe they could use a snake's skin. I pulled out a small eating knife and swallowing down a wave of nausea, attempted to skin the creature. It wasn't a very good job but I managed to get it all off in one piece.<br><br>I rolled it up and ran as quickly as I could to the merchant. She was very friendly and gave me 9 copper for it. I was thrilled. I would be able to make my way to Freeport after all. Not only did she say she would buy more snakeskins but anything else I could harvest from the beasties. I was overwhelmed. For the first time in my life I was self-supporting and self-sufficient.<br><br>I became a hunting machine, practicing my spell skills as well as my staff skills, using every part of the creatures I killed for food and money for water. In what seemed like no time I had earned enough money to make my way to Freeport.<br><br>On my journey I saw beings and creatures a plenty. I must have looked like a babe, staring at all the strange sights. When I finally reached the dock at the Ocean of Tears, my breath caught in my throat. The ocean was huge! Never ending, it looked like it fell off the edge of the earth in the distance. I was afraid. When the boat arrived I didn't want to board. I let others pass and began to back away. Then I heard a jovial voice say, "You're going the wrong way if you want to get to Freeport". I looked around but didn't see anyone. Again, the voice said, " It'll be another day before the boat comes again". I honed in on the voice and looked down. "Zithroth" I exclaimed. I reach down gave the halfling a bear hug. "You came to see me off".<br><br>"Uhh, I appreciate the hug young lady but I am afraid I am not who you think I am. My name is Jayfoot Bloomrose of the High Council of SCARAB." He beamed.<br><br>My face must have turned three shades of red as I replied, " I beg your pardon sir, you look just like a form my master took on". "Ahh so that explains it, I didn't recognize that name and there are few of my people that would travel this far abroad." "Are you traveling to Freeport?" he asked, " Or have you just come all this way to see the ocean". I hesitated. Freeport. It's what I had come to want so badly. But to leave the familiarity and safety of my home and cross this never ending ocean."Well I was going to but I don't see Freeport across the water only the edge of the earth" I managed to mumble. Would he think me a dolt? Would he look at me in disdain?<br><br>Jayfoot only giggled softly as he patiently explained, "Freeport is there,just over the horizon. I know because I came from there and beyond. There is nothing to fear friend. Hop aboard and I shall enlighten you about Freeport,the continent, my homeland, and the great guild of SCARAB." He reached up his stubby hand and said, "Come milady, it is time your eyes were opened..."</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
