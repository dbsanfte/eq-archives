How it Began.
</b>
<br><br>
It is dark and rainy, raining hard while I write this. I always had some innate abilities in my youth. It was that small amount of
power that made me misunderstood. Lighting, what power. Could I control such power. I loved the rain. It was hard when I
was young, They never understood, Human children rarely did, the master of the orphanage knew there was something
"Different" about me, and he made it clear to the children that I was "Different". Children are very cruel, but I can't blame them,
nor the adults that looked over us, they could not understand, and they feared what they did not understand. I had no friends to
confide in really, so the day of the "incident" was especially cold and lonely. The children were being especially cruel that day,
one of the Dirt balls meant for me broke the orphanage masters window, all the blame came down on me, I could not think ,
yelling, screaming at me, Un Just, Un Warranted, "Stop, It was not me!!" no one listened, Anger, Fear, RAGE. the last thing I
heard him say "thunder? there are no clouds." In a Flash of light power and rage he was gone. It was me, I didn't know what
was going to happen , I was afraid. Men in robes entered the small detention room I was held in, "How long child?" I didn't
know what to answer. "when did you first know you were not the same, Little One?", "All my life sir." I looked in his eyes. I
saw nothing but empathy, He knew my pain, "I will take him in my self" he said to the others, never taking his eyes from mine.
As we were leaving the orphanage It began to rain "What a lovely day, isn't it Little One?".

The Scarab!
</b><br><br>

I was finished with my training, My mentor had sent me out to make a name for my self, I had mastered the starting arts of
wizardry, and was ready to enter the world on my own, In my travels I met many a friend, people, while in the places of evil
needed my assistance, wanted it. I grew to understand that friends were the most important people in your life, I heard of
guilds and groups that join together and share friendship and information, and have events together, but never could I find one
that fit my needs, I was growing in power and Strength of Magic, when one day I was searching out Items of power, and a
barbarian friend of mine suggested that I speak with Ldyhawke, as she was able to create great jewelry of power. One day on
my way to the vile pit of Unrest, I ran into her in what is called the Cauldron, she was with a group of fighters, I asked her
about the jewelry she was very hospitable, one of the nicest persons I had met. I saw the guild tag she wore, "Scarab" I bid her
farewell and went on my way, while In unrest I was invited into a group comprised of all scarab, excepting myself of course,
They fought well and were all formidable warriors, but what made me think was how well they got along together, and they
treated me like a friend right away, as if I was one of them. I started reading posts about them and their laws and ways, and
decided that was where I wanted to be, I started the process of a recruit, I felt a little strange at first being a recruit as a wizard
of the 25th circle. Not once was I treated as one. I one time thought to my self, what did A human Paladin see in a Dwarven
Cleric, Then one day I was delivering a rare gift to Ldyhawke, when I saw her I went to bow before her, and she jumped up
and hugged me (I had never been hugged by a dwarf before) I composed my self and finished my bow trying not smile too
widely, I gave her the gift and she asked If I wanted payment , I did not, she was very kind and thankful, I at that time saw
what Lord Hawke saw in her, and never again have I questioned any union. I knew I had made the right choice. I passed my
entrance and I am now full Scarab. And I now have a Family of friends</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
