					<TD valign="TOP" colspan="2"><FONT class="text1">One day, while                       he was gathering firewood, he stopped in a small glade and                       sat down to rest. While he sat there daydreaming , a flock                       of ravens landed in the trees overhead, and began chattering                       in their raucous, uproarious manner. He sat and watched                       these creatures - their black feathers that glowed purple                       and blue in the sunlight, their intense curiosity, and their                       fearless antics mesmerized him until the sun was dipping                       low on the horizon. He ran home, only to be scolded thoroughly                       by his worried parents. This happened more and more, as                       the boy went into the forest to gather firewood, he would                       almost always come across the same flock of ravens. Time                       after time, he would stare for hours at them. Eventually,                       they started staring back. One day, while he sat watching,                       one of the larger ones swooped down from behind him, and                       landed on the ground less than a foot away. It stared at                       him for some time with its dark, piercing eyes. He stared                       back, not knowing what to do.</P>
<P>His grandmother                       had once told him they were harbingers of evil, witches’                       familiars, and guardians of evil places. Looking into the                       eyes of the raven, he saw no evil – only curiosity, determination,                       and strength. He stood there, and after what seemed like                       an eternity, he lifted his hand to the bird. The large raven                       flinched then stood still. A moment later the raven appeared                       to nod its head at the young man, then it flew away with                       the rest of the flock following him.</P>
<P>This routine                       occurred for many months. Even when the weather turned cold                       the birds would always return to the trees and sit above                       the head of the young man. One spring day, almost a year                       to the day of his initial contact with the birds, his life                       changed forever.</P>
<P>It was a cool                       evening, he had dug out a hole that was currently filled                       with clear rainwater and was watching the birds take turns                       at bathing. Each bird would swoop down, bath, and then return                       to the tree as the next bird swooped down. The soothing                       sounds were cut short as an arrow cut the air, piercing                       one of the smaller ravens in the tree. One by one arrows                       began to pick off the ravens, until only a few remained.                       Confused, scared and angry the young man jumped into a nearby                       bush. The large raven, obviously the leader, did not move                       from his branch.</P>
<P>Out of a nearby                       thicket, two young orc pawns emerged, snarling and laughing                       at the twisted fun they were having. They began to snarl                       and grunt at each other in their own grotesque language,                       and were pointing at the raven. One of the orcs drew back                       his bow and let an arrow fly. The raven slid to the left,                       and took flight, dodging the arrow. The young man exploded                       out of his hiding place as both orcs aimed at the flying                       bird. He threw himself into one of them, knocking the orc                       into a tree which rendered him unconscious. The other orc                       brought his arm down on the young mans back, forcing the                       air from his lungs and dropping him to his knees. Blackness                       threatened him, and he resolved himself for the afterlife.                       The Orc screamed again, this time in pain, and the young                       man looked up in time to see the large raven with his claws                       in the orcs face, and its beak in the orcs eye. The Orc                       screamed again as blood flowed from the now destroyed eye,                       it turned and began to run, but tripped over a log, and                       fell. The young man tried to stand, but was helpless to                       see the orc fall on top of the bird that had saved his life.                       Darkness overtook him then.</P>
<P>At first there                       was only the soft smell of rain. He had no idea how long                       he had been knocked out. All at once his memories flooded                       into him, and he snapped his eyes open and looked up. The                       flock of ravens still lay scattered about the glen, impaled                       on dark, orc arrows. He stood, and found that the orc that                       he had tackled was dead, a heavy branch had punctured its                       chest when he was tackled. He turned his attention to the                       other orc, his mind racing, his last thoughts were of the                       raven that had saved him.</P>
<P>The orc was gone.                       All that remained was the crushed body of the raven, the                       orcs eye still stuck on its blood encrusted beak. The young                       man wept, his heart heavy. He took time to gather up all                       the dead birds, and began the long walk home.</P>
<P>As he approached                       his small cottage he saw his parents standing outside waiting                       for him. His mother screamed as the blood soaked boy dumped                       the pile of dead birds outside the home, and without a word                       got a shovel to dig graves. His parents watched, and knew                       the boy in front of them was not their son.</P>
<P>The next few                       years were painful, the family tried to get the boy to return                       to normal. But constant mumbling about the one-eyed orc                       drove his parents to the brink of insanity. One morning                       near his 16<SUP>th</SUP>birthday he awoke to find his parents                       gone. This mattered not to him, his soul screamed for justice,                       His soul screamed to drive the vile force of evil from his                       land, his soul screamed to bring back that quiet days with                       the raven. He packed up some clothes and food and headed                       to Freeport hoping to find information about the one-eyed                       orc who haunts his dreams.</P>
<P>As he crossed                       into the commonlands he found himself face to face with                       a small orc pawn. The orc seemed surprised, and the boy                       swung his heavy backpack like a flail. Without thinking                       he screamed the word &quot;raven&quot; at the top his lungs,                       and with the power of adrenaline and hatred beat the orc                       pawn to a bloody pulp. He continued to beat the dead orc                       for several minutes, until he collapsed on the corpse out                       of exhaustion.</P>
<P>His body pulsed                       as a blue aura surrounded him. He lifted his head to see                       a man casting a spell, and again the blue aura surrounded                       him. For a moment he felt warm, and at peace.</P>
<P>&quot;It’s a                       healing spell friend Raven.&quot; Said the man. I assumed                       you were wounded after your fight with the orc. &quot;My                       name is Ozwyn, I am glad you are well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why do                       you call me Raven?&quot; the boy asked, standing up, his                       battle fury gone. He did note that this orc had both its                       eyes.</P>
<P>&quot;It is what                       you screamed in battle&quot; Ozwyn said, Puzzled. &quot;I                       assumed it was your name&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It IS my                       name,&quot; The boy said, suddenly confident, as if the                       name was his all his life.</P>
<P>&quot;Excellent                       friend Raven, come with me to Freeport. I am meeting a man                       and woman named Hawke. We have this crazy idea about starting                       a guild.&quot;</P>
<P>Raven agreed,                       and on the way to Freeport told the cleric his story. Ozwyn                       explained that this guild would be the perfect, and could                       aid him in his search for the one-eyed orc. Ravenn agreed.</FONT>
