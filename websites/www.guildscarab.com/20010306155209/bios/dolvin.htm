      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story of Dolvin is unlike
      many other stories. Rather than come from a poor, broken home, Dolvin grew
      up amidst the cool breezes of the Ocean of Tears. His parents were rich
      merchants of Freeport, and would frequently make trading visits all over
      Antonica. Rather than keep his son safely in their oceanfront castle, his
      father would take Dolvin along, showing him the safest way to travel from
      city to city, showing him what to avoid.<br>
      <br>
      His father also furthered his education by enrolling him at the Temple of
      Marr’s religious academy for non-clerical studies, declaring that
      &quot;every young man needs a solid spiritual foundation.&quot; And so
      Dolvin grew up among the clerics and holy knights of Marr, studying the
      ways of Honor, Valor, Justice, and Sacrifice. As he reached adulthood, he
      found himself drawn more and more not to the mere studies of spirituality,
      but the exercising of those studies through combating evil.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than be upset with his desire to become a holy Paladin of Marr, his
      parents supported his decision. Dolvin committed his life from then on to
      be in service to others. Joining the Knights of Truth in a solemn
      ceremony, his parents were pleased to see him continue in his training,
      and eventually he was posted to Rivervale to secure Misty Thicket from all
      manner of evil that would threaten the peaceful and carefree populace.
      Daily, Dolvin would venture forth to do battle with goblins and orcs, and
      repeatedly braced the goblin chieftain Mooto in his lair.<br>
      <br>
      Over time, he became involved with first the Imperial Order, and now with
      Scarab. Through guild membership he continues to spread Mithaniel Marr’s
      message of Honor, Valor, and Loyalty to all he comes in contact with. As
      he approaches his final passage to knighthood and the gaining of the 20th
      circle, Dolvin revels in the strength of his sword, his knowledge of the
      countryside, and the faithfulness of his friends to get him through the
      world around him.</font></p>
