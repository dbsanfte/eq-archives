He moves silently as he walks the halls of BlazeRose Keep. His mind is enraged at the news of the recent attacks
on his birthplace of Halas. Orcs have risen enmass and have assaulted numerous cities across Norrath. They have
been pushed back time and time again but still they come, driven by some mad lust for blood and battle. He has
made ready for his journey home to help as much as he can. He has not spoken to anyone save his Captain of the
Guard, Angus StoutHeart, and the messenger who is on his way to Halas. His armor is ready, his weapons packed
for the trip, his trusted horse ready for this trip from the Karanas to Halas. Slowly he walks through the Keep
checking the inhabitants. Morigane sleeps soundly in her room, home form her travels to the lands of the gods.
Selgus rolls over in bed and growls and returns to sleep. He moves out into the garden and rests his hands on the
Grandfather Tree and smiles as the tree bids him safe travels. Dinaden and Tree are cuddled together in their Tree
House, safe in the arms of the old tree. He softly pats the old bark and nods once in passing and then moves to the
stables.
<br><br>
"Sair ye should nae go alone, let me send guards with ye." Angus’ voice is filled with knowledge and reason and
yet his Lord knows that this cannot happen for every guard will be needed in case of the Orcs moving against the
Keep. "No old friend as usual I go alone. Dragonsbrand and I will see to this matter." Angus is gruff and upset as
Briggs mounts the giant roan horse and rides out of the Keep. He stops long enough to watch the gates close and
hear the bars slide across them. Nodding once he waves his hand to those on the battlements and smiles as they
return the gesture. Spurring the horse he heads across the plains towards Halas. 
<br><br>
Two days later he is still on the trail. He has seen signs of the Orcs but has not come across any Orc Patrols. He
passed a small settlement in the karanas and stopped to bury the dead. The Druids of the Karanas had retreated to
High Hold once the uprising had begun. He past the Druidic Rings and sighed as he saw them scorched from
flames and weapons. He had found a treant slain and had prayed over it and then built a funeral pyre for it and
looked away as it had burned. He found slain human guards in the Karanas as well as farmers. He had buried the
bodies and had kept riding. Now he was moving thru the Hills of Qeynos and here he came upon an encampment
of Qeynos Guards, Druids and Rangers from Surefall Glade. They had bid him stop for food and drink and he had
obliged them with a smile and news of his travels. The commander of the encampment had told him that the Orcs
had been stopped here as they had come from Black Burrow.
He had thanked them for the meal and info and had pressed on from here. As he neared Black Burrow he could
smell the burned hair and skin, slowly he dismounted and led the horse thru the tunnel and into the passage thru the
Burrow. He shook his head as he saw the dead gnolls and orcs and kept going. As he came to the end of the
tunnel, which opened, into Everfrost Peaks he stopped and shouted a challenge to the guard, which stood on the
barbarian side. They had responded in kind and had welcomed him home for he was the former commander of the
Halas Guardians. He took a report and told the men he would get word to Halas and have them relieved as soon
as he could. He mounted his horse and rode for Halas. 
<br><br>
As he rode thru the Peaks an unearthly calm cause DragonsBrand to shiver slightly and paw at the ground. Briggs
reached back for his axe and snarled just as three orc mountaineers burst out of a snow bank. In a flash he was
down off the horse and his axe whistled through the air. The head of the first orc hit the ground as his body fell
back into the snow. Briggs spun and buried his axe in the chest of the second and snarled as he spun for the third.
The orc was lying on its face and a Barbarian was yanking a sword out of it’s back. "Damnit Jack I had them. No
need for you to be bothered." The other barbarian just smiled. "Briggs Blazerose, I’ve known you for ages and
you are still as bad as we were when we were younger." The two barbarians clasped hand to forearm in the
greeting of old warriors. "Bah you old crazy fool, still out here running the peaks I see, where’s the bear?" Jack’s
eyes suddenly took on a look, which made Briggs wish he’d not asked that question. "He’s back in the lair,
nursing his wounds. We were set upon by a patrol of Orcs and they almost had us. That old bear took numerous
blows meant for me. Took me forever to help him back to the Lair but he’s sleeping his wounds away. I was on
my way to Halas for supplies, guess we’ll both make our way there." Briggs nodded and smiled as they both
resumed the trip to Halas.
<br><br>
Once the had made it to the next line of guards and then across the ferry into the city Briggs made his way to the
Pit and stopped to talk to the warriors there. It was late and he would speak with the Elders when the Sun broke
the night. He took a room at the Warriors Hall and saw to his horse. He spent the night walking through the city
and speaking with those who lived and worked there. Then he moved back to his room for a rest after the long
trip....
