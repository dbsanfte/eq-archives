          <TD><FONT class="text1"> Scarab is much more than a typical online gaming 
            guild. Scarab is a family of close friends, both online and in real-life, 
            who uphold the values of honor, valor, and loyalty. Our guild is a 
            large family and we take great pride in the fact that every person 
            in the guild really enjoys being a part of the family. At Scarab, 
            we honestly believe that the person behind the screen is important. 
            We try to look beyond the character, and just like any Pen and Paper 
            gaming group, we are all friends. If you are looking for "phat lewt" 
            or a guild to power-level you up to "uber" standards then you have 
            come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a guild that stays 
            in character constantly then you are also in the wrong place. If you 
            are looking for a friendly family atmosphere where you will make real 
            life friendships, read on.<br>
            <br>
            Scarab has two sets of laws which dictate our actions: the Code of 
            Conduct and the Code of Chivalry. These codes are the heart and soul 
            of a Scarab member, and are to be followed at all times. <BR>

          <TD><FONT class="text1"> <FONT class="head2">Justice</FONT> - In courageously 
            seeking the truth and the path of righteousness, members must strive 
            to escape their own personal gain and instead be just. Members who 
            seek out justice without bending to temptation will be members of 
            renown.<BR>
            <BR>
            <FONT class="head2">Sacrifice</FONT> - Generosity is a prime characteristic 
            of a Scarab member. In order to counter the weakness of gluttony, 
            members are to be as generous as their resources will allow. Generous 
            members are better able to walk the fine line between mercy and cold 
            justice. Giving, rather than taking, makes the name of Scarab renowned 
            and respected.<BR>
            <BR>
            <FONT class="head2">Compassion</FONT> - The weak and innocent are 
            our charges; their defense and safety are our duty. The might and 
            wisdom of a Scarab member allow those not capable of their own wellbeing 
            to stand boldly behind us. The meek may rest weary heads on the strength 
            of our shoulders.<BR>
            <BR>
            This is the Scarab way! To these ends we strive to serve! Thanks to 
            Lord Gregor who provided the model for this code.<BR>
