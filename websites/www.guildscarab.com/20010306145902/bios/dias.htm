The bartender looks up and                       looks at the bundled creature standing in his doorway. Layers                       of clothing peel away to reveal a stern faced male face.                       I walk across the room, sliding into a booth against the                       wall, facing the door. <br>                      <br>                      Smiling warmly, "What would you have?" asks the waitress.                       <br>                      <br>                      "Ale and stew if you got it." I reply. <br>                      <br>                      "That'll be 5 copper." <br>                      <br>                      Three coppers are placed on the table and covered with a                       well callused hand, "Half now.. the rest when the food comes."                       <br>                      <br>                      I watch the waitress swish off through a door, the scent                       of food and warm grease drifting from the back. Looking                       slowly around the room, I notice that the tavern is quite                       busy. Two dwarves play a game of dice in the corner, a few                       nondescripts sit at the bar buried in their ale. Drawn to                       the bright colors, I see an elf adorned in bright blue sitting                       in a booth near the door. Picking up my ale, I walk over                       to his table. <br>                      <br>                      "Hail, might I sit and talk? I have not spoken to anyone                       in some time." <br>                      <br>                      "Pull up a seat, young sir. An old man, such as myself,                       always enjoys company." The stranger gestures to an empty                       chair. <br>                      <br>                      Spinning the chair so it faces the door, "What is an elder                       doing out in such harsh weather?" <br>                      <br>                      "Elder eh? I am in search of a young half-elf by the name                       of Dias Icewind. He is said to be a drifter from this part                       of the world" <br>                      <br>                      Stunned to hear my name, I inquire further, "What do you                       need with him? I know of him, and have seen him on occasion."                       "I have important news of his parents, do you know where                       he could be found?" <br>                      <br>                      Excited by the prospect of learning of my parents, almost                       yelling "I am Dias Icewind, what do you know of my parents?!?"                       <br>                      <br>                      Raising an eyebrow, the elder looks at you suspiciously,                       "What proof have you that you are who you say you are?"                       Pulling my cloak and shirt off, I show him my right arm,                       where the tattoo of a large star floating above a large                       oak tree, on a mountainous landscape is placed. <br>                      <br>                      "This was drawn on me as a young child, before I can even                       remember. It is all I have to remember my heritage by" <br>                      <br>                      Looking intently at the tattoo, "Amazing, I have only seen                       one other such tattoo. Placed on the left arm of a half-elf                       that was slain in battle. That half-elf was your brother,                       you were twins. The name of the tree is the Ellcrys, created                       by long lost elven magic, locking the hordes of ravenous                       demons in their dimension. This is the mark of the family                       Icewind, destined to protect the world of Norrath from these                       evil forces. The time of darkness is upon us, you must seize                       your destiny, and destroy the evil that threatens. You are                       the worlds hope, but you will need help. There is a force                       already gathering to the north, go to them and give them                       direction. Prove your worth and make your ancestors proud,                       for you are born of the nobles of nobility. The last family                       left of a long line of defenders of the Ellcrys." <br>                      <br>                      The rest of the morning flew by quickly as I prepare for                       my journey. I mount my horse, and look back over my shoulder                       to see the elder gazing to the north…towards the waiting                       army...towards my destiny </font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
