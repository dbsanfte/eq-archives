        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; The morning mists hung
        heavily over the battlefield, horns and drums could be
        heard from the trees facing the Keep. The attacking
        troops were mustering for the battle and moving equipment
        for the upcoming battle. Anson stood by Briggs and
        smiled,&#148; They are ready to come to us sair.&#148;
        Briggs turned and smiled, &#148;Aye Anson, they will come
        and they shall learn what death truly is.&#148; The night
        before Briggs and others had stolen out onto the
        battlefield to remove the coverings from the pits
        surrounding the Keep. Now, only grass covered the pits
        and this was magically covered so it would look like
        nothing was amiss. Briggs smiled darkly and nodded as the
        attacking calvary made it&#146;s way into formation.
        &#147;Archers ready, I want none of those men alive when
        they charge us.&#148; His Archers nodded and Leflair
        smiled, &#148;Brother they won&#146;t get past the pits.I
        promise you that.&#148;</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font
        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; Suddenly the men
        spurred their horses and the ground shook as over one
        hundred horses moved as one. Screaming as they came as
        the bloodlust took them the riders waved weapons and
        spurred their mounts on faster. Briggs shook his head,
        &#147;Such a waste of good Horse flesh. Save what ye can
        of those mounts Lef, it would be humane and we can use
        more horses.&#148; Leflair nodded, his face grim as he
        pulled his bowstring taunt. The other fifty archers did
        the same and fixed upon a target. Suddenly, the horses
        his the pits, the grass covering them disappeared and the
        riders looked down to see the spears and spikes which
        filled each pit. The screams of both horse and man filled
        the battlefield as they fell to their deaths. Briggs
        turned slowly to survey the carnage as Leflair and his
        archers let loose with a barrage and then another. Men
        fell from horseback and writhed on the ground, horses
        screamed as they thrashed, a few horses made it to the
        Keep and the gates were opened as the squires moved to
        corral them. Briggs nodded and moved down the ramparts
        towards the casters tower. He wanted to make sure they
        were all ready. He stepped onto the balcony and smiled,
        Amberlee, Geranon, Phyndin and Tritium were all ready. He
        nodded to them and moved around the building to find
        Aesha , Qalaar , Xrath and Aairk all ready for battle. He
        turned to them all and smiled, &#147;My family those who
        would help the attackers by using their spells are your
        first targets. Spare none.&#148; Then he turned and moved
        down the steps to the courtyard where most of the others
        stood, his eyes swept over Heldenfeld, Harpax, Fantane ,
        SoulKeeper, with his arms wrapped around Arylin, Anthem
        and Callandra playing battlesongs, Ganorn and Avar stood
        discussing holy matters, Gaken and Tinhawk discussing
        healing with Rathalius, Nokomis standing with Gotyour, a
        smile on her face from his endless joking. His eyes then
        locked on Khaylis, Ticarro, and Bellimar , these were his
        brothers in arms on another level and he had learned much
        from them. He slowly caught their attention and smiled.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &#147;You all answered when we sent word of the coming
        battle and it does my soul good to see you all.&#148; His
        eyes moved from one to the other in thanks. &#147;The
        coming battle will be brutal. I have no idea what
        artifact it is that the commander of this army seeks but
        they say it is here in OUR Home. I for one will not allow
        anyone to desecrate our home. No words are needed let us
        just give these fiends what for and send them to hell the
        fastest way possible.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;
        His family smiled almost as one and moved off to their
        battle points. Khaylis moved beside him and put a arm on
        his, &#148;Brother, go check on her, I know you want to,
        I&#146;ll check on the rest of the men.&#148; Briggs
        smiled and nodded &#147;Aye brother it won&#146;t take me
        long.&#148; Briggs turned and bounded up the stairs of
        the North Tower. He stopped and opened the door to his
        private rooms and stood in the doorway, his breath taken
        away at the vision before him. She lay there on her side
        sleeping soundly, the silk sheets clinging to her body.
        The handmaiden smiled and nodded, &#147;She sleeps well
        m&#146;lord but, I fear the coming battle will wake
        her.&#148; Briggs nodded and whispered, &#147;If she
        wakes you WILL not let her leave this room, her wounds
        need to heal before she can fight.&#148; The handmaiden
        nodded and smiled as her lord moved to brush his lips
        against those of the sleeping woodelf. He lay a single
        BlazeRose on her pillow and slowly left the room. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;
        He smiled as Khaylis waved to him and then suddenly heard
        a lone horn ringout. He ran up the rampart stairs and
        looked out onto the battlefield. His eyes found the
        incoming white flag and he smiled. He saw the commander
        of the attacking troops move out of the mist. &#147;I
        give you one last chance Lord BlazeRose, give me what I
        desire or I will lay waste to your Keep and your
        friends.&#148; Briggs turned and looked into the faces of
        each of those who were fighting with him. The look
        returned to him was all the same. He cupped his hands
        around his mouth, &#147;Go back to your troops! They will
        know nothing but death if you send them against us.&#148;
        The enemy commander said nothing as he turned his mount
        and rode back to his lines. Briggs saw his hand come up
        and then drop, suddenly a rumble filled the morning as
        the attacking troops moved as one. Ogres and Trolls,
        humans and dark elves all moved as one and then suddenly
        charged as one, their screams filling the morning air.
        Bolts of energy flew from both sides, the attacking
        casters taking the worst of it. Briggs did not turn to
        see what damage they had done, he knew it would be taken
        care of by the healers. His hands gripped both his short
        swords as he moved down the ramparts. His eyes took in
        the group of men who stood with him as the gates opened
        and they stepped out onto the battlefield. They were all
        protected by numerous battle spells. These seventy five
        men would face down a dragon itself if need be.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;The
        archers were firing arrows as fast as they could, the
        incoming spells were becoming few and far between, the
        incoming troops were falling like wheat before a giant
        scythe. Briggs readied himself as the first of them came
        to him. One thrust dropped him and then it was all a
        blur, a ogre falling before him then a troll as the
        bloodlust took him. Anson suddenly surrounded by a horde
        of Ogres and falling, a scream filling the morning as
        Briggs leapt among them swords flashing blood spilling as
        the ogres fell. Last thing he saw was two of the men
        carrying Anson back to the healers. He turned as the
        remaining troops began to retreat. He kept his men in
        formation as they moved back into the Keep, carrying
        their wounded and dead.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;
        Briggs dropped his swords into their sheaths. Suddenly a
        bloodthirsty scream filled the air and a huge shadow
        covered the Keep.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;
        With a resounding crash something huge hit the ground
        behind Briggs. He spun and his eyes narrowed as the dust
        hit him. His eyes widened as he took in a huge green
        dragon. Suddenly someone was handing him his runed two
        handed sword, he looked down into the eyes of the woodelf
        who had stolen his heart. She leaned up and kissed his
        lips softly then moved away. His family all stood on the
        ramparts and made ready to defend their homes from this
        fiend. A low grating voice filled the Keep, &#147;You
        have what I desire Lord BlazeRose and I will have it even
        if it means I raze this entire Keep to the ground. You
        have the totem which was meant for me many years ago and
        you WILL give it to me.&#148; Suddenly a voice filled
        Briggs&#146; head, &#147; My son&#133;this vile creature
        lies. The totem was not meant for him, it was meant for
        you, tis why YOU have it. I will be with you during this
        fight my son, fear not.&#148; Suddenly Briggs body
        thrashed as energies hit him, the woodelf screamed and
        backed away as a change overtook the man she saw. Briggs
        arms flung out beside him the sword clenched in one hand,
        his eyes locking with those of the dragon. His voice was
        a rumble from the heavens his eyes glowing with ancient
        energy, &#147;You will find nothing but death here old
        one, if that is what you truly want then come,&#148; his
        hand beckoned the dragon forward, &#147;face me and my
        son together we will destroy you and no harm shall come
        to any here but you.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suddenly energies seemed to fill the Keep and it
        dissolved around them. They were in a ancient arena ,
        blood stained the floor, gore was everywhere. Then
        suddenly the voice was back, &#147;Remember this place
        old one? You should tis where you suffered your last
        tormenting defeat. Good defeated evil again that day.
        Care to take another try?&#148; The dragon suddenly threw
        its head back and flames filled the arena, crashing over
        Briggs, blackening his armor but doing no more damage
        than that. &#147; Old one I do not crave to destroy you,
        you are old and wise, ageless in knowledge, there is a
        huge cavern and underground Keep near BlazeRose Keep
        which you could partake of, I&#146;m sure my son would
        nae mind a ally such as yourself. I will NOT let you
        destroy him, he is needed in the future of Norrath. What
        will you do old one? Face me again and die this time or
        help Norrath with your knowledge? Your two spawn have
        become evil, they seek to destroy all that is Norrath and
        make it their own, which you know cannot happen for the
        balance to be kept. You know, as well as I, that balance
        must be kept less we all fall.&#148; The old Dragon was
        listening to all this, one claw tapping his scaled chin,
        then his voice filled the arena, &#147;You speak trully
        as you did those many years ago old friend. Your son
        seems to be the one who can change Norrath, I will help
        him and his family, after all they do seem to be the
        Guardians of K&#146;Arnon. So they seem to be MY
        Guardians as well as yours. I agree to this for now.
        Return us old friend I&#146;m sure they worry about this
        lad.&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suddenly the keep was surrounding then again and Briggs
        was screaming for everyone to calm down as the dragon
        looked around. His voice like thunder filling the area,
        &#147;Know this I am K&#146;Arnon, I have chosen to
        return and I will call the near underground Keep as my
        own. You all are allies to me now as I am to you. Call
        upon me when you need and I will call upon you when I
        need.&#148; With a mighty sweep of his wings he leapt
        into the air and was gone. Briggs stood with one hand
        clenching the sword and one arm around the woodelf
        maidens waist, his eyes staring into hers as the dragon
        flew off to his new home. His eyes moved around to each
        of his family as they all began to wonder what would come
        next&#133;&#133;&#133;</font></p>
