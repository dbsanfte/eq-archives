            <p>I’d like to make a note in remembrance to the crew of flight STS-107, 
              who lost their lives on Saturday, February 1. The Columbia was NASA’s 
              oldest shuttle, logging 28 flights since 1981. Columbia was named 
              after the Boston, Massachusetts-based sloop that in 1792 maneuvered 
              past the dangerous sandbar at the mouth of a river extending more 
              than 1,000 miles/ through what is today southeast British Columbia, 
              Canada and the Washington-Oregon border. 
            <P>You can find complete coverage of the STS-107 at <a href=http://www.space.com/shuttlemissions/ target=Space.com>Space.com</a>, 
              including <a href=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sts107_bios.html target=bio’s of the astronauts>bio’s 
              of the astronauts</a> that are complete with interview clips. 
            <P><I>To the crew of the Columbia and to all who have had the greatest 
              honor to visit space:</I> 
            <P><B>HIGH FLIGHT </B><BR>
            <P> Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth<BR>
              And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; <BR>
              Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<BR>
              Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things<BR>
              You have not dreamed of wheeled and soared and swung<BR>
              High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there, <BR>
              I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<BR>
              My eager craft through footless halls of air. <BR>
              Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<BR>
              I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace<BR>
              Where never lark, or even eagle flew<BR>
              And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod<BR>
              The high untrespassed sanctity of space, <BR>
              Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

            <font class="text1"> <br>
            <p> <br>
            <p> Well since the latest talk is all about the upcoming Star Wars 
              Galaxies, I thought I'd share some general info. 
            <p>For those not in the know, SWG is another MMORG, created by Sony 
              Online with LucasArts. Set in time during the Galactic Civil War 
              (after the Deathstar destruction). You will be able to play a range 
              of classes, with <a href= http://www.swgcenter.com/info/species_list.asp  target=species>species</a> 
              such as: Bothan, Human, Trandoshan, Twi-lek, Zabrak, Mon Calamari, 
              Rodian, and your favorite I'm sure, Wookie. 
            <p>Just some questions asked on the <a href=http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/faq.jsp target=SWG FAQ's page>SWG 
              FAQ's page</a>. There are a ton here, make sure to check it out! 
            <p><B>Are there zones like in EQ?</B> 
            <p>Not exactly. The "zone model" doesn't really apply to Star Wars 
              Galaxies. We will have contained areas designed for exploration, 
              combat, player interaction, and travel, but the transitions between 
              these areas will be seamless and automatic. Players will feel like 
              they are adventuring across large sections of a planet, rather than 
              hopping from zone to zone. 
            <p><B>Will my character be based on a pre-defined archetype or "class?"</b> 
            <p>No. We want to give players the freedom to create characters with 
              a wide range of skills and abilities. Characters will be defined 
              primarily by the skills they possess and the types of activities 
              they pursue, and not by "classes." We're hoping this results in 
              thousands of unique characters with their own individual strengths. 
            <p><B>Will there be name constraints or professional titles?</b> 
            <p>We will enforce name constraints to help promote a Star Wars atmosphere. 
              You will not see LuukSkywalker777 running around. We do intend on 
              allowing players to attain professional titles based on the skills 
              they choose to focus on. 
            <p><b>Can I play a bounty hunter like Bossk or Boba Fett?</b> 
            <p>Yes, you can. There is a bounty hunter profession in the game, 
              which includes abilities such as tracking your targets. Bounty hunters 
              are not able to take down any target they wish; they are given a 
              list of possible targets and they sign up for a particular one at 
              the bounty hunter's guild. The more experienced you are as a bounty 
              hunter, the more difficult (and lucrative!) the targets offered 
              to you will be. Targets may include computer-controlled NPCs or 
              players who have incurred bounties because of breach of contract 
              or criminal actions 
            <p><b>Will I be able to play a Jedi?</b> 
            <p>Yes. Although the details are still being worked out, we are staying 
              true to the spirit of the films. Therefore, the journey to become 
              a Jedi will be difficult, but those players who choose this path 
              with find it very rewarding. 
            <p><B>Can I become Dark Jedi?</b> 
            <p>Yes. We're creating the Jedi system to take into account Dark Jedi. 
              However, be warned that the life of a Dark Jedi will be very perilous... 
            <p>And of course… <B>Can I be Luke Skywalker , Han Solo or Princess 
              Leia?</B> 
            <p>No. To preserve the continuity of the fiction, you will not be 
              able to play the key figures in the Star Wars universe. However, 
              you may cross paths with a few of them…

              Welcome to another edition of <i>Inquiring Minds Want to Know</i>. 
              This interview was with Tolmar, who currently plays with the Dark 
              Ages Scarabs. 
            <p>Q. <i>How did you come to be in Scarab? </i><br>
              A. I played EQ on SolRo and my soon to be cousin-in-law Sayuri had 
              just joined Scarab. He tried getting me on some raids but I always 
              got left behind. :( I had to wait till he was an elder member to 
              invite me in, but that wasn't till DAoC came out. Sayuri was the 
              one that talked me into playing, and I'm glad he did. Scarab is 
              the only kind of guild I would want to be a part of, and DAoC has 
              the RvR elements that I've grown so addicted to that I could never 
              play a purely PvE game again. 
            <p>Q. <i>Have you ever been to a ScarabFest? If so, what was the most 
              enjoyable thing you did? </i><br>
              A. Nope. Would love to, but my wife just doesn't understand the 
              idea of gamers getting together to have fun. Doesn't surprise me 
              as she can't understand how I could like computer games so much 
              in the first place. ;) 
            <p>Q. <i>What online game(s) do you play? </i><br>
              A. My first taste of online gaming was Halflife. The game was great 
              I thought, but the one flaw was that even with cable modem lag was 
              bad enough to make the game frustrating. Little did I know how good 
              I had it once I saw my first relic raid. ;) Anyway, I played EQ 
              for a couple years and was talked into joining DAoC. 
            <p>Q. <i>In the game(s), what name and type of character do people 
              know you best by? </i><br>
              A. Most people know me as Tolmar. I played hard to get up to 50 
              in the hopes of going out with the guild and tearing up the RvR 
              action. Little did I know that the Thane was not really the character 
              I envisioned. The hard part was that in PvE the Thane rocked. In 
              RvR though, I find it sad that I have a tough time soloing an enemy 
              tank (and most other classes for that matter =D). I couldn't bear 
              the thought of leveling another tank class to 50 so set my sights 
              on a runemaster that I had floating around level 20 for the longest 
              time. Janderon is now going to be my main for the immediate future.</p>
            <p>Q. <i>Why did you choose the class that you did? </i><br>
              A. I chose the Thane originally because I've always like tank classes, 
              but the warrior I played in EQ was too one dimensional for me. I 
              like a bit of magic thrown in. The Thane sounded perfect. Slice 
              things with my axe and cast lightning bolts. Life doesn't get any 
              better than that. ;) In EQ my main was a druid and I wanted a class 
              that could melee this time around. </p>
            <p>Q. <i>What is your favorite aspect of the game you play most? </i><br>
              A. The adrenaline rush you get when you come across folks from an 
              enemy realm. Especially when it's a surprise. </p>
            <p>Q. W<i>hat is your least favorite? </i><br>
              A. The fact that people that play 24/7 have a big advantage over 
              you. Not a big deal in PvE type games, but when you have enemies 
              out there that RvR non-stop it's hard to compete with that. Would 
              be nice to have a level playing field at some point. That's why 
              I like the Battleground zones. Everyone is pretty much at the same 
              level and realm ability rating. Makes for much even game play and 
              it then just comes down to skill not time played. Brings me back 
              to those old Half Life days! </p>
            <p>Q. <i>What game do you see yourself playing next and why? </i><br>
              A. I will probably play Star Wars Galaxies next. I really prefer 
              the fantasy D&amp;D type games better, but I can see myself getting 
              addicted to the breadth of possibilities in that game. Bounty hunter 
              just sounds plain all out fun. </p>
            <p>Q. <i>If you could be any character in real life from the game(s) 
              that you've played, what would it be? </i><br>
              A. I would have to go back to my D&amp;D days to remember that I 
              mostly played fighter types. My favorite character from D&amp;D 
              in fact was named Tolmar, and he was a big 7 foot tall warrior from 
              the frozen northlands of Vlekzed. That would be me in real life. 
              A big imposing figure wielding a huge sword. =)</p>
            <p>Q. <i>What is your favorite munchie while at the computer? </i><br>
              A. I don't really have one. I don't tend to munch while playing. 
              What I do consume is beer. Guiness is the elixir of life. ;)</p>
            <p>Q. <i>Outside of computers and being with Scarabs, what is your 
              next favorite hobby? </i><br>
              A. I have been a volleyball addict for many years. Before getting 
              married I would play 5-6 times a week. That dropped to once a week 
              afterwards. ;) Unfortunately I just blew out my ACL and MCL playing 
              volleyball. Looks like that once per week is not looking so good 
              anymore. </p>
            <p>Q. <i>What do you do in real life as a job and what do you WISH 
              you did in real life as a job? </i><br>
              A. I work in software at Fidelity Investments. Currently I am a 
              project manager still feeling the withdrawal symptoms of not writing 
              my own code anymore. If I could be anything I would love to be in 
              the computer games industry, but I know full well that most don't 
              make enough money to stay afloat, and those that do have to work 
              way too hard. Maybe I'd just like to be independently wealthy so 
              I wouldn't have to work at all. I'm one of those people that could 
              be happy not working! </p>
            <p>Q. <i>What is your favorite/best achievement in and out of the 
              game(s)? </i> <br>
              A. In game, it would have to be reaching 1100 in armorcrafting. 
              I started out thinking it would be good to work on it. When I saw 
              how long it would take I never thought I could make it. Somehow 
              I put my nose to the grindstone and pushed it out. Out of game, 
              it would be when I was at the height of my volleyball skills I had 
              level A rated players impressed with my game and telling me I was 
              far underrated. I got many invitations to play on tournament teams 
              because of my lower rating. Was a blast to play in those tournaments.

              <B>DAoC</B> - Since so many test patches have been released, and 
              not everyone always keeps up to date on them. I thought I’d mention 
              a few of the best ones soon to be out. I’ve cut some interesting 
              pieces out of the updates for you:<BR>
            <P> <B>Sprinting:</b> Sprint can now be bound to a key in the keyboard 
              configuration. Very handy as this will free up an extra slot for 
              a spell or style! Now... where to find a spare key!<BR>
            <P> <B>Dueling System:</B> By popular request, there is now a way 
              to fight characters from your own realm - a dueling system, where 
              both parties agree to fight. <BR>
            <P> To start the duel, select the character you want to fight and 
              type, "/duel challenge". The character responds with "/duel accept" 
              to accept the challenge and fight you. They can also type "/duel 
              decline" to reject the challenge. Once the fight starts, either 
              combatant can type "/duel surrender" to surrender the fight. <BR>
            <P> All duels are to the death. No constitution or experience is lost 
              on a dueling death, but you still must be resurrected by a friendly 
              healer/cleric/druid, or release. A message is printed to all nearby 
              on victory or surrender notifying bystanders of the outcome of the 
              duel. <BR>
            <P> Oh goodie, now when you are having a tiff with your significant 
              other you can beat each other to a pulp, venting the frustration 
              harmlessly and with no police! <BR>
            <P> <B>Monster/Name Color Coding:</B> There is now a way to display 
              the names over all in-game models (player, monster, and enemy player). 
              There is a new slash command: "/colornames" that enables the new 
              name coloring scheme: <BR>
            <P> Monsters: Names are colored by con color <BR>
              NPCs: Cyan <BR>
              Realm Enemies: Red <BR>
              Guild Members: Dark Green <BR>
              Players: Normal Color (light blue) <BR>
              Graves/Dead People: Brown <BR>
              Selected Target: White <BR>
            <P> Note that when you turn this on, selected target is no longer 
              yellow, it is white. Yellow names are yellow-con level monsters. 
              <BR>
            <P> To restore the game to the old system, type "/oldnamecolors", 
              which restores the original name coloring. Your name coloring preference 
              will persist across zoning and quitting. <BR>
            <P> Like I’m not having enough problems with the colored boxes, colored 
              squiggles in the boxes, remembering what each of those squiggles 
              does, my con colors are now reversed and I’m trying to blow up my 
              group mate while wondering how come the monster isn’t dying. Yipe! 
              <BR>
            <P> <B>Name Toggling:</B> There is a new slash command used to hide 
              player, monster, and grave names. The command is as follows: <BR>
            <P> /hidenames players | monsters | self | graves | all <BR>
              /shownames players | monsters | self | graves | all <BR>
            <P> Shift-N effectively acts like a toggle between "/hidenames all" 
              and "/shownames all". (Example: /hidenames self graves will hide 
              your own name and those names over graves.) <BR>
            <P> <B>10 Icon/10 Bank Toolbar:</B> You’ll be able to have 10 hotbars 
              with 10 icons each! <BR>
            <P> There has also been a new slash command added, /qbar which allows 
              you to pick a quickbar with a slash command. Example: /qbar 2 switches 
              to your second quickbar, the same as pressing Shift-2. This change 
              allows you to assign /macro commands that will select between different 
              quickbars. The current quickbar page will now persist across zoning 
              and quitting. <BR>
            <P> Cool! Now I can Shift 1, cast spell 4, shift 0, buff, /qbar 3, 
              run, Shift 2, eyes. glazing. over. <BR>
            <P> Well some nice goodies coming out, and hopefully soon! There are 
              always the little fixes they are doing of course, armor dying, monsters, 
              etc. I just picked some of the major fun ones. <BR>
