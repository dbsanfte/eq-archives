Hail. Well met!<br>
My name is Cybele. You may have seen me once or twice before... I am afraid I keep a rather low profile...except in battle that is. I love to fight!<br><br>
	Ah... So you are wondering what my tale is?<br><br>
Well, I was a fighter and a Scarab before I could even walk. 'Tis true! Ozwyn found me early one fall morning in the Freeport Arena. The shrill screeches of quarreling rats had caught his attention. He followed the sound though the rows of bleachers. When he spotted me, I was standing over the bodies of three giant rats. I was only two years old. I was dirty and scratched and my knuckles were bleeding, but Ozwyn always said I had the biggest grin he'd ever seen stretching across my face. <br><br>
	Ozwyn was hardly the type to raise a young child so he handed me over to Cain Darkmore for training. For many happy years, I spent every day in the halls of the Warrior's Guild in Freeport. The memories of my childhood antics soon faded into dim tales told by firelight on long autumn evenings. Then one morning I decided to explore Norrath on my own.<br><br>
I was wandering aimlessly through the Commonlands when I heard a cry for help. I looked over my shoulder and saw something that made my blood boil. A creature had died and found a way to come back to life. Now its reanimated form was chasing down a child. The boy was running towards the guards, but I could tell that he was not going to reach them in time.<br><br>
	With a growl, I leaped into action--kicking and taunting the foul reincarnation until it forgot the child completely and turned on me. I smiled and with a mighty blow, the skeleton crumpled. Its limbs clanked to the ground making the most delightful sound! I laughed and gave the pile of bones a final kick, scattering the pieces everywhere. I turned to tend to the lad's wounds and found another skeleton standing over the boy's unconscious form. Rage filled me as I struck down this second abomination.<br><br>
	That was my first meeting with the undead....<br><br>
From that moment on I have hated all Undead with a passion. They should not be allowed to walk the face of Norrath. They were taken from the living world because they were not worthy. They are not worthy. They have no right to come back and walk above ground.<br><br>
	Aye, It may be a bit harsh, but that is the way of things. All is not pretty and easy in Norrath. Rallos Zek teaches that we all must struggle to survive. To live. And if we die, then we die. And we will die well! But to come back again... to try to force your way back into the world of all that lives... Ack! Foul!!!!! Those twisted souls stuck between the living and the non! They have placed a stain upon Norrath. A stain which will not be erased until every Undead creature is punished and sent back to the void of beyond!<br><br>
	Ever since that first fateful meeting in the Commonlands, I have been on a journey to rid Norrath of this taint. Cain Darkmore could not understand my passion and so I left the safety of the Warrior's Hall to seek out the man who had first found me.<br><br>
When I met Ozwyn again, I learned that he had helped to form a guild called Scarab. I quickly found myself a loyal member of their guild - fighting to promote honor and valor....
