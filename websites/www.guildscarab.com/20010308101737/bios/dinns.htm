The scene: Three years ago, outskirts of Clan Runnyeye. 
<br><br>
Dinaden crouched behind a pika bush, gesturing his two younger brothers to do the same. Dinnar and Dinskin
crouched, their banded armor clinking softly. Dinaden glanced back at them. They were an impressive pair,
twins, and each was 3 inches taller than Dinaden. They fidgeted anxiously, fingering the hilts of their swords,
probably wondering why they had to go around skulking behind bushes, as if they were halflings. Dinaden
smiled. So young, and so eager. He remembered when he had been like that. Each of his brothers wore newly
made banded armor. Dinaden had finished Dinnar’s suit only 3 days ago. They had then mounted up and rode
to Rivervale. 
<br><br>
Their objective however was not the quaint halfling town but the vile headquarters of the Clan Runnyeye
Goblins. Dinaden had raided Runnyeye several times previously as part of Lord Hrothgoomba’s Knights, a
mercenary company he had recently departed. Dinaden felt his brother’s training had finally been complete - at
least as compete as it could be in non-combat situations. Thus the trip to Runnyeye. As warriors of Halas, it was
time for his brothers to test themselves against real opponents. Clan Runnyeye was now believed to be
considerably weakened from the battle to take Runnyeye Citadel, a small castle nestled deep underground.
Dinaden and his company of warriors had been repelled, and not without cost, thought Dinaden, rubbing a fresh
scar on his bicep and thinking of his brave friend Halteff. But now, halfling scouts reported that Runnyeye was in
great disarray, and the goblin leadership splintered and bickering amongst themselves. No better time for a raid,
thought Dinaden. "Stay here." With just those words, Dinaden drew his twin Langesaxes and stalked out into
the open, approaching the goblin sentries posted at the mouth of the cave. 
<br><br>
The four goblin sentries looked at each other. Guttural squawking that passed for the goblin tongue passed
between them. Dinaden approached until he was less than 30 feet from the opening of Clan Runnyeye. The
goblin sentries apparently decided a lone warrior was killable, for they drew their crude swords and charged,
and goblins never attack unless sure of victory. Dinaden tried not to chuckle, waited until they were within 10
feet of him to bring his twin blades into a defensive position. The goblins quickly surrounded him, more babbling
passing between them; apparently arguing over which would attack first. Dinaden waited patiently, apparently
unconcerned with his encirclement. A keen observer would have detected, however, that Dinaden’s eyes were
darting back and forth, keeping track of the location of all of his foes, his feet repositioning themselves subtly, his
wrist quickly flipping over one Langesaxe until it was held backhanded, as a dagger.
<br><br>
The goblin behind him stabbed out suddenly. With only the quickest glance backwards, Dinaden parried with
one sword. The other three goblins leapt at him as he parried. Din whirled around to slash at the goblin that had
attacked, then parried another slash. Another goblin he tripped, dodging its clumsy swing, and the last Dinaden
stunned with a vicious backhand swing of his guantleted hand. In a flurry of flashing steel that neither Dinskin or
Dinnar followed, Dinaden laid about him with a series of slashes. The blood of the four dead sentries stained the
dirt of the cave entry. Dinaden gestured casually for his brothers to come out of their hiding place. The whole
'fight' had taken all of ten seconds.
<br><br>
Dinnar and Dinskin followed Dinaden into the cave that was the home of Clan Runnyeye goblins. Dinskin pulled
out a torch, lit it. Looking about, they saw broken down scraps of furniture and the rotting remains of several
small unfortunate forest creatures, but no other signs of life. "We go in. Keep quiet and your wits about you,"
Dinaden muttered. They walked around the bend to the right, passed another opening that led into the Gorge of
King Xorb, and down a large flight of stairs. They met with no resistance, or even sign of habitation. Perhaps
they had killed more of the Runnyeyes than he had reported to Lord Hrothgoomba. They continued walking
downwards. The air took on a chill, and Dinnar wrapped his polar bear pelt around his shoulders more tightly.
Dinaden lit a torch of his own. "Where are they, brother?" asked Dinnar. "I don’t know, tis strange to find this
foul pit so empty," replied Dinaden. A half hour later, they had already passed by the point that Dinaden had
previously decided they must not pass, an armory of sorts which Din knew was the home of a Runnyeye
Warlord, one of the few goblins whose fighting abilities Din respected. "Ha ha, they are frightened of us,
Dinaden," Dinskin guffawed. Dinaden doubted it, but wondered where all the goblins were. 
<br><br>
Without warning, Dinaden felt a sharp pain in the back of his neck. Reaching back, it was as he feared, a small
dart was lodged in the space between in his helm and gorget. Dinaden pitched the dart to the floor in anger. A
second later, the room was crawling with goblins, all decked out in ratty leather armor and swinging a vicious
array of spiked weapons. All was chaos. Dinaden parried wildly, dodging and slashing six times for every attack
that his brothers attacked, but he could already feel himself weakening, his arms getting heavy - the early phases
of paralytic nerve poison, he knew. Dinaden tried to stay in front of his brothers, but they were too quick, and
the battle too chaotic. Din lost track of where Dinskin and Dinnar were; his world was a haze of blood, steel,
and goblins.
<br><br>
Dinaden had already counted at least four goblins that he had killed, but still more poured into the large hall from
three directions. It did not look good. Dinnar had a huge gash on his sword arm and was bleeding badly.
Dinskin cut down a goblin with an earth to sky cut that Dinaden had taught him not a week before, but two
more goblins took the place of their fallen brother, and Dinskin was forced to retreat. Dinaden’s mind worked
furiously, weighing their dwindling options, trying to think of a way they could escape. Dinaden cursed himself
bitterly. He had been a fool to bring his brothers here for their first hunt. Nobody knew the true status of the
Runnyeye clan, and it was now clear that they still had more than enough warriors to kill all of them. Din saw
Dinnar’s sword get knocked aside by a large, well-muscled goblin. Had he not taken enough time in showing
Dinnar proper parrying technique? Dinaden’s felt despair and concern clench around his heart. Dinnar was
already covered with a multitude of bleeding wounds. Dinaden parried three more attacks and dispatched
another goblin, but as he watched out of the corner of his eye, a cruel blow from a goblin club caught Dinnar in
the side, doubling over the young warrior in pain.
<br><br>
There was only one way any of them were going to live to see another day. Dinaden roared "Get behind me,
NOW!!!!" then lashed out with renewed fury, lunging wildly to distract the goblins from his wounded brothers.
Dinnar limped behind Dinaden, holding his right leg, a look of terror in his young eyes--but he still gripped his
sword. Dinaden kicked out viciously, simultaneously turning aside a stabbing attack, and heard the sharp crack
of a goblin skull shattering. He quickly shifted in front of Dinnar, saw his brother was safe for the time being,
then looked around for Dinskin. A horrible scream. It was Dinskin. He lay broken and bleeding on the cave
floor. Dinskin tried to crawl away from the huge goblin stood over him, whose bloody sword was raised high
for the killing blow, but it was clear that his fate was sealed, until -
<br><br>
"NOOOOO!" Before Din could stop him, Dinnar knocked Dinaden aside, sprang forward with a ragged
scream, a primal barbarian sound that defied pain and cried out to defend his twin. What happened next seemed
to happen in slow motion. Dinaden reached for his brother, but it was too late. Turning from the man on the
ground, the goblin warlord whirled and swung his blade at his new assailant in a vicious arc. Too late, Dinnar
raised his hands in mid-leap to defend himself. The blade cut deeply into Dinnar’s neck, and he flopped to the
ground with a horrible thud. Dinnar writhed in agony as his blood splashed on the cold, unforgiving stone floor. 
<br><br>
What happened next, Dinaden only later remembered. At the time, he knew that he was probably going to die,
but he had to make one last attempt to save them. Din leapt forward, parrying the goblin’s attack in midair and
cutting him down as he landed. His tired muscles bent over to pick up Dinskin, flung him over his back. Grim
faced, Dinaden reversed his grip on one of his swords and threw. The langesaxe whirled end over end to lodge
between the eyes of another goblin. With strength born of adrenaline, Dinaden grabbed Dinnar’s bloody collar,
jerked his brother to his feet and began running. He bowled aside a cluster of surprised goblins that were
blocking the exit, and dragged Dinnar’s unmoving body along as they shot out of the cave and kept running,
running, until there was only pain, and exhaustion, and the numbing inevitability of the poison.
<br><br>
Dinaden awoke in a tiny bed. His legs hung over the end of the bed by a good foot and a half. Thinking that this
was a particularly ironic Hell, Dinaden tried to sit up to see what new terrors fate wished to visit upon him. A
tiny woman pushed him back to the bed, applied wet cloth to his forehead. "Woah there, fella, you aren’t ready
to get up again just yet." A halfling nurse, Din realized. He must have made it to Rivervale, which
meant.... Dinskin walked into his room, not wearing his armor, but fit with an arm cast, a leg cast, and a small
army of bandages. Dinaden looked around for his other brother. "Leave us, Mira," stated Dinskin. The nurse
left them alone. "Where is Dinnar?" inquired Dinaden. Dinskin’s eyes filled with tears. "He’s... he's gone,
Dinaden," Dinskin managed to choke out. Dinaden layed back on the small pillow, closed his eyes. A small sigh
escaped his lips. With difficulty, he blinked back his own tears, clenched his jaw. Dinskin needed his strength
now, and as the eldest in a barbarian warrior family, Dinaden could not allow himself an emotional breakdown
when his family needed him most. A thousand things ran through Dinaden’s mind, but he knew no appropriate
words. He spoke anyway: "He was... a good man, a brave warrior," Dinaden said. But his words sounded flat
and empty, even to his own ears. "Damn it Dinaden! Is that all you have to say? Our brother is DEAD,"
pleaded Dinskin. Despite his pain, Dinaden sat up in bed, then gritted his teeth as he forced himself to stand.
Without another word, Dinaden hugged his brother close, wishing there was more he could say. 
<br><br>
3 years later ....
<br><br>
Dinaden sat with Treewhisper on the grass of the hill behind the Jade Tiger. The sun was beginning to set. He
sipped a honey mead. "And so, I'm afraid Dinskin never forgave me, Tree. Shortly after Dinnar died, Dinskin
left the path of the warrior and went to study the way of the shaman from the elder one in Halas. We have
hardly spoken since that time, but I hear from him from time to time." Dinaden drained his mug, wiped foam
from his goatee with the back of his hand. "I know now that Dinnar’s death was not really my fault. It was
nobody’s fault - but it taught me one thing. No matter how well equipped one is, no matter the odds, this world
is a dangerous place, and death can come for you in the blink of an eye." Din took Tree’s hand in his own, spoke
gently: "I know that sometimes I am overprotective of you, but as I watch you grow, I... cannot help but be
reminded of my brothers. Forgive me if I seem out of line sometimes, but when I see you defending Tunare’s
creation against those that would destroy it, sometimes, my mind returns to that cursed day in Runnyeye." 
<br><br>
Dinaden sucked down another honey mead, sighed in contentment. Dinaden’s haggard face then brightened
slightly. "On the other hand, you are now far stronger than Dinskin, and you don’t need my fool advice in most
things." Dinaden beamed a smile at Treewhisper. Tree blushed slightly. "But I cannot help but want to be by your
side. Know this, I shall never leave you, my love." With that, Dinaden pulled Treewhisper into his embrace and
kissed her tenderly, and Treewhisper sensed that whatever demons Dinaden had battled with in the past, the
future was now bright.
