<p>Dinaden walked briskly towards Scarab Freeport Headquarters. The building was in the north business ward, near the bank and many other area businesses. People bustled around busily, rushing to get to where they were going. Dammit, his trusty sword was poking him in the back again. Dinaden sighed. With a practiced movement and soft grunt, he carefully adjusted his mithril sword in its harness on his back.  It was a fine weapon, and had never failed him in spilling the blood of countless evil monsters, but Dinaden had seen enough blood to last a lifetime. Din walked into Scarab HQ, climbed the steps to his quarters. His quarters were much larger and, despite his protests, more luxurious, than when he had first joined up, but were still decorated in the simple, martial aesthetics of the average barbarian. Various trinkets that he had acquired in his adventures, trophy animal heads, and weapons that Din had used in his younger days adorned the walls. Its good to be home, thought Din, dropping his backpack on the floor.  Freeport was always a little humid and bit too hot, and what they considered the "fall" season was rather a joke, but hey, you take what you can get, you take what you can get, thought Din.</p>

<p>Dinaden unsnapped the magical green bracer he wore on his left forearm. It had been given him by a thankful town in reward for slaying a renegade minotaur. Each piece of his equipment still brought back vivid memories, of friends that had stood by him at the time, and the evils they defeated in the name of Scarab. Dinaden continued the laborious process of unstrapping his magic platemail. How proud he had been when he had completed his set of it! Now, Din placed the armor carefully on the soft fur polar bear pelt on the floor, given him by his mother for protecting him against the Everfrost cold. Perhaps he should have worn that when he had done battle with the mighty ice dragon Vox in her lair, Din thought with a chuckle. That would have mom turning in her grave, thought Din with a grin.</p>

<p>Dinaden shrugged his way out of his shoulder sword harness, tossed the sword onto the bed, turned towards the small spring in the corner of the room. It burbled up, floating about 4 feet off the ground, magical power recirculating the sparkling clear water in a small basin fountain. Despite what they said in Halas, sometimes being friends with wizards DID pay. Din leaned over the fountain and splashed water on his face. "EEP!" Laughing, he said "warmer." The water shimmered slightly. Din splashed more water. "Ahh, that's better," said Dinaden, letting the warm water wash away the dust of the road. He dried his face on a towel, picked up the sword. As he lifted the sword from the bed and started to look around for somewhere to hang it, Din's left arm involuntarily drew the sword-shhhhhiiiink. Din looked down at his sword arm as if to say, "silly arm, what is there to kill?" Exhaling peacefully, Din flipped the sword around, rolling his wrist, reversing his grip to a backhanded grip a certain bard had showed him. Of course, the bard had been using a wakizashi, but then Dinaden was a barbarian. Foosh foosh foosh. Foosh foosh foosh. Foosh foosh. Din swished the huge magic blade through the air effortlessly, performing an intricate series of cuts.  Dinaden didn't like to do that among his Scarab friends, it was too showy.  Despite the chronic pain in his back, the movements still came so easily, and with amazing power and grace. When did I ever get so damn good? Dinaden thought in a moment of pride. A grin crept across Dinaden's features of its own accord.</p>

<p>Spinning the sword around once more, Din returned the sword to its sheath, hung it over his bed, then collapsed onto it for a much deserved rest.  Dinaden stretched out his massive frame on his custom build bed, one of the few luxuries he allowed himself. "Ahhh," a massive sigh escaped Din's tired body. It was a sound of fatigue and long suffering in a body that had experienced more than its share of the tender mercies of the evil creatures of Norrath. Perhaps the time had come for him to ease off a bit from wild adventuring, become an instructor at the Scarab training hall for younger warriors, or take up running the Jade Tiger Inn, which he owned. He thought back to his day of adventuring with Scarab. It had been a good day, typical of a life that had been more blessed than he often acknowledged. As many other days, it had been a day of small triumphs, friendship shared and sealed in blood and laughter, wisdom attained on the wrong end of a club, and another few dozen platinum pieces to finance Dinaden's retirement. Din cursed reflexively at that weak thought. -Pffft, as he used to say in his younger days. Din chuckled at himself. Thinking back, Dinaden rolled over onto his back, sighed again, a more contented sound this time, and a wide smile spread across his weathered face.</p>

<p>He carefully removed his eyepatch and laid it on the dresser, touched the ugly scar underneath. In an uncharacteristically profound moment, Dinaden reflected on his days as an adventurer.  Even with only one good eye, I still recognized good people and followed them. For that, he was grateful.  He had seen too many others throw their lives away on causes not worth a drop of ale, watched sadly as too many of his childhood friends took the wrong path in life. Dinaden pondered, venturing to think that perhaps he had led a worthwhile life so far, protected those who needed it, done his part in making the world a little better, with the help of his friends in Scarab, which he would not trade for any friends in all Norrath. Can anyone ask for more, really, Din wondered. Dinaden looked at his armor lying on the floor; it looked to him so suddenly alien, a cold blue steel shell of a past life, now shed. Din knew he still had a path to walk, yet from now on, he would lead a very different life. Tunare grant me the wisdom to acknowledge the road ahead of me, and the courage to walk it, prayed Din. It was not the most original prayer, but it was a good one nevertheless, Dinaden thought with satisfaction. Whoever thought I would end up praying to Tunare? thought Dinaden. With another brief prayer to Tunare to heal one of his chronic injuries, the gruff warrior pulled the covers up to his chin, just the way he liked them, and dreamed very pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>Thunder boomed in the still Antonican night. Dinaden Gahalantine looked up from the mug he was drying. The gods' disapproval sounded again, louder. Closer. The clouds burst forth all
at once with rain, and the water beat down upon the Jade Tiger with a hiss. Torches burned brightly in their sconces, illuminating the main hall with an orange glow. Shadow danced across
wet travelers, just now entering. Business will be good tonight, thought Dinaden. Quickly bored of thoughts of coin, Dinaden's drifted to other things. </p>

<p>A party of adventurers walked in, clad all in steel and laughing boisterously among themselves. One largish man seemed particularly enthused. He waved his hand, still clutching a sword, in
the air. Din caught snippets of conversation: "...and did you see?...then I... tumbling to the ground, haha!" "Aye, but then you...with the beer and that...when you..." came the roguish
reply. The first man roared even louder with laughter. "Hahahaha, aye, that I did, but..." Din smiled as he dried another mug. Did I sound so foolish in my younger days; was I such a
braggart as this? Aye, I probably was, Din decided with a hearty chuckle.</p>

<p>The Jade Tiger was ablaze with life. The evening was now well on, and the main hall filled with patrons. Dinaden smiled with contentment, not only that he would be paying the servants a
little extra come this harvest festival, but that so many found happiness in his simple inn. Still, the Jade Tiger had not been new when Dinaden had purchased it. 
The rooms upstairs were cozy and quaint, yet were old and had need of renovation and new furnishings. Handing over control of the main hall to his lead servant David, Dinaden tromped
up the stairs toward the lodging rooms. 
Of the refurbishing of a couple of the rooms and their furnishings in particular, Dinaden paid personal attention, trying quite unsuccessfully to stifle a smile at some memories that came to
him once more. A candle, already burned low, guttered in a bedside sconce as Dinaden entered the last room in the hall on the left. The onetime patron and now proprietor of the Jade
Tiger gently blew out the candle. Din sighed a long sigh, a faraway look in his damp eye. Though he had so much, some dreams were not meant to be, he thought sadly. </p>

<p>"Mr. Gahalantine, the carpenter for the stair has arrived. He asks your leave to begin constructions in the morning," piped up Pipin the young, a wee lad of a boy who had been trying
unsuccessfully to break into the Temple of Marr when Dinaden had found him. "Aye, Pipin, tell him to begin first thing in the morning." "Yes, m'lord!" Pipin replied enthusiastically
scampered off, skipping unnecessarily as was the way of children. </p>

<p>Din looked around the main hall, now fully occupied by the happily distracted citizens of Freeport. Raucous cheers of encouragement at one table where the patrons were engaged in a
drinking contest blended with the discussion of a group of bejeweled nobles in a booth. A dwarf arm wrestled a barbarian, neither willing to yield, a look of fierce concentration evident on
each of their faces. Dinaden's mood began to lift, a smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. Torches sparkled brightly and shadows danced on the faces of all present. For the moment at
least, all was as it should be.</p> 




<p><font color="blue"><b><a name="three">Dinaden's retirement story, Part 3: Politics, part I</a></b></font></p>

<p>A few months later...</p>

<p>Borgu Bladesong played a plaintive elven melody on his lute. After his own retirement from adventuring, Dinaden had persuaded Borgu to come to the Jade Tiger and perform every once
in a while. The patrons that were not too drunk or tin-eared to appreciate music were treated to the sweet music of a master musician more fitting to a throne room than a common tavern.
Borgu's deft fingers danced with long practiced ease over the strings. Dinaden lifted a mug in salute to his friend's skill, caught Borgu's eye, nodded his appreciation.  "You can't...always get...what you waaant, but if you try sometimes...you might find... you get what you neeeeed," warbled the great bard, moving on now to more popular local folk
ballads. </p>

<p>Walking back to the bar area, Dinaden was accosted by two well dressed, portly men. 
One of the men, clad all in gold silks, spoke with a obsequious smile: "Ahhh! Mr. Gahalantine! I am SO pleased to have found you! I have the great pleasure of informing you of a most
excellent business opportunity in the new lands of Velious..." Dinaden knew the type. Since his retirement, he had grown uncomfortably familiar with the merchants of the north Freeport
business district that frequented the Jade Tiger. They were as friendly as the next chap, usually, yet Dinaden could not help but be disgusted by their obsession with coin. Dinaden's
beloved Jade Tiger had expanded greatly, and he had been forced to hire many new servants. Sometimes Dinaden felt ashamed, in spite of himself. Servants, piles of silver... ach, it was
not the warrior way. Merchants had a knack for divining the whereabouts of wealth, and as they saw the expensive renovations to the Jade Tiger take shape, they swarmed like flies.
Sometimes they even had the temerity to interrupt him while he was eating the evening meal. That was a big mistake. </p>

<p>The salesman was still rattling on: "...and an expeditious application of your holdings towards the new shipping routes being established would no doubt be highly..." With a snort, the
other man pushed the first aside, and spoke: 
"Bah, do not bother master Gahalantine with your prattling. He is one that deserves better company, and only the finest things that Freeport has to offer. And such have I for you,
Dinaden." He produced a small leather pouch. "Go ahead, open it!" Dinaden opened the pouch to find a fancy black eyepatch, made of the softest hand-tooled leather, and encrusted
with a ring of sparkling diamonds around the outer rim. "A gift, from his lordship the Duke of Freeport, Sir Edmund Lucan." At the name, Dinaden's back involuntarily went rigid, his lip
curled. "What need have I of such things?" Dinaden asked derisively. "It is a simple matter of reconciliation, m'lord. The Duke wishes to bury the hatchet over past...misunderstandings
between himself and Scarab, and you...are the most settled member of Scarab in Freeport," spoke the messenger. Dinaden fingered the eyepatch briefly, appraisingly. The gems alone
were worth more than a suit of armor...but...no, he could not accept it. Dinaden was reminded of a halfling saying Jayfoot was fond of: "Ye can't shake Innoruuk's hand and say your
only kidding."</p>

<p>And Sir Edmund Lucan of Delrey was an evil man. A proud, selfish knight and politician, Dinaden and his brothers in Scarab had sadly watched his rise to power throw a shadow of
oppression and base morality over what was once the most free and prosperous city in all of Antonica. Since his return to Freeport, Dinaden has been disgusted to see the slow but
inexorable degeneration of local culture under the rule of Sir Lucan. It had been a long time since Dinaden had been to Freeport, and what he found upon his return had greatly saddened
him. Previously honest and friendly Freeport citizens lied and stole, and would as soon spit on you as hail a stranger just into town from the long road. </p>

<p>Thinking back, Dinaden remembered how, in earlier days, Scarab had tried political and then more direct measures to keep Lucan from gaining control of West Freeport. All of those
measures had failed. A month after Dinaden's retirement, and with Scarab and their allies occupied in the lands of Kunark, Lucan had consolidated his power by declaring the North
Freeport city council dissolved, and declared himself Mayor and Lord Protector of the City of Freeport. With his loyal horde of militia thugs discouraging all complaints at this maneuver,
no one had dared oppose him. </p>

<p>"The Duke would like to enjoy the pleasure of your company as well, Mr. Gahalantine," the messenger's voice broke Dinaden's reverie. "A banquet is scheduled for this Saturday, in the
Hall of the High Priests at the Temple of Marr, to commemorate the installment of the newly appointed Bishop of Freeport." The messenger looked into Dinaden's eye, spoke coyly: "All
of Freeport's...leading citizens...will be there." Din dropped the eyepatch back into the pouch. 
"I really can't..." "Accept the gift, or attend the banquet?!" snapped the messenger, suddenly more haughty and forceful. "Neither. I have matters aplenty to attend to here. Give my
regrets to the Duke." The messenger regained his previous solicitation, a mask of pleasantness fell over his features. "Well, I hope you will reconsider. Mr. Jendl does put on a most
excellent banquet." Dinaden's face blanched. </p>

<p>"What...did...you say? Jendl? Who is Jendl to be interfering in matters of the church?" demanded Din. William Jendl was the captain of Lucan's raggedy militia, a man more famous for
his skill at lying and womanizing than for keeping the peace. "Why, bite your tongue, rogue, his Grace Jendl has just been named the new Bishop by his lordship the Duke!" replied the
messenger. 
Dinaden sat down quickly. He felt as though he was going to be physically ill. One such as Jendl could NOT be allowed to rule the church. It was...an abomination. He was thankful that
Cloud and Peabodi no longer came much to Freeport. Seeing Jendl sitting on the throne of St. Marr would have broken their hearts. Still, Dinaden knew what he must do. He gathered his
composure, forced his voice not to quaver with the disgust he felt. "Well, Jendl and I go way back, way back indeed, why don't you tell them then that I will be attending after all..."</p>
<p>/timpani: BUM BUM BUMMMMM!!!</p>
