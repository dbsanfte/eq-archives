Born in my beautiful city of Felwithe, I was nurtured and looked after with much loving care.  Life was quite simple then.  I wasn't abandoned by my parents and raised by a pack of wolves, like some visitors to my city claimed to be.  In fact, I had so few cares and so little knowledge of the outside world that I rarely believed the stories the outsiders would tell.  There were many outsiders that would visit my home from time to time.  They always fascinated me, and I loved to listen to their tales, although I rarely believed them.  Yet, their tales gave me something to dream about when my mind was idle, so I continued to listen.<BR><BR>My parents, although they loved me dearly and taught me in the principles of truth, had very little impact on my early life.  You see, at a very young age, I, like all High Elves in Felwithe, was tested for certain talents, intellectual skills, and wisdom that would qualify me for admission into the circles of the High Elven Magi.  I have no memory of this first test other than the fact that I passed.  Shortly afterward, I entered into the Junior Academy, which, for a few years, would instruct me in the basics of the arcane sciences.<BR><BR>The Junior Academy became my new home, and my classmates became my new family.  Although I remember much more about the Junior Academy than I do about my true family, my memory of those years is still quite vague.  However, I do remember that I was a very talented student.  I'd frequently finish all my assignments earlier than my classmates, and I'd spend my leisure time fishing and swimming in the crystal clear pools and listening to the outsiders tell their strange tales at the inn.<BR><BR>It's important to understand that the Junior Academy, being the first and most basic arcane institution, instructed all the classes of the magi.  Only after graduation would we move into a dedicated study of our chosen class.  But, while in the Junior Academy, enchanters, clerics, magicians, and wizards all studied and worked together.  Throughout our career in the Junior Academy, we would be tested in order to determine which class would suit us best.<BR><BR>So, being the gifted student that I was, my mind was constantly filled with new questions about things arcane.  Often, while I'd fish, I'd dream of harnessing amazing powers and going on grand adventures.  From the tales I'd heard from the outsiders, I learned a great deal about powerful spellcasters.  One day, an old and withered enchanter came to the inn.  After serving him some of our finest wine, I talked for hours with him about his adventures.  I was captivated by his stories of charming magnificent creatures and controlling their actions.  Many other events similar to this happened which increased my interest in all the classes of the Magi.  How I longed to be able to cast huge fireballs like the mighty wizards and to change my appearance like the elusive enchanters!  While many of my classmates quickly found a favorite class, my in-depth study of each class gave me great yearning to be all of them!  I couldn't choose just one.<BR><BR>Thus, one day, a question occurred to me that would indirectly change my life.  I began to wonder that if clerics, enchanters, magicians, and wizards alike can study together in the Junior Academy, why can't they continue in that manner and learn the mysteries of all the classes together?  Why can't the most intelligent Enchanter comprehend the most basic Wizard scroll?  So, the next day in class, I asked this question to my instructor.  Somehow, I expected her to give me a very complicated and confusing answer that I couldn't understand.  However, instead of giving me an answer - despite its complexity - she rudely said that it was a stupid question and I ought to put my mind to more productive thinking.<BR><BR>Disturbed by this response, I made up my mind to find out the answer for myself.  But how?  I knew that an answer existed, regardless of what my instructor told me.  After class that day, I quickly finished all my chores and sneaked into the Felwithe Library.  The Library is off-limits to most people, including those in the Junior Academy, but I didn't care.  I had a mission to accomplish!  I "borrowed" a brewery barrel from the inn, placed it beneath the Library window, and climbed in.<BR><BR>I fell through the window and onto the marble floor.  When I stood up and brushed myself off, I was stunned by the numberless books and scrolls on the selves and tables.  I didn't know where to begin, but I guess it didn't really matter, so I started with the shelf closest to me.  I pulled out a book, and only barely started looking at it when I suddenly rose off the floor!  I had no idea what was happening to me.  I turned my head around and saw a huge, floating mound of earth that had grabbed me by my robe.  The elemental carried me through the air and dropped me on the desk of the Chief Librarian.<BR><BR>"What have you brought me today, Kobarntik?" the librarian said as she looked me over.  "What's a youngun like you doing in here?"  She smiled wryly.<BR><BR>I quickly scrambled off her desk, stood up straight, and declared that I had a question that I needed to answer and no mound of dirt would stop me.  I soon decided that was a foolish thing to say as the elemental picked me up and threw me out the door into the rain.<BR><BR>That night, as I sat on my bed and nursed my bruises, I started thinking about that experience.  I was amazed at the power of that elemental, and the control the librarian had over it.  I made up my mind to learn more about that elemental, and the next day I stopped the chief librarian as she was about to enter the Library to start her day's work.  To make a long story short, she allowed me in and showed me a few tricks about controlling elementals.  From that day on, I knew I wanted to become a Magician!<BR><BR></font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
