                      <br>
                      Lilla’s childhood was very happy, growing up in a warm loving 
                      family. She was a special child, her mother Almath was chief 
                      Medicine woman of her Clan, and very respected. Her father 
                      was the Great Shaman. But he was not the father she grew 
                      up with. Soon after becoming a chosen (selected to bear 
                      the Great Shaman’s child, a Clan tradition and Honor), she 
                      conceived then returned to her own Clan to chose a husband 
                      to take care of her and the special child. His name was 
                      Murtagh, he loved and cared for Lilla and her mother, keeping 
                      them safe and provided for. <br>
                      <br>
                      When Lilla was born, her mother made her a small pouch. 
                      A Clan tradition, to be worn from a cord around her neck. 
                      The leather had been dyed a deep brownish red, with fine 
                      powdered red ochre mixed into the bear fat that had been 
                      used to cure the bearskin it was made from. Inside this 
                      pouch she placed a tiny relic, the holiest relic Almath 
                      possessed. She placed the pouch around Lilla’s neck, a Shaman 
                      child of the Six hammers. <br>
                      <br>
                      Lilla loved foraging for plants and herbs, and was a quick 
                      learner. Her mother took her out often, teaching her the 
                      magical healing ways of a Medicine woman. Lilla learned 
                      how to make her own medicine pouches, and how to dry and 
                      preserve the exotic plants and flowers that grew around 
                      Everfrost. <br>
                      <br>
                      It was during one of these outings, around her 10h summer, 
                      that Lilla always eager to find what lay just beyond the 
                      next hill became separated from the others. She was following 
                      a trail of pretty wildflowers, smiling as always, and lost 
                      in her own thoughts when she heard the roar. <br>
                      <br>
                      She dropped her basket, her heart almost stopped when she 
                      saw the great white beast looking her direction. Looking 
                      around quickly she tried to find a place to run, but knew 
                      running would be hopeless against such a quick animal. Spotting 
                      a small crevice in the rocks near her, she climbed inside, 
                      tucking herself in as best she could. <br>
                      <br>
                      The snow lion roared loudly, Lilla trembled at the sound 
                      and stared in hypnotized horror as the great cat snaked 
                      his paw, with sharp curved claws outstretched, into the 
                      small hole. Unable to get away, she watched the claw come 
                      at her and shrieked in pain as it sank into her left thigh, 
                      raking it with four deep parallel gashes. She had nowhere 
                      to go, and no weapon, her mind was spinning, she was fighting 
                      the panic that was starting to overcome her, when suddenly 
                      the cat backed away and left. She waited a couple of more 
                      hours, not sure that the cat was really gone. It was the 
                      warm welcoming sound of her family calling her name, searching 
                      for her that drew her out of hiding. <br>
                      <br>
                      Home with her family, sitting around the warmth of the clan 
                      fire, Lilla told what had happened with the Lion and its 
                      sudden disappearance. Almath, who had been applying a soothing 
                      salve to the claw wounds paused. She looked at her daughter 
                      and explained the meaning of the attack. “The Snow Lion 
                      marked you,” she explained. “He is your totem animal. You 
                      were marked as a baby with his symbol, the tattoo that you 
                      have on the back of your neck. Now he has come to mark you 
                      himself. Be proud of the scars, and remember their meaning.” 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      That was many summers ago, Lilla was now a grown woman, 
                      and had proven herself a great Medicine woman. She would 
                      one day be the Shaman for her Clan, but until then she still 
                      had a lot to learn, and a quest to follow. She gently touched 
                      the scar on her thigh as she remembered her mother’s words. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Putting on her tunic and belt, she carefully arranged her 
                      medicine pouches. Some small, some large, each with its 
                      own special purpose. In one pouch she carried fresh brownies. 
                      A special recipe her mother had taught her. <br>
                      <br>
                      It was the time of the gathering, when the clans all met 
                      to exchange greetings, and renew old ties. The gathering 
                      only happened once every seven years, and was a great cause 
                      for celebrating. Lilla was eagerly looking forward to this 
                      gathering. As a full Medicine woman now, she would be invited 
                      to join in the rituals and experience the new magics. <br>
                      <br>
                      The journey took a couple of days, but Lilla and her clan 
                      made it easily. They were greeted by family and friends 
                      from other clans, and quickly made themselves at home as 
                      they set up camp. Several days passed, there were fighting 
                      competitions, as well as magical rituals. The sights and 
                      sounds filled Lilla with excitement, she loved new discoveries, 
                      and there were many to be found here. And tonight was going 
                      to be very special; she would experience her first vision 
                      quest. <br>
                      <br>
                      The evening stars were bright, as Lilla and the other medicine 
                      women carried their small wooden bowls to the great Shaman, 
                      who filled each with a liquid mixture made from the rarest 
                      herbs in Everfrost. (Males had their own vision quest ceremonies 
                      separate from that of the women) <br>
                      <br>
                      Lilla took her place by the fire with the other women, and 
                      carefully held the bowl with its precious liquid to her 
                      lips, and drank deeply. She soon felt a strange sense of 
                      distance, as though part of her was detached and watching 
                      from some other place. She felt a tickling sensation inside 
                      her brain, inside her mind. She sensed emotions alien to 
                      her, emotions not her own. With a shock, she realized someone 
                      was inside her head. In her mind she felt his thoughts, 
                      with her emotions, his feelings. But who was he, and what 
                      was he doing in her head? Her head was spinning with questions, 
                      she could not see a face, but yet she could feel his presence. 
                      Then suddenly an image came to her, that of a Snow Lion. 
                      Her heart pounded, her head spinning she felt the old fear 
                      come back, but then almost as suddenly it vanished as the 
                      Lion seemed to speak to her. Not in words but in a way that 
                      was deeper. Were the strange emotions and thoughts she was 
                      experiencing that of the lion? She asked herself, but no, 
                      it was not the lion it was someone else, but the connection 
                      was there none the less. (she did not realize at this time 
                      that it was her half brother that she had connected with) 
                      Gracefully the Lion turned to walk away. In the distance 
                      she saw a large Scarab, and the lion spoke to her, “seek 
                      out the one who can fulfill your quest, and the path that 
                      lays before you. Seek out Scarab, and follow their ways.” 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The clan gathering was over; everyone was packed and heading 
                      back to his or her clan homes. Lilla could not shake the 
                      image of the Snow Lion she saw in her vision quest. She 
                      knew that it was important that she obey the lions message, 
                      but where to begin? Packing her small belongings, she kissed 
                      her family goodbye, and set out to follow the path, to find 
                      the Scarab the Lion told her about. <br>
                      <br>
                      After many days of travel, and many adventures, she finally 
                      found herself in a strange land, in the city of Freeport. 
                      She heard stories of a great guild called Scarab, and she 
                      knew deep inside, this was where she was meant to be, this 
                      is where her totem had lead her. Eagerly she sought out 
                      Lord and Lady, and found her new home in Scarab. <br>
                      <br>
                      Hail Scarab!! </font></p>
