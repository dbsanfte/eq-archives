Born                       to a poor family, his only thoughts of his mother and father                       are brief images, mental flashes, smells, and sounds. One morning, around                        the passing of his 7th year, he awoke to find himself in the home of                       a saddened uncle, who refused to answer any questions about his strange arrival.  His only contact to his family was a wooden                       crate, which contained a sword from his father, and his                       mothers sewing kit. His uncle would never let the young boy discuss his previous life, and always called him "boy".                       His uncle took care of him, and taught him to be hardworking, loyal and honest.                        <br>                      <br>                      One day, after his 16th birthday, he was chopping wood in                       the clearing outside his uncles small home when a man on                       horseback rode up and identified himself as a tax collecter.                       Hawkes uncle emerged from the small home and demanded to                       know what was going on. Without a word the tax collecter                       pushed his uncle to the ground, entered the home, and emerged                       with several items, including Hawkes crate that contained                       the only links to his past. His uncle tried to stand, but                       was kicked in the face and dropped. Hawke, his hot temper                       flaring, moved towards the man, "What tax is so important                       that you must injure an old man!" Hawke demanded. "Mind                       your own life, Boy!" the collector shouted, mounting his                       horse. "How dare he take my items" Hawke thought, his anger                       at the injustice raging in him, He sprinted off after the                       horse and rider, running as fast as he could. The chase                       lasted many miles.. and Hawke was soon joined in pursuit                       by a local sherrif, who was curious about the goings-on.                       <br>                      <br>                      After seeing young Hawke continue the chase, the sherrif                       spurred his horse along side the fleeing man, and stopped                       him. Out of breath, Hawke tried to explain his story, but                       immediatly the tax collector attempted to flee,                       but was quickly caught by the sherrif. "This man is no tax                       collector" The sherrif explained. "We have been looking                       for an imposter robbing homes claiming to be from the tax                       office for quite a while now!" The Lawman shackled him and                       gave the young Hawke his gear back. "You've got quite the                       spirit there boy, What's your name" said the lawman, in                       awe at the distance Hawke ran to retrieve his items. "I                       have no name, well, no name that I can remember." The Lawman                       smiled, "Well you certainly have the spirit of a hawk to                       chase this imposter down for your items." Said the man.                       "It wasnt the items, Hawke said, "It was the injustice                       of it." He paused, thinking about what the sherrif had just called him.  "Hawk? I like the sound of that." The lawman smiled,                       "Well young Hawk, with an attitude like that.. You should                       go talk to my friend Sir Repirn at the Paladins Guild." With the criminal in shackles the lawman rode away, leaving Hawke in the middle of the road, his words about the paladins guild rolling in his mind.                       Hawke did just that.. he arrived at the gates to the paladins guild the next morning, asking to speak with Sir Repirn. "Whats the name, boy" Said the gruff gate keeper. Without realizing the importance of the event, Hawke lifted his chin, looked the huge man in the eyes and boldly said. "Hawke, my name is Hawke, and I would take kindly if thou would not refer to me as 'boy'". The gatekeeper began to laugh, and let young Hawke pass. <br>                      <br>                      After spending several years talking and learning from the                       wise and noble Paldin Sir Repirn, Hawke was given a quest                       to spread the virtues of Loyalty, Honor and Valor. Bidding                       goodbye to his uncle, he took his fathers sword, his mothers                       sewing kit, and headed off to his destiny. <br>                      <br>                      Armed with a new name, and determination, Hawke traveled                       across the commonlands towards the west gates of Freeport.                       The guards at the gate payed no attention to the young man.                       Hawke made his way through the city, ending up at a grassy                       pathway with a sign labled "Hall of Truth".<br>                      <br>                      He found himself standing before a large keep, surrounded                       by a moat. He crossed into the keep, and made his way to                       the top. A large armored Paladin took him aside, and listened                       as young Hawke told his story. <br>                      <br>                      Hawke spent many years training and learning the ways of                       truth. The ideals that Sir Repirn had taught him served                       as building blocks for Hawke's growth into a Paladin. <br>                      <br>                      One day Hawke was quietly strolling towards the dock to                       buy some fish cakes. Unknown to him, he was headed for an                       encounter that would change his life. He walked into to                       the port authority to find the place full of races of all                       kinds, One Dwarf caught his attention. She was standing                       in line, waiting her turn to sell her basket full of fresh                       fish, and a rusted dagger. She was reading a book on the                       history of Freeport. She seemed so out of place surrounded                       by the Elfs and Humans, yet didn't seem to mind. He stood                       there for a moment, not realizing that he was staring at                       her. <br>                      <br>                      A slight movement caught his eye as a rogue moved slowly                       towards the reading Dwarf, his hands reaching for her coin                       pouch. Before Hawke could react, The Dwarf spun, planting                       her fist under his rib cage. "I wouldn't do that." She said                       with a fierce tone, "I work hard for those coins." The rogue                       ran from the shop, out of breath and stunned. <br>                      <br>                      The Dwarf looked up at Hawke, who stood with an slight grin                       staring at her. He introduced himself, and they quickly                       became friends. He found her to be strong willed, Loyal,                       honest, and just. She was a cleric, and therefore shared                       the same values as Hawke. Together they learned about the                       city they lived in, and they begin to explore the possibilitys                       of forming a Guild based on the virtues they share. he found                       himself wanting to spead and promote the virtues more and                       more each day that he and his dwarven friend talked, her                       dedication to them made him want to be more dedicated, and                       a friendly rivalry formed that exists to this day. <br>                      <br>                      Soon they married, and teamed up with some friends, Ozwyn, Venomm, and Ravenn, to form a guild of Honor, Valor, and                       loyalty that would serve Norrath to promote good and smite                       evil. Lord and Lady Hawke would be the guildmasters, and have continued to provide wisdom and leadership to Scarab since the day it was founded.  </font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
