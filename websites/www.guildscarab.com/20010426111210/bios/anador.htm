Anador awoke to the warm sunlight that was streaming through the window.  Just like
any other day, he dressed himself quickly and headed into the kitchen for breakfast.  But
today wasn't just another day.  Today was the day where he would petition to join the
ranks of rangers of Surefall Glade.
<br><br>
Anador’s mother smiled as he entered the kitchen looking for food.  But there was an
unusual twinkle in her eye that he noticed.  Something was up but he didn't want to spoil
her surprise in anyway by asking.  Anador ate quickly to hasten his trip to Surefall Glade
from Qeynos.  Finishing his meal as fast as he could, he kissed his mother on the cheek
and headed towards the door.  "Wish my luck, mother!" said Anador with enthusiasm. 
She smiled and winked as if she knew something he didn't... but he paid no attention to it
and headed off to Surefall.
<br><br>
As he left the safety of the gates and guards, Anador placed his hand on the hilt of his
long sword.  He found it in the attic among the odds and ends his mother was saving.  It
was quite old but of fine make.  Probably an elven smith considering the fact that it was
so light and well balanced, yet was sharp as a razor blade.  He always wondered how and
where his mother got this sword but he was glad nonetheless.
<br><br>
Even though the paved road to Surefall is occasionally patrolled by the Qeynos guards, it
still wasn't all that safe.  There are gnolls who try to ambush anyone who dare walk upon
"their" lands.  Though they were a threat, they've been pushed back to Blackburrow by
the citizens of Qeynos.  But they do tend to get a bit bloodthirsty and come out from their
lair to cause havoc in Qeynos Hills.
<br><br>
The trip to Surefall Glades was uneventful.  The guards patrolling seems to have scared
most off the gnolls away back into Blackburrow during the day.  Anador paused for a
moment to gather himself up so that he would look worthy to speak to Hager Sureshot. 
"Hold there stranger," stated one of the guards who stood in front of the path into
Surefall.  "What is your business here," queried the guard.  Anador replied trying to
sound as official as possible, "I am here to speak with Hager Sureshot.  I am here to join
the ranks of trackers and rangers of Surefall."  The guards looked at each other for a
second then made enough room for Anador to pass between them.  "Whew... made it this
far," Anador thought to himself.
<br><br>
As he entered Surefall Glades, Anador felt at ease and calm.  There was something about
this land that soothed his soul.  Walking along the path, he could see Hager immediately. 
Though Anador has never seen Hager before, he could tell that this was the man who
trained other rangers.  Walking up as confidently as he could, he cleared his throat to get
Hager’s attention.
<br><br>
"State your business here young one," said Hager without even turning around to face
Anador.  A bit taken back by Hager’s comment and statement, Anador spoke up.  "I've
come to join the ranks of rangers who were trained by you."  At that statement, Hager did
turn to face Anador and looked him over.  "What is your name son?" asked Hager.
"Anador, sir. Anador Nightwind," replied Anador as he tried to snap to attention to
impress Hager.  "Uhmmmm. I don't remember any Anador’s in the recent invitations. 
Where is your note?  You do understand that I try under invitation only, right?" said
Hager in a questioning tone.
<br><br>
"I do know that it's by invitation only but I can prove myself that I'm ready to join your
ranks!  I can shoot a bow as well as any trained marksman!"  With that statement, Anador
pulled an arrow from his quiver to his bow to fire at the target that Hager was practicing
on.  He stuck a bullseye with one shot.  "I can take care of myself in the wild as the
captain of the guards in Qeynos will tell you!  I've brought in more than my share of gnoll
scalps!" stated Anador proudly.
<br><br>
Hager looked at the shot made by Anador and looked as if he was sizing him up.  "I'm
sorry son," said Hager "but the rules are the rules.  It is by invitation only or if another
ranger will vouch that you have the ability to become one of us.  There are no exceptions
to these rules.  Even you, Anador."  And at with those words, Anador’s shoulders
slumped in knowledge that he would not be welcome till the invitation came or someone
would vouch for him.  Anador silently picked up his bow and turned towards the exit
when a voice came out from the shadows...
<br><br>
"I will vouch for him."
<br><br>
Anador turned towards where the voice came from.  Out of the shadows came a wood
elf.  Wearing green armor signifying that he was wearing Ivy Etched Armor... armor that
is only given to rangers who are accomplished enough to quest for the components
demanded by the rangers in Kithicor.  Walking with as much confidence as even Hager
when he moves, this elf starts walking towards Hager.  They clasps their hands as if
they're old friends and starts speaking to each other.
<br><br>
"KYLIAR!  You haven't been around these parts in a long long time!  What brings you
back here?" roared Hager with a huge smile on his face.  The elf replied, "It has been
awhile Hager.  And what brings me here is Anador.  I'm here to vouch for him."  With a
questioning look, Hager looked at the elf and asked, "Why? What is your relation to
him..."  His voice trailing off, Hager did a double take and nodded in understanding.  "I
will begin his training Hager.  Please add his name to the scrolls and I'll make sure he is
well trained and prepared to be one of us," stated Kyliar as he shook Hager’s hand again
and turned towards Anador.  "Come with me young one. Your training begins."  And the
elf began walking towards the path to outside of Surefall Glades.  Stunned and his mouth
agape, Anador turned to bow to Hager and ran after this elf.
<br><br>
Anador started rattling questions to Kyliar as they walked down the path towards Qeynos. 
"Who are you?  Why did you help me back there?  Not that I'm complaining or anything! 
Do I know you or something?"  Yet Kyliar doesn't reply and continues to walk towards
Qeynos.  Just as the gates into Qeynos becomes visible, Anador runs in front of Kyliar to
stop him.  "Who are you?" asks Anador again.  Kyliar, finally stopped looks into
Anador’s eyes and a smile begins to form on his face.  "My name... my name is Kyliar. 
Kyliar Nightwind," states the elf.  Anador looks puzzled for a moment then replies,
"Nightwind? But my mother told me that that was the surname that my father..."  Kyliar
looks up at Anador with a bigger smile.  "Father?"
<br><br>
At the local tavern, Kyliar steers toward a table in the corner that's away from the crowd. 
Anador follows, still in shock, trying to avoid bumping into people, chairs and tables. 
Kyliar was silent the rest of the way into Qeynos and he finally speaks after they sit
down.  "I'm sure you have many questions and I'll try to answer them now.  You see, I
met your mother a long time ago.  When I was just beginning to learn the ropes of
becoming a ranger.  But I learned everything I could from Masyn Trueshot, the
guildmaster of rangers in Kelethin, so I traveled East to Surefall Glades to continue on
with my training here.  To learn other tactics and skills that is quite different from what I
learned in Kelethin."  Kyliar pauses to motion for a barmaid to bring some drinks for the
two.
<br><br>
"Now," continues Kyliar after the drinks arrive, "I met your mother while training in
Surefall.  I truly did care for her and I spent a good year with her while training.  But I did
tell her that I would have to leave after the training is complete.  She understood.  And
kept a secret from me.  That secret being you. I guess she knew that I would not have left
if I knew.  But she wrote me this letter a month ago.  Stating that she gave birth to my
child and that he was following in my footsteps.  I was stunned, I did not know what to
say or do.  So I made my way here as soon as I could.  Your mother told me that you
already started your way towards Surefall Glades when I arrived this morning.  So I
followed... and here I am.  And I'm here to say for awhile.  To begin your training... and
to settle down for a bit."
<br><br>
Quiet but nodding in understanding, Anador looked towards his father.  "You know... I
sort of understand.  I do not want to really leave mother but... there is this call for me to
travel and see the world," says Anador.  Kyliar just smiles and grins.  "Well, let's head
home... son.  Your training will begin tomorrow."
<br><br>
While on his way home, Anador thinks to himself... "I will train hard and learn. I will be
as good of a ranger as my father.  No... Better!"  With that, a grin forms on Anador. 
"Today was truly a wonderful day," Anador whispers to himself. </font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
