        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">He sat upon a rock and
        thought of everything that was going on within him as of
        late. Suddenly the growls and snarls of the wolves, which
        lived on his land, brought him to stand and spin in their
        direction. IN a sprint he was over the next rise and
        stopped short at the scene he beheld. Ogres! Here???? His
        mind raced as he pulled his swords and joined the battle.
        These Ogres had beset upon a small pack of wolves and
        were toying with them. Two already lay dead as a mother
        and father wolf sought to protect the cubs between them.
        With a roar the Lord of Blazerose Keep charged the Ogres.
        They spun to meet him and the first fell with his body
        one way and his head the next. The larger two set upon
        Briggs with ferocity and rage as they kept him from the
        Ogre with the bow. The twang of the shot filled the
        plain, as did the death howl of the female wolf. His
        concentration broken, he felt the sword bite deep into
        his side. In shock he lashed out, his sword blade driving
        deep into the stomach of the nearest Ogre. The next
        moment he saw the club crash down on the skull of the old
        alpha wolf and his eyes saw the last living cub as it
        shivered near it&#146;s mother.</font><p
        class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">Enraged to the point of not caring
        he threw himself upon the larger of the Ogres and bashed
        it&#146;s head in with the hilt of his swords. Standing
        on weak legs he threw the SharkJaw Cutlass and smiled
        bloodily as it bit into the back of the remaining Ogre.
        The ogre fell like a splintered tree and then Briggs
        dropped to his knees, his blood staining the snow as he
        crawled to the cub. Reaching out he pulled the cub
        against his chest and looked upon the alpha wolf. Glazed
        over eyes stared at him as he made a promise to raise
        this one as his own, to do the old alpha wolf proud.
        Reaching out he closed the old wolfs eyes and stood on
        weak legs. One hand held the cub against him and the
        other picked his weapons up and put them away. As he
        walked he kept his hand over the wound and prayed to
        Tunare and Rallos Zek that he could make it back to the
        Keep. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">The guards saw the man staggering
        down the road to the Keep and called for the Lady to come
        see. As she stepped out of the door her husband dropped
        to one knee and then fell against the door. His face was
        ashen as she knelt over him. She motioned for them to
        take him to their room so she could heal him, when she
        saw the little ball of fur curled up against her
        husband&#146;s cloak. Reaching down she pulled the wolf
        cub out of the cloak and held it up. It squirmed and
        growled at her and then soon settled down as she stared
        at it with a smile on her face. &#147;So he has brought
        home another rascal has he? Well YOU will not be tearing
        into things YOU will be well behaved.&#148; The wolf
        licked her face as she held it against her. She heard her
        husbands voice as they carried him, &#147;Send out
        patrols&#133;.Ogres..killed wolf pack&#133;.made promise
        to keep cub..&#148; Angus turned and shook his head,
        &#147;Ogres he says? M&#146;lady do you think our lord is
        with fever?&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">She shook her head, &#147;Do as he
        said I have never known him to midjudge something and if
        you find the dead wolves, bury them correctly.&#148;
        Angus nodded, &#147;And the bodies of the Ogres
        m&#146;lady?&#148; She looked at her husbands wounds and
        snarled, &#147;Leave them for the scavengers&#148; </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">Slowly she cleaned her
        husbands&#146; wounds and covered them in ointment as she
        cast her healing spells on him and smiled as he healed.
        She sat on the edge of the bed near him as the wolf cub
        curled up against her. She scratched the cubs&#146; ears
        as her husband moved in his sleep as the save sealed his
        wounds and prevented infection. Slowly she curled up next
        to him as the wolf cub made itself comfortable between
        them. &#147;You will have to learn to sleep in that
        basket soon little one, nothing sleeps between my man and
        I.&#148;</font></p>
