					<FONT CLASS="text1">
					In an amazing scurry of little feet, the Nekkid Gnome Race took place this afternoon. Six overworked and underclothed newbie gnomes all raced from Ak'anon to Erudin.  What an amazing feat for such amazing feet. :)<BR>
					<BR>
					A big congrats goes to Linq for coming in 1st place, taking only 2 hours 40 minutes to arrive in Erudin! Calcanctus and Luxy were a close 2nd and 3rd, reaching the finish line after about three hours of racing.<BR>
					A screenshot of the big conclusion is posted on the left side bar.<BR>
					<BR>
					Way to go racers, and a big thanks to everyone who helped make this race a success!

					<BR>
					So far the Dwarf and Iksar's are running a close race on the newbie poll! If you wish to attend go out and cast your votes! <BR>
					<BR>
					Please leave a message for me if you're still interested or able to attend. This is open to all Scarabites! I'd like to see as many there as would usually attend any other raid! Because aside from all our high level troubles, this is ment to be pure fun! A newbie group or two taking over newbie field, KSing each other and dueling over a couple coppers, having a couple ales (dwarves winning the class provided), running to guards from bats and skellies or just the newbie corpse retrieval!

<B>RULES:</B> Level 1 - 3 Gnome, any class. Only the weapon and/or spells issued to a newbie of said class. Guild tunic is encouraged, yer gonna need every bit of HP/AC it gives.  5pp will be issued at start line for food,drink,bandages and booze. Booze will be handed out as well and may be freely accepted throughout the race. You may bind anywhere you want, if you can manage to beg someone to do it. Revives/resurrections are not allowed.

<B>RULES FOR NAMES:</B> Please no phrases! I loved the names but Verant was not so ammused. "IG" is no longer required( I will Tag all racers and a simple who scarab 1 3 all should do the trick) If you do use IG, please use it in front of your main's name. Please follow all naming policy.
<B>PVP:</B> Although this seemed like a good idea...it's just not the humane way to go. I wouldn't be able to sleep if one of my guildmates was killed by a lesser kobald in Toxx forest and sent back to Ak'Anon just because no one could bind them.<BR>

					The Nekked Gnome Race is nigh at hand!<BR>
					This incredible event will be held on <B>Sunday, July 15</B>, at 4:00 pm EST.  Racers must be at the starting line no later than <B>3:45 pm</B>. <BR>
					This race is open to all Scarab members and recruits. All contestants must use a racer gnome character level 3 or under, and they may only use the newbie gear that comes with new characters.  The race director will issue 5pp for food, water, and bandages.<BR>
					The Start Line is at entrance to Ak'anon and the Finish line is the library in Euradin. There are no teleports or buffs allowed. Just in case of helpful strangers, debuffings are issued at the 3 checkpoints: Temple of Marr in Freeport, Wizzie spires in North Karana and the cleric guild in Qeynos. Binds are allowed if you can talk someone into it. No high level escorts and no revives are allowed either. Gnomes should have a name with "IG" in front so race coordinators can easily check progress with a "/who ig all."<BR>
					Obviously there will be a pize for the first 3 to cross the finish line, but everyone should enjoy the thrill of being a newbie gnome running across Norrath.<BR>
					First place will be the coveted Traveler's boots for your main. (or cash equivelent for those with Jboots, SoW or Bards)<BR>
					We hope to see you there!
