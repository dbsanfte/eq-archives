        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood before the
        massive doors and waited to enter. Slowly the doors
        opened and before him stood a Giant. His hands
        instinctively went to his axe handle and then released as
        the giant laughed. &#147; My lord will see you now
        Barbarian. But know this, anger him and you will end up
        as the Imp who sought to do you harm earlier.&#148;
        Slowly he stepped inside the doors and the giant shut
        them and slid the giant bar closed behind them. The Lord
        of Blazerose Keep knew not why he had been summoned, he
        only knew that it had something to do with his past for
        the Dragon Crystal he wore under his breastplate had been
        aglow ever since he&#146;d received the summons. Slowly
        he stepped past the one named Skarn and then stood as the
        one named Tranix moved into another room and began
        speaking. He made out &#147;He has come m&#146;lord as
        you summoned&#148; and &#147;As you wish m&#146;lord,
        immediately&#148; Tranix turned and waved him inside with
        a grunt and stepped aside. Slowly he stepped inside the
        room and his breath caught in his throat as the sight
        before him.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"
        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;The ancient red dragon was
        curled upon a mountain of treasure; smoke flowling from
        his nostrils and from around his teeth. The voice, which
        filled his ears instantly brought fear to his heart,
        t&#146;was the fabled Dragon Fear and many a knight had
        met his doom by being unable to respond after the fear
        fell upon him. &#147;You have come as I have summoned.
        But, know this, few mortals ever are allowed this far
        into my lair unless they are food or fools. You are here
        at the request of your father. At his request when you
        reached the age, which you are now, I was to tell you of
        your true parents and the reason they left you with the
        old shaman and why he left you with the Jymblaydes. Make
        yourself comfortable childe this will not be over
        soon.&#148; Briggs looked around and suddenly a massive
        throne was before him. With a motion of one massive claw
        Lord Nagafen motioned for his guest to sit and then moved
        around on his treasure pile. Slowly he stretched with his
        wings unfurling and flapping, causing a breeze to fill
        the room. A breeze, which made Briggs shiver and absently
        pull his cloak around him, this brought a deep, rumbling
        chuckle from the dragon as he watched. &#147;Your story
        begins with two lovers who were forbidden to be together
        by all around them. Your mother was a Barbarian Shamaness
        who was well known and respected by all in Norrath. All
        knew her healing powers and she taught many in the
        shamanistic ways. Your father, on the other hand, was a
        dark and evil being. He was one of Veeshans&#146;
        favorite WarLords. Many fell before his claws and teeth
        during the times of war. His anger was legendary among
        our kind; his vengeance was swift and final. But, he met
        your mother on one of his spying missions and he followed
        her to study this being who brought stirrings from his
        heart, which was strange to him. He assumed the form of a
        barbarian warrior many times to spend time with her and
        slowly he came to know love with her. He strayed from the
        path of evil to be with her. Soon after this your mother
        conceived you and he was pleased to have an heir. For
        some reason Veeshan allowed you to be born and to survive
        as you have.&#148; The Dragon paused and clicked his jaw
        with a massive talon as he became lost in thought. His
        eyes seemed to glow as he looked upon Briggs again.
        Slowly the words filled the room one more.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &#147;You were born under the dragon moon, that is why
        you wear that crystal. Inside it is a small bit of the
        soul of both your mother and father. They both watch over
        you from afar. Now as to the reason you were taken to the
        old Shaman. Your father knew that Veeshan&#146;s
        vengeance would be swift and unforgiving. He went to your
        mother and they spoke of this while you slept. Fearing
        for your own life they took you to the shaman, who hid
        you well under spells and such means. As they left you
        they both partook of the crystal so they would be with
        you always. The shaman swore to them both that he would
        keep you safe and would assure you would grow as they
        wished. This was the last time he saw them and I would
        tell you only that they both died bravely and swiftly.
        Now as to the Jymblaydes and how you came to be with
        them. The old shaman aged faster than he should have and
        needed someone to watch over you. He watched many and one
        evening they came to him seeking potions and he spoke to
        them about adopting his son and watching over him because
        his time was nearing an end. The Jymblaydes, after much
        thought, agreed to this and took you in. Lord Jymblayde
        taught you the ways of the warrior and the meaning of
        dedication while Lady Jymblayde taught you compassion and
        loyalty. They both combined to teach you love and honor
        and what it means to have a family. The old one could not
        have found a better couple for you. As I look at you I
        see the ways of both your mother and father in you. I see
        your father in you moves and how you carry yourself, and
        your mother in your eyes and how you take in all around
        you. You will be a great man one day, mayhaps even a
        great leader. Now I am done speaking there are those who
        would seek me dead and they come soon. I must make
        preparations and you should not be here for that. Now go,
        leave this place and tell only those you trust with your
        heart what I have told you.&#148; </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Briggs rose from the chair and made his way to the door,
        pausing to turn back one last time. His voice was deep
        and full as he spoke; &#147; I thank you for this Lord
        Nagafen and let it be known that when my time comes to
        face you I pray that either of our deaths is swift and
        honorable.&#148; The dragon just stared at him in silence
        and then slowly raised a clawed paw in salute as Briggs
        turned away and moved into the secret exit </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And made his way back out into the acrid air of the
        LavaStorm Mountains where his wife waited on horseback.
        He swung up onto his mount and leaned over to kiss her
        gently. &#147;M&#146;love I have much to tell you once we
        get back to our home, about my past about mother and
        father and about us.&#148; He stared into her confused
        eyes and smiled at her. &#147;No worries love nothing
        will ever change between us. I love you now as I will
        forever.&#148;</font></p>
