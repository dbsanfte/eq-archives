                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a sunny fall morning just outside of Trinsic. The land of Brittania was quiet as always in that area. No monsters spwaned near there; however recently a panther had been killing all the chickens on the locals farms. Galvin and Kyna Lynn's farm had just lost all their chickens that night.<br><br>
	Galvin took his daughter by the arm and hobbled down the lane towards the town. "Emry." He said in a strong voice. "You must go and find this panther and kill it. We can not afford to this loss. That panther hide will give us enough to buy some chickens to replace those we just lost. Go now, and take my bow with you."<br><br>
	"Father, you are far better at tracking than I am."<br><br>
	"Yes, but your skills will serve you well enough. Just go quickly, and return safely."<br><br>
	Emry Lynn hugged her father and waved back towards the house where she knew her mother was watching. "Alright. I will go."<br><br>
	It was nearing midday, and Emry was still on the panther's track though it was at least an hour old. "This is taking to long. That wicked cat will be long gone from here. I better head back."<br><br>
	Just then she saw a movement from the corner of her eye. She spun to her right and came face to face with a grizzly bear.<br><br>
	"Oh no!" she gasped as she turned and ran, loading her father's bow as he had taught her many years ago. Emry could feel the bear beathing down her neck as she dogded around a large tree. She turned and fired, hitting the grizzly in the leg. Quickly she reloaded and fired again. This time her aim was true and the bear fell back with a mighty thump.<br><br>
	Emry breathed a sigh of relief as she pulled out her knife to skin the beast.<br><br>
	A few hours later, Emry Lynn started back towards home. "I may not have found that panther, but Father should be happy. This skin will sell for more than a panther's and now we have food for weeks!"<br><br>
	As she got closer to her home she sensed that something was wrong. "I should hear father chopping wood by now." Emry quickened her pace. The woods were in dead silence. Emry dropped her load and ran to her house. She threw open the front door and froze in horror. The kitchen was in utter chaos and there in the center was the body of her mother slit in two. When Emry recovered, she searched for her father. She found him lying at the base of a tree with his axe still implanted in his skull. Emry dragged his body back to the house and placed it next to her mother. She look around and found everything gone. The killers had even stollen Kyna's sewing kit.<br><br>
	With a sad heart, Emry Lynn took a torch and set her childhood home a-blaze. She wrapped the bear skin around herself and headed north.<br><br>
	As she travelled north, Emry Lynn heard stories of a guild which fought for Honor and Justice, Scarab. She learned that this guild was lead by two very kind and noble people, Lord and Lady Hawke, but it was the name of one of their followers which gave Emry hope, Ozwyn. Emry remembered her father telling her stories of a travelling cleric, Ozwyn, who had helped her family fight off bandits when Galvin and Kyna had first moved into Brittania.<br><br>
	Emry meet Ozwyn of Scarab and joined the guild. Soon after, she travelled with Scarab to the land of Norrath where Emry built a house in the trees of Greater Faydark. She  now studies the arts of the rogue and uses her skills and familiarity with the woods to help those lost in the forests surrounding Greater Faydark.<br><br>
