        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I played my songs in newbie
        grounds<br>
        Not realizing that my harmful sounds<br>
        Would make you want to strike me down<br>
        Ack! I'm KOS!<br>
        <br>
        The froggies used to like me a lot<br>
        Then one day me and the Shin Lord faught<br>
        I can't believe what that tangle has wraught<br>
        Ack! I'm KOS!<br>
        <br>
        Being nice is the path I take<br>
        But disliking me you can not fake<br>
        When you whack on me for going near your lake<br>
        Ack! I'm KOS!!<br>
        <br>
        When I must travel I use your ring<br>
        But bears they have this deathwish thing<br>
        They attack me and cause your spells to fling<br>
        Ack! I'm KOS!<br>
        <br>
        The bouncer scowls and beats his chest<br>
        Proclaiming to all that he's the best<br>
        Who hasn't heard the bouncer say &quot;I's vic..I
        won?&quot;<br>
        Ack! I'm KOS!<br>
        <br>
        There was a time when you didn't scowl<br>
        But then we went and took Sir Lucan out<br>
        Why didn't you just throw in the towel?<br>
        Ack! I'm KOS!</font></p>
