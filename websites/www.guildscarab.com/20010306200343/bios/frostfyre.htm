His parent had told him of other                       places, other people, but he had met none, save the wandering                       few nomadic travelers that appear so rarely in the inaccessible                       land that is Everfrost. In his heart, he knows the truth                       of his parent’s words when they tell him he is too young                       at 15 summers to be longing for adventure. He had taken                       vows to follow in his father’s footsteps as the Clan Shaman,                       but had yet to receive the &quot;Calling&quot;, as all Shamans                       must.</font></p>                    <font size=2>                     <p>&#9;His father is the current Shaman to Clan Souwnkatu,                       and is revered throughout the land as a wise and honorable                       man. <font size=2 color="#008080">Frostbringer</font><font size=2>,                       </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre’s</font><font size=2>                       father, being a Clan Elder and advisor to the Clan Chief                       has gained quite a reputation around Halas and the surrounding                       areas. Frostbringer became famous by almost defeating a                       brigade of Gnolls as they attempted a raid on Frostfyre’s                       clan. With the Clan Chief critically wounded, Frostbringer                       led a charge that defeated the Gnoll raiders, and then led                       a frenzied Barbarian horde into the Gnoll home cave where                       they were virtually wiped out by the blood-mad Barbarians.                       </font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;</font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre’s</font><font size=2>                       mother, </font><font size=2 color="#00ffff">Crystalgaze</font><font size=2>,                       is also a powerful Shaman in her own right. Where Frostbringer’s                       art is one of mostly offensive spells, Crystalgaze’s talents                       are solely in the vein of healing. As her family was destroyed                       violently by Ice Goblins when she was young, she has dedicated                       her life to the healing arts. It was Crystalgaze that brought                       the Clan Chief back from near death during the Gnoll raid.                       It was after that raid that the two powerful Shamans met.                       The result of that union produced their only son, Frostfyre.</font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;As a child, while other younglings were                       playing, </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       was taught the fine art of war by his father, the art of                       healing by his mother. When others were swimming in the                       lake that separates Halas from Everfrost. Frostfyre was on                       hunting trips with his father or on long journeys with his                       mother to garner special herbs for defensive spells. He                       also learned the art of stealth and stealing from an acquaintance,                       unknown to his parents.

All of the spells                       had been memorized, but he could not call them into fruition,                       as he had not received &quot;The Calling.&quot; This &quot;Calling&quot;                       is a period every Shaman goes through when the spellcasting                       ability comes forth. His family became quite concerned,                       as most Shamans get &quot;The Call&quot; around their thirteenth                       or fourteenth summer. Frostfyre began to wonder if he really                       was intended by the gods of the Six hammers to be a Shaman,                       after all.</font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;It was in this, his fifteenth summer,                       that </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       met another barbarian youngling, a female.

Her outgoing personality                       was in sharp contrast to Snowshaow’s own gruff but likable                       ways. Where Frostfyre was wary and distrustful, she was open                       and inviting. </font><font size=2 color="#0000ff">Chillseeker</font><font size=2>                       was yin to Frostfyre’s yang, and from the day he met her,                       he found she never left his thoughts. She was visiting from                       her Clan on a supply expedition to Halas, her mother an                       old friend of </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre’s</font><font size=2>                       mother. The two younglings spent much time together while                       their mother remembered old times, and when in came time                       for them to leave, </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       was heartbroken, as was </font><font size=2 color="#0000ff">Chillseeker</font><font size=2>.                       They had fallen in love, a tragic and unexpected turn of                       events, as </font><font size=2 color="#0000ff">Chillseeker’s</font><font size=2>                       marriage to another had already been arranged according                       to her Clan’s traditions. </font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;</font><font size=2 color="#0000ff">Chillseeker</font><font size=2>                       and her party were scheduled to leave in 12 hours. The Barbarian                       younglings crept away into the snow to be together for a                       short time, most likely the last time. </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       built a makeshift ice shelter and a small fire inside, mostly                       for light, as both had grown used to the cold many years                       ago. When they again appeared at the home of </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre’s</font><font size=2>                       parents, there was a gleam in the eyes of the two star-crossed                       lovers that the adults could not quite comprehend.</font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;As </font><font size=2 color="#0000ff">Chillseeker’s</font><font size=2>                       expedition started off, </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre’s</font><font size=2>                       mood grew darker.

As he watched them                       leave, a strange feeling came over him. A burning from deep                       inside, a fire welling up from the deepest part of his soul.                       He could not watch her leave, he must do SOMETHING. As his                       frustration grew, so did the feeling, as if to tear him                       apart.</font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;&quot;</font><font size=2 color="#0000ff">Chillseeker!!!</font><font size=2>&quot;                       roared </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       at the top of his lungs, the pain burning through his skin,                       threatening to explode and destroy </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       in it’s ferocity. &quot;</font><b><font size=2 color="#0000ff">ARRRGGHHH!</font></b><font size=2>                       </font><b><font size=2 color="#ff0000">Esto Natuck Raknsi!!</font></b><font size=2>&quot;                       The words came from his lips without thought, his hands                       gesturing as if in spasm.

He entered the Cave.</font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;Two </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnoll</font><font size=2>                       guards at the entrance. </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       surprised them, and disposed of them with a minimum of noise                       and damage to him. Upon entering, he found the total darkness                       disconcerting. Having not planned for this, he kept his                       back to the wall and crept forward. He traveled what seemed                       an eternity until a light caught his attention. This seemed                       to be the start of the </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnoll</font><font size=2>                       &quot;civilization.&quot; He readied </font><font size=2 color="#800000">Skullcrusher</font><font size=2>                       and continued on. He heard a raging battle, and hurried                       along the semi-dark tunnel to where the sounds originated.                       What he saw amazed and delighted him.</font></p>                    <p> <font size=2>&#9;There was a band of warriors already                       in the </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnoll</font><font size=2>                       base camp, fighting the vermin and doing very well. Then,                       an avalanche of </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnolls</font><font size=2>                       appeared from all sides. A trap! The crafty </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnolls</font><font size=2>                       had lured the brave warrior party to their deaths. </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       could not stand by and watch a massacre. Before the </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnolls                       </font><font size=2>could attack, </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       spied their leader and poured all his magical energy into                       one massive spell. &quot;</font><font size=2 color="#800080">Arturk                       Bandmot Frakju</font><font size=2>!&quot; cried </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>,                       then ran headfirst into a pack of the deadly monsters, swinging                       his mighty warhammer, crushing skulls and breaking bodies.                       He hoped he was able to buy at least some time for the brave                       warriors to escape. Having lost their leader did cause the                       </font><font size=2 color="#808000">Gnolls</font><font size=2>                       to lose concentration, but the pack into which he had so                       blindly run was closing in on </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>,                       though his kill count was rising by the second.

Others jumped on and began to pummel                       him, scratching his face and body with their razor-sharp                       claws. </font><font size=2 color="#808080">Frostfyre</font><font size=2>                       began to pray to </font><font size=2 color="#000080">The                       Six Hammers</font><font size=2> that he might be allowed                       to sit at the</font><font size=2 color="#000080"> Table                       of the Brave </font><font size=2>in the hereafter, when                       an incredible thing happened.
