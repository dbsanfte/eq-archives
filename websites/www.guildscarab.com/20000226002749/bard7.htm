                        was just a small distance away now. The

                        had been a long trip, but Hawke knew that
                        soon it would be over. Without warning he
                        felt himself hit by a vile magic, and
                        some life energy slipped away. Hawke spun
                        around to see a group of Tier'Dal ,
                        joined by a hideous Skeleton, rapidly
                        approaching. &quot;Marr!&quot; Hawke
                        shouted, slipping the collection of bags
                        and packs off his shoulders and reaching
                        for his blade. Another blast of magic
                        slammed into him, and He felt a vile
                        disease fester within him. His attempts
                        to draw his blade almost succeeded, but
                        the necromancers pet had other
                        intentions, knocking the sword free from
                        Hawke's hands. Several more dark spells
                        slammed into him now, as others from the
                        group began to cast on him. The Skeleton
                        lunged forward and pinned Hawke's arms to
                        his side, and weakened by the disease,
                        Hawke fell to the ground. </font></p>

                        sinister laugh was heard as one of the
                        dark ones walked up to him. He was
                        shorter than most Tier&#146;Dal, and his
                        hair was pure white. Blood ran into
                        Hawke's eye, and he could not see much
                        more. </font></p>

                        efforts rewarded with the hideous

                        power of Marr, calling for the pet to be
