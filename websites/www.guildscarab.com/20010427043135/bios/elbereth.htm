Naturally I was to become a great Paladin                       as my father was. The castle life was all I ever knew until                       the age of 16 and thats when i joined in the holy crusades.                       My life long friends Dias and Ragnar had joined a guild                       called Knights of the Round Table. There we all fought bravely,                       but the evil there was overwhelming. It wasnt until we met                       up with three of the most brave and honorable people we                       had ever met...Boudica was the most talented archer i have                       ever seen and also the most beautiful...Cyan Bloodbane and                       his Brother, Cyric the Virus, also great warriors, accompanied                       her on there quest to destroy the evil's of our land. With                       a group like this we drove out the evil and killed diablo                       himself. <br>                      <br>                      Then a voice from what seemed to be coming from inside of                       me said "Your Job is not done here, I send thee to Brittiania                       where a greater evil awaits...you will find a group of adventurers                       waiting for you by the river bank...treat them as if they                       were family...now go my son...and remember what i have tought                       you". That moment I knew it was my father. Then a gate poped                       up and I walked inside. When I made it to the other side                       I saw a group of people in the distance and I begain to                       walk to them. I introduced myself to them and told them                       my story. <br>                      <br>                      We are Lord and Lady Hawke, Co Guildmasters of Scarab, said                       the Gentleman and Lady...this is Ozwyn, Ravenn, and Venom,                       we are all the founding members of Scarab. I then knew this                       was the group my father was talking about so I humbly asked                       if i could join their ranks and they graciously accepted                       me. It wasnt for a few days after then I met up with my                       friends from back home, and so I asked Lord Hawke if it                       was alright for my friends to join us in our quest for peace                       and he discussed it with the Inner Circle and they were                       accepted...then Cyric and Cyan informed me of there name                       change to Skie and Stout. <br>                      <br>                      Now we were looking like a real guild and our name spread                       throughout the land. <br>                      <br>                      As my father said, there is a greater evil at work...it                       did not take us long to find that evil. It seemed i had                       lost all my power from the gate trip and all I had were                       the clothes on my back...I quickly started to practice the                       art of archery since I still had my speed and no armor...it                       didnt take long for me to get good at it since there were                       plenty of monsters to fight. Over time the guild got big                       and I was recruited into the Inner Circle of Scarab, an                       honor I hold as high as any other. I started to think about                       my other family and why exactly i was brought here, but                       I didn't question my fathers purposes. I then realized why                       I was here...our honor and valor is what keeps this land                       from becoming a total chaotic world, it was then I heard                       my fathers voice again, he said &quot;Now you know why I                       sent you - know that you can't completely stop evil, but                       as long as you contain it everything will work out.&quot;<br>                      <br>                      Some time had past since i heard from my father...our guild                       had some conflicts and we went our own directions...Dias,                       Ragnar, and I tried to uphold the honor we once had but                       the evil had taken over us. I was lost and in trouble...the                       days got so dark that one couldn't tell it from the night..                       I was on the verge of destroying everything in my path until                       I heard the voices of Lord and Lady Hawke say "What has                       become of you? Dont you remember what you stand for?&quot;                       It was then when i realized what had happened... I knew                       then i had to do something before I lost control of myself..so                       I had Lord Hawke put me in a deep sleep until he called                       upon me to join him in another world...and so there i slept.                       <br>                      <br>                      Now i finally awaken, and the darkness that once controlled                       me is lifted by the spirit of Scarab. The lands I once walked                       are merely a dream to me now... with the past aching in                       my heart i promise to uphold the honor and valor i once                       had... and with my family by my side I swear by the honor                       of Scarab I will not stray from the path of righteousness...                       and defend all that is good in this new world....Norrath.                       </font> </p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
