                        the contents within them, tied together

                        Freeport. The guild would benefit from
                        the items he had, as Lord Cloud and the

                        passed the First Inn of the Eastlands,
                        and moved into the desert. West Freeport
                        was just a small distance away now. The
                        thought of having to cross the path of a
                        vile militiaman was of little concern

                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">It
                        had been a long trip, but Hawke knew that
                        soon it would be over. Without warning he
                        felt himself hit by a vile magic, and
                        some life energy slipped away. Hawke spun
                        around to see a group of Tier'Dal ,
                        joined by a hideous Skeleton, rapidly
                        approaching. &quot;Marr!&quot; Hawke
                        shouted, slipping the collection of bags
                        and packs off his shoulders and reaching
                        for his blade. Another blast of magic
                        slammed into him, and He felt a vile
                        disease fester within him. His attempts
                        to draw his blade almost succeeded, but
                        the necromancers pet had other
                        intentions, knocking the sword free from
                        Hawke's hands. Several more dark spells
                        slammed into him now, as others from the
                        group began to cast on him. The Skeleton
                        lunged forward and pinned Hawke's arms to
                        his side, and weakened by the disease,
                        Hawke fell to the ground. </font></p>

                        sinister laugh was heard as one of the
                        dark ones walked up to him. He was
                        shorter than most Tier&#146;Dal, and his
                        hair was pure white. Blood ran into
                        Hawke's eye, and he could not see much
                        more. </font></p>

                        necromancer began to rummage through the
                        packs and Hawke could see several items
                        taken. </font></p>

                        those items alone, for they belong to my
                        guild!&quot;</font></p>

                        struggled against the grip of the
                        Skeleton, which held him pinned down. His
                        efforts rewarded with the hideous
                        cackling laughter of the undead pet. </font></p>

                        moving towards Hawke. </font></p>

                        could see the man clearer now, his purple

                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Enough
                        is enough!&quot; Hawke shouted. He
                        gathered in his will and called forth the
                        power of Marr, calling for the pet to be
                        warded. Bands of blue light began to
                        swirl around Hawke, then shot out and
                        caught</font></p>

                        undead pet. The force of the blow knocked
                        the Skeleton back, and Hawke was free to
                        go. He quickly snatched up his shield and
                        bashed the nearest Tier&#146;Dal. Other
                        necromancers began to cast more spells,
                        and</font></p>

                        was again knocked to his feet. He felt
                        himself on the verge of death, vile
                        poisons and disease infested him, and the
                        world began to go black around him. </font></p>

                        his last ounce of strength, he again
                        called to Marr, and Laid his Hands upon
                        his body. In a rush his life force
                        returned, and he stood up, ready to face
                        his attackers. </font></p>

                        more mana, a snakeskin tunic, and the

                        just what to do.</font></p>

                        the powerful guildstone sending his words
