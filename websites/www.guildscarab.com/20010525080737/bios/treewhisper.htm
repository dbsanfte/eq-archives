Treewhisper took her first breath. The trees were the only midwives to attend the child's
mother, and the wolves were the only family to pace anxiously along the edge of the
misty grove. But as Moonsong gently cleansed the blood from her new born babe, she
knew that she'd have it no other way. The breeze sang through the trees, celebrating the
birth of their Keeper's child. The soft susurrations of sound were whispers to Moonsong's
ears.  The trees were whispering the good news, one to the next throughout the wood: an
heir to the forest was born. Moonsong rejoiced in their approval, calling the child
Treewhisper in honor of her ancient wooded family. 
<br><br>
As the child grew, Moonsong taught her the ways of the wood, instructing Treewhisper in
the ancient magicks of life, renewal and rebirth. Moonsong knew her time as the Keeper
of Silverglade Wood was coming to an end, and Treewhisper would reign as Keeper. The
wood was small, warranting only one Keeper, unlike Jaggedpine Forest to the South. 
<br><br>
The child grew strong in body and wisdom, wolves her sisters and brothers, trees her
guardians. Moonsong never mentioned Tree's father, and Treewhisper never asked, for
her mother had taught her that a Druid's forest was her husband, and her marriage bed,
the grasses within. 
<br><br>
Druids do not die. Instead, they fade away into the nature that they protected for so long
-- at least that's what they say. They say a Druid within her forest can last a thousand
years as long as she dwells within its sheltering embrace, then her spirit simply transfers
itself to the trees. Thus, each tree is a Druid of old, since the day when Tunare first
appointed a guardian to her forest -- so they say. 
<br><br>
So, Treewhisper was not surprised one day to find her mother's belongings in the small
moss-covered cave that they called home. Moonsong's scrolls, herbs, and battle gear were
all placed neatly together on the old, rock-carved shelf that lined the cave wall. This was
not a sorrowful time for Treewhisper. 
<br><br>
Though Tree would miss her mother's physical companionship, she could sense her in the
wood and knew that it was as it should be. The wood was her kin now, its inhabitants her
charges. The young Druid picked up the fine scimitar used by her mother over the ages
and ran her finger along it's shining, sharp blade. She turned it in her hand. The balance
fit her; no more practicing with old rusty scimitars in the glade with her mother. This
weapon was meant for a woman, for a fighter, for a true defender of the forest. A soft
smile touched Tree's face as she caught her reflection in its long steel blade. She had not
realized how much she had grown. Her face looked somehow older. In place of merry,
rounded cheeks, were cheekbones chiseled from tan clay. Instead of the dancing glow of
innocence in her bark-colored eyes, she saw the wisdom of ages sparkling there -- her
mother's wisdom, passed down from mother to daughter. 
<br><br>
And all was well in Treewhisper's corner of the realm -- for a time. Gnolls began
invading the wood from the South, killing the wolves for meat and slashing and burning
the trees. Treewhisper fought bravely for as long as she could. The Keeper of Jaggedpine
Forest tried to send aid, but he and his apprentices had their own battles to fight as Gnolls invaded Surefall Glade.
<br><br>
The attacks became more frequent, the fires more encompassing, until Treewhisper was
captured and imprisoned in Blackburrow. She felt the pain of the trees as they burned,
and even from this far she heard their silent screams in her heart. And she could do
nothing. She had failed her wood. She no longer heard its whispers, she no longer felt its
presence. 
<br><br>
Her wood was dead. 
<br><br>
Not long after the destruction of Silverglade, Treewhisper found herself rescued by brave
rangers sent from Surefall Glade. There was no rejoicing; Treewhisper had nowhere she
wished to go, nothing to call home. Her will was to die in Blackburrow, for a Druid
without her wood surely dies.
<br><br>
But Tunare works in strange ways. The inhabitants of Surefall Glade nursed her back to
health, and the presence of the sheltering pines soothed some of her pain. She started
small, healing slight wounds and protecting the Grizzly Caves from intruders. Though her
anguish ran deep, she was soon able to leave the Glade in search of her homeland,
Kelethin. Now she roams the land, protecting the children of Tunare, the Mother of All,
in any way she can to make up for her failure. Perhaps you'll see her . . . perhaps not.
They say she blends with the trees and sleeps with the wolf. But if someone is in trouble,
she is by their side, regarding each life saved as precious to her as her lost trees.
