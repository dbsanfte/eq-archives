She                       has long hair and wears it in long braids draped over her                       shoulders. unlike most dwarven females, she lacks a beard.                       She carrys herself in a rugged manner, having spent the                       majority of her years in the mines of Kaladim. She has recently                       added a tatoo on her left hand which is a picture of the                       sun, moon, and the stars as she firmly belives that her                       Diety looks down upon her and given her the strength and                       courage to uphold the values that her guild, Scarab, has                       asked of her. <br>                      <br>                      <font color="blue"><b><i>History: </i></b></font><br>                      <br>                      Born as Rozella of Kaladim, she grew up the maze of many                       tunnels and trails. She made it her duty to know the destination                       of each and every one of them! She lived in relative security                       with her mother, also a cleric, until one day she decided                       to expand her knowledge of the area. She liked living in                       the mines but always wondered about what lay outside her                       immediate area. One day she loaded up her pack and ventured                       forth whereupon she walked onto the docks of Kaladim to                       find a large ferry. Bravely she said a small prayer to her                       diety, and jumped aboard. She arrived in the town called                       Freeport with no maps to guide her. It was so unlike the                       quiet underground she was used to, and at first the hustle                       and bustle made her nervous. It was not too long before                       she soon realized that she was lost with no idea as to where                       she was at. <br>                      <br>                      Luckily for her, she met the acquaintance of a human Paladin                       who lived in this city, he had a natural charisma about                       him, and seemed to treat her with high respect, something                       which other humans did not give her. Instead of wishing                       to be returned to her underground home, she elected to learn                       more about the city that she arrived in. After informing                       her mother of her decision, she took to teaching herself                       everything that she could about the land she had discovered,                       while trying to promote the ways of the dwarven Diety. She                       spent many days with her new friend, and found his faith                       in Dietys did not clash with hers, and found his sense of                       honor refreshing. Rozella learned that the city held many                       secrets that held her fascination for many years. After                       spending several years as friends of the Paladin, they grew                       very close, and decided to take up residence on the western                       edge of the city and share thier knowledge with anyone or                       anything that would need it. Together they formed a guild                       with strong roots in Honor and Loyalty, and they married,                       she took his name, dropping the Rozella, and earned the                       right of Lady with her station of Guildmaster. <br>                      <br>                      Since then she has been assisting any creatures that come                       to her for help. She has an open policy of assisting any                       creatures of any alignment who may need healing. Lady Hawke                       has an extensive knowledge of healing certain adventurers                       who were cursed with long-term ailments and then teach them                       the ways of the land so that they could care for themselves.                       Due to her views in assisting everything in the land she                       has made friends with many creatures that live there. Together                       with Lord Hawke, she makes a solid force agaisnt the evil                       dealings in this land. <br>                      <br>                      <b><i><font color="blue">Recent Activity: </font></i></b><br>                      <br>                      Lady Hawke has been involved in many investigations over                       the last several weeks. Most of the cases she works on are                       either acting as a knowldege gatherer for the guild, or                       making money in the fishing industry she recently discovered.                       She has also been in a number of internal investigations                       into the guild of Scarab. As a lawful good cleric, she is                       on the constant look out for signs of activity by known                       evil groups in the land. She is very intellegent and exceptionally                       observant, very little escapes her notice. She is very difficult                       to surprise, and always tries to stay one step ahead of                       the enemy. She doesn't, however, give this appearance to                       those who do not know her, which only serves to increase                       her ability to achieve this. To most she appears to be a                       simple cleric who speaks freely with you, however has a                       knack of being able to get people to say things before they                       realize that they didn't mean to. </font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
