Because we’d all like to get to know our guildmates better, I’ve started a new section for the news: Inquiring Minds Want to Know. This takes a handful of questions and lets you know a bit about others in Scarab. If you would like to be interviewed just email me and I’ll either email you some questions or will catch you in-game. I’ll probably be posting an interview a month or as my supply of guinea pigs allows.  I hope you enjoy the latest segment of the News! <BR><P>

This weeks <I>Inquiring Minds Want to Know</I> interview takes place with Hawke: <BR><P>

Q. <I>How did you come to be involved in the Guild Scarab?</I><BR>
A. Well, I'm one of the original 4 founders of the guild, way back in Ultima
Online Beta. <BR><P>

Q. <I>As Inner Circle Leader, how do you see yourself conquering the world in the short time you have?</I><BR>
A. Already tried this once. Learned a valuable lesson from it. Now I think I'll be content to help others rule the world. :) <BR><P>

Q. <I>What or who got you interested in gaming?</I><BR>
A. Ahh, well, that would be me. I remember back to when Lucasart's X-Wing came out. (on Floppy) and I played that for hours on my state of the art top of the line 486DX66. <BR><P>

Q. <I>What type of computer do you play on?</I><BR>
A. My personal gaming box is a home built AMD 1.2 with 512MB Ram, a GeForce2
Ultra 64MB, SB Live. 47GB IBM Hard Drive with a 19In Monitor. I have a home
network and use Cable Internet. <BR><P>

Q. <I>What is your favorite snack to eat while playing?</I><BR>
A. Depends on my mood. Sunflower Seeds to Fritos. :) I don't have a single
favorite. <BR><P>

Q. <I>What game(s) have you played with the Scarab Guild?</I><BR>
A. I am proud to say I have worn the Scarab tag in Ultima Online, EverQuest,
Anarchy Online, Dark Age of Camelot and Jumpgate. I have also participated
in Scarab gaming events with Age of Empires (I and II), Empire Earth, Jedi
Knight (Fear my Jedi Back Attack!), Dungeon Keeper, and a few other Strategy
and FPS.  I'm also involved with Fantasy Sports with members of the guild,
which is a lot of fun! <BR><P>

Q. <I>What was your favorite game to play with the Scarab guild?</I><BR>
A. This is a difficult question. I am going to assume that you don't mean
favorite overall game. I am going to say DAoC. Dolvin and the rest of the
crew did such an awesome job getting the DAoC guild off to a running start.
It was so much fun playing with all the different guildmates working
together to get the guild up and registered in the quickest time possible.
<BR><P>

Q. <I>In the game(s), what name and type of character do people know you by?</I><BR>
A. Well, I've always been known as Hawke. There has only been one time that my main character in any game wasn't Hawke, and that was Anarchy Online, when I was Hawkenarr, a really big and stupid guy who really loved Cheeseburgers.
Had fun RPing him. I have also been known as Szintra, but that's my evil
side. Early in EQ we created a second sub guild called "Sunset Rage" that we
stuck our evil alts in. We actually set up guildwar between Scarab and
Sunset Rage and had player ran PVP quests between the two guilds. That was a
lot of fun. Szintra was a cheesy bad guy, but fun all the same. <BR><P>

Q. <I>Why did you choose the class that you did?</I><BR>
A. 99.9% of the time, Hawke is a Paladin or Paladin type. DAoC was the first
time I didn't go that route. (Not counting AO, since the classes were so
different.) I wanted to play a warrior with a chip on his shoulder, and that
was Midgard Hawke. My first AD&D Character was Hawke the Paladin. Old habits
die hard I guess. <BR><P>

Q. <I>What is/was your favorite aspect of the game?</I><BR>
A. Well, normally I would ask which game. But this answer is simple. My
favorite aspect of any game is Scarab. Without them the games just aren't
there. <BR><P>

Q. <I>What is your least favorite aspect?</I><BR>
A. EverCamping. Bleah. <BR><P>

Q. <I>Why did you leave the latest game you played, Dark Ages of Camelot? Do you see yourself going back to either EverQuest or Dark Ages?</I><BR>
A. I started college full time. I didn't have the time to put into a MMORPG. I don't really see myself ever going back to DAoC, though I have kept my EQ
account alive all these years, mainly for the history of it. Hawke is, as I
am told, the oldest living Character on Solusek Ro Server. It was also
though EQ Hawke that the Guild Scarab was formed, and the guild is the
oldest active guild on the server. (We were the first guild created in DAoC
on our server, and the second guild created on Solusek Ro in EQ, so
something to be proud of.) <BR><P>


Q. <I>If you could be any character in real life from the game(s) that you've played, what would it be and why?</i><BR>
A. Wow, a great question.  Putting things into perspective, I would have to say Hawke, Paladin, EQ. The early days of EQ everything was so fresh and new and fun. Many many great friendships have come from those days, and many friends I made in UO just became better. <BR><P>

Q. <I>What Mmorg game do you see yourself playing next and why?</I><BR>
A. Star Wars Galaxies. Originally I was very much against this game because of one of the designers involved, but I'm willing to give it a chance. As all
the world knows, I'm a pretty big Star Wars Geek, and I can't resist the chance to run around as Jedi Hawke with the Scarab tag. Boooyah! <BR><P>

Q. <I>Where do you see Scarab in the next few years (or more), or where do you hope to see Scarab going?</I><BR>
A. In 5 years, I see Scarab as an official not for profit organization
sponsoring live local gaming tournaments set around our annual Scarabfests! <BR><P>

Q. <I>And last but not least, what IS up with the Llama thing?</I><BR>

Oh boy...  Well… Ok. I’ll tell the quick and dirty version. The full
story is reserved for ScarabFests.</i> <BR><P>

You see, a long time ago in the UO Beta, a young and fearless Hawke wanted
to make a name for himself. He set out on an adventure that lead him to a
quite docile looking Llama. To make a long story short, Hawke attacked this
Llama, and got his butt handed to him. The next day at work, besides himself
with excitement at the coolness of this new style of game, I shared this
story with the other guys (Ravenn, Venomm, and Ozwyn.) I told the story with
such fire, I didn't realize how incredibly lame I was that I got my butt
kicked by a Llama. Ever since then, things have gotten more silly and are at
the point where they are now. I have an innate fear of Llamas, and the guild
makes fun of me ruthlessly for it. :) <BR><P>

<BR><P>

Well hope you all enjoyed the first edition of the Interviews. Just email me if you'd like to be interviewed!
<BR><P>

<B>SCARAB NOTES:</b><BR><P>
The Inner Circle of Scarab has announced their very first charity fundraiser! Macedon and his sister are involved in a group called Team In Training, which raises money in support of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to help fund research and find a cure. Their goal is to raise $10,000. Be a true Scarab supporter by buying some awesome, specially picked items at the Scarab Store (see above link) or at <a href=http://www.cafepress.com/Scarab_cure target=Scarab Cure>Scarab Cure</a>. You may also contact <a href=mailto:llagonik@yahoo.com>Mace</a> directly if you so wish. See complete details on the Scarab board.<BR><P>

Scarab has now joined a new Alliance! This Alliance consists of Aesirs Chosen, Hardfought, Hrafn Warband, NorthGuard, Of Staedwall, Reckoning, Rel Por, Scarab, Shadows of the Unseen, Sif’s Devotion, The Harbingers, and The Horde. We all hope to see lots of action in RvR with new Alliance mates, and some good experience groups would be a welcome bonus.<BR><P>

Well since the previous update was all about games on the PC, I thought that I’d give a post on sites to obtain virus information to keep those PC’s in shape. Just recently I received yet another email claiming that if I just forward my email, along with all the emails of my friends, to the hither beyond of the internet that Bill Gates will send me money! <BR><P>

Come on! Bill Gates has better things to do with his money, like buy a gold plane or Apple Computers. Let alone send $200 to one of his forced-to-use-Microsoft masses. If Ed McMahon won’t send me money, why would Bill?<BR><P>

Anyways, it isn’t a virus, but it could lead to unpleasant things (actually its an <a href=http://www.europe.f-secure.com/hoaxes/bgetrack.shtml target=annoying hoax>annoying hoax</a>). Nothing like giving someone access to 50 emails to peruse at their leisure. (See an interesting article at <a href=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/usebcc.htm target=Truth or Fiction>Truth or Fiction</a>. The “story” <I>may</I> not be true, but the gist of it is.)<BR><P>

So on to those sites:<BR><P>

<B><a href=http://www.f-secure.com  target=F-Secure>F-Secure</a></b> - One of my favorites, this has lots of up-to-date information and an easy to use site<BR>
<B><a href=http://www.mcafee.com  target=McAfee>McAfee</a></b> - Not a bad site, lots there if you look through everything. Also has a free email signup where they send you virus warnings as they get them.<BR>
<B><a href=http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ target=Trend Micro>Trend Micro</a></b> - Lots of information, a little slow on the latest update though.<BR>
<B><a href=http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/ target=Symantec>Symantec</a></b> - Informative updates, shows a nice little damage/distribution graph.<BR>
<B><a href=http://www.sybari.com/alerts/default.asp?year=2002 target=Sybari>Sybari</a></b> - Its okay, not very recent news, but nice if you want to have a couple sources to look through.<BR>
<B><a href=http://www.truthorfiction.com target=Truth or Fiction>Truth or Fiction</a></b> - Its not a virus site actually, but does have some good info on if things are fact or fiction. <BR><P>

A nice thing about most of the above sites, is not only do they tell you about viruses, but about hoaxes and what silly emails to watch for. Hope this helps!<BR><P>

<B>SCARAB NOTES:</b><BR><P>

Congrats to <a href=http://www.guildscarab.com/quaser.jpg>Quaser</a> (extended member of Scarab) on reaching Level 60 and the status of High Priest! Job well done!<BR><P>

Just a reminder to check the BB for any updates on topics such as Alliance, raids, Fantasy Football, and more!<BR><P>

<b>Check your roster information.</b> Look over all of the rosters and make sure your information is complete and accurate, then send an Email to <a href=mailto:Hawke@guildscarab.com>Hawke</a> and let him know that either your information is right, or that it needs to be updated. This will only take a minute of your time so please help us out.<BR><P>

<center>
<img src=http://www.chanee.com/bars/bar012.jpg><br><P>
</center>

So you want a break from Dark Ages (or Everquest)? (Though WHY is beyond me!) Here are some up and coming games to keep an eye out for.<BR><P>

Being a chick the first thing I think of is: does it look good? I mean really, who wants to play a game that the graphics remind you of Pong?!<BR><P>

Well, to start <a href=http://www.codemasters.com/redirect/redirect.php?url=http://www.codemasters.com/dragonempires/uk/front.php target=Dragon Empires>Dragon Empires</a> looks pretty neat. Check out the screenshots. There be <a href=http://62.25.96.161/dragonempires/uk/imagelibrary/BirdDragon004.jpg target=Dragons>Dragons</a>, Ahoy! To quote: "In Dragon Empires you group with friends into clans and compete for the ownership of the 50 cities scattered throughout the world." Can't say that those playing dynamics appeal to me really, but the graphics look and the environment sounds very interesting. <i>(Release in 2003)</i> <BR><P>

Of course one can't forget <a href=http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ target=World of Warcraft>World of Warcraft</a>. This game looks stunning. Done in cartoony way, but done well so you don't feel like you are watching bad reruns of the old Spiderman. You get to play everything from humans and Taurans (minotaur type creatures), to some awesome dorfs. My hubby (Torhald/Grimthar in DAoC) picked up the dwarven figurine to this game. Must say it looks very very cool. <I>(No release date as of yet)</i><BR><P>

<a href=http://everquest2.station.sony.com/ target=Everquest II>Everquest II</a> is based 500 years into the future of Everquest lore. Its not an expansion of EQ but rather a sequel. It looks to have alot smoother graphics than the latest expansion of EQ. The <a href=http://everquest2.station.sony.com/screenshots/72502/Elf1.jpg target=elf lasses>elf lasses</a> look presentable and even the <a href=http://everquest2.station.sony.com/screenshots/72502/griffinback1.jpg target=mobs>mobs</a> have had a makeover. Now if they fixed the "have to be in an uber guild to get anywhere, and not have to camp something 46 hours" issues, the game will be kick as…. awesome that is. <I>(Release later in 2003)</i><BR><P>

If you don't want to pick up any of those, how about <a href=http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com/home/news.shtml  target=Shadowbane>Shadowbane</a>? You can choose from 10 races, 20 classes, 13 guild types and the ability to multiclass. <a href=http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com/downloads/screenshots/200207/page03.html target=Effects>Effects</a> seem to look okay, though in general the graphics seem to be a bit blocky. <I>(Release sometime in 2002)</I><BR><P> 

Then there is <a href=http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC2/default.htm  target=Asherons Call II>Asherons Call II</a>. What I've seen of the <a href=http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall2/extras/multimedia.asp target=screenshots>screenshots</a> is fairly impressive, but what got me ooh'ing and ah'ing when I checked out the site was this concept art shot: <a href=http://zone.msn.com/images/zac2/0531ConShadow.jpg target=Shadow Mystic>Shadow Mystic</a>. Torhald actually picked up the disk for the beta testing from Computer Games Magazine. Its a very simplistic game (well compared to EQ or DA) but the graphics are great! <i>(Release in winter, 2002)</i> <BR><P>

And something for those UO nuts out there: <a href=http://www.uo.com/ageofshadows/ target=Ultima Online Age of
Shadows>Ultima Online Age of Shadows</a>. Comes with 2 new professions (Pally and a Necro) and a new realm to run around and gank people in. <i>(Release in early 2003)</i> <BR><P>

Okay since we are talking games, I've GOT to have a quick plug for my favorite. Its not a PC game, but its so much fun: <a
href=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/357/357890p1.html target=Gauntlet: Dark Legacy>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy</a> for the Xbox. There is improved graphics, some new levels and places to explore, yet with the traditional fun characters to play. Not an indepth, deep meaning, change your life forever kind of game, but just plain ole' shoot 'em up fun. There are a few more awesome Xbox games (like Halo, Munch, etc.), but I can yap about those later. <BR><P>

Well hopefully that will keep you busy for an hour or two, and gives you an idea for a few games coming out in the next year or so!<BR><P>

Greets Scarab members and readers! Just wanted to introduce myself - Rose from Dark Ages/Guinevere. Actually I used to be Rose from EQ, but back then played on the Mithaniel Marr server.

<BR><P>
The latest Dark Ages news out there, as I'm sure we've all heard about, is the respec topic. Sanya did a <a
href=http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=34341295&page=1 target=Respec Issues>Respect Issues</a> post on the VN boards that may help explain things a bit for those considering it. Just remember you only have a 2 level span of time to respec!<BR><P>

Also, something that people can't wait to be implemented - Spell Crafting and Alchemy! There is a nice writeup available on Spellcrafting for those thinking about taking up the trade: <a

We can't forget the Everquest folks with the Planes of Power expansion
coming out October 22. Check out the <a
