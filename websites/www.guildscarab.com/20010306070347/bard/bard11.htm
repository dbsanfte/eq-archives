        face="Comic Sans MS">I had awakened from my sleep in
        North Freeport. I was filled with energy to purge the
        evils that await outside of the walls Freeport. That is
        my quest&#133; my mission&#133;. my life&#133;. I have
        very few friends outside of SCARAB and they are my
        family. I would gladly lay down my life for anyone one of
        them 1000 times over. I gave a HAIL over the guildstone
        to see who was out and about, my friend Horammer gave a
        shout back. &quot; I am heading to unrest, care to join
        me?&quot; Unrest&#133; one of many vile places begging
        for purging. Hmmm Unrest was across the ocean. I hate
        boats, never liked them, never will. Horammer knew what I
        was thinking. &quot;Come on&#133; take some beer and a
        fishing pole&#133;. and get out here. It will be fun to
        fight together again&quot; Well the day was young and my
        unquenchable thirst for vengeance was growing. I told
        Horammer that I would join him. &quot;Excellent my friend
        many undead will be crushed beneath our boots. I will
        meet you at the docks and take you there&quot;. As I
        boarded this vessel I could have sworn that it was
        sinking. There were only two other people on board so I
        kept to myself and sat in the middle of the boat,
        muttering &quot;I hate boats&quot; The trip went without
        problems. I jumped onto the docks of Butcher block to
        hear a &quot;Hail Venomm&quot; being not used to this
        area I looked around then down to see my friend, my
        brother dressed in what looked to like plate armor. The
        climate was much cooler than the barren desert of
        Northern Ro. There was no desert that I could see. We
        traveled to Kaladim, where he binded my spirit. He then
        centered my body and spirit. I felt healthier and
        stronger, now my thirst was screaming from the inside,
        and I felt good about how today was going to turn out. We
        traveled through some grassy land and slightly dense
        forest. We traveled for what seemed like hours, through
        mountains and even into the mountain itself. Much like
        befallen.</font><p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;We
        are here,&quot; he said. &quot;Once we get inside go to
        the left and stick to the wall&quot; This was his area he
        knew it well. So I followed. Once inside I was scoped the
        place out. It seemed to be a luxury manor of some rich
        fool who had let the undead take it over. It mattered not
        who owned the place this area reeked of evil. It took all
        that I had to keep from going out of control and killing
        everything in sight. &quot;Since its just the two of us
        right now lets start with something easy&quot; As he took
        two steps forward he seemed to lighten up with power and
        shot loose a bolt of energy that struck an undead
        creature. It charged him, me being the fighter I stepped
        into the path of the creature charging Horammer. It was
        saying something like kill you. I could not make out the
        words nor did I care. Everything went red and I let
        myself go berserk wielding a hammer in each hand. One was
        my father&#146;s and the other I received as a gift form
        Lord Hawke. Then next thing I know Horammer is pulling me
        off of this rotting corpse that I have smashed to bits.
        &quot;Easy my friend, do not expel all your energy on
        this one&quot; As I stood up relatively unhurt I found
        myself seeing the weak points of this rotting beast.
        &quot;Another?&quot; Horammer asked. As if I was little
        boy asking for soup, &quot;yes please&quot; I said. I
        found myself becoming more confidant with these
        creatures. This is when things went down hill. My father
        had always said &quot;think before you act. Know you
        enemy well, that even the smallest pebble could lay to
        best fighter to waste&quot; After laying waste to another
        tormented soul, I felt a biting at my foot. I looked down
        to see what looked like a fire beetle of Northern Ro but
        these were nastier. However there were 5 of them, all
        nipping at me. I had lost much blood and I was very
        fatigued, my hammer swings seemed to have no strength
        behind them. I looked to Horammer, he was busy with
        another undead soul. I figured I had to lead them away,
        if I was going to die then it would be best if it was
        away from Horammer. I took them around a corner only to
        meet another tormented soul and a large wisp. The
        tormented soul started to say something like &quot; kill
        you!&quot; That was all he managed to say as my hammer
        took off the lower part of his jaw. But now in hindsight
        I see what his real goal was, to hold me down as the
        large wisp and the death beetles beat and slashed my body
        to a bloody pulp. I awoke in Kaladim where Horammer had
        binded me. I quickly rushed back as far as the mountains,
        concerned that Horammer was unprotected. However he had
        survived the battle and he meet me at the mountainside to
        lead me back the rest of the way. Upon retrieving my
        stuff Peabodi had joined us in the fight. Together the
        three of us killed many tormented undead, jack
        o&#146;lanterns, and several barbed skeletons. By the
        time I had to sleep for the night I had gained much
        knowledge of these foul creatures. I have decided to stay
        here while and help Horammer and whoever else that wants
        to purge this manor of the evil undead. Besides, I
        don&#146;t like boats, never have, and never will.</font></p>
