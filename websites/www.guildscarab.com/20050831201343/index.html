										<p class="newsBody">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
- World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.6.1 (2005-08-02)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
 General<br />
- Spell casting is no longer interrupted when leaving combat. <br />
<br />
 Warriors<br />
- Improved Shield Block - Fixed a bug where Rank 3 of the talent was <br />
  not granting the extra block.<br />
- Bloodthirst - Damage bonus increased to 40% of attack power. <br />
<br />
 Items<br />
- The Oil of Immolation effect is no longer affected by bonuses to <br />
  spell damage from items. <br />
<br />
 Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
- Blackwing Lair<br />
   Several encounters in Blackwing Lair now cause the front gate to <br />
   close, preventing players from zoning out or joining an in-progress <br />
   battle.<br />
   The Razorgore encounter has been changed slightly to make it less <br />
   "random". The spawning should be more consistent throughout the <br />
   fight.<br />
   The timer for Vaelastrasz the Corrupt is now more persistent. You <br />
   can no longer reset the one-hour time limit for beating him by <br />
   leaving the instance. Also, Vaelastrasz the Corrupt will not respawn <br />
   for 12 hours if he has not been beaten when the timer expires.<br />
   The drakes in Blackwing Lair will no longer leave the lab. <br />
- Maraudon<br />
   Lowered experience values for Creeping Sludge. <br />
<br />
 Macs<br />
- Increased the maximum number of sounds which can be played <br />
  simultaneously. This will fix problems where some sounds could be <br />
  dropped in very busy situations.<br />
- Fixed WoW Error Reporter so that it doesn't crash under Mac OS X <br />
  10.4 when trying to send an error report.<br />
- Worked around an issue where you would lose your Expose/Dashboard <br />
  preferences if you crashed or asserted while in fullscreen mode on <br />
  Mac OS X 10.4.<br />
- Fixed the "blockWidth", "srec", and "bitnum &lt; m_numBits" assertions <br />
  bugs that would crash the game.<br />
- Fixed a bug involving corpses near the player that could result in a <br />
  crash ("BusError"). <br />

Mogtak and Malfader were awarded Torches of Loyalty<br />
<br />
Many members were promoted to Veteran Status (sorry too many to name)<br />
<br />
Quartermaska gave out many presents to the guild. Keep those donations flowing to Quartermaska and if you are looking for an upgrade check with him since he may have something donated from another guildmember.<br />

The key words for the evening were to remember to have FUN!!!<br />
Let the officers know if your not having FUN and we will do our best to help you have FUN!!!<br />
