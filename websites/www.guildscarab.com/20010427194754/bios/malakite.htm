<font face="arial" size="2">Born Markus Ariakis (Mar-kus Ah-rye-a-cus, Malakite was born in Freeport. His parents were not poor, but not rich. He led a fairly normal early childhood....He worked around the house, ran errands, studyed when he had time. Malakite, or Markus, was always studying. He desired information more than anything. He had dreams of traveling to the far off Faydwer, perhaps even to Odus among the Erudite people. He always had his nose in a book, or out walking among the commonlands, before the griffins came. <br><br>
	One day, Markus' father had to go cut wood out in the commonlands. While helping his father fell a tree, he noticed some movement in the bushes. He kept glancing out of the corner of his eye at it. Soon he thought it was just an animal, and concentrated on his work. All of the sudden, an arrow flew out from the bushes and pierced his father's shoulder . Markus recoiled, diving for the protection of a tree stump. His Father picked up the axe and swung at a dark object that was just emerging from the bushes. The Tier'Dal screamed in a high pitched voice as the blade bit deep into its leg. Markus became frightened, and ran as fast as he could to his father's aid. Markus was young, and not trained in the arts of fighting. The best he could come up with on such a short notice was a large stick. He swung down upon the Drow with all the force he could muster. The injured Dark Elf easily dodged it, but was caught unaware by the flat blade of his father's axe. The Elf was knocked unconcious... Markus' father and Markus tied the elf to a tree, and demanded to know what it wanted as soon as it awakened. The Drow spit at his father, cursing (obviously) in his own language. From his studies, Markus understood some of the words. he caught "necklace" "stolen" "death" and "human". Markus had no idea what the Tier'Dal meant, but his father obviously did. <br><br>
His father became suddenly calm and cool, and slit the dark elf's throat. He told his son to go home, that he would return soon. Markus did as he was told, but arrived home to find his house in a mess. He searched the house, only to find his mother dying in the kitchen. His mother looked up at him and motioned him to come closer. She told him to remove the 2nd stone from the bottom of his fireplace, and then she passed away. Under the stone was a necklace, bright silver, with a piece of Malachite as the pendent. He felt an odd tingle from it. Markus did not know what to do. He knew if he stayed, whoever it was that was after them would come back to do a more thorough search. But he knew his father may be back at anytime. He couldn't leave a note as the infidel's might discover where he had gone. Markus decided to go to his Aunt's house in the East Commonlands. As he left his house, he got the odd feeling he was being watched, so he hurried along the streets, around corners, nearly running. As he rounded one corner, he slammed into a short, dark skinned creature. The drow quickly tackeled Markus and held a dagger to his throat. "Where is it?' The drow spat at him. Markus figured he ment the necklace, but said nothing. The Dark elf was about to kill him, when a guard rounded the corner. The evil swine clubbed him over the head quickly and carried him out to the pier where another Tier'Dal was waiting. They argued about what to do with Markus, when one got angry and threw him in the bay. 
<br><br>
The guildmaster of the Monks found him washed up on the shore, with a nasty bump on his head. The Master took him to the Ashen Order, and nursed him back to health. Markus could remember nothing, not his name, not who his parents were, not ever where he lived. All he had was a small silver and malachite necklace with "Ariakis" engraved into the stone. The Master began calling Markus "Malakite", since his real name was not known. He trained for years with the Ashen Order, until he felt he needed to leave. He bid his Master farewell and headed out to Befallen, a dangerous dungeon where evil creatures reside. <br><br>
"As I came into the darker parts of it, I noticed a lone halfling fighting a skeleton. I snuck up behind the skeleton and, trained as I was in hand-to-hand combat, threw my fist into its spine with such force as to shatter it. The halfling collapsed, weary from his battle. I asked if there was anything I could do, but the Halfling simply smiled and mumbled something. Suddenly, a strange blue aura surrounded him and it was apparent that the small person was feeling better. I introduced myself as Malakite, being the only name I had known for around 7 years. The Halfling smiled again and said " I am called JaVanno.". We talked for a while, and I came to learn that JaVanno was a member of a guild that was being formed. I was interested in knowing more, so I returned to the city and began asking around about it. Soon I was attempting the quests, and shortly thereafter presented my items to Lord Hawke himself and was accepted as a member." 
<br><br>
Malakite started remembering his past long ago, but has decided to keep the name Malakite. He is determined to find out what happened to his Father, and avenge his mother's death. He still has the necklace, although he still does not know what it is.
