					<TD valign="TOP" colspan="2"><FONT class="text1">
						Dolvin was born in Jordheim and grew up in a happy home.  He was the oldest of three children, with a younger sister Greta and his younger brother, Hawke.
						Dolvin spent most of his early life in Jordheim, working with his father at the family forge, developing his skill with metal, leather, and wood.  
						Frequently, he would be called upon to bail his little brother out of scrapes of his own making.  No matter how many times he warned him, Dolvin thought, 
						Hawke just couldn't stay out of trouble.<br>
						<br>
						In his 19th season, Dolvin fought with his father against the foul invasion of elves and monsters from Hibernia.  Although his father fought valiently by his
						son's side, Dolvin's father fell in battle, and Dolvin was forced to bring his father's body home to his newly widowed mother.  For the next two years, Dolvin's
						training took over and he worked his father's business as best he could, so as to put food on the table for his mother and siblings.  <br>
						<br>
						Then, things began to crumble around him.  His mother, who had never fully recovered from the sight of her son bringing home her husband's bloody body over his shoulder, 
						died early the second year.  Some months later, while Dolvin spent yet another sleepless night at the forge, his sister ran off with no word, just a note that said she
						was going to avenge their father.  Dolvin struggled to raise his brother Hawke while maintaining the stoic exterior that was expected of all Norsemen.  Inside, however
						his blood was boiling.  He longed to take the training of the Thanes - the holy warriors of Thor.  He knew that with Thor's help he would rid the world of the murderers of
						his family.<br>
						<br>
						His rage would prove prophetic.  A few months after she left, he received a message from her commander at Svaude Faste.  Greta had been killed in the line of duty, her body
						torn apart with torture and abuse at the rage of a different enemy - the Britons of Albion.  They had gutted her like an animal and returned her in pieces to her commander.  
						There had already been a pyre, her commander explained, and her soul was safely in Valhalla.<br>
						<br>
						The news finally split the steel shield that had been pulled over Dolvin's heart.  Tossing the letter towards the fireplace, he emerged into his ancient family's common room
						holdling the fine alloy battle hammer that his father had died holding.  Looking at his brother Hawke, already in training to be a warrior of Tyr, Dolvin reflected sadly on 
						the innocence that had been lost in his lifetime.  The steel in his eyes was reflected back to him in Hawke's.  Dolvin knew the boy was ready to fight.<br>
						<br>
						Dolvin went out, and taking advantage of the reputation that he had garnered as a smith, called skilled warriors to his side from all of Midgard.  Working closely with them,
						they forged Scarab, a guild of warriors dedicated to eradicating the forces that had destroyed his family.  Soon after founding Scarab, he called the most powerful guilds together
						to Midgard to form a grand Alliance of Guilds.  Together, these guilds pledge to rid the world of the foul invaders and restore Midgard to its rightful place as the most powerful
						realm in the world.</FONT>
