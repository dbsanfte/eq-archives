        size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Horammer, Borgu and I were
        hunting the Plains of East Karana. We had setup near the
        great wooden bridge and Borgu would travel out and seek
        prey. After many lions, some gorge hounds and a few gnoll
        reavers, we decided to finish our hunt with something a
        little bigger.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Borgu set out and
        even though the Griffawns appeared to be an easy match,
        his experiences earlier in the day told him otherwise.
        The Griffawn that had seemed to be a little weaker than
        himself and even with Lochlan, had ripped them to shreds
        with it's powerful claws sending Lochlan's spirit back to
        Freeport and Borgu running for the safety of the bridge.
        So the Griffawn was out, ahhh, an Evil Eye, it looked
        dangerous but not impossible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Borgu let loose a
        great bellow and the Eye set after him, pet in tow. It
        unleashed great magics on him and by the time he returned
        to us, Borgu was near death. For good measure a Lion
        Patriarch had joined in the battle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">We tried
        desperately to lure the creatures from Borgu but to no
        avail and soon our friend's spirit was sent away. The
        creatures turned on us, I lured the pet and lion away
        while Horammer focused on the Eye.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The air exploded
        with magical energy as they battled while my sword and
        song did what they could. Soon Horammer had the upper
        hand and while a party of onlookers watched he finished
        the mighty creature. A kind healer whose name escapes me,
        boosted my strength and soon I vanquished the pet and
        lion with some help from Horammer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A mighty battle
        was won despite the loss of our friend and a great cheer
        rose among the crowd. Soon thereafter I achieved my 14th
        rank and camped , exhausted and proud. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Borgu's
        story:</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I was hunting East
        Karana with two guildmates, Horammer and Lochlan.
        Horammer is the epitome of the Dwarven Cleric. He is
        short of words and study in battle. Lochlan was the first
        bard in the SCARAB guild, and one I look to for guidance
        in the ways of honor, loyalty, and valor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I was eagar to
        impress my guildmates with my daring, so I suggested we
        attempt to destroy an Evil Eye. An Evil Eye is the
        essence of fell magic created by evil sorcerers. At the
        time I bore a magic shield which I believed would help to
        protect me from the Eye's magic. I was soon proven
        wrong...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I ran towards the
        beast and set forth a terrible bellow to attract it's
        attention. As I turned to run I was locked into place by
        the monster's magic. It cast spell after spell upon me,
        darkness, fear, weakness, and yes even the dreaded death
        spell was attempted by this creature. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Still I was able
        to break free. by the time I reached my brothers, I was
        near death. I saw the bridge to safety yet I hesitated to
        leave my guildmates to the monster. I turned to loop
        around and distract the beast while my companions
        unleashed spells of their own. Next thing I am aware of
        is flying through the air, knocked backwards by the force
        of the Evil Eye's magic! I realize I will not be of any
        use, so I run towards the bridge. A veil of evil darkness
        slammed over me and I fell at the base of the bridge
        unable to see. The last sensation I felt was the hot
        breath of the Eye as it began to consume me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I awoke some
        distance away in the safety of High Hold Keep. I was
        worried about my guildmates so I queried them on the
        guildstone. I was surprised to find that they vanquished
        the beast! I ran back to my corpse happily knowing my
        death was not in vain.</font></p>
