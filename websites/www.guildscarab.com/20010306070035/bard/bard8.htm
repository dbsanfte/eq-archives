                        next morning still sprawled in the small
                        clearing, images of Ella&#146;dil still
                        in my head, I shake the cobwebs from my
                        brain and rise. The lean-to I had built
                        had served its purpose, now it made good
                        firewood. Starting the fire, I set the
                        single pot on the fire to melt some snow
                        for drinking water. While the water
                        boiled, berries and small roots make for
                        a filling breakfast&#133;ah&#133;sweet
                        root&#133;excellent. After filling my
                        water skins and my belly with clear
                        stream water, I set off once again down
                        the trail, stepping silently on the soft
                        pine needles. </font><p><font size="2"
                        face="Comic Sans MS">My effortless stride
                        eats mile after mile, over hills,
                        streams, and through tall grass valleys
                        until the sun is high in the clear sky. I
                        stop for a rest on top of a tall hill,
                        looking out over a long valley. Something
                        bothers me&#133;cant quite make it
                        out&#133;something is just unnatural
                        here. A line of trees marks where a
                        stream or brook runs the length of the
                        valley, splitting the valley in equal
                        halves. I sit silently, listening for
                        signs of life&#133;listening for any
                        noise&#133;anything at all.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Deciding
                        to camp at the top of the valley for the
                        night, I go about the preparations for a
                        fire, and a shelter. Settling onto my
                        bedroll, pulling my bearskin over me
                        snugly, I can not get the feeling of
                        something wrong out of my head. Thinking
                        of this, I slowly doze off.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Long
                        skeletal fingers of the frigid dawn try
                        to push into the relatively warm lean-to
                        as I awaken with a start. Cold sweat runs
                        down my neck, I slide out of the shelter
                        and look around quickly. Everything looks
                        normal, but something definitely feels
                        out of balance. In the early light, I
                        survey the valley again. Hmm&#133;Was
                        that small hut there late evening??</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Packing
                        up the camp hurriedly, dousing the coals
                        with handfuls of snow, I set off down
                        through the long grasses of the valley
                        cautiously. A faint trail appears beneath
                        my feet, leading in the direction of the
                        small dwelling. Not wanting to follow the
                        trail directly, I cut across it and walk
                        parallel to the stream. Approaching the
                        house, listening for any noises, I crouch
                        silently in the grass, looking the house
                        over. A fire burns out in front of the
                        low door, a spit rests on two metal
                        prongs, but nothing is cooking&#133;at
                        the moment. The ground is beaten down, as
                        if well trampled on, in a circle around
                        the hut and the fire. There is a faint
                        scent on the breeze blowing across the
                        valley, coming from the direction of the
                        hut. Smells of burnt meant and hides come
                        drifting slowly to me, making my nose
                        wrinkle.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
                        sun is coming up over the trees when
                        activity is heard from inside the hut.
                        The darkness of the doorway splits to
                        reveal a hideously disfigured
                        face&#133;just gazing upon the awful
                        features makes my stomach turn. The
                        figure emerges and moves to the woodpile,
                        grabs a few logs and throws them
                        haphazardly on the fire. The flames lick
                        hungrily at the dead wood&#133;growing of
                        the energy within the wood. Stepping back
                        inside the hut, the creature emerges with
                        something slung over its shoulder. I
                        strain my eyes, trying to make out what
                        it is&#133;No! It cant be! The body of a
                        young child&#133;..</font></p>
