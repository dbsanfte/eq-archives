The hurt, pain and anger evident in his eyes and on his face. Slowly he brought the axe up and slammed the blade thru the shrine again and again, his words seemingly like thunder as each blow landed. 
<br><br>
"You have forsaken me, I followed you, killed for you, sought justice for you and you forsake me. I renounce you and ALL the damnedable gods. We are not your playthings! I need no god to direct me, my fate is MY OWN! My Destiny is MY OWN! Never again will I pray to one of you or pay tribute to one of you, NEVER AGAIN!" 
<br><br>
With his last scream the shrine was destroyed. After This he slowly walked back into the darkness. His steps took him back to the ruins of Blazerose Keep and he stood among the destruction and looked upon where he had called home. Slowly he removed his armor and weapons and stood in no more than his kilt, his muscles rippled as he began clearing the stones and debris away. He worked well past sunrise and had a clear spot done. Kneeling, he removed the Dragon Orb from around his neck. Unclasping the chain he reached down and pulled his platinum wedding band from among some burned stones and slid it onto the chain. Then he clasped his hands around the stood and concentrated. He spoke the ancient tome of making that his mother had taught him in a dream and he felt the earth move around him. When he opened his eyes he was kneeling near the elder Oak. His eyes opened wide as he looked around him. Everything was as it was before he had set the Keep ablaze. 
<br><br>
He was weak from his task and sighed as his body relaxed. Suddenly, he felt a small hand on his shoulder, 
<br><br>
"M'love? Morigane?" 
<br><br>
He spun and looked at the lithe figure before him and his smile turned into an emotionless glance as he saw it was not the one who held his heart and soul. His voice a hoarse whisper, 
<br><br>
"Nae, she is gone nae'r to return to me" 
<br><br>
"Tis good you came to save the tree little sister, it helped me do what I have done. The road I travel now is dark and I may nae return to the way I once was. You'd do best to stay away from me less you have the same happen to you as I have had happen to me." 
<br><br>
Slowly he stared back down at the ground and waited for Treewhisper to speak.
