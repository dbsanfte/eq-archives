For years helping his father                       in the small forge was his life and he enjoyed it. The only                       times he was in trouble was when he set off traps so hunters                       could not catch anything. He believed that hunting should                       only be for survival and not for sport. His father taught                       him how to fight with swords and spears and bows, however                       it was the hammer that the boy liked. His father said he                       made it out of a rock that fell from the sky. The boy became                       proficient on the hammer and used it to set off traps set                       by big game hunters. </font></p>                    <p><font face="arial">Several years later, the boy was off                       in the forest setting off traps, visiting his favorite part                       of the woods when a group of hunters came into town. They                       massacred everyone in town --some villagers had it worse                       than others. One of the worst was his father. His father                       was forced to walk through the traps they used to snare                       animals to save his mother from animals that were bred to                       kill. Needless to say it was not a pleasant sight. Enraged                       with this sight the boy gathered up what he could. The town                       was pretty much burnt to the ground, so his supplies were                       limited. He left his village and never looked back.</font></p>                    <p><font face="arial">It seemed like months that he tracked                       this hunter, destroying his traps and freeing the animals                       that were caught in them. Then one day he had tracked the                       hunter to a familiar part of the forest. The boy drove the                       thought from his mind because the hunter was there, eviscerating                       a yearling. Vengeance was calling. As leaped down from the                       trees swinging his hammer he caught the hunter by surprise.                       In am manner of moments the boy disarmed and crippled him,                       but instead of moving in for the kill he paused. He wanted                       the hunter to feel trapped to feel despair. Most of all                       he wanted him to feel PAIN. All the pain that his village                       went through. The hunter begged for mercy. The boy just                       stood there staring at the pitiful mass resembling a human,                       &quot;no&quot;, the boy said, &quot; not today, not ever,                       for scum like you&quot;. Then and idea came to him, knowing                       the hunters traps and where he had hidden them, retrieved                       them all. Then, one at a time, set them off on the hunter.                       As the hunter breathed his last breath the boy realized                       where he was. This was the one part of the forest that brought                       him peace. As he realized that he brought destruction to                       this peaceful area, he had also brought justice. He then                       swore and oath that where ever evil reared its ugly head                       he would be there. He would become poison to all evil predators.                       He would become VENOMM.</font></p>                    <p><font face="arial">Several years later deep in the forest                       Venomm was hunting down a party of bandits who had been ambushing                       heavily traveled merchant routes. As he was tracking a group                       of bandits he heard the sounds of battle. He rushed quickly                       towards the noise fearing the worst only to find a group                       of bandits had bitten off more than they could chew. Warriors                       disguised as merchants set a trap for them. When Venomm saw                       what was happening he could not believe it. He immediately                       jumped into the fray. When it was over Lordhawke introduced                       himself and three others. Lady Hawke, Ozwyn, and Ravenn.                       He said that he was forming a guild called Scarab and asked                       him to join them. The fact there were other people like                       him filled him with hope. Hope that together, they could                       bring justice to this world. How could he say no??</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
