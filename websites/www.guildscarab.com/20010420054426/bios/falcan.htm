      <br>
      Falcan appears human, tall and well built. The only thing that doesn't fit
      in is his blue eyes and hair. This is said to be the result of a failed
      experiment long ago, but no one knows this for sure. He also radiates with
      a power that not many beings possess, and a strange Darkness always seem
      to hang over him. Not many things are known about his childhood, but a
      last interview is recorded in the great scroll's of Britian.<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><b><i>History</i></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <br>
      He was raised by foster parents on a small farm, and at an age where he
      was still young he started his adventure into the world. (Editor's note:
      There is no record of the names of these parents or what era it was.)<br>
      <br>
      The first record of him is when he became a member of a mercenary band
      called the &quot;Pendragons&quot; but after a fight against a Black Wizard
      (where the band was nearly wiped out), he went under the teachings of a
      wizard called Baragon. (Editor's note: There is no Record of a Wizard
      named Baragon in any of the Ancient scrolls of the Conclave, witch leads
      me to believe that either Falcan used this name to cover for self research
      or this Baragon was not part of the Conclave. If it was the case that he
      was not part of the Conclave, he held his identity very safe and was never
      prosecuted for self-research and heretic acts. There is also the
      possibility that Baragon was a Dragon in disguise, there are several
      records of Dragons teaching ancient magic to the First High members of the
      Conclave).<br>
      <br>
      A member that later on proved to be his long lost brother first enlisted
      Falcan into Scarab. He started out as a recruit but soon after became a
      full member of this glorious guild. After being a member of the guild for
      a long time he finally achieved the status of Inner Circle of Scarab. One
      of his greatest accomplishments was when he succeeded in becoming an
      Assistant Guildmaster a little while before the guild disbanded.<br>
      <br>
      After the guild was disbanded he left his family behind and was last seen
      looking for a notorious keep.<br>
      <br>
      Time passed and he came back, more powerful then ever. During one night he
      set up a house in the outer city and didn't leave it for anything other
      than gathering more books.<br>
      <br>
      The last 2 years he collected and read all magical books known to man (and
      more books unknown to man). His library is notorious for its collection of
      spells and secrets.<br>
      <br>
      The last that was seen of him in the world of Britian is a last interview
      made by a well-known scribe.<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><b><i>Current
      Status</i></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <b<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000066"><br>
      Falcan was in an unknown way transported to a different world, this world
      being the place that The Hawkes were sent to. He is currently active with
      Scarab but is rarely seen doing anything else then studying and fighting
      the Evil of the world.<br>
