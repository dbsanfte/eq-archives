      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It had been a long
      walk, but the dryad finally had come home. She stood in the center of her
      little grove of trees in Norrath's Greater Faydark and she breathed in the
      fresh scent of evergreens. From every branch and burrow, her forest
      companions had come to greet her. They loved and cherished the young dryad
      for the safety and love she gave them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry had lived
      here in Kelethin all her life. She had been born of the soul-union between
      a wood sprite and an evergreen tree, as most dryads are. Contrary to
      popular belief, dryads are not bound to their home-trees; her tree was the
      result of that merge between sprite and plant. It held the essence of her
      mother and father; if her mother's spirit were to break away from the
      tree, it would grow weaker or stronger depending on how far from its other
      half it was. But Kelagry was not a wood nymph. She was a dryad, born of
      the union of nymph and tree. As such, she was free of the restrictions the
      wood sprites had. And glad of it, for Kelagry loved to roam.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry had already
      adventured over all of Faydwer, though her years were few for one of her
      kind. She was always happy to return home to her grove, but her wandering
      feet inevitably took her off again, usually sooner than she'd planned.
      This time, her homecoming was already being tempered with a desire to see
      more than Faydwer. The animals around her seemed to know it too, for the
      sounds they made were the soothing &quot;please stay&quot; sounds they
      made whenever they knew she was going away.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Soon,&quot;
      Kelagry thought to herself. &quot;Not today but soon. I will leave here
      for a time, and see the rest of this world.&quot;</font></p>
      <div align="center">
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><b>*****</b></font>
      </div>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry peeked
      around the trunk of the large tree she had taken refuge behind, trying to
      determine whether or not it was safe to come out. There was a Dark Elf out
      there... and with it was a hideous beast, a monster with no head or feet,
      just two trunklike arms that looked strong enough to break her in half.
      She didn't care to challenge either Dark Elf or beastie. She knew the elf
      had seen her, but she stayed still, hoping he wouldn't come after her. She
      had heard terrible things about Dark Elves. Stories of murder, blood,
      living sacrifice....</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a nasty
      chuckle from in front of the tree. Kelagry heard a movement, and steeled
      herself for battle. There was no escaping it; she would have to fight this
      monster, to cleanse the world of his evil. She breathed deeply, counted to
      three, then jumped out from behind the tree and held her hands up to begin
      casting a spell...</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And her hands
      dropped almost as fast as she'd flung them up.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dark Elf was
      sitting, quite unceremoniously, on his bottom in the dewy grass. He had an
      open book in his lap and seemed quite intent on his reading. The beast
      with him floated calmly in the air by it's master's side.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry put her
      hands on her hips. She cleared her throat. The Dark Elf looked up from his
      reading and seemed almost to blush (was that a hint of red on his
      dark-skinned cheeks?) as he closed his book and tucked it back into his
      pack. He stood quickly and gave her a funny, awkward bow.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry cocked one
      eyebrow. &quot;Aren't you going to cast a spell or try to sacrifice
      me?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dark Elf, if
      anything, looked taken aback. &quot;Should I?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dryad almost
      chuckled at his bewildered expression. &quot;Isn't that what your kind
      does?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dark Elf
      guffawed. &quot;So... shouldn't you be off making love to a tree?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry scoffed.
      &quot;I'm a dryad, not a wood sprite.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh.&quot; He
      managed to convey that one syllable with a melody of meanings, the most
      prominent of which clearly hinted that he was feigning ignorance.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Who's your,
      uh, friend there?&quot; Kelagry asked, curiosity finally overcoming her.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other elf looked
      around. &quot;Oh, that? It's Jantik. It's an elemental. How about your...
      uh, friends?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry was
      momentarily confused, then looked around to realize that as usual some of
      the creatures of the Commonlands had come to visit her. &quot;They kind
      of... just come by to visit,&quot; she explained lamely.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was another
      moment of awkward silence, then the Dark Elf stuck out his hand. &quot;My
      name's Etsalon, of House Everhate.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry hesitated,
      then clasped hands with him. &quot;I'm Kelagry.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Are you new to
      the Commonlands?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dryad nodded.
      &quot;Yes, I arrived here from Faydwer a few days ago.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What do you do
      here?&quot; Etsalon asked.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry considered.
      &quot;I travel. Explore.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Well... maybe
      we can explore together. I don't know much about this place myself. I just
      got here from Nektulos Forest.&quot; Etsalon gestured toward a dark,
      ominous-looking forest on the horizon.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry considered,
      slowly feeling her doubts fade away. This Dark Elf didn't seem like such a
      horrible person. He seemed... almost like her, in some ways. She slowly
      smiled. &quot;I think that might be fun.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Etsalon smiled back.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"><b>***Kelagry's
      Years***</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry and the Dark
      Elf Etsalon soon grew to become closer than friends. Through trials,
      hardships, battles, and long journeys they bonded to each other as kindred
      souls. Kelagry and Etsalon both learned to drop their previous prejudices,
      and life held many more lessons for them as well. Their travels found them
      learning to accept more and more people, and Kelagry in particular loved
      learning about new races and the occupations of those people.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelagry's first true
      friend was the Shadow Knight Aerithanna. They met during a long battle
      against the aviak bird-people in the southern Plains of Karana. The battle
      was long and vicious, but in the end the side of Good triumphed.
      Aerithanna decided to travel along with Kelagry and Etsalon, and this
      became the beginning of a relationship most undescribable. The wood elf
      and the dark elf bonded as would two sisters, for all that their skins
      were two different colors and they came from completely different worlds.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along their travels
      they threesome also met with the Ogre brothers, Goliathh and Obadijah.
      Once again Kelagry's prejudices were turned around and upside down, for
      the two Ogres weren't evil at all. They were rather large and sometimes
      smelly, but underneath the ugly exterior their hearts were of gold. Three
      people turned into five people as they traveled from the southern plains
      to the maze of Cazic-Thule.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Cazic-Thule, the
      group turned to fight against the worshippers of that evil god, the
      lizardmen. And yet another great friend was made on that journey. This
      time, Kelagry found a friend in someone from her own homeland. He was an
      enchanter named Calanctus, a high elf from Kelethin's neighboring city,
      Felwithe. Calanctus quickly became friends with Aerithanna, Etsalon,
      Goliathh, and Obadijah as well, and though their paths didn't always cross
      they all kept in contact with one another.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After they had
      ravaged the lizardmen in Cazic-Thule, Kelagry and Etsalon learned of a
      place called the Dreadlands. They journeyed there and again bumped into
      the enchanter Calanctus and a friend of his named Qyen. Both the high
      elves belonged to a guild named &quot;Scarab,&quot; which seemed to be a
      guild made up all of close friends. By that time, Kelagry and Etsalon had
      joined their own guild, the Black Orchid Brigade. They'd met the Brigade
      during their times in southern Karana, and had made many friends there,
      most notably the cleric Korrupt, another cleric named Isildor, and a
      necromancer named Reklov. Kelagry had been given a position of officer in
      the Brigade, and although Calanctus had sometimes mentioned Scarab to
      Kelagry and Etsalon, they felt they belonged with their friends.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a short stay
      in the Dreadlands, Kelagry and Etsalon met their friends Aerithanna,
      Goliathh, and Obadijah in an evil dungeon called Lower Guk, where they
      campaigned against froglok ghouls. Yet again they bumped into Calanctus,
      and he became a regular companion.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a long stay
      in Lower Guk, during which the friends became less and less content with
      their current guild. They began to seek more options. Kelagry in
      particular felt the strain. Aerithanna and Etsalon pledged to follow her
      where she went, but she didn't want to abandon the Black Orchid Brigade.
      The decision lay upon her shoulders and it was a heavy burden. Soon the
      pressure became too much though, and inner-guild strife had torn the
      Brigade apart. With heavy heart, Kelagry announced her resignation from
      the Brigade and turned her eyes forward to the future.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still in Lower Guk,
      Kelagry, Etsalon, and Aerithanna were still close companions with
      Calanctus. With him, they met more and more Scarabs. They met the mage
      Cilien, and were re-acquainted with the cleric Qyen. They also met another
      enchanter by the name of Ainjel. More and more they spent time with the
      Scarabs, and they all learned to work together. Kelagry loved the
      adventure of the froglok dungeon. The more she spent time with the
      Scarabs, the more she felt comfortable with them.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Etsalon,
      Aerithanna, and Kelagry decided to try to become members of the guild
      they'd grown to be used to. They informed Calanctus of their choice, and
      he in turn let them know when and where the guild would be meeting, so
      that the threesome could get to know even more members.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along with them came
      Obadijah; though Goliathh had found his niche some time back the
      good-natured ogre was still hunting for the right group of people. They
      all journeyed with Calanctus to Trakanon's Teeth, where they met the
      ranger Drue, a bard named Melescant, a warrior named Mescalen, and were
      re-introduced to Cilien.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After several weeks,
      they were finally introduced to Gyst Starblaze, and from there on they
      became members of Scarab.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To this day Kelagry
      remains committed to her sister-in-spirit Aerithanna, the lover of her
      heart, Etsalon, and her dearest friends Calanctus, Obadijah, Goliathh, and
      Qyen. She has more friends than she can name, and considers the whole of
      Scarab to be her family. She hasn't longed for her grove in the Faydark
      for quite a while, and may never long for it again as long as her friends
      remain so, and her sister and love are by her side.</font></p>
