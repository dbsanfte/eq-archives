<br><br>
I come from a wealthy family in Qeynos, grew up playing with Antonious Bayle's children. My
family, the Ironforge family, is a proud family in Qeynos, the makers of most of the fine
weapons available in the shops there. In fact, the family is also in the jewel business, selling
precious jewels to all who can afford them. It was a lucrative business and my parents
provided well for me. I was an apprentice in the crafts of my family, learning the basics of
smithing, but it just never was a profession that suited me. 
<br><br>
I was lost, not knowing the plan that Bristlebane held for me, only knowing that my family's
business was not a business I cared to undertake. That all changed when I found the craft of
song. My parents immediately forbade me from dabbling in the the pleasures and powers of
music. When I did not stop, I was punished. This couldn't dissaude me either. After many
long years of argument and strife, my parents finally decided to give me their acceptance of
my chosen field at least that is what I they told me at the time.
<br><br>
I've since learned that my parents made a bad guess. They thought it was youthful rebellion, it
wasn't. They also thought I would outgrow my love for drums and lutes and singing and
travelling to dangerous places, I didn't. Finally, after many years of practice and love of my
craft, my parents decided I wouldn't outgrow my love. This was the day they called me into
the estate and took my name from me. My room was cleared and my possessions were
burned in the family forge. My parents sent me away and told me never to return unless I was
willing to forgo the ways of the bard. This is something I could not do at the time and
something that I do not believe I will ever be able to do.
<br><br>
I was banished from the estate with nowhere to go. I'd finally discovered Bristlebane's plan
for me, but now I had no family to share it with, no family to share my joy. The League of
Antonican Bards took me in and continued to teach me. They became my family and I
flourished. I learned new songs at astonishing speed and charmed many creatures both
beautiful and grotesque to my will. I was given the name Dirgemaker, with the promise that
one day, if I could prove myself, my name could be Dirgemaster, the name of the bard that
founded the League in the days before my grandfather was born. 
<br><br>
Proving myself became my obsession. I wanted to learn the ways of the master bard and
prove myself worthy of the name Dirgemaster, but the more obsessed I became the harder it
became to master new skills and the more I missed my old family. I went many years
saddened by my obsession and my lost family. 
<br><br>
My attitude changed when one day Bristlebane sent me a vision. He showed me that it was
possible to regain my family and gain the ways of the master bard. With renewed hope, I have
set out to earn the name Dirgemaster and to win my family back. I do not yet know what I
must do to win these rewards, as Bristlebane likes to keep many secrets, but I travel the
world searching and learning new things so that one day, Bristlebane's glory can light the path.
<br><br>
That path was further illuminated recently when my God sent me a vision of great grandeur.
His message was clear, his orders were beyond question. I was to find an honorable family,
one that showed valor and honor in its actions, one that was loyal to its members. I was told
to find that family and to ask to join its ranks. I was told to become a loyal member of that
family and to help whenever my song or blade was needed. After much searching, I have
found that family and it is called Scarab. 
<br><br>
I've done as my God has demanded and asked to join the family. Now I will set out to remain
loyal to the Scarab cause for the glory of Bristlebane, the glory of Ironforge, and the
continued glory of Scarab.
<br><br>
All hail Scarab!!
