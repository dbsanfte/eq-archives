Scarab is much more than a typical online gaming guild.  Scarab is a family of close friends, both online and in real-life, who uphold the values of honor, valor, and loyalty.  Our guild is a large family and we take great pride in the fact that every person in the guild really enjoys being a part of the family. At Scarab, we honestly believe that the person behind the screen is important. We try to look beyond the character, and just like any Pen and Paper gaming group, we are all friends. If you are looking for "phat lewt" or a guild to power-level you up to "uber" standards then you have come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a guild that stays in character constantly then you are also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a friendly family atmosphere where you will make real life friendships, read on.<BR>
<BR>
Scarab has two sets of laws which dictate our actions: the Code of Conduct and the Code of Chivalry.  These codes are the heart and soul of a Scarab member, and are to be followed at all times.<BR>

<FONT CLASS="head2">Justice</FONT> - In courageously seeking the truth and the path of righteousness, members must strive to escape their own personal gain and instead be just. Members who seek out justice without bending to temptation will be members of renown.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Sacrifice</FONT> - Generosity is a prime characteristic of a Scarab member. In order to counter the weakness of gluttony, members are to be as generous as their resources will allow. Generous members are better able to walk the fine line between mercy and cold justice. Giving, rather than taking, makes the name of Scarab renowned and respected.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Compassion</FONT> - The weak and innocent are our charges; their defense and safety are our duty. The might and wisdom of a Scarab member allow those not capable of their own wellbeing to stand boldly behind us. The meek may rest weary heads on the strength of our shoulders.<BR>
<BR>
This is the Scarab way!  To these ends we strive to serve!  Thanks to Lord Gregor who provided the model for this code.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>At Scarab, we strive to promote our Codes of Conduct and Chivalry throughout the lands of Norrath by deed and word.</LI>
<LI>Our members strive to uphold our values to create a world where evil fears the light of honor, loyalty, and valor.</LI>
<LI>Our members will strive to make Norrath a land where all can enjoy life.</LI>
<LI>Scarab is committed to ensuring that all of our members enjoy their guild. Guild activities will promote the family environment we have created.</LI>
<LI>Scarab was founded for our members to have fun with each other, and to have fun in the world in which we live.</LI>

<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Base of Operations</FONT> - Jade Tiger, North Freeport<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Race/Class Restrictions</FONT> - Scarab does not show prejudice to the player's right to choose a race and class of their character. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Roleplaying vs Powergaming</FONT> - Scarab would be considered a light role-playing guild. When at all possible, we ask that members try to be in character. Out-of-character comments are not prohibited by any means, nor do we expect people to be hard-core role-players all of the time. We do not, however, support powergaming. There are times when a touch of powergaming is acceptable, and even needed. However, Scarab members should not consider powergaming to be a top motivation for their character.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Member Integrity</FONT> - At no time will a member of Scarab exploit a bug or promote any other activity deemed illegal by Verant Interactive or the leadership of Scarab. Any member found to violate this bylaw will be immediately dismissed from the guild.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Multiple Guilds</FONT> - Scarab members may not have alternate characters in different guilds, with the exception of the Sunset Rage. The Sunset Rage is a roleplaying guild consisting entirely of alternate characters of Scarab members.  Scarab members may have more than one character on the Scarab guildstone.<BR>

Terms used below:<BR>
Scarab = Those currently a Scarab member.<BR>
Guest = Those personally invited by Scarab members to attend <BR>
Add-on = Those who ask to join us and are given permission to join on the condition that they understand and agree to follow our loot rules.<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>All Scarabs on the major raid should be in roleplaying mode to cut down on the number of Add-ons.</LI>
<LI>To help cut down on OOC and shout traffic, group members should pass messages through their group leader. Only group leaders should be sending tells to the raid leader.</LI>
<LI>If you are not in the pulling group, please do not hail creatures that aren't in the camp.</LI>
<LI>DO NOT ask for certain creatures to be pulled, even when joking. Pulling can be hairy at times and the last thing pullers need is someone pestering or criticizing them.</LI>
<LI>Corpse Recoveries take time. Please don't harass the folks doing this and PLEASE be patient.</LI>
<LI>If the raid leader shouts "camp," group leaders should repeat in groupsay. All group members should repeat in groupsay and camp. Each group leader should camp after they have confirmation from their group they are camping.</LI>
<LI>The raid leader and the group leaders should turn their /log on. This way if we have problems with people or a question about what happened there will be logs available. Please remember to turn logs back on after you camp.</LI>
<LI>Unless it is a joint raid, each group will be assigned a Scarab member to be the group leader to cut down on confusion and to make sure Guildsay information gets passed on.</LI>
<LI>Loot rules -
	<UL>
	<LI>a) Only the group leaders should check bodies for loot but they need to do ASAP after a kill. Check it even if another mob is there if possible, and put the word out to the raid leader and announce it in OOC. Make sure folks in your group know this.</LI>
	<LI>b) Zone lotto gems unless otherwise told so by the raid leader on all but special gems and $$$ items (i.e. Diamonds, Blue diamonds and the like). Do this by doing a /who then a /random 1 # that are in the zone. If that person has gotten a $$$ item that day, redo the roll. We reserve the right to give gems to clerics or other classes that spend $$$ on gems that benefit others to cover gem costs, including gating gems.</LI>
	<LI>c) Runes, words, pages etc go to the right class first.</LI>
	<LI>d) Class armor will be lottoed by class. All class members will be eligible for the first piece. If you have won a piece of armor already you should defer to the other scarabs and guests. You do not need to defer to add-ons before taking your second piece.</LI>
	<LI>e) On the coveted chest piece for each class, even if you have gotten a drop that day, Scarab and guests will be able to lotto for the item.
	<LI>f) Weapons may be rolled for even if you have received a piece of armor.</LI>
	<LI>g) We do observe the final piece rule. If you only need one piece before the raid starts and it drops you will get that item. If more than one person needs that same last piece they well lotto for it. This does not apply to add-ons.</LI>
	<LI>h) If no one is able to use the armor or weapon, we will log in those unable to play. Scarab as a guild reserves the right to include someone in a lotto who may have just signed off.</LI>
	<LI>i) If you have two characters eligible to receive loot, you should tell the raid leader which character you will be playing for that evening. (i.e. Gwern/Nilla should be announcing that he is there for ranger armor or enchanter armor and roll with the appropriate group. He then could sign on the other character if he/she wins the lotto BUT if on another character this has to be done FAST).</LI>
	<LI>j) Individual classes may exercise the right to handle their own personal lottos in different ways to accommodate situations but must insure fairness; ALL Scarab and personally invited folks must agree. Also insure that the Raid Leader is notified of the situation and knows all the details.</LI>
	<LI>k) On Guild hunts, items will always go to those that can make good use of the item. The item is to be considered guild property and is to be turned back into the guild to be handed out to those that still need and NOT sold/traded away. If more than one person can make use of it, a fair lotto will take place.</LI>
	</UL>

<LI>Final and MOST important rule: HAVE FUN!! </LI>

We support our members in their desire to play additional games, and therefore, Scarab provides secure message boards for other games for which there is a high interest level.
Scarab members in another Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game can petition the Inner Circle to become an officially sanctioned guild (in that game) by following these provisions.
<OL>
<LI>At least ten Scarab members have played the game for at least three months.</LI>
<LI>The in-game world would logically support a guild of Scarab's nature, beliefs and rules (i.e. no Unreal Tournament, Half-Life, etc.)</LI>
<LI>Follow the Code of Conduct and the Code of Chivalry stated in the Charter.</LI>
<LI>The players ask the Inner Circle to become official emissaries of Scarab to that game. </LI>
</OL>
If approved by the Inner Circle, the active players in that game would be welcome to:
<OL>
<LI>Use the moniker "Scarab" with their names.</LI>
<LI>Apply for official guild status with the new game, under the name Scarab.</LI>
<LI>Recruit members from the game to be part of Scarab. These players would be allowed to participate as a Scarab in ANY of our supported games.</LI>
<LI>Be allowed to select one of their numbers to serve on the Inner Circle as a representative with full voting privileges.</LI>
<LI>Create an organizational structure to facilitate in-game needs. Examples are positions that are not leadership oriented (i.e. not guild master). Acceptable positions are those needed to make game life easier such as controlling the flow of resources (i.e. armorer, treasurer, librarian, etc.)
Although Scarab does believe in supporting as many games as their player's desire, most resources will be focused on a single MMORPG. Currently, this is EverQuest. A 75% full membership vote is required to change this focus.</LI>
