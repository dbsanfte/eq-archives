                        it was time to make the trip from Qeynos
                        to Freeport and meet up with all the
                        SCARAB folks on the other half of the
                        world. I had tried before and always been
                        turned back. But now, armed with Selo's
                        Aceelerando and a hand drum the land was
                        a blur under my feet. I left Qeynos
                        behind and headed into the vast expanse
                        that is West Karana. This land is not so
                        dangerous as it is big, the rolling hills
                        go on and on hiding things like lions and
                        grizzly bears that seem especially strong
                        and aggressive. Finally, I was about to
                        enter land of the Griffons, North Karana.

                        face="Comic Sans MS">North Karana is the
                        most dangerous place I have yet seen in
                        my travels. It is not unusual to see a
                        family of Griffons flying over head and a
                        pride of lions searching the ground. I
                        steeled myself and set off singing and
                        playing my drum. My feet raced along the
                        road until it felt like I was flying and
                        soon the Great Wooden Bridge was in
                        sight. I breathed a sigh of relief as I
                        approached it and soon I was on the
                        bridge crossing the great river. I turned
                        to look back into the lands and saw a
                        trio of Griffons flying towards me. I
                        quickly spun around and crossed to the
                        other side into East Karana, praying the
                        rumors were true. What rumors you ask?
                        The ones that said that the Griffons
                        hated to fly over water and wouldn't
                        cross the river. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I
                        stumbled up the hill and glanced over my
                        shoulder. The Griffons were on the other
                        side screaming at me. I took this as a
                        sign that the fates were with me and I
                        would cross the mountains and make the
                        journey to Freeport. As I followed the
                        signs to Highpass Hold, I realized that
                        this land was completely deserted. I
                        wondered if some great creature patrolled
                        here consuming everything that lived or
                        perhaps there was some evil magic that
                        made this place death to all who would
                        live here. I decided to leave the
                        questions unanswered and set off up the
                        mountain pass. I climbed high into the
                        hills and saw many great carvings along
                        the way. They were enormous and
                        spectacular, but again there was no
                        creature around to claim the great work
                        as their own, only more mysteries. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">After
                        a long climb, I stood before the entrance
                        to Highpass Hold. I knew this place
                        harbored many strong and vile creatures
                        who would kill me just for spite, I also
                        knew that there were guards here to aid
                        me, if I could only find them. My heart
                        was pounding as I made my way in, I had
                        gotten some general directions from a
                        kind halfling and I followed them as best
                        I could. The path twisted and turned and
                        there were many dead ends, but soon I
                        found the guard house that sat in the
                        middle of the Hold. The guards were kind
                        and helpful and one led me most of the
                        rest of the way. From there it was easy
                        to follow the trail out of the hold and
                        into Kithicor Forest. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A
                        dark and foreboding place, the forest was
                        nonetheless a welcome sight. It might I
                        was over the mountains and I could use my
                        song and drum to best advantage. Soon I
                        saw a marker for Freeport and knew that I
                        would make it this time. The journey
                        ahead was still long and dangerous. I
                        stayed on the path and soon came to the
                        West Commonlands. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Everything
                        was new to me now, the creatures, the
                        plants, the trees, I was curious to
                        explore this place, but knew better than
                        to try. I was close to Freeport and
                        couldn't court disaster now. I tore
                        across the ground and soon came to the
                        East Commonlands and then West Freeport. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">What
                        an odd and ugly town at first glance.
                        This Freeport was vastly different than
                        my home and I was uneasy despite being
                        safely within the town walls. I wandered
                        lost, learning the ways of the town until
                        I found the Jade Panther. This looked
                        like a good place to get an ale and
                        recover from my journey. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I
                        opened the door to a loud and raucous
                        crowd and when I turned the corner I
                        discovered it to be a large group of
                        SCARAB members. I saw Ozwyn and Javanno
                        and Stubs and Grithen and many others and
                        they welcomed me with mead and hugs and
                        warm greetings. Freeport was looking up.
                        We drank many a mead and told many story
                        that night, a better welcome a Bard could
                        never hope for. </font></p>
