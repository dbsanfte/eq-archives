            <p><b>SCARAB NOTES:</b> 
            <p>Nothing overly, just to keep watching the Alliance boards for further 
              information.

            <p>This times <i>Inquiring Minds Want to Know</i> is with Scarab member 
              Horammer:
            <p><b>How did you come to join Scarab?</b><br>
              It's a lucky story for me. Just fate really, but I'm glad it happened 
              the way it did. One night, about 2 weeks after I started playing 
              EQ, my friends decided Fennin Ro server was too laggy and overpopulated. 
              We decided to switch. After some investigation, I told them Sol 
              Ro seemed to be a good server and we moved there. Many of you know 
              Diison Dawnrunner from Sol Ro EQ. I joined his guild, Norrath War 
              College, when Diison was level 12, lol. After Norrath War College 
              broke up in the fall of 1999, I looked for a new guild. I met Hawke, 
              Borgu, and Ozwyn in the Highkeep basement fighting goblins. They 
              seemed like nice people and they had a good website, so I pestered 
              them until they signed me up a couple months later, in December, 
              1999J.
            </font>
            <p><b>What game(s) did you play with the Scarab Guild? </b><br>
              As a member of SCARAB, I have played Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot, 
              and Anarchy Online. Maybe one or two others that aren't springing 
              to mind, but those are the major ones. Actually at Scarabfest last 
              year we also set up a LAN and played a lot of Jedi Knight II and...Stronghold 
              I think it was called, both of which were very cool. I was pretty 
              mean at JK2, but got my butt kicked at Stronghold.</p>
            <p><b>Which was your favorite game and why? </b><br>
              Despite all the various and sundry bitching that people direct at 
              Verant (and much of it deserved), the most impressive and groundbreaking 
              video game I've seen in the last 5 years has undoubtedly been Everquest. 
              Yes, it had and still has several problems, but overall it was an 
              AMAZING experience. Think about it for a minute. Consider the graphics, 
              the real time interaction with an ever more challenging fantasy 
              environment; fabulous group/class dynamics; chatting about all sorts 
              of stuff with your &quot;team&quot; that, in a good guild like SCARAB, 
              quickly became friends. </p>
            <p>Until boredom and frustration set in later in the upper levels, 
              EQ rocked SCARAB's world for many happy months of questing and slaying 
              of monsters and I and many others look back on those days of EQ 
              very fondly. The friendships gained I maintain today. Some of the 
              people I met from SCARAB have been some of the best people I have 
              met and I hang out with them in real life. </p>
            <p>Also, EQ lent itself quite naturally to providing opportunities 
              to foster SCARAB's principles of Honor, Valor, and Loyalty by rewarding 
              such with medals. The Inner Circle created a variety of medals that 
              were specifically designed to ensure good guild morale, smooth operation 
              of in game events and administrative tasks, and reward those showing 
              loyalty to the guild and willingness to sacrifice for the good of 
              the guild and one's guildmates. This continued SCARAB's tradition 
              of being a friendly and honorable organization, which helps ensures 
              that we have a good reputation among other gamers, and that members 
              of SCARAB are good people that treat each other well and act to 
              help the guild, which is of course, the whole point.</p>
            <p><b>In the game, what name and type of character do people know 
              you by?</b><br>
              In Everquest, my first serious character was named Dinaden Gahalantine, 
              which was a combination of the names of 2 Arthurian knights. He 
              was a bad ass warrior. He wore all blue armor when it was still 
              cool. Ahem. Anyway, after I leveled Dinaden to level 50, I started 
              playing a cleric character of a guildmate that had stopped playing. 
              That character's name was Horammer. I played him to level 52. Clerics 
              rule. That's just all there is to it. I loved playing Horammer, 
              but felt that I had accomplished all I had ever wanted to do or 
              could reasonably even dream of doing in EQ, so I moved on to DAOC. 
              In DAOC I played a thane named Dinaden up until level 20. Today, 
              I am mainly known as Horamir, as I have slightly amended the name 
              of my cleric ;) I do like cleric types in general. They are the 
              Kings in EQ. People want you in their groups, and you are useful 
              and fun to play. I've found that having a decent amount of HP and 
              AC is good, I'm way too much of a perfectionist to play an enchanter 
              or something that die at the drop of a hat, yet I gotta have some 
              spells too!</p>
            <p><b>Have you ever been to a ScarabFest?</b><br>
              Absolutely! After I made the big move out east to work for the government, 
              I have attended several Scarabfests in Atlanta and Washington, DC. 
              I expect to be at the next major Scarabfest in Atlanta over Memorial 
              Day weekend in May, 2003.</p>
            <p><b>What was the most fun moment you had at the ScarabFest?</b><br>
              There are two things that are great about Scarabfests. One was meeting 
              SCARABs that I knew well from EQ but had never met before. Jayfoot, 
              Miri, Dolvin and co. from Atlanta, and Sedrick and Hawke from California, 
              among others, were fun to meet and hang out with. </p>
            <p>Although we always play various computer games and chat incessently 
              about games, probably the most fun we have is actually non-game 
              stuff like all gathering together and sharing a good meal and just 
              hanging out and talking. We all went as a big group last year and 
              saw StarWars Episode 2 and had a good time at Dave and Busters (Dolvin 
              is a shareholder in D&amp;B's, natch&#133;)</p>
            <p>Also last year, Hawke, Mace, Dias and I I think it was all went 
              to a Sam's Club and bought a bunch of food (a bit TOO much, but 
              hey, better than not enough). We then had a couple great meals together 
              as a guild with about 16 people all eating together. One meal in 
              particular was really good-homemade lasangna made by Jay's wife 
              Celia. Everyone liked that and we were regaled by some great funny 
              stories from Hawke, Ozy, Ven and Ravenn about the early days of 
              the guild, and Hawke gave an excellent retelling of the Llama story 
              (and I could still see the terror in his eyes&#133;). <br>
              <br>
              This year, for SF we are planning to focus more on group outings 
              and meals, since LAN parties tend to burn us out and are generally 
              not as cool for a guild gathering as stuff we can't do when we aren't 
              together, if you follow me.</p>
            <p><b>What or Who got you interested in gaming?</b><br>
              Wow, long story. The short version: I remember being hooked on Pac 
              Man and Space Invaders from an early age on the Atari 2600. Later, 
              when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, my sister's boyfriend's brother 
              introduced me to Dungeons and Dragons. At that tender age, I didn't 
              really have any serious campaigns going on, but my friends and I 
              knew there was something very appealing about it and we stuck with 
              it. Around that same time, the original 8 bit Nintendo Intertainment 
              System was coming out and I was hooked forever on gaming. The Legend 
              of Zelda is still my all time favorite video game, period. It also 
              helped that my best friend that I have known for practically my 
              whole life (we were born the same week in the same hospital in Iowa 
              City) was a huge gaming nerd. Growing up in the 80's with my little 
              income from a paper route, I played just about every good computer 
              and Nintendo role playing game there was. This morphed into computer 
              gaming more in high school and college, as I was never as into the 
              systems that came after the Super Nintendo 16 bit system.</p>
            <p><b>What MMORG game do you see yourself playing next and why?</b><br>
              Well, obviously I suppose I and the guild will be giving the Star 
              Wars MMORPG a shot, although so far, beta chatter is not overly 
              optimistic. But I can't deny the appeal of slicing off heads with 
              a lightsaber or going &quot;growooror&quot; as a Wookie. I mean, 
              who can, really? Also, I have heard good things about Worlds of 
              Warcraft from Blizzard, but that one looks like it's a ways off. 
              Also, Horizons has put out some very cool looking looking ideas 
              for their game, but its been around a long time and they haven't 
              really produced all that much, so it isn't looking like Horizons 
              will actually be appearing anytime soon either.</p>
            <p><b>Favorite website(s)?</b><br>
              Any one that features Patricia Ford is pretty strong in my book. 
              Ok, seriously, I mainly go for the web comics such as PvP Online, 
              Bruno the Bandit, Penny Arcade, Nuklear Power 16-bit Theater, as 
              well as gaming and news sites, the occasional fantasy sports and 
              car website, and of course, the mighty SCARAB boards. The Excite.com 
              homepage is surprisingly good at organizing a customizable array 
              of news links for you and I generally set that as my homepage.</p>
            <p><b>Favorite hobby besides games?</b><br>
              Probably music and DVD movies. I've always been a musician, first 
              being forced to take piano lessons and hating that and not being 
              very good, but later being really unaccountably good on trombone 
              and loving that. These days I play electric guitar halfway decently 
              and am totally addicted to home theater DVD watchin. I like music 
              quite a bit, mainly hard rock, some heavy metal, as well as blues 
              and classical. <br>
              <br>
              <b>What do you do in real life?</b><br>
              I work for the United States Department of Education, Office of 
              Federal Student Aid as a Financial Aid Management Analyst. That 
              is a polite way of saying I am a bureaucrat ;) I am mainly a writer. 
              Our biggest annual project is the Student Financial Aid Handbook, 
              which explains to colleges nationwide how to correctly administer 
              the Federal Student Aid programs for college student financial assistance. 
              I write the Pell Grant section of the Handbook and occasionally 
              call up colleges and prod their lazy butts along on behalf of guildmates 
              who happen to be in college, heh.</p>
            <p>Also, my little team analyzes all sorts of FSA web sites and knowledge 
              management solutions that the Dept has going on and implements solutions 
              to enhance communication and operational fuctions. That is a fancy 
              way of saying we have license to look at all sorts of various screwed 
              up FSA (the Office of Federal Student Aid) things and try to improve 
              the way things work, a little bit at a time. Our other major function 
              is to research complex financial aid questions that our Customer 
              Service Call Center cannot answer. </p>
            <p>Oh, you meant what do I do that ISN'T completely boring? Well, 
              after work I go home and play with my kitty cat, Coal, and listen 
              to music and watch TV and play video games. Right now I'm plowing 
              through the first 3 seasons of the Sopranos on DVD. Highly recommended.</p>
            <p><b>What state do you live in?</b><br>
              I live in the &quot;commonwealth&quot; of Virginia. Don't ask me 
              why it is still called a commonwealth, that's probably a British 
              remnant, but it is one of the 50 states in the United States. It 
              is one of the two states that surround the Capital of the US, the 
              District of Columbia.</p>
            <p><b>Best thing to do in Virginia?</b><br>
              Since Virginia is one of the original 13 states and has had more 
              American Presidents born within its borders than any other state, 
              there are many interesting historic sites to see here, such as Monticello 
              and Mt Vernon (the homes of famous American Presidents Thomas Jefferson 
              and George Washington), as well as Colonial Williamsburg. The Fashion 
              Center at Pentagon City and Tyson's Corner Shopping Center are two 
              of the nicer shopping malls I've seen on the East Coast, and both 
              are within easy driving distance of Arlington. </p>
            <p>Other than that, Washington DC itself is nearby, and is famous 
              for its tourist appeal, featuring many museums, the US Capitol and 
              White House buildings, memorials, and excellent restaurants. Back 
              in Arlington, I live within a couple miles of the Pentagon. My mom 
              toured the Pentagon once, which she said was a very interesting 
              tour, but now after September 11th, they no longer give tours to 
              the public, so that is unfortunately out. And of course, the headquarters 
              of Mythic Entertainment, makers of Dark Age of Camelot is in Fairfax, 
              Virginia, approximately 10 miles from where I live&#133;</p>
            <p>Long Live SCARAB! <br>

              of Ykesha</a> going live. Froggies! Thats right, for all of you

              now be a <a href=http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_froglok.jsp target=froglok>froglok</a>. 
              My Dark Age playing hubby Torhald had his EQ account reinstated 
              by Verant, free for a month, and I got to peek at the models. Some 
              are very cool. My favorite being the male with black tips and a 
              red body, and the pale purple/teal females. 
            <p>Another game to keep a watch out for is <a href=http://www.warhammeronline.com/ target=WarHammer Online>WarHammer 
              Online</a>. To quote: "Warhammer Online is a new massively multiplayer 
              online computer game that allows players to take on the role of 
              outlaws and mercenary adventurers within a grim and gritty realisation 
              of Games Workshop's dark, gothic fantasy world." This is to be released 
              early 2004, so a bit of a wait yet. 
            <p>For the PVP lovers: check out a game called <a href=http://planetside.station.sony.com/faq.jsp target=PlanetSide>PlanetSide</a>. 
              This is a science fiction based game, rather than your usual fantasy. 
              The game is pure PVP, with 10 continents, from desert to tropical 
              settings. Some of the classes you can specialize in are: Sniper, 
              Driver, Pilot, Hacker, Medic, Heavy armor, Skirmisher, Scout, Commander, 
              Tactician, Engineer, and more.

            <p>I’d like to make a note in remembrance to the crew of flight STS-107, 
              who lost their lives on Saturday, February 1. The Columbia was NASA’s 
              oldest shuttle, logging 28 flights since 1981. Columbia was named 
              after the Boston, Massachusetts-based sloop that in 1792 maneuvered 
              past the dangerous sandbar at the mouth of a river extending more 
              than 1,000 miles/ through what is today southeast British Columbia, 
              Canada and the Washington-Oregon border. 
            <P>You can find complete coverage of the STS-107 at <a href=http://www.space.com/shuttlemissions/ target=Space.com>Space.com</a>,

              honor to visit space:</I>

            <P> Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth<BR>

              My eager craft through footless halls of air. <BR>
              Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<BR>
              I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace<BR>
              Where never lark, or even eagle flew<BR>

            <font class="text1"> <br>
            <p> <br>
            <p> Well since the latest talk is all about the upcoming Star Wars 
              Galaxies, I thought I'd share some general info. 
            <p>For those not in the know, SWG is another MMORG, created by Sony 
              Online with LucasArts. Set in time during the Galactic Civil War 
              (after the Deathstar destruction). You will be able to play a range 
              of classes, with <a href= http://www.swgcenter.com/info/species_list.asp  target=species>species</a> 
              such as: Bothan, Human, Trandoshan, Twi-lek, Zabrak, Mon Calamari, 
              Rodian, and your favorite I'm sure, Wookie. 
            <p>Just some questions asked on the <a href=http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/faq.jsp target=SWG FAQ's page>SWG 
              FAQ's page</a>. There are a ton here, make sure to check it out! 
            <p><B>Are there zones like in EQ?</B> 
            <p>Not exactly. The "zone model" doesn't really apply to Star Wars 
              Galaxies. We will have contained areas designed for exploration, 
              combat, player interaction, and travel, but the transitions between 
              these areas will be seamless and automatic. Players will feel like 
              they are adventuring across large sections of a planet, rather than 
              hopping from zone to zone. 
            <p><B>Will my character be based on a pre-defined archetype or "class?"</b> 
            <p>No. We want to give players the freedom to create characters with 
              a wide range of skills and abilities. Characters will be defined 
              primarily by the skills they possess and the types of activities 
              they pursue, and not by "classes." We're hoping this results in 
              thousands of unique characters with their own individual strengths. 
            <p><B>Will there be name constraints or professional titles?</b> 
            <p>We will enforce name constraints to help promote a Star Wars atmosphere. 
              You will not see LuukSkywalker777 running around. We do intend on 
              allowing players to attain professional titles based on the skills 
              they choose to focus on. 
            <p><b>Can I play a bounty hunter like Bossk or Boba Fett?</b> 
            <p>Yes, you can. There is a bounty hunter profession in the game, 
              which includes abilities such as tracking your targets. Bounty hunters 
              are not able to take down any target they wish; they are given a 
              list of possible targets and they sign up for a particular one at 
              the bounty hunter's guild. The more experienced you are as a bounty 
              hunter, the more difficult (and lucrative!) the targets offered 
              to you will be. Targets may include computer-controlled NPCs or 
              players who have incurred bounties because of breach of contract 
              or criminal actions 
            <p><b>Will I be able to play a Jedi?</b> 
            <p>Yes. Although the details are still being worked out, we are staying 
              true to the spirit of the films. Therefore, the journey to become 
              a Jedi will be difficult, but those players who choose this path 
              with find it very rewarding. 
            <p><B>Can I become Dark Jedi?</b> 
            <p>Yes. We're creating the Jedi system to take into account Dark Jedi. 
              However, be warned that the life of a Dark Jedi will be very perilous... 
            <p>And of course… <B>Can I be Luke Skywalker , Han Solo or Princess 
              Leia?</B> 
            <p>No. To preserve the continuity of the fiction, you will not be 
              able to play the key figures in the Star Wars universe. However, 
              you may cross paths with a few of them…
