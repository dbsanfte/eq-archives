        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A cold wind slowly
        blows through the icy mountains<br>
        The few trees gently creak, blown by harsh winds<br>
        The ice upon the frozen river crackles as the cool winds
        blow down its narrow channel.<br>
        Frozen snow blows across the empty planes hiding the sun
        from view and misting over the moon.<br>
        &nbsp;A flash of white atop a cliff, or was it just a
        trick of the fading light?<br>
        Darkness sets, enshrouding the white cliffs in the folds
        of night.<br>
        A light streaks across the darkness, blue eyes pierce the
        night.<br>
        Slowly the moon crests the frosty peaks, it&#146;s white
        light shimmering off the pure snow, reflecting it&#146;s
        glow into the skies.<br>
        Running quickly, a lone wolf, white as the snow slides
        through the shadows across the frozen tundra, head low to
        the ground.<br>
        The edge of a cliff ending in darkness&#133;.<br>
        The winds of the North howling across the night
        skies&#133;<br>
        Slowly the wolf raises it&#146;s head to the skies and
        looks upon the stars as they twist through they night in
        the endless dance of the Gods.<br>
        A freezing winds as the ice crackles and mist blows low
        across the land. single, long, mournful howl breaks the
        stillness of the frozen lands and freezing winds as the
        ice crackles and mist blows low across the land. <br>
        A second wolf joins in the mournful chorus from the
        north, a second from the West and a third the East, their
        songs of sadness making the world stand still, the stars
        in the sky slowing their dance.<br>
        Three wolves. Their songs of sadness twisting in the
        night to form a chorus of more beautiful and terrifying
        then that of the Angels above themselves.<br>
        Cool mist blows in from the east and the wolves vanish
        from sight, their song slowly dying to the coming dawn.<br>
        The shadows slowly fade back across the land as the
        darkness fades and the sun sparkles off the ice once
        more.</font></p>
