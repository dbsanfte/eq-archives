            <p><font class="text1"><b>Website updates</b> 
            <p><font class="text1">Well well well...It's been a busy month!<br> The project to get our website up-to-date is still going strong. Most things happen behind the scenes, though, so I am here to give you an update.<br><br>

            I believe we have eliminated all broken links now. If you see any, please <a href="mailto:ixchael@guildscarab.com">let me know</a>.<br>
            The following sections have been updated:
            <ul>
              <li>Roster</li>
              <li>Fallen Heroes</li>
              <li>Events</li>
              <li>Scenes</li>
              <li>Links</li>
            </ul>
            We will need your help to keep them updated, though. So please submit any news, screenshots, links, etc that you come across!<br><br>

            In addition to that, there has been a huge clean-up of all the files we have on the server. 
            Files have been moved around, some stuff have been deleted, etc. 
            If you miss anything, just let me know. We have backups of everything.<br><br>

            The plan is still to have all members be able to update some parts of the website in the future - and we are making progress in that area as well. I cannot give you an ETA yet, though.<br><br>

            That's it for now..

            <p><font class="text1"><b>Game News</b></p>
            <p><font class="text1">Well, due to some delay from confusion about who was doing what and if I was needed for updates, I’m finally getting around to actually doing one.<br></p>
            <hr>
            <p><font class="text1">I suppose the first thing I should mention are the games that are being tested. 
            Firstly is the <a href=http://www.istaria.com/><b>Horizons – Empire of Istaria</b></a> game, which quite a few Scarab members are beta testing. 
            The <a href=http://www.istaria.com/mod.php?mod=userpage&menu=19&page_id=9>races</a> you can be are: Dragon, Human, Elf, Dwarf, Fiend, Saris, Sslik, Gnome, or Half-Giant. 
            (So how many are going to rush out and make a dragon as soon as they can!?) As with most of the MMORGS being released tradeskills and housing also make an appearance, along with the usual bashing and killing your way across the land.<br><br>
            <a href=http://www.istaria.com/mod.php?mod=gallery&op=media&media_id=1&PHPSESSID=b73abb32f573aa12ebbb657dc706377e>Screenshot 1</a><br> 
            <a href=http://www.istaria.com/mod.php?mod=gallery&op=media&media_id=14>Screenshot 2</a><br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><font class="text1">
            I myself am alpha testing a game called <a href= http://www.mutablerealms.com/><b>Wish</b></a>. 
            I’ve only seen a small part of the game, but already have noticed things like the Dragon (see Screenshot 2) which flies over the town, setting it afire. 
            Their main headliner would have to be: <br>

            <blockquote>
            “<i>Unlike existing MMORPGs that confine players to a server with only a few hundred other players, Wish's highly-scalable server cluster infrastructure allows us to support tens of thousands of 
            simultaneous players in a single shared world.</i>“ 
            </blockquote>

            The <a href=http://www.mutablerealms.com/conceptart.php>races</a> you can be are: Humans, Orcs, Elves, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Cyclops. 
            Graphics look to be promising at the end phase, and the only thing I have a slight concern with is the movement factor, which you do by clicking on a spot with the mouse and then the character moves (unlike EQ or DAoC where your keyboard controls 360° movement.) 
            There will be PvP, housing, crafting, and of course PvE.<br><br>

            <hr>
            <p><font class="text1">
            Some new games to look at:
            <a href=http://www.darkfallonline.com/><b>Darkfall </b></a>… not too much information, and those graphics reminds me of the game Soul Caliber with big oversized armor. 
            The game seems more character (as in inner character) defining with things such as politics, tactics and kingdom building playing a role. 
            They even go so far as to put in player defined legal system. The game seems to center around 3 <a href=http://www.darkfallonline.com/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=album05>races</a>: 
            Humans, Orks (green of course), and Alfar (scrawny dark elf looking race). They run around on four large landmasses with smaller islands scattered about. <br>

            <blockquote>
            “<i>Darkfall supports actual ownership of resources and areas, making conquest and warfare an integrated part of the game.</i>”
            </blockquote>

            <a href=http://www.darkfallonline.com/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=screenshots&id=Darkfall06_03_03_5>Screenshot 1</a><br> 
            <a href=http://www.darkfallonline.com/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=screenshots&id=Darkfall06_03_03_3>Screenshot 2</a>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><font class="text1">
            And it seems that the Ultima line has not been finished with… presenting <a href=http://www.uxo.ea.com/><b>Ultima X</b></a>! 
            Information is rather scarce on the site, but one thing I picked up sounded interesting: 

            <blockquote>
            “<i>Players can choose their level of aggressiveness and a variety of combat styles, making the outcome of the battle as dependent on players' actions as on their characters' strength. 
            In addition to individual combat, player guilds can challenge other guilds to gladiator-style dueling in privately created zones.</i>”
            </blockquote>
 
            And if you want to become Uber (nothing like promoting power gamers!): <br>

            <blockquote>
            “<i>UXO offers a higher level of challenge, adventure and character customization through the Virtues, a popular component of the award-winning Ultima series. 
            In UXO, players can ascend their characters to become the Avatar once they have mastered all eight Virtues. 
            Mastery of a Virtue allows a player to unlock special powers and, eventually, create disciple characters. 
            Players can build a pantheon of heroic followers, all of whom can aid one main character in pursuit of attaining the status of Avatar.</i>”
            </blockquote>

            <p><font class="text1">
            Check out the <a href=http://www.blizzard.com/wow/>World of Warcraft</a> site for more news on things like they just added 3 new races (undead, gnomes, and trolls), and 3 new classes (paladins, priests and rogues).
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><font class="text1">
            Also an interesting tidbit for those looking forward to <a href=http://everquest2.station.sony.com/>Everquest 2</a> (like myself hehe):

            <blockquote>
            "<i>The way that encounters are handled though is very, very different in EQ2. Bill showed me a group of Dervishes and when conned I was surprised to see the whole group become highlighted, 
            Bill explained that the four mobs counted as one 'encounter', once a player, or group of players activated an encounter by attacking or being attacked, those mobs were 'locked' into that group of players. 
            Once this happens no one else can interfere with the encounter at all. Kill stealing it seems will be a thing of the past. 
            It also prevents excessive power leveling by friends as only those actually in the team can aid in any way.</i>" 
            </blockquote>

            <p><font class="text1"><i>Greetings to you all.</i><br><br>
            I will be taking over the job of Website Administrator from now on.<br>
            Don't worry, the take-over was not nearly as hostile as it could have been :)<br><br>
            
            As the web admin, I have one primary responsibility: to make this space useful.<br>
            For that to happen, I see two main areas to focus on..
            <b>
            <ul>
              <li>Regular updates</li>
              <li>New look and feel of the site</li>
            </ul>
            </b>
            I think most of you agree that the grey and blue of this site is getting old. It's time for a face lift :)<br><br>
            Regarding updates, I have big plans already in progress. It starts with more updates from our existing news reporters, and hopefully ends with everybody being able to contribute - regardless of their HTML skills.<br>
            Only time will tell if that can be accomplished, but I will certainly try my best to make it happen.<br><br>
            That's it for now! I thought you would enjoy a screenshot of our new guild hall in Star Wars: Galaxies so I have uploaded one. You can view it by clicking on the thumbnail to the left.<br><br>
