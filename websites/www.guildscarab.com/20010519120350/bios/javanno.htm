                    <p><font face="arial">In his early days he was a wanderer of sorts.  JaVanno traveled from town to
town frequenting the bars and finding ways to trick the locals into parting
with thier cash.  Luckily, he was tall and powerful and had a knack for not
only starting brawls at the local taverns, but also winning them.  And so,
in this way, he managed to beat out a living on the road. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="arial">One particular morning, with a bad-hangover and a broken nose, he limped
into Freeport.  He sidled up to the bar and introduced himself to the patron
as a "purveyor of tracts of land."  The patron, Puab Closk, a guildmaster of
the Order of the Monks, held no allusions about the nature of young JaVanno.
He indeed knew that JaVanno was a common thug at best.  Young JaVanno tried
in vain to sell Puab what he called "the best darn farm in Ro."  Amused yet
irritated, Puab gruffly dismissed JaVanno.
</font></p>
                    <p><font face="arial">Oh, good! An arrogant one! I enjoy beating the jum-jum out of the arrogant
ones!" bemused JaVanno.  Sadly, as JaVanno grabbed Puab's arm, he had no
idea of what he was in for...
</font></p>
                    <p><font face="arial">Later Puab, feeling guilty that perhaps he may have abused his power,
carried the limp body of JaVanno back to his guild house in West Freeport.
As he prayed to Queillos, he thought, "Well perhaps it is for the good.
After all, he did have a nice left hook.  Perhaps I shall train him and thus
make atonement to Queillos by giving this man an honest trade."
</font></p>

		

<p><font face="arial">JaVanno was not only impressed by skill with which Puab broke nearly every
bone in his body, but also with the care and interest which Puab took in
rehabilitating his broken limbs.  Therefore, he stayed at the guild house in
order to learn the ways and values of the Monk and devote himself to
Queillos.  One day, Puab approached him and said, "JaVanno, your time has
come and I can teach you no longer...you must venture out into the world and
bring glory upon our order!"  So young JaVanno opened the door and found the
nearest road.......

                               Where many paths and errands meet.<br>
                               And whither then? I cannot say.<br><br>
