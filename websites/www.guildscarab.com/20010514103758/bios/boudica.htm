Four                       swords emanating from a four loop Celtic ring pattern. About                       3 inches in diameter, green. <br>                      <br>                      Boudica's Mother was a fighter in the Free Blades Militia,                       a noted mercenary unit which was renown for only taking                       the "right" side of a conflict, and maintaining a number                       of lucrative contracts with the elven nations in surpressing                       orcish activity. It was during a extended posting at a border                       city where her mother, (Govinnis Betraine) and her father,                       (Tarissyn Moonshadow) an elven wizard, met. <br>                      <br>                      She was never quite comfortable in the world of either her                       mother or father. While she was a skilled fighter, the arts                       of combat just did not make her feel complete, neither did                       her father's study of magic. Added to this the slight, but                       nevertheless present distance from the rest of elven society,                       and it was inevitable she would be drawn away from her society.                       <br>                      <br>                      She had found what appeared to be a odd park inside the                       city walls. It was here she met one of the major influences                       in her life, the Druid Falysyrin. She recognized Boudica's                       affinity with the forest, but also recognized her family.                       Instead of trying to pull Boudica away from her family's                       interest, Falysyrin used the druid teachings in conjunction                       with her family's interest to teach her the foundations                       of the Ranger way. <br>                      <br>                      However, Boudica's mother had some concerns with this path.                       Rangers were far too solitary of souls for her approval,                       and after no small amount of pressure, Boudica joined her                       Mother's old Mercenary unit. She served in the Free Blade                       League for three years, and although she quickly gained                       a reputation as a skilled warrior, she never felt at ease                       with them. <br>                      <br>                      Boudica's had managed to finally become somewhat comfortable                       with Wyvern company, when that unit began involved in what                       became the Siege of Anarlyn Fortress. Anarlyn Fortress is                       a border outpost used to contain northeastern orc tribe                       of the elven lands. It was constructed by dwarven engineers,                       funded with elven gold, and manned by human soldiers. During                       the seven month siege, Wyvern, Unicorn and Griffin companies                       were stationed at the fortress. They were subjected to starvation                       due to a corrupt supply officer, and constant attacks and                       probing actions. After the final orkish assault no more                       than a score of soldiers from all three companies survived.                       <br>                      <br>                      She requested and was granted a early release from the Free                       Blades in recognition for her valor and heroic acts during                       the siege. She wandered for many moths, sometimes working                       with small units of warriors and adventurers to purge local                       threats, but more often hunting evil alone. For although                       she preferred the comraderie of the adventurers who were                       akin to families, she did not like the chaotic, uneven organization.                       <br>                      <br>                      After many adventures of her own, she encountered a small                       party of adventurers who seemed different. It was Helios                       and Gloin, for manay months the three wandered, righting                       wrongs and slaying evil. Eventually, they Encountered Elbereth                       and Dias. And while they were quite successful, and famous                       in their own right, they had collectively agreed that something                       more was needed. Their indecision was brought to the point                       by the tragic and heroic death of the noble Helios in a                       pitched battle against a savage band of highwaymen. The                       group was struck deeply by this loss, and they nearlty broke                       up, uncertain as to their willingness to go on. <br>                      <br>                      It was at this critical time that Elbereth encountered Lord                       and Lady Hawke, who were in the beginnings of forming Scarab.                       He introduced Boudica and the rest of that party into Scarab.                       The founding members Of Scarab had been looking for an established                       group of honorable, valorous adventurers to constitute the                       core of an effective fighting force. From this group, many                       Scarab legends arose.<br>                      <br>                      Boudica's service as a member of Scarab is one of the longest                       in the guild. She has served as Assistant Guildmaster, Master                       of Provisions, member of the Inner circle, and has won numerous                       awards and accolades. Her acts of personal valor and sacrifice                       for others are legendary within the guild and among guild                       allies. Her sacrifice to save Lord Hawke's life against                       a troll during the early days of the guild was one of the                       inspirations for the Torch of Loyalty and the Scarab medal                       of honor. </font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
