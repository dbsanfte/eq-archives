"That's a nasty bump!"  This is my first memory,spoken by a human Paladin;
Sir Peabodi LeSinclaire.  He discovered my unconscious body while wandering
the Butcherblock mountains. I had no recolection of who I was, what I was
doing or what happened to me!  Sir Peabodi gave me a "temporary" name;
SEDRICK, then took me to the Paladin guild of Kaladim.  He asked them to
care for me and help me find my past, promising to return he continued on
his travels of Norath.<br><br>
After a couple of years with the Dwarven Paldins, learning the ways of good
and honor, I still had no idea of true past. And decided to head off on my
own holy quest; to rid the world of evil and find my family.  On reaching
Freeport city, I found my old friend Sir Peabodi, who took it upon himself
to continue my training in the ways of the noble Paladin.  Years of training
and hunting led many on many adventures and to make several friends, but
none so great as when Peabodi introduced me to his friends in the Guild
Scarab.  These adventurers took me into their fold with open arms, finally
with a sense of family I can continue with the life I have built.  With
honor I would die to save a member of my new family....</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
