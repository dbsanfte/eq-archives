Here I will tell you of me beginnings in this world.  Let it be known that I
know not the identity of me father, and me poor mother is long dead.  What I
do be knowing of me younger years and history is not but hearsay, as it was
passed to me by the man that took me in as his own.  Though I do believe his
work...Jinkus has not betrayed me trust in me lifetime.<br><br>

I have been told that me mother was a fine warrior.  She was greatly
respected amongst me people for her many daring and heroic deeds.  Once cold
morning me mother set out with two companions to hunt mammoths.  Their
purpose was to be getting the village extra meat fer the winter that was
expected to begin any day.<br><br>
Nighttime fell and me mother and companions had yet to return.  The next
morning a search party was sent out.  They found me mother barely alive with
the help of a tamed wolf named Snowflake.  With the aid of the healing
powers of the Shamans of Halas, she survived.  However, not all was well,
she never regained her health as it once was.<br><br>

She spoke of a mage they had stumbled upon near the frozen river.  he was
apparently in cohorts with the vile icegoblins and orcs of the region.  Upon
seein me mother and her party they attacked.  Gilian dropped his weapons and
fled like the coward he is.  My people hunt fer this wretched excuse of a
Barbarian to this day.  Ivan stood and fought with everything he had, but
was quickly overran by the foul beasts.  Me mother was beaten down by the
wizards powerful and evil magic's.  He then had his way with her, and left
her fer dead.  By a stroke of luck, or by the will of the gods, the beasts
of the tundra didn't come upon her before she was found by me people.<br><br>

Thus, I was born into this world.  Sadly me mother died within a couple of
days of me birth.  She died with me in her arms I am told, and the last word
to escape her lips was Luman.  It's not known what she was attempting to
say, but it was decided that Luman would be my name.  Although somewhat of a
peculiar name amongst me people, I am fine by it.  Perhaps I will learn the
true meaning of me mothers last word in time.  Me family name of Icehawk I
took upon coming of age to honor me father's father.  I am the last of that
line.<br><br>

As a youngster I aspired to be a great warrior as me mother once was, but me
people are a superstitious of many things, and I quickly found that I was
one of em.  The warriors were hesitant to allow me amongst them, and in the
end the leaders outright refused me.<br><br>

Finally I turned to me adopted father Jinkus fer guidance.  He told me that
this had been foreseen, and the Tribunal had already decided to take me in
as one their own.<br><br>

Thus I became a shaman of me people.  For many years me people looked at me
with suspicion or indifferently at best.  However, over time and proving
meself by performing deeds in the interest of all, I have earned the
respect, friendship, and trust of most.<br><br>

A day came when me father approached me.  He told me that it was time for me
to venture out into the world as all shamans of our people must.  I was to
gain knowledge and wisdom in my travels, and bring this back to me guild to
contribute to me people.<br><br>

Thus I set out.  I traveled from one end of the world to the next.  I was
surprised to find smatterings of me people all over.   Yet try as I might, I
couldn't find me place amongst them.  That is until I me another shaman of
my people, named Lilla, on her sojourn.<br><br>

The kindness she extended me was beyond that which I had encountered in me
previous travels.  She spoke of a great family she had become a part of
called SCARAB.  I found that this SCARAB was a group of people from all
walks of life that had come together to achieve a common goal, but more
importantly together in the name of friendship.<br><br>

Right away I knew that at last I had found me place in the world.  Now I
proudly serve SCARAB.  Not as a servant out of obligation, but as a friend
amongst friends, and a brother amongst brothers and sisters.<br><br>

Hail SCARAB!<br><br>
