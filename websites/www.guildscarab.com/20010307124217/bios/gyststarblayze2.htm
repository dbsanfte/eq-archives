I graduated from the Junior Academy and started my training by becoming an apprentice to the great magician Jrool Levonka.  I served him with dedication and thoroughness, and it wasn't long before I became immersed in my work.  Although the work I did was much harder than what I was used to, I enjoyed every minute of it.<BR><BR>
Master Jrool was an old, wise, and energetic elf - not to mention an excellent teacher.  He had a very unique way of teaching me, and I learned very quickly from him.  He'd often present me with an unusual task or problem, and tell me to solve it.  The task would seem unrelated at first, but it wasn't long before I learned to recognize the wisdom in his assignments.  I learned quickly and well under his guidance, and it wasn't long before I had the esteemed privilege to cast my first true spell.<BR><BR>
I remember the day vividly.  The air was cool and crisp from the rain the night before.  When I entered Master Jrool's chamber, he was sitting at his desk with an odd smile on his face.<BR><BR>
"Congratulations," he said.  "Today is going to be a first step into a much bigger world for you."  He slid a smooth piece of paper across his desk toward me and beckoned me to read it.  It was a scroll - my first spell.<BR><BR>
"What does it do?" I asked.<BR><BR>
"You tell me," was his reply.  "It doesn't matter what the spell is supposed to do.  Your concentration and state of mind - not the spell itself - is the only thing that will determine if you are successful.  Don't think about creating the desired result.  Just concentrate on casting.  Clear your mind of all your thoughts.  Concentrate on the words."  He then stood up and walked out of the room, leaving me alone with the scroll.<BR><BR>
I quickly got to work.  I sat down in my favorite corner where the clear sunlight shone through the window and I began skimming over the beautifully scribed words.  It was written in an Elvish tongue (even though I was already studying other languages to some degree) and I had no trouble reading it.  I pulled out my spellbook which had never before been used, opened it to the first page, and began carefully scribing the scroll into it.  As I tediously and meticulously wrote the words down, my mind drifted and I began to wonder what this spell would do.  I had to catch myself several times and return my concentration to the scribing.  Even though I understood the words, I could not make sense of the scroll, so I had no idea what would result.  I had the impression that the spell was a Conjuration, but I could not be sure.<BR><BR>
Finally, I finished scribing the spell, and I began my first attempt to cast it.  I cleared my mind of all other thoughts and began reading the words off the page.  As I concentrated on each word, and as each word escaped my lips, I could feel something - some power - flow through me.  As I approached the end of the scroll, I could feel a definite tingle in my fingers.  After I pronounced the last word… nothing happened.<BR><BR>
I was heartbroken.  I knew I must have done something wrong.  I spent the next hour studying the scroll and my spellbook to make sure I'd scribed it correctly.  I could find no errors.  I came to the only conclusion left: I must have done it too slowly.  I knew that if I wanted to complete the casting, I'd have to memorize the entire scroll.  So, I set to work immediately and worked long into the night to memorize the spell.<BR><BR>
The next day, after a very rewarding sleep, I resumed my attempt.  Once the spell was memorized, I began reciting the words.  I felt a mystic and wondrous powers surge through me.  I could not tell where the power came from.  It seemed to come from all around me, as well as within me.  As I approached the end of the chant, my hands were tingling like they were on fire.  Finally, as I said the last word, green light began pouring out of my fingers and swirled around me.  Flashes of light also leapt from the ground beneath my feet and went soaring toward the sky.  I spun around in amazement and watched the lights dance around me.  When the lights faded away, I looked back down into my hand.  I was holding something - I had performed a conjuration!  The object was black, crumbly, and it smelt like the back room of a Barbarian fishing hut.<BR><BR>
"What is THIS?" I exclaimed.<BR><BR>
"It's supposed to be bread," a voice said.  I looked around, and suddenly bubbles started swirling out of the air and Master Jrool appeared.  "You did better than most, you know.  Most of my students have come up with something much more similar to manure on their first attempt.  Still, I don't recommend eating that thing in your hand.  You still need much practice."<BR><BR>
Over the next few days I practiced my spell diligently.  Master Jrool taught me how to pronounce several key phrases more correctly.  With each cast, I'd come up with something slightly different, but each result looked a little bit more like bread.<BR><BR>
Eventually, I conjured a complete loaf of bread.  It was still black, but it smelled like bread to me, so I took my first bite into my creation.  It took several bottles of Elven Wine to completely rise the vile taste from my mouth.  Master Jrool could only laugh, although I failed to see what was so funny.<BR><BR>
Within about a week, I was summoning loaves of bread - edible versions this time - as often as I could.  I'd sit on the bridge to Felwithe and offer my bread to passing travelers.  Of course, I'd have to warn them that it's an acquired taste and the bread tended to spoil when you camp, but I still couldn't resist showing off my new spell.  I ate my own summoned food (and water when I learned to conjure it) as often as I could.  I grew to like the taste of my black bread, and still do to this day.<BR><BR>
The ability to create my own food came in handy (although I never expected it) shortly afterward when a life-changing event occurred to me one day…<BR><BR>
