No one is quite sure where Biggle originated, although he is rather quick to
tell you one of three interesting stories...none of
which can be proven as true or untrue. One thing is for certain though, none
of them are the same and they all conflict. In the
past few decades it has been confirmed he did in fact sucessfully complete a
strict rehabilitation course at the Erudian Home
For the Mentally Insane...Although their standards and procedures are
currently under reveiw.

Biggle's lil' Story:</u></b></font><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
         Back in the day...before the Monkies (Humans) infested our great
land their was a time of great suffering and pain. The
Inkies (Drow) were at war with the Snobs (High Elves) and the youthful Dirt
Faeries (Wood Elves) were runnin amok in chaos
and disorder. Many years would come ta pass before the naked apes would
spread their influence on the battle fields..for they
like the stupid Big Dum-Dum Stoopid Heads (Orges and Trolls) were mere pups.
We being the intelligent folk we were,
decided to not interevene...The Stumps (Dwarves) and Hamsters (Hobbits
a.k.a. Halflings) were a wild bunch though...esp. the

Dwarven warriors...Oh what a sight they were...although mind yee they were
still Demi-Gnomes but there's someting about
watching a fellow "shorty" lobbing off kneecaps that just makes ya want to
cheer!  And dem furry-foots are even better at
poking the tall ones ones in the behind den we are!<br><br>
         Well over the years the battles raged on...The High Elves were
simply not numerous enough to deal with the onslaught of
the Inkies...something to do with some odd mating ritual i believe i was
told once...and although the dwarves were more then
happy to assist in lobbing off knee-caps the Halflings were another story.
While some of them were hold and righteous, others
were evil and deceitful...so needless to say they were a bit
unreliable...and as i stated before we gnomes just didn't care. Sure
there were the powerful mercenaries, but fer every one of them was an
equally powerful and currupt Necromancer Gnome.
And i tell ya they fought with much more heart then the mercenaries did that
i tell ya. In this time of Dismay the Orges and Trolls

were growing in power. The Orges who had once been a great kingdom were now
stupider then ever. But they had
power..and although they had many struggles within their society they were
still able to organize not only themselves but the
equally stupid Trolls...Well it was not pretty. The big fat uglies marched
on towards battle...but what they did not relize was at
dis time those naked apes in freeport had come to power. Living that close
to the evil of Innoruuk which was festering in  the
Nektulos Forest had hardened them...and they grew stronger and stronger from
the infux of monkies from the Qeynos area.
And together with the Barbarians....oh what a sight indeed!! They crushed
the Big Dum-Dum Stoopid's quickly. What they did
not relize though was that the Orges and Trolls had created a diversion, and
that their main forces were marching on Freeport
itself with the Inkies!!!! And even worse currupt Necros and Shadow Knights
exsisted within their very ranks!!! Oh the horrors

that played out that day were not pretty indeed...it was quite nasty.<br><br>
         The battle raged on at the front gates of Freeport...from every
possible angle where the sounds of screams, battle-cries,
and gushy thuds as limbs flew about. The monkies got back to defend their
town just in time, and fer a breif moment it looked
as though they might just overcome. Now keep in mind me's seen lots o'
horrible things...but this by far was the worst...up from
the crumbling groud rose a giant disfigured beast. Ears not quite and long
and beautiful as me own...but rather lanky and
twisted. The foul beast must have stood 60 stores high! And when he let out
his cackle i knew it could only be one person...or
God rather. Yells and cheers arose from the battle feild as the inkies
chanted his name...All at once like a bunch of drones his
name sung out "Innoruuk!!!, Innoruukk!!!" and in an instant me blood
chilled. With the wave of his hand monkies fell left and
right...as he sucked their life force chuckling and laughing. At his feet
the swarm of drow gathered together...feeding off his
essence, and regaining their powers. It trully was a sad sight, me may not
be very fond of the naked apes..but most of them are
an honorable bunch..and i could not stand to watch them slain in such a
mannor.<br><br>
         As the battle raged on i took a particular interest in a near-by
mountain...it appeared to shift and move...methinks to
meself this cannot be good...and the earth began to quake...Up from what
just was a mountain appeared Cazic Thule
himself...the God of war!!! He appeared enraged...for his Orges were being
misled by these evil beings...yet at the same time
his excitement got to him, in a fit of rage he began slicing down mortals
left and right...there went an Orge, there went a Human,
there went an Inkie...he didn't seem to care, and to tell you the truth
neither did i, population control if ya ask me hehe. Well
anyhow Innoruuk did not like this much...methinks the foul beast is a bit of
a control freak, and he concentrated his efforts on
Cazic...now don't get me wrong, ol' Cazic is a force to be reckoned
with...but a great many of his powers were striped from
him when he abused them..and he was no match for Innoruuk's might. Cazic
fell to his knees but before Innoruuk could drain
his lifeforce into himself Cazic chopped his own head off! To the ground it
fell...crushed at least 40 mortals and made a real
neat sound as the groud shook!. Innoruuk turned in a crazed look towards the
City of Freeport..and his eyes lit up then faded
just as quickly...for out of the corner of his eyes stood a tranquil being,
maybe half his size with a peaceful little smile on his
peaceful little face. "Who are you!!!" commanded Innoruuk, his eyes aflare
and spittle flying from his mouth. "I am Rocet Nife
and i have come to destroy you".  Innoruuk laughed with glee, "Ahh yes i
know of you, but you cannot match my might and i
will consume your soul!"  Rocet smiled...gotta admire that "little" guy he
must have a bit o' Gnome in him. He spoke very softly
...so calmly that for a minute all fighting ceased...as if he very word were
so sacred nobody...not even the Big Smelly
Dum-Dum Stoopids would dare raise a sword. And he said to "Innoruuk, no i
cannot defeat you, and i dare not try...i said i
was here to destroy you" Innoruuk again laughed and battle raged on, Rocet
winked and from the sky dropped another
mountain of a God...methinks his name was Mr. Marr or something like that.
Made all the monkies rather happy i must say.
Well this Mr. Marr charged right at Innoruuk...ignoring all the little
inkies trying to poke and tickle him with thier weapons and
spells. He hacked away at Innoruuk..with speed and skill unmatched. And
Innoruuk sucked away at his lifeforce mending his
wounds as fast as that Mr. Marr fellow could make em...It did seem as though
Innoruuk had the upper hand. But he fergot one
thing....That silly little God with the silly little smile on his face. He
began to dance around in glee healing Mr. Marr...Now this
certainly would have been the end of Innoruuk...but along come another
God!!!!  I do believe i knew this one, his name was
fizzlethrope or something along those lines. God of theives methinks...but
anyhow this little weasel runs up and starts jabbing at
Rocet Nife! Then Innoruuk steps back, casts a powerful spell..and up pops
the undead corpse of the God Cazic Thule!<br><br>
           At this point me starts to get very worried. What does this
mean?? What will become of the rest of Norrath if this foul
beast wins. Well ya know great minds think alike...and from the docks of
East Freeport i heard a sound i will never forget....a
horde of drunken Dwarfs singing war songs and clanging their weapons...My
what a sight it was seeing those wild lil' boogers
charge into battle...axes swinging and beards a wagging. Like a Hill Giant
on a bad day they plowed through the crowd of
Inkies headed straight for Innoruuk...He had depleted much of his powers on
that Mr. Marr fellow who continued to hack
away at him dispite his many wounds. And if that wasn't enough all around
the battlefield appeared thousands of elves...High
Elves came from nowhere...as if some magical force had just teleported them
in..and i'll be darned if out from the near-by trees
and bushes popped a herd of Wood Elves. The battle that ensued was quite
awesome...and every now and then i'd notice
Gnome or two run by giggling and pouncing. Dwarven clerics took Rocet's
place healing Mr. Marr  as he was busy with that
pesky King of Theives. The Elves quickly dispatch Cazic's undead corpse and
cheered victory...but it was all too soon. The
Inkies had been reduced to half their numbers...but a great many Powerful
Necromancers remained...as did many Monkies and
Gnomes who were loyal to Innoruuk. Up from the groud sprang fallen warriors
from both sides, and their skellital remains
cackled much like the evil laugh of Innoruuk himself. A war that should have
been nearly over....had just begun.<br><br>
             It was then i noticed a group of well organized
peoples...surrounding a Monkey and a stubby Dwarf...looked like a
couple, and rather odd one me thought to meself. In their eyes burned a fire
that could not be...umm put out. yeah that's it.
Well this group of fine Warriors and Mages seemed to work together so
well...and that interesting Dwarf was killing undead left
and right...at will it seemed. The Monkey didn't appear as wise as his
Dwarven mate...and rushed into battle like a
madman..kinda admirable for a naked ape methinks. Well what this noble
Paladin lacked in Wisdom he more then made up for
in strength...With this special sword he seemed to have a connection with he
tore through Inkies like butter...it was rather
amusing...and all around him his guild fought with the same honor and valor
that he did. Some of them fell in battle..which was
understandable considering the odds...but the sheer force of this fighting
machine was amazing. I even noticed a handsome
Gnome or two among their ranks helping out their much less able Demi-Gnome
friends...For we all know the backbone of any
good fighting machine is the Gnomes that hold it all together.<br><br>
              But anyhow enough about them, lets focus on me. Now as i
stated before it had turned out to be quite a battle..the
Gods and mortals battled on...and once again Evil seemed to take the upper
hand...Soon as the King of Theives had slain
Rocet, Innoruuk drained his lifeforce..killing his ally to replenish his
strength. He trully is an evil little weasel methinks...and
although at this point i had been a mere spectator i felt the time for
action was upon us. I quitely sat down and began to
meditate while the battle raged on. All around me i heard the sound of
weapons clanging and flesh being torn..and the
occasional dishonorable cry of pain as fallen warriors hit the ground. I
stood up furious...consumed by the hate which Innoruuk
was feeding off of on the battle feild. But i gathered me wits...after all i
am a Gnome hehe. I focused all my energy on Innoruuk
and with what almost killed me sent a surge of magic at him...which lowered
his naturall magical resists. He screamed in pain
and confusion...looked around, and his eyes found me. I must say i was a tad
bit frightened...i may be a Gnome but i can still
die. With what was left of my powers i sent a bolt of energy at him which
knocked him off his feet! That Mr. Marr fellow
swung his mighty sword down and lobbed off Innoruuk's head...Then he picked
up Rocet's fallen corpse and as quickly as he
had appeared away he vanished. The Inkies were terrified...but still they
fought on. Luckily for everyone else there...i took out
at least half of the unclean heathens. And i was quite the Hero. Everyone
cheered my name and boosted me on their shoulders
and really made much more of a fuss then i deserved...granted i single
handedly defeated Innoruuk and destroyed his army of
Inkies, but it was nothing no other good Gnome would have done ya know.  The
fine guild which had battled so
bravely..known as Scarab...promptly invited me to join their
ranks.....That's my story and i'm sticking to it  =)<br><br>

Biggle's lil' Story-Conclusion:</u></b></font><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Reports have it that on the day of this great battle Biggle was quietly
resting  at home, and he in fact met Scarab one day while
attempting to pick LauChann's pockets. To this day he denies such
accusations as "hogwash".
