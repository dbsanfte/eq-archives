I have written this in My perspective in hope that the readers will get a clear view of that happened that night.
<br><br>

I walk down the dark street, towards the dark-blue house at the end of it.  I have heard so much about this house and its owner, but have yet to see him in public.  The street grows darker but somehow warmer...strange on this cold winter night. 
<br><br>
The house is said to be of magical origin, but no one has ever proved that.  From the outside it looks like a normal two-storied stonehouse, made by blue polished rock...a strange rock that I have never seen before, and it feels like it is radiating and watching me. 
<br><br>
I walk through the small grove and notice that there is a myriad of summer and winter flowers growing there.  I stop to see them, they are all blooming at the moment.  "Winter and summer?"  The cold winter breeze in the city somehow stops when it reaches the grove, a small wind pushes the treetops a little but no flower is moving. 
<br><br>
I stop in front of the black-toned door.  There are carvings of dragons flying through the air, a beautifully made carving.  It takes some time before the door opens to greet me welcome, a dancing light flows out through the door and a strongly built, red haired, and red eyed individual stands before me in the doorway. 
<br><br>
I cannot seem to remember such a face, for some reason the memory of his face slips my mind each time I don't look at it. "The master is expecting you," he says with patronizing voice. 
<br><br>
He shows me inside, taking my coat.  As I walk inside the house, I feel like I am entering a castle.  The lounge is huge, about 30 feet to the ceiling.  A leaved door is situated at the rear end of the hall right between two stairs leading to the second floor.  "This place must be enchanted...." I think to myself. 
<br><br>
"Follow me," again with this patronizing voice, strange for a servant. 
<br><br>
He looks at me like he knows what I am thinking but says nothing to me. We walk through the door down a long corridor and stop at yet another leaved door. "In here, please!" he says with stress on "Please".  As he opens the doors, a warm wind reaches my face making my eyes pinch together. 
<br><br>
For a second, I thought I saw a large shadow of a dragon on the back wall of this great room.  The shadow is cast from a fireplace on the right side of the room.  In front of the fireplace two chairs are situated and an individual is sitting in a blue robe.  "The Great Wizard" I think.  The doors are closed behind me and I notice that I am in The Great library so many scholars have told me about.
<br><br>
There are bookshelves along all the walls reaching all the way to the ceiling far above.  This library is said to contain almost all the knowledge of the world and many people have tried in vain to gain access to it.  On the back wall there are long shelves of spellbooks in blue covers.  I remember a story from my childhood, about a young man who came to learn from this master of magic. 
<br><br>
He was told never to open any of the books with that cover.  One day he did... and the next day he was found walking about, blabbering about all kinds of strange things.  He died a horrible death from fear two weeks later, never reaching sanity after having read those books. 
<br><br>
The man in the chair is a strongly built man. He doesn't seem to be very old, but still... the records indicated otherwise. 
<br><br>
Suddenly he says to me: "Come... sit in the chair". His voice is so gentle and steady... an earthquake couldn't disturb it. 
<br><br>
I walk over to the chair and sit down.  "A glass of wine?" he asks.  "Yes - please..." I say. 
He hands me a glass of wine - tasting like honey, with a smell of roses.
<br><br>
"So... you wish to write the story of my life? Many have asked me off this, and now I sense that it's time for me to tell..." 
<br><br>
He says in a thoughtful way, "Where shall I begin...?"
<br><br>
"Where shall I begin...."
<br><br><i>
My childhood was a quiet one - I never had anything to fear, my mother and father protected me with their life.  When I was around 18 I felt it was time to leave the nest.  I left my parents behind, took my spellbook and a sword, and left my humble home. 
<br><br>
I started to roam the land for "evil" creatures and after some time I met a great warrior.  He taught me all there was to know about fighting and under his "wings" I quickly became a master of swordmanship.  We were mercenaries and during a battle he was killed by a mage in a black robe.  This mage was a warlord and he was well known in my time. 
<br><br>
He was a twisted man and he killed all standing in his way.  After my mentor died I fled the battlefield and for many months I wasn't myself.  One day a man in a Beautiful robe found me and took me to his house. He told me something I never forgot.  "You are a special child and the people you know as your parents, aren't." 
<br><br>
What were he talking about, my mom and dad aren't my parents?  He told me that my brother and I had been separated at birth and given to two different men who both swore to defend and raise us like their own.  I couldn't believe this.  I quickly left him and went home to talk to my parents.  But when I arrived I saw a horrible sight. 
<br><br>
My childhood house was on fire and as I came close I saw this black wizard again.  In front of my eyes he killed my parents in a Fury of Fire.  After this he left and I ran down to try to help them. But there was nothing to do... they were dead.  I buried my parents and took what little there was left in the house.  I went back to the man in the green robe.... 
<br><br>
For years I studied under him, learning all there was to know about magic - and not to touch my master's books... many fingers were burned trying to read those."  </i>I notice a smile on the Great Wizard's face.  <i>"When some time had passed he told me to go as far north as possible, to the north of the world and even further.  There I would find my real kin." 
<br><br></i>
"But this is another story - I won't tell it now" he says with a glance in his eyes. 
<br><br><i>
After having spent many years getting to know my real parents, I went out to find my brother.  I went back to the main land and for many years I sought my brother.  I fought many monsters and evils in that period and that was the time I learned about a glorious guild that - like me - was fighting the evil of the land. 
<br><br>
SCARAB it was called and after two months I met a member.  Already at that time I felt like I knew him.  He was an honest and hard fighting man.  He brought me to The Great Lady Hawke in Britain.  After having talked my case I was enlisted into this mighty guild. 
<br><br>
Soon after I was brought to their tower, and here I met the rest of the guild.  There were many names among them... the two Guildmasters, and lovers, Lord and Lady Hawke - along with many mighty co-members.  All of them were well known in the world and I felt proud to be in the company of these noble people.  After some time I was officially a member and a great ceremony was held. 
<br><br>
In time I happily found out that my search had ended!  My brother was a SCARAB - the very same person that had enlisted me into SCARAB was my brother. For many years we fought evil and evil fought us, but we always ended up as winners.  Many evil guilds fell to us, and many people honored us in the land. 
<br><br>
But five years ago something terrible happened, a terrible incident in the realm of the Gods was changing the World. The Gods were occupied with other things and evil was taking over much of the land.  The mighty SCARAB could not withstand and it was decided to disband the guild.  All agreed to stay together as friends and keep in touch. 
<br><br>
A little while afterward, the mighty Hawkes was out hunting and had been gone a long time... I was sent out to search for them.  After hours of searching I came upon the trail of them.  The trail led to a cave I had never seen before and a cold and dark breeze came out of it. 
<br><br>
I looked into the cave to see the Hawkes surrounded by enemies and as I was about to help them the earth swallowed them.  At first I thought it was an earthquake but I suddenly saw the Dark Wizard again.  And the remains of a spell was floating in the air, a spell I had never seen or felt before.  He disappeared along with his followers - the AoD. 
<br><br>
I went home and told everybody what I had seen.  Then one morning I discovered an ancient scroll about a keep that had once belonged to the High Evil of OSI.
<br><br>
I left my friends and family behind and started searching for the keep, and after a year I finally found the remains of it.  But to my horror it wasn't a ruin anymore, I found a castle that radiated with evil.  I entered and walked through the cold corridors.  After having killed several guardians I felt a presence I had felt times before.  And there I found him, the Murderer of my foster parents, my former mentor and the mighty Hawkes: The Black Wizard. 
<br><br> 
He looked at me with his dark eyes and I think I saw a smile on his face. "So you came."  He looked at me and said, "I should have killed you and your brother when you were born...." 
<br><br>
"Why?" I asked. 
<br><br>
"They never told you?  Hahahahaha," his laugh echoed.  "Nevermind, I will kill you and hunt down your brother as well!"  A magical battle began.  He was strong, so very strong.  But in the middle of the fight he must have forgotten I was a swordsman as well, because he came too close to me and I put my sword in him.  In his dying breath he mumbled a spell unknown to me and said, "I will return to dispose of the two of you!" 
<br><br>
Then he disappeared in a blaze of blue light and all there was left was some ashes on the floor.  I returned home, relieved. Finally all came to place... except the "curse" he had said never left me.  So for the past two years I have dedicated my time to studying the ancient books in my library and to be well prepared if he should ever return.
<br><br></i>
Have you any questions?" he asks me. 
<br><br>
But as I was about to start, another figure enters the room. He doesn't enter through the door... actually I didn't see from where. 
<br><br>
"My brother... what news do you bring?" Falcan asks this new figure.  The two brothers put their arms around each other.  "I bring no news, only worries," he responds. 
<br><br>
"You have felt it as well, I will assume?" Falcan says. 
<br><br>
"Yes, brother," he replies. 
<br><br>
Suddenly the room starts to shake and a blue portal appears.  Out comes a black cloaked person. 
<br><br>
"You...." Falcan says. 
<br><br>
"Yes it's me...." The figure says.  "And it's time for my revenge. My Gods have given me this last chance... so now you die...." 
<br><br>
A multicolored sphere shoots from the figure's fingers and flows towards Falcan and his brother... but as it comes closer, Falcan starts to cast a spell.  When the sphere surrounds them it has become a single color - white. 
<br><br>
As I see the two brothers being dragged down some sort of portal, their bodies are changed into the shape of dragons.  The sphere disappears and the room is dark.  I look at the dark figure and expect him to kill me as well but he is occupied by something else. 
<br><br>
Suddenly he yells out: "NOOO!!!!! It cannot be...! Failure once again!!!!"
<br><br>
He turns to something inside the blue portal.  "Please!  Let me have one more chance...."  As he is about to finish his sentence a huge bone claw reaches out and pulls him through the portal.  The portal closes and all is quiet.  Suddenly the walls start to shake and I run out through the door, down the corridor and out the house. 
<br><br>
The house is swallowed by the earth and all there is left is the memory of a house that used to be....

<br><br>


Lorigan's Notes: Ad this point in time it is unknown where Falcan and his brother are. Perhaps in the future more will be known.
