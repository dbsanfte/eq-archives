                    <p>G<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">regor, like 
                      his father chose the holy path at a young age. From the 
                      time of his fathers birth, he was chosen to be a priest, 
                      to shed light where there was darkness, and happiness where 
                      there was sorrow. Little did Gregor know that his path along 
                      with his fathers would not be able to protect us from the 
                      very horrors that we fought against. <br>
                      <br>
                      It was the day after his 16th birthday and like every other 
                      day of his life, his father left for his daily holy crusades. 
                      On that day he chose a much more difficult task of trying 
                      to preach in a new town with an unfamiliar feel to it. The 
                      town was filled with many uncertain evils. This in no way 
                      altered his fathers holy quest. This would be his downfall 
                      and the beginning of Gregors abrupt uncertain future. <br>
                      <br>
                      As his father preached to a small crowd of somewhat interested 
                      listeners, he noticed a group riding into town. They were 
                      equiped with swords, shields and were very heavly armored. 
                      One of the men dismounted his horse and attempted to insult 
                      and degrade Gregors father because he feared what he didn't 
                      understand. Gregors father stood tough, and defended his 
                      virtues, onlt to get run through by a bandits sword. Gregors 
                      father could not have died more honorably as he attempted 
                      to spread the principles of truth and justice!<br>
                      <br>
                      </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The word 
                      of his death reached Gregor quickly, and he could see his 
                      destiny begin to unfold. He then knew then that he would 
                      take his fathers strong religious beliefs along with a few 
                      new ones of his own. He dedicated the following years to 
                      becoming an expert swordsman. Strong study and an unwavering 
                      dedication to truth and justice made him a mighty Paladin. 
                      As he grew in age he became exactly as he had forseen. His 
                      horrible tragedy that plagued him as a youth now turned 
                      Gregor into a great and honorable man. He traveled many 
                      miles in this great land, alone with my sword and the virtues 
                      as his guide. He needed more. He needed a greater purpose. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      On one of his many nights alone Gregor had a guild travel 
                      across his path. They seemed very honorable and trustworthy. 
                      Gregor invited them all to enjoy the comforts of his campfire. 
                      The members of the guild gathered around and they spoke 
                      of many of the adventures they had shared as a group. The 
                      head of the guild approached Gregor and introduced himself 
                      as Lord Hawke,one of the two Guildmasters of Scarab. He 
                      too being a Paladin, could see Gregors faith and loyalty 
                      asked if he would be interested in joining their guild. 
                      Gregor has been faithful to Scarab and a member ever since.
