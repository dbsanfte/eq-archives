					<TD valign="TOP" colspan="2"><FONT class="text1">In a small village lived a blacksmith with his wife and only son. For years helping his father in the small forge was his life and he enjoyed it. The only times he was in trouble was when he set off traps so hunters could not catch anything. He believed that hunting should only be for survival and not for sport. His father taught him how to fight with swords and spears and bows, however it was the hammer that the boy liked. His father said he made it out of a rock that fell from the sky. The boy became proficient on the hammer and used it to set off traps set by big game hunters.<BR>Several years later, the boy was off in the forest setting off traps, visiting his favorite part of the woods when a group of hunters came into town. They massacred everyone in town --some villagers had it worse than others. One of the worst was his father. His father was forced to walk through the traps they used to snare animals to save his mother from animals that were bred to kill. Needless to say it was not a pleasant sight. Enraged with this sight the boy gathered up what he could. The town was pretty much burnt to the ground, so his supplies were limited. He left his village and never looked back.<BR>It seemed like months that he tracked this hunter, destroying his traps and freeing the animals that were caught in them. Then one day he had tracked the hunter to a familiar part of the forest. The boy drove the thought from his mind because the hunter was there, eviscerating a yearling. Vengeance was calling. As leaped down from the trees swinging his hammer he caught the hunter by surprise. In am manner of moments the boy disarmed and crippled him, but instead of moving in for the kill he paused. He wanted the hunter to feel trapped to feel despair. Most of all he wanted him to feel PAIN. All the pain that his village went through. The hunter begged for mercy. The boy just stood there staring at the pitiful mass resembling a human, "no", the boy said, " not today, not ever, for scum like you". Then and idea came to him, knowing the hunters traps and where he had hidden them, retrieved them all. Then, one at a time, set them off on the hunter. As the hunter breathed his last breath the boy realized where he was. This was the one part of the forest that brought him peace. As he realized that he brought destruction to this peaceful area, he had also brought justice. He then swore and oath that where ever evil reared its ugly head he would be there. He would become poison to all evil predators. He would become VENOMM.<BR>Several years later deep in the forest Venomm was hunting down a party of bandits who had been ambushing heavily traveled merchant routes. As he was tracking a group of bandits he heard the sounds of battle. He rushed quickly towards the noise fearing the worst only to find a group of bandits had bitten off more than they could chew. Warriors disguised as merchants set a trap for them. When Venomm saw what was happening he could not believe it. He immediately jumped into the fray. When it was over Lordhawke introduced himself and three others. Lady Hawke, Ozwyn, and Ravenn. He said that he was forming a guild called Scarab and asked him to join them. The fact there were other people like him filled him with hope. Hope that together, they could bring justice to this world. How could he say no??<BR></FONT>
