                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gulder Ospar 
                      was born in a small village they called Drevlin. This was 
                      not a Dwarven village as you might expect a Dwarf like Gulder 
                      to grow up in, but rather a community of many races. This 
                      particular village, made up of some 20 residence, actually 
                      seemed more like a family with the whole of them gathering 
                      around a bondfire near center of town one evening every 
                      week for spirits, dance and celebration.</font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gulder learned 
                      about his culture and heritage from his father, Ghinn, who 
                      owned a forge just ouside of town. Ghinn was the finest 
                      smith in all the land. The quality of his weapons and armor 
                      were of such high caliber they were sought out by the most 
                      talented and wealthy warriors. Through the years Gulder 
                      became very proficient at the craft of smithery, and also 
                      in the ways of using these weapons in combat. The life of 
                      a smith was satisfying, but was not to be his destiny...</font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gulders mother 
                      died shorty after his birth. He knew very little of her 
                      as it pained his father greatly to speak of her. One special 
                      night as this family gathered around the bondfire, Gulder 
                      found out the truth behind this village, and the truth about 
                      his mother. This night was the 20th aniversary of the victory 
                      of "The Great War". It turnes out that the residence of 
                      this village are the last remanents of the war party that 
                      claimed the final victory for the powers of light. They 
                      formed this village to live out their lives in peace and 
                      honor those who died in battle fighting for the cause of 
                      righteousness. All, are masters of their craft.. Wizards, 
                      Warriors, Rangers, Magicians, Driuds, Bards, Paladins and 
                      yes ... Clerics. </font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Atana was one 
                      of the most honored participants of the war. Not because 
                      of the many minions of evil she helped destroy, but because 
                      of the many souls she saved through her powers of healing. 
                      Gulder was very proud to hear that his mother played such 
                      an important role in that victory over the powers of darkness. 
                      He knew then, that this was the path chosen for him. His 
                      father wept when he heard the news of Gulders decision, 
                      they were not tears of sorrow, but tears of joy. What better 
                      way to honor his mother than to become a Cleric himself 
                      and help those in need.</font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ghinn introduced 
                      Gulder to a human Cleric in the village named Danas. Danas 
                      was very old for a human, about 75 years of age, but looked 
                      barely over 40. He took Gulder in and began to teach him 
                      the rituals and ways of the Cleric. For seven years Gulder 
                      studied, practiced, and prayed. He had become quite proficiant 
                      at minor spells and was well on his way to becomming a great 
                      Cleric. One evening on that seventh year, Danas passed away 
                      in his sleep. Gulder had a dream that very night of a new 
                      and exciting place and had a vision of a huge Cleric hall 
                      in this place. How wonderfull this city looked in his dream.</font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within the week, 
                      Gulder said his farewells to his friends and his father 
                      and went off in search of this strange and interesting city 
                      named Freeport in the land of Norrath. As he was looking 
                      over the map his father had given him he noticed an odd 
                      scribbling of letters on the side. They read "Scarab" and 
                      beside that were the names "Lord and Lady Hawke". Hmmm, 
                      curious, he though. </font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many days had 
                      passed by and Gulder was beginning to wonder if he had made 
                      the right decision in leaving Drevlin. He continued onward, 
                      pondering this thought as much as Dwarves tend to ponder 
                      anyway, when he came across a small trail leading in his 
                      direction. Wonderfull!! he thought, as this was a sign he 
                      was getting close to his destination. He thanked Rodcet 
                      Nife for his guidence and began to pick up the pace a bit. 
                      Before long he was running full steam down the trail when........WHAMMM!!! 
                      </font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gulder picked 
                      himself up off the ground and brushed his cloths off. He 
                      turned around to see what he tripped over and found that 
                      there seemed to be a rather large leg sticking out of a 
                      bush. "Hello" he called out to the bush. "Uhhggg" was all 
                      that replied. Gulder peeked his head through the shrubbery 
                      and saw a somewhat battered human laying face down in the 
                      dirt. He pulled the human out of the bush and leaned him 
                      against a tree. He was in very bad shape indeed. Gulder 
                      began casting, and after a few moments the humans eyes opened 
                      up. "Thank You" he said, "I would have slain that hill giant 
                      for sure if he hadn't hit me".......</font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What's you name 
                      friend?".., "Gulder Ospar" he said proudly. "Well met Gulder 
                      Ospar, they call me Lord Hawke"... Gulder pulled out his 
                      map and looked at the names written on the side. He showed 
                      the map to Lord Hawke, who's eyes shifted back and forth 
                      from Gulder to the map. "Where did you get this map Gulder?", 
                      "My father gave it to me" he replied. "I haven't seen this 
                      map in 27 years, not since I left it with a good friend 
                      named Ghinn, who i fought with in the "Great War". </font></P>
                    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gulder and Lord 
                      Hawke began to make the short trip to the city known as 
                      Freeport. On the way Lord Hawke told Gulder his story of 
                      the "Great War" and about a mighty guild in Freeport. That 
                      guild was named Scarab and was to be the place Gulder would 
                      call home.</font></P>
