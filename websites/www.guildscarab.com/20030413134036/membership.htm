We take the recruitment of new members very seriously, and getting into Scarab is no easy task. However, most people who have put forth the necessary effort to be admitted to the guild believe it is well worth the wait and effort.<BR><BR>
Here are a few guidelines to help you become a recruit, as well as some information about what to expect from the recruitment process.<BR>
To become a recruit, you must do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Introduce yourself to us on our public message board. Tell us about yourself and express your desire to join the guild. Be sure to tell us your reasons for picking Scarab as your guild of choice, let us know of your current guild acquaintances, and tell us what you hope to bring to the Scarab family..</LI>
<LI>Send an email containing a similar message to the <A HREF="mailto:dtamburin@yahoo.com
">Stallari (DAoC)</A> expressing your desire to join the guild..</LI>
<LI>We are recruiting by invitation only, so if you are serious about joining Scarab you must get at least three Elder Members to sponsor your admittance into the guild. Please ask them to post a message of recommendation about you on our Recruitment Message Board.<BR>
We are a large guild, and we pride ourselves on the fact that we've been able to maintain a family feeling and atmosphere in the guild where everyone knows everyone. We feel that if you are unable to find at least three friends in the guild to sponsor you, this probably isn't the right guild for you.<BR>
As a general rule, the more friends you have in the guild, the better your chances of being admitted will be.<BR></LI>
</OL>
Once these three steps have been achieved, we will accept you as an official recruit and add you to the "guildstone" (our term for /guildsay chat) but you must go into /anonymous mode so the Scarab tag is not shown above your character's head until you've completed your recruitment period.<BR>
<BR>
Expect to be a recruit for quite some time. The minimum recruitment time is one month, but it may take longer for a recruit to be admitted into full membership status.<BR>
This long waiting period gives us a chance to get to you know better, but more importantly, it gives you a chance to see if Scarab is the right guild for you.<BR>
<BR>
After we feel that we've gotten to know you fully and feel that you would be a good addition to the guild, you'll be presented with a verbal membership test in-game presented by the Master of Admissions. This test will include questions about the nature of the guild, its leadership structure, important guild concepts, the guild charter, and questions about your personal character. If you review the information contained on our website and put forth a good effort toward getting to know your guildmates you'll do just fine on this test.<BR><BR>
In conclusion, the # 1 best way to get into the guild is this: Hunt with us, group with us, hunt with us, get drunk with us, hunt with us, and when you've done all that, do it all over again.<BR>
<BR>
The recruitment process is long and detailed, so it will take time for the "paperwork" to be handled. So, your main goal should be that when the Master of Admission says "Do we want to let So-And-So become a recruit?" everyone will say "What? You mean he/she isn't one already? Why on earth not?"<BR><BR>
Good luck!
</p>
Although our recruitment period is long and drawn out there is one know shortcut and that is being the RL friend or spouse of an Elder Member. Here is how that shortcut works:<br>
Real life friends NOT residing in same house - Recruit<br>
Real Life friends residing in same house - (roomate, sig other, etc) - full member after IC approval<br>
Real life family/relative - full member after game GM approval <BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="head2">Recruits</FONT><BR>
Recruits are players who are seeking membership in Scarab and have been added to the guildstone so they may communicate with guild members.  Recruits must stay in Anonymous mode during their recruitment period so their guild tag does not appear. This is a probationary period that will last a minimum of one month and is gives the us a chance to see if the recruit would be a good addition to the guild. After this recruitment period is over, recruits will meet with the Master of Admissions and will be given a final test. Upon passing this test, they will be made a full member of the guild and will be granted access to our secure web pages.<BR><BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Guild Members</FONT><BR>
Once promoted from the status of Recruit, the member is now a Full Member of the Scarab family. Full Members are the heart and soul of the guild and are able to vote in guild affairs, elect new Inner Circle members, and be part of a tight knit family of true friends and comrades.<BR><BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Elder Members</FONT><BR>
Elder members are members who have been in the guild for at least six consecutive months. Only Elder members of Scarab can volunteer to serve on the Inner Circle.<BR><BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Extended Members</FONT><BR>
Extended Membership is a branch of membership for people who are Scarab at heart but no longer play Scarab's main game or who, due to faulty game mechanics of the main game, have chosen to leave the in-game Scarab tag to continue their in-game enjoyment with another guild. Scarab is a family of close friends, and these friendships transcend beyond unimportant in-game status.<BR>
<BR>
Extended Members are essentially just like Elder members, but they are not associated with Scarab in-game. Like Elder members, they retain access to guild message boards and have a voice in guild-wide votes. However, when a guild-wide vote is taken that only involves an in-game issue, Extended Members are encouraged to use their judgment and to abstain from votes that do not apply to them.<BR>
<BR>
Extended Members who left Scarab and still play in active games do not have their characters on the guildstone except for special events where more coordination would be beneficial. Extended Members' who no longer play one of the games we are active in but have an active account may keep their characters on the Scarab
guildstone.<BR>
<BR>
Extended Membership status is granted to players by the Inner Circle on a case-by-case basis.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Inner Circle</FONT><BR>
Members of the Inner Circle provide leadership through shaping policy and voting on key issues.<BR>
The Inner Circle is not an in-game role-playing leadership body. Its purpose is to handle issues that affect the guild as a whole (recruitment, website administration, discipline issues, involvement in non-core games, etc)<BR>
Members of the Inner Circle must maintain an active presence by participating in all official discussions and all votes unless they have given some prior notice that they will be unavailable<BR>
At times, real-life may make it difficult or undesirable to participate as a member of the Inner Circle for an extended period of time. In such cases it is acceptable to honorably step down from the position.<BR>
The Inner Circle will abide by the Code of Leadership. They will not treat their position as one of authority and will at all times perform their duties to the best of their ability and treat all members with respect.<BR>
Inner Circle members have no individual authority. In order to prevent possible abuse, the Inner Circle must approve all actions. There will be an election every 6 months to keep the Inner Circle and the Leader of the IC active and representative of the guild as a whole. If an IC member steps down, that position will not be filled until the next general election. There is no limit to the number of terms a member may serve. The IC is encouraged to delegate certain responsibilities such as recruit mentoring or running quests to volunteers. Willing volunteers are our greatest assets. The IC and Guildmaster will select officers as needed (treasurer, librarian,
armourer, player advocates, etc).<BR>
The Inner Circle has a secure forum to discuss issues.<BR>
The Inner Circle has a ratio of 1:7 with Scarab members. This ratio is to be used when electing a new Inner Circle. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT CLASS="head2">Guildmaster</FONT><BR>
This position is the highest level of role-playing leadership and inter-guild diplomacy.  The Guildmaster should be well spoken and levelheaded, intimately familiar with guild policy and game mechanics, and be able to role-play as necessary. The Guildmaster is an equal member of the Inner Circle with full voting privileges.<BR>
The Guildmaster will hold this position until they decide to step down, the guild decides to stop playing the current game they are actively involved in, or by a vote to remove the GM is passed by a two/thirds majority of the guild.
