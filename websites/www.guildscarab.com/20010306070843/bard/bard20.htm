        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in
        his study and smiled as she moved behind him. Her fingers
        deftly working away the pain in his shoulders as her soft
        humming filled the room with soft melody. She smiled and
        leaned close, speaking softly. &#147;M&#146;love? Shall
        we go riding today?&#148; Slowly he turned his chair and
        pulled her onto his lap. &#147;Aye m&#146;love we should.
        It would be nice to spend some quiet time with you, away
        from the Keep.&#148; Standing he carried her out of the
        room as her laughter filled the Keep. Slowly he walked to
        the stables as two squires emerged leading their horses.
        With a smile and a Nod he placed her in the saddle and
        then mounted his own steed. Suddenly her laughter
        increased as she spurred her mount out of the courtyard
        and across the drawbridge. He laughed and spurred his
        mount after her with a large smile on his face. As he
        caught her she turned and flashed him the smile, which
        would melt even his coldest mood. &#147;Catch me if you
        can m&#146;love.&#148; She spurred her mount faster as
        they neared the forest. He chuckled and took off after
        her, his mount flexing under him as raw power sought to
        catch the mare in front of him.</font><p
        class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Finally they neared the crystalline pool and she reared
        her mount to a stop. Deftly she flipped from the saddle
        and came to rest near the waterline. Briggs smiled as he
        watched her remove her armor and dive into the water.
        Swiftly he dismounted and joined her, his powerful legs
        kicking him towards her underwater. Wrapping his arms
        around her he surfaced and smiled as he twirled around
        with her in his arms. Her laughter was cut short as his
        lips pressed to hers in a deep soulkiss. She smiled and
        swatted at him, &#147;Let me go you big oaf!&#148; His
        smiles turned mischievous and he did as he was told,
        quickly dumping her into the water. He was swimming
        towards the sunning rock just as she surfaced, sputtering
        water and swearing.&nbsp; As he climbed onto the rock he
        felt her move next to him and wrap her arms around his
        neck as she sat behind him. His voice was a whisper as
        the words suddenly poured from his soul.
        &#147;M&#146;love, you have rekindled emotions inside me
        which were long dead. My soul is complete with you, were
        I to lose you all would end for me. I would have no
        reason to stay where I am. I would become
        incomplete.&#148; Her soft voice silenced him as her lips
        touched his shoulder, &#147;M&#146;love I would never
        leave you willingly and you know that.&#148; He nodded
        slowly as she moved to straddle his lap and then they
        loved each other for a time.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was early evening as they both dressed and mounted
        their horses for the ride back to the Keep. He smiled as
        she rode beside him with her fingers entwined in his. She
        sang softly as they rode, a smile across her face as she
        gazed at her man. Suddenly, the world around them seemed
        to warp and twist. An evil voice filled the forest as
        they both reigned their mounts. &#147;Ahhhh yes so young,
        so virile. She will do nicely.&#148; Briggs and Kyt both
        leapt from their mounts as the hag stepped from the
        swirling mists. &#147;So the Lord thinks he can save his
        lady? You suffer now with the knowledge that your lovers
        body will be withered away so that I may return to my
        beauty.&#148; Her hands came up as Briggs moved towards
        her, sparks flying from them to envelope the Lord of
        BlazeRose Keep and bind him in place. His eyes widened in
        terror as the hag yanked Kyt towards her and closed her
        hands around her neck. As he watched Kyt&#146;s body
        began to wither and collapse in on itself. His scream
        filled the forest as he watched his one true love
        seemingly dissolve before his eyes.
        &#147;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! By the Tribunal NO!&#148; Suddenly
        his world blacked out&#133;..</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He awoke in his chambers with Fantane hovering over him.
        Harpax stood by the door with Khaylis and Leflair. His
        eyes were filled with terror as he glanced around. His
        voice harsh and deep, &#147;Kyt? Where is she?&#148;
        Fantane eyes told him all, &#147;We found you both in the
        forest, her body was&#133;.&#148; Her voice faded as a
        shadow detached itself from the corner. &#147;Her body
        was destroyed by a hag. Her soul was saved and placed
        into a SoulStone.&#148; The voice was rich and deep.
        &#147;What are you saying K&#146;Arnon? My love is dead?
        Taken from me?&#148; The dragon/human shook his head,
        &#147;No lad she is safe, but she is also different now.
        She thinks you will not accept her as she is. She must
        stay this way until we can find away to regenerate her
        body, which will take time. I placed her soul into a
        suitable shell, which I think you will agree to as she
        did. Now she has the powers of the magic at her command
        even more than she had before. She will enter if you call
        to her m&#146;child.&#148; Briggs turned to Fantane and
        spoke as she nodded, &#147;M&#146;love? You are here?
        Please come to me so I may see you as you are now.&#148;
        Slowly the door opened and his eyes widened as he gazed
        upon her. &#147;M&#146;love? You are safe and well?&#148;
        His eyes took her in as she moved towards him, his arms
        wrapping around her as she leapt into them. His soul knew
        this was his lady, even as his eyes knew the differences.
        He closed his eyes as she wept and began to
        speak&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.</font></p>
