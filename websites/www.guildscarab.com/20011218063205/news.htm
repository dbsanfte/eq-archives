Soon Nottmoor and Bledfaste fall to us, but sadly while we were doing this Fort Scarab in Hibbieland fell to those foofy elves...</P>All in all a great night of raiding and counter-raiding.</p>Huzzah's go to:</p>
Both Battering Ram teams! The speed, the professionalism, a sight to behold :)</p>
Goonar, Captian of the Guard in Fort Scarab, who had only the grannies to keep him company most of the night.</p>
Our home defense team, who despite two zone crashes kept at it, trying to retake our forts.</p>To Tharian and others who rallied our forces to get the home keeps back after the Alliance called the raid off!</P>
Great job to everyone!</p>
