                        winced, and tried to push back the
                        headache that was forming as she surveyed
                        this new world. The bright, harsh
                        sunlight was an unfamiliar presence,
                        unknown in the Old world from which
                        SCARAB had left. </font><p><font size="2"
                        face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Too
                        bright...&quot; She muttered to herself
                        as the city lights seemed to intensify
                        the headache. This city of the new world
                        was huge, and strange. All around here
                        what appeared to be other emigrants were
                        asking questions to anyone, looking as
                        lost, if not more, than she did. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;All
                        I need to do is find the rest of the
                        guild.&quot; She decided aloud as she
                        checked her equipment. A short sword that
                        looked like it had seen a few too many
                        days of sparring and a strange book with
                        unfamiliar runes inside. She buckled the
                        sword belt on, set the book inside her
                        backpack, and slung her back as she tried
                        to navigate the strange city.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately,
                        the winding, similar streets were a
                        dramatic change from the cities SCARAB
                        had known. Things were confusing; her
                        skills in tracking and pathfiding seemed
                        to only betray her as she wandered. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">She
                        took a pathway that looked different
                        enough to possibly lead to alandmark of
                        some kind. Instead it led to the
                        waterline...but the water was different.
                        In the old world, the water was solid,
                        untouchable and immobileas a mountain.
                        Here it was eerily clear, and she could
                        see the gleam of what liked gold just a
                        few yards down. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
                        she thought, better to meet up with the
                        others with some gold in the pocket, she
                        decided as she walked in the water. It
                        was a strange feeling, being immersed in
                        water. As she approached the shiny
                        object, she saw a tiny, helpless, curious
                        red fish. It swam close, and then
                        suddenly darted away. She could have
                        sworn that unlike all the fish she had
                        seen Ozwyn and Palin catch, this one had
                        unusually long teeth.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">It
                        swam past the shiny spot, and around what
                        looked like the wreck of an ancient ship.
                        Suddenly, she saw a swarm of much, MUCH
                        larger red fish swim toward her from
                        around the wreck. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">They
                        moved like wolves, fast and determined.
                        She could feel something was wrong as she
                        drew her sword and began to back up,
                        towards dry land. But they were too fast,
                        and one fish the size of a large dog swam
                        close. It opened its maw to reveal teeth
                        the length of her forearm. She drew her
                        sword, but the watery environment slowed
                        her actions. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">She
                        swung the blade desperately as the rest
                        of the school swarmed her. She cried out
                        for help from her guildmates, and her
                        god, but instead she choked on the water
                        as the piranhas began to feed.... </font></p>
                        <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">There
                        once was a ranger called Bo, <br>
                        got lost in the city, oh no....<br>
                        She tripped on a stick, and cut quite the
                        flip. <br>
                        To land in her watery tomb.........</font></p>
