    <td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My friends, I have
      very pale skin. Traditional of high elves, yes? It is also a not so
      traditional birthmark of evil dark elves. The tale be, that me mother was
      a wretched woman of many men. That is why me friends, I could never tell
      you the tale of me father. I all but do not know.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was dropped at the
      borderline of the Commons between the Dark Elf home and Human home. I was
      just a baby then. Someone then picked me up, an orphan they called me.
      Dressed in nothing but the tattered robe my mother left me in and a stick
      in my young hand, I was not quite sure what to do with. These Humans, they
      picked me up, carried me to the enchanting city of Felwithe. They searched
      high and low for the couple I belonged to, to no avail. They then put my
      bassinet down at the entrance to the magic guild. Surely someone would
      find me and take care of me. The person who found me would know what to do
      with me. right? I was taken into a family of enchanters. My parent were
      Matricia and Morphatate Mystbane. The tale however gets worse. I had a
      sister, an EVIL sister, named Allixmaree Mystbane. She was an enchanter
      too, of the 20th season by the time I was brought to live with them. My
      parents, no matter how hard they tried could not teach me the science of
      being an Illusionist. I kept producing balls of fire and shards, and
      conjuring things they didn't understand. I was scolded and taunted by
      Allixmaree, for she was mastering her arts by then. Allixmaree could make
      beautiful jewels, and me, all I could do was make more rag clothes of
      spider silk. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I sat out on my own to learn
      more about the magic that was special to me. I was taken into a guild of
      magicians and given a book of magic. This book had spells in it that were
      unique only to me. These spells would teach me how to survive. They taught
      me how to fight for myself, how to meditate to my Gods when I got tired.
      My first kill was a bat. Then I tasted it, I tasted the blood. It pulsed
      through me like a running boil. It ran all through my blood and into my
      heart. I wanted to kill. I wanted revenge for all that had gone wrong in
      my life. I wanted revenge for everything that Allixmaree had ever done to
      me!!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I practiced more every day,
      and soon, I graduated to the 10th season of my magic works. I seen it, I
      hated it, Allixmaree was in love! I hated her, no one loved me. not like
      he loved her.. Corvax was so kind to her, she didn't deserve him!!! After
      all the cruel things that she had done to me.. I wanted him, it was the
      one sure way to hurt her, and I knew it! Corvax was very attentive to my
      young needs, teaching me where to advance my skills as a young magician,
      and even watching over me as I warded off many enemies. One day, I sent a
      conjured helper after Allixmaree and that was the last I saw of her. The
      more time passed, the more Corvax taught me to love as he did. That the
      disgust I felt, the boil in the blood, was toward the attacking creatures
      and not towards others who would bring no harm to me. Upon me entering
      into my 20th season of magic, Corvax asked me to marry him. I knew he was
      older in his practices than I, he was 30th season after all. Upon reaching
      my 25th season of magic, Corvax and I were married in the lovely town of
      Felwithe. There were others there from a family guild called Scarab. This
      would be the day I met many such as Qyen, Revenn, Shadowbane and others.
      Corvax belonged to this guild, but I did not yet feel confident enough in
      the skill of sharing myself to join with him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent many seasons in the
      dungeons in High Pass Keep. Most of them, alone in the cellar, practicing
      my magic on Osargen, a prisoner. I would use my magic to make him
      disappear, and then I would meditate to myself, finding my inner self and
      finding the love. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I finally aspired to
      return to the surface, I first found myself giving to groups while I
      practiced my magic on bigger thins. Now I aspire to give my love and
      friendship to Scarab. Both as a family member and loyal wife to my
      wonderful husband, Corvax!</font></p>
