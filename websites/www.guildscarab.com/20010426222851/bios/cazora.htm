As an infant, she was found by a small group of Karanas gypsies and taken in and raised as one of their own, even though the human gypsies didn't normally associate with high elves.  They sensed something very special and magical about her.  As she grew into childhood, she became exceptionally beautiful, intelligent, and extremely charismatic.  She took a natural interest in the art of enchantment and showed enormous potential.  By the time she was 12 years old, she had learned all the gypsies knew.  Not wanting to hold her potential back, they brought her to Felwithe and presented her to the enchanter's guild there.  The guildmaster, Kinool Goldsinger, immediately recognized her potential and accepted her with welcome arms.  Her guardian mother, Silspin, left the gypsies to open a jewelcraft shop near the beautiful fishing ponds and to take care of Cazora.  In a few short weeks, she grew in powers far exceeding students several years older than her.  The gypsies had taught her something that is difficult to learn in academic arenas -- that was resourcefulness, and a key to being a powerful enchantress, and that gave her an edge.
<br><br>
During the next four years, Cazora grew into an extremely beautiful women and had made many friends.  During the same time, Silspin had taught her all the secrets of jewelcraft.  Cazora enjoyed this trade immensely; her high charisma and beauty combined with her skills caused her to become the perfect jeweler.  Word of mouth got around about her talent, and it wasn't long before travelers would come from abroad just to get jewelry from her.  Meeting so many adventurers and hearing about their stories caused her to desire to be a great adventurer.  She made great many friends and became closer to a special guild of adventurers known as Scarab.  Their ideals and values matched hers perfectly, so she decided it was time to move on.
<br><br>
CURRENT
Moving to Freeport to the HQ of Scarab, she began adventuring with fellow members, many of them having quests of her own to pursue, all of which, are for bettering society and smiting evil.  Cazora enjoys helping people above all.  Early on in her adventuring days, she focused more on making her group better with magical buffs as well as equipping  them with fine jewelry.  It wasn't long though, when she quickly mastered the art of controlling battles with a large variety of mind controlling methods.  Her fellow adventurers came to respect her as an important person (because she was so frail and beautiful, they felt more of a need to protect her than focus on the battles in the early days).  They eventually learned that she could prevent stuff from attacking her or anyone else, better than anyone else could, and was instrumental in allowing the group to fight battles 2 or 3 times the normal size.
<br><br>
As her reputation in jewelry became world known, she began to earn enough money to help acquire difficult items for fellow guild members.  This aspect has been viewed as acts of generosity, however, her intentions were purely in the vein of helping others out.  In groups where others understand how she fights, everyone tends to relax a bit, as she entertains them with jokes and various "scare pranks", probably to keep them on their toes!  She also thoroughly enjoys shapeshifting for entertainment purposes, especially at parties, or near the end of a long hunt when fatigue starts to set in.
<br><br>
One of her goals is to find out her origins, who her real parents were and why she ended up in the hands of her gypsy founders as an infant.  She has no knowledge of any past, however, she senses that Kinool Goldsinger knows something, even though he has never mentioned anything.  Perhaps one day, she will find out, but in the meantime, she is happy to adventure and learn about the world.  Without Scarab, she wouldn't have this kind of happiness and fulfillment.

<br><br>
BELIEFS
Cazora is one of the few enchanters to worship Mithaniel Marr.  Most enchanters follow the goddess of love, Erollosi Marr.  Perhaps it had to do with the valorous upbringing and her strong beliefs of justice.  She values life and freedom above all else, with happiness as a close second.  She despises those who would deprive others of them, and will treat such people the way they treat others.
