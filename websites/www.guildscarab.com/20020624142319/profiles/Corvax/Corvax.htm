<P>Corvax was the first-born son of Gilthas Arcanium, General of the 3rd Army of Felwithe and leader of the infamous Mountain death clan wars,  and was born shortly after the discovery of the new continent known as Kunark. Corvax lead an uneventful childhood, being groomed for a life in the military with a pre-ordained commission already in place courtesy of his father's position in the military. All this, however, changed towards the end of the war as a strange malignment befell the once strong youth and left him crippled, a shell of his former self. Clerics were gathered from all corners of the explored world but none could cure this strange ailment and the once strong noble youth was left as a pale skinned living skeleton. Light was shed on this incident later on when it came to be discovered that a particularly strong Goblin Shaman towards the end of the war had cursed Gilthas and although strong talismans protected him himself the same could not be said for his son Corvax who bore the brunt of this extremely nasty curse.</P>
<P>His body crippled but his mind racing, the young Corvax turned his energies from practicing sword and shield to exercising his mind and exploring the sometimes-dark paths of magic. Upon exploring the realms of magic the path of wizardry was chosen, as the ease of travel would benefit the weak youth. Finding him a willing student, the wizard's guild in Felwithe soon found the young Corvax a constant occupant. When not studying he could be found swimming the lake outside, trying to strengthen his weakened frame.</P>
<P>Feeling confident in his new arcane powers and being sounder of limb, Corvax decided to put his skills to the test and join the ever-constant battle against the encroaching Orcs of the Crushbone Clan. Early battles fared poorly for the young wizard as his early battle training left the young man trying to combat the Orcs with Power and Weapons rather than guile and magic. After many painful lessons needing much clerical attention, the young wizard met with a group lead by Dolgo Baldfeet and calling themselves his Deputies. A proud yet small group, the deputies attracted Corvax with their informal structure and desire for adventure. During his time in the deputies Corvax made many friends, and having made a significant effort against the Crushbone Orcs travelled to The Oasis of Marr to practise his arts on the plague of reptilians that was the bane of the area.</P>
<P>It was at about this time a young elven enchantress by the name of Alixmaree caught the eye of Corvax when it wasn't stuck in a book in the constant study of the arcane. The friendship grew over time with Alixmaree aiding the young Corvax where possible and even giving him the mighty talisman of Muggok, which he still wields to this day. Shortly after this time Corvax travelled the world further, finally taking up the quest against evil in the southern plains of Karana at the same time 2 other things happened, and Alixmaree having caught his eye just disappeared. A heartbroken Corvax was then asked to lead the Deputies, as many battle scars needed time to heal on Dolgos frail halfling frame. While battling the strange bird-like creatures that had made their home in these lands Corvax met a healer by the name of Qyen, another elf from his homelands and one gifted with magics of healing and warding. With the continued absence of Alixmaree, Corvax vented his anger and frustration on the Aviak birdmen while his friendship grew with the healer called Qyen. Many moons passed and Qyen moved to the Kunark to continue his quest while Corvax, still harbouring mistrust for the continent that caused his malady, stayed behind to help quell the uprising of the TesMak gnolls. Finally plucking up the courage to heed his friend's calling, Corvax boarded the boat and travelled the oceans to the newly formed outpost of Firiona Vie. Finding his friend Qyen in the mountains of the new frontier, Corvax soon met many members of Qyen's guild called SCARAB. Time passed and Corvax's arcane powers grew, leading him to pass up leadership of the Deputies to his good friend Thistlefoot.</P>
<P>At around this time a young elven Magician approached Corvax on a visit to his homeland. She was called Luxy and wished to learn further the ways of the arcane. Corvax gladly tutored her and taught his willing student all he could. As time passed and Luxy started to fill the void left since Alixmaree's departure, friendship turned to love and shortly thereafter they where married in his hometown of Felwithe with his old friend Qyen presiding and his hunting partner Ravenn by his side.</P>
<P>Shortly after this joyous occasion Gilthas was called out of his semi-retirement to head up an exploratory force to venture to the newly discovered lands of Velious (found by the Ak'anon gnomes who seem to have nothing better to do than tinker with clockworks and explore). After a rushed trip buying supplies and furs, Gilthas waved goodbye to his family and negotiated travel permits for him and the party on the Gnomish icebreaker. The Elven High Council kept the family up to date with Stories of Gilthas's progress until one fateful day some 2 months into the exploration, when the couriers stopped arriving. Two moons passed and Corvax decided to take matter into his own hands, after the second party sent by the High Council turned up nothing. Out of pure frustration Corvax bid farewell to his wife and mother and set off to seek tales or trace of his father in the distant snow covered realm of Velious.</P><BR></FONT>
