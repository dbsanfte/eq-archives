Already traveled through numerous dimensions, Aerithanna the lone dark knight is reborn into a new land, the world of Solusek Ro. She leaves all her memories and friends behind in other worlds, continuing her journey in her search for the ultimate power that unites good and evil. Originally born in Neriak on the distant world of Nameless, Aerithanna  was raised in the Shadow Knight guild. Having no parent nor any relative, she was destinted to be one of the greatest shadow knight to bring pride to Neriak. However, as 15th season Aerithanna entered Oasis of Marr for the first time in mission to search of her lost comrade Vexal, she encountered Bruel the singing bard and Sali the knowledgeable druid. For the first time Aerithanna felt she has a family due to Burel and Sali care for the lone shadow knight. Their search of Vexal finally extended to the land of the Froglocks, the Guk. Its in the Guk dungeon where they found Vexal has laid dead with his Dark Reaver still holding tightly in his hand. Aerithanna swore the revenge, however, Vexal's body reveals the clue of his killer. The killer is no stranger but the commanding shadow knight of the Dark Guild himself, Marell NightStalker. Knowing now Vexal has laid victim of an interal power struggle, Aerithanna has given up any hope in the force of darkness. Knowing he has no chance to fight the Guild alone, Aerithanna decided to join the Champions of Honor, where Burel and Sali belong. As time goes by, light and dark forces clash again and again on Nameless, but with light force out numbered by their dark counter parts, the Champions of Honor was defeated once and for all in the gruesome battle of North Ro desert. Aerithanna and Sali are few survivors of battle, while Burel unfortunately perished. Exiled and fleeing from her dark brothers and sisters, Aerithanna knows the only way she can gain the strength to defeat the evil is to unite her force of dark side with the power of the light, and she has been on search for that force ever since. One day, while journeying to the temple of Marr for a chance to speak with the priests within, Aerithanna was stooped by a old erudite wizard Fann. Fann has heard of the Story of Aerithanna and told her that the only way to find and unite the force of light and darkness is to start over in a whole New World and serve in the power of light. Aerithanna has been too deep into the darkness in the world of Nameless, and starting over in other world will erase that doomed past and perhaps bring new life to her. Agreeing giving up all her power and back to a child again, Fann summon a temporal gate of time and space, and transfer Aerithanna to a New World. So Aerithanna entered realm of Solusek Ro and lives her incarnation yet again. Having been wielding her entrusted Nasthar Great Sword alone for quite a while, she met up with a great Wood Elf druid Kelagry in the Southern Plain of Karana, after a gruesome and fierce battle with the occupants of the Avaik city. Eventually a great friendship has grown and the duo saved each other's life numerous times across the land of Norah. Now both take part in the mighty force of the Scarab, the sisterly love strengthen the already wonderful guild.</p>

For every shadow knight that wields great sword seeking blood in battle, there must be also a forgiving angel to balance the agony and hatred brought by the dark knight. Everlyn was a just a normal human girl born in Freeport. One day, while in her trip to fishing villiage in the Desert of South Ro, a group of charmed undead surrounded Everlyn. Behind the evil creations of the dark side is the rouge Dark Elf necromancer Vanarth. Vanarth had been banished from Neriak for years due to his discussing practice of sacrificing his own Dark Elf sisters for creation of his own evil power. Unknown to Everlyn, Vanarth has discovered an ancient scroll, which calls for sacrifice for a particular family line of human girl, the family of unmatched clerical power. All of Vanarth clues had pointed him to Everlyn. According to the scroll, Vanarth will gain so much favor with long forgotten King of the undead, who will grant him great power of necromancy unknown to the world. As Everlyn was knocked unconscious and carried to Vanarth's secret alter of blood, the lone shadow knight Aerithanna happened to witness the awful kidnap. Recently passing through Neriak and enraged by of Vanarth awful deed, the dark knight, although can careless about scarification of a human, decide to take revenge for the dark elf girls who perished due to Vanarth's evil deed. With unsuspicious Vanarth busying planning the sacrifice ceremony way from the site, Aerithanna alone launched a surprised attack against Vanarth's undead creations. As Aerithaana's great sword chopped down the lifeless bones of the last skeleton, Vanarth returned to the ceremonial site found Everlyn already rescued, and a calm and fearsome avenger awaits him. Without help of his summoned undead, Aerithanna's swift blows again and again interrupted Vanarth's casting of hatred and suffering. Finally the once great necromancer fell on the feet of the lone traveling shadow knight. Still unconscious, Everlyn was taken by Aerithanna to her friend Kelagry's care. Not wanting have anything further to do with the human, Aerithanna left alone continuing her quest for balance. As Everlyn awaken, under the care of kind druid Kelagry, she was told what have happened. From The scroll Vanarth dropped, Everlyn learned about her great ancestry that she did not know about. Now a follower of Mathanial Marr, Everlyn has shown her great healing power where no human cleric have possess, and starts her own quest for history of her own ancestry.</p>

Everything comes in a surprise. When Rinnoa was just a little girl, she always enjoyed the bard tales about far away kingdom and epic battles, never she imagined that she will be part of the tale soon. As a young girl living in West Freeport, Rinnoa always played with other kids outside of the gate area, overlooked malitia making sure no harm will be done to them. Its until not long ago, evil necromancers invited the gate area and start to slaughter the malitia guards. One afternoon, Rinnoa was coming out the gate in search for some bat wings, she found all the malitia guards lied dead on the ground, before she knows it, she was already surrounded by numerous orcs who finally dared to move close to the gate without the guards presence. Suddenly the temperature air roses near Rinnoa, as she still stunned in place, a fire elemental quickly wiped out the orc gathering at no time. A warm voice behind Rinnoa said, "little girl, are you doing alright?" As Rinnoa turns around a smiley face an awesomely dressed enchanter stood before her. Rinnoa was still stunned from the near death experience. The enchanter said, "Oh well little girl, it seems like you are still shaken up… hmm, let me see, take this to protect yourself and as my present for you for friendship. My name is Calanctus of the Scarab. Perhaps one day you might need my assistance. Remember the name well. Farewell then little girl." As Rinnoa received a Bamboo Bo stick from Calanctus, the great enchanter faded into the dark with his gating spell. Upon returning home, Rinnoa asked around about what is the gift she has received, and turned out to be a good monkly weapon. Rinnoa thought to herself, "Perhaps it's a sign, a sign that I shall becomes one of the greatest fighter of the world." Armed with the stick and a big dream, Rinnoa joined the local monk guild and start her training. Still young and inexperienced, Rinnoa has displayed some awesome fighting skills as a monk of bright future. "Perhaps one day I will meet Calanctus again, and one day I will belong to the mighty Scarab."</p>
