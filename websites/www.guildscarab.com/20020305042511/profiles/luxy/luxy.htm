					<TD valign="TOP" colspan="2"><FONT class="text1">My friends, I have very pale skin…  Traditional of high elves, yes?  It is also a not so traditional birthmark of evil dark elves.  The tale, that my mother was a wretched woman of many men.  That is why my friends, I could never tell you the tale of me father.  I all but do not know.</P>I was dropped at the borderline of the Commons between the Dark Elf home and Human home.  I was just a baby then.  Someone then picked me up, an orphan they called me.  Dressed in nothing but the tattered robe my mother left me in and a stick in my young hand, I was not quite sure what to do with.  These Humans, they picked me up, carried me to the enchanting city of Felwithe.  They searched high and low for the couple I belonged to, to no avail.   They then put my bassinet down at the entrance to the magic guild.  Surely someone would find me and take care of me.   The person who found me would know what to do with me… right?   I was taken into a family of enchanters.  My parent were Matricia and Morphatate Mystbane.  The tale however gets worse.  I had a sister, an EVIL sister, named Allixmaree Mystbane.  She was an enchanter too, of the 20th season by the time I was brought to live with them.  My parents, no matter how hard they tried could not teach me the science of being an Illusionist.  I kept producing balls of fire and shards, and conjuring things they didn't understand.  I was scolded and taunted by Allixmaree, for she was mastering her arts by then.  Allixmaree could make beautiful jewels, and me, all I could do was make more rag clothes of spider silk.</P>I sat out on my own to learn more about the magic that was special to me.  I was taken into a guild of magicians and given a book of magic.  This book had spells in it that were unique only to me.  These spells would teach me how to survive.  They taught me how to fight for myself, how to meditate to my Gods when I got tired.  My first kill was a bat.  Then I tasted it, I tasted the blood.  It pulsed through me like a running boil.  It ran all through my blood and into my heart.  I wanted to kill.  I wanted revenge for all that had gone wrong in my life.  I wanted revenge for everything that Allixmaree had ever done to me!!</P>I practiced more every day, and soon, I graduated to the 10th season of my magic works.  I seen it, I hated it, Allixmaree was in love!  I hated her, no one loved me…  not like he loved her..  Corvax was so kind to her, she didn't deserve him!!!  After all the cruel things that she had done to me….  I wanted him, it was the one sure way to hurt her, and I knew it!  Corvax was very attentive to my young needs, teaching me where to advance my skills as a young magician, and even watching over me as I warded off many enemies.  One day, I sent a conjured helper after Allixmaree and that was the last I saw of her.  The more time passed, the more Corvax taught me to love as he did.  That the disgust I felt, the boil in the blood, was toward the attacking creatures and not towards others who would bring no harm to me.  Upon me entering into my 20th season of magic, Corvax asked me to marry him.  I knew he was older in his practices than I, he was 30th season after all.  Upon reaching my 25th season of magic, Corvax and I were married in the lovely town of Felwithe.  There were others there from a family guild called Scarab.  This would be the day I met many such as Qyen, Revenn, Shadowbane and others.   Corvax belonged to this guild, but I did not yet feel confident enough in the skill of sharing myself to join with him.</P>I spent many seasons in the dungeons in High Pass Keep.  Most of them, alone in the cellar, practicing my magic on Osargen, a prisoner.  I would use my magic to make him disappear, and then I would meditate to myself, finding my inner self and finding the love.</P>When I finally aspired to return to the surface, I first found myself giving to groups while I practiced my magic on bigger thins.  Now I aspire to give my love and friendship to Scarab.  Both as a family member and loyal wife to my wonderful husband, Corvax!</P></FONT>
