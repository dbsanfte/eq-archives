It all started many, many years ago when he was just a young lad in the world of Britainnia. Stout was his name back then, a strong and promising warrior he was. He had been seperated at birth from his brother Skie and raised by foster parents far from his true home in the North. Although his foster parents raised him like their own, it quickly became clear that he was not like the other kids. Strange and wonderful powers were revealed every day and Stout soon realized his true parents were not human. <br><br>After years of practice he managed to control both his natural and his human form, allowing him to shift between these at will - which would prove to become rather useful at several occasions later on.<br><br>At the age of 20 he began to adventure through the lands - fighting, studying, and last but not least searching for his only brother. It was at this time he met a young and beautiful woman named Boudica; a woman he was sure he had met before (this is a completely different story, however - if you would like I will tell it later on). He was not the only person encountering her though, as she was soon attacked by a member of an enemy guild. For his pathetic but successful attempt to save her life, Stout was offered to join the guild Boudica was in - the Society for Collection And Research of Anhks in Britainnia. Such a chance should not go to waste, Stout thought, and gladly accepted. <br><br>One day a few months later Stout met a young wizard adventuring through the woods. Over time a special bond developed between the two and soon they were both members of this glorious guild. Great was the day when the truth was revealed : that young man was Stout's long lost brother Skie - fate had brought them together - nature did the rest. <br><br>The two brothers have stayed loyal and dedicated to Scarab ever since and they have both been rewarded for this with greater influence in guild decisions and medals for their services. Skie functioned as an assistant guildmaster at one time, Stout became in charge of recruiting. Both were members of the famous Inner Circle for quite some time until what they both call The Great Change. <br><br>A time of chaos - a time of despair. <br><br>Scarab fell apart and the two brothers were faced with an old and powerful threat. This evil wizard had taken the lives of several close to Skie and would not rest at that. Skie was faced with the dark wizard personally - and rid the world of this foul individual - while several attempts to assasinate Stout were made. <br><br>One evening a while after, a young scribe was fortuned enough to be granted an interview of Skie the wizard. That young scribe would later on prove to be the sole witness of the episode that forever changed the lives of the two brothers. Midway through the interview, chaos arose. The Gods of Evil had granted the mysterious black-robed wizard a touch of life and so he appeared one last time - more powerful than ever. As the wizard began to cast a spell in order to hurl the two brother into a doomed dimension, Skie had no choice than to copy him and try to control the spell even though his powers did not match the strengh of the magic formula.<br><br>The outcome was unfortunate yet it saved their lives. When Skie came to his senses again he realized they were no longer in the world they had been born and raised in. A new and unfamiliar world lay before them. Stout was yet to gain consciousness and seemed to be struggling somehow. He was fighting an inner battle - two souls claiming the same body. <br><br>You see, that evening Ffaffner - the servant and apprentice of Skie - had been in the room as well, and the backfire of Skie's spell had consumed him too. His spirit left his body and travelled along with the spirits of the two brothers - and was now struggling to manifest itself in this new plane of existence. <br><br>Stout was never the same again. Today, he shares the memories of both as well as their different characteristics. He is still noble, brave and kind but sometimes slightly confused. Those who know his story tend to bare with him should his speak be unintelligible.<br><br>"Stou-what? The name is FFAFFNER. F..F..A..F..F..N..E..R !" he has stated more than once<br><br> </font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="500" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
