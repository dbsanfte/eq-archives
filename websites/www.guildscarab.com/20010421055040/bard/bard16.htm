        face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sat at the
        celebration and smiled as his eyes took it all in.
        K&#146;Arnon had returned and was happy with them.
        Leflair seemed to be of better spirits lately,
        mayhaps&nbsp; Ciara had something to do with that. Briggs
        smiled to himself, he watched his friends celebrate, he
        looked for her and saw that she was dancing with a guard
        with a smile on her face. This one troubled him, his
        feelings for her were strong but he wondered if she could
        feel the same. Suddenly, without a word to anyone he
        stood and made his way to a door in the rear of the Keep.
        Without a word he waves his hand and the magical
        enchanted lock opened, then he slipped through the door
        as no one noticed. He walked down to the creek, which ran
        behind the Keep and sat against a stump to think. His
        thoughts troubled him lately because he and Morigane both
        shared a bond which none could understand. She had been
        the one to support him through the dark days after
        he&#146;d left Halas and he had sworn a soul oath to
        protect her with his own life. &nbsp;</font><p
        class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He sat throwing rocks into the pool of radiant water when
        he suddenly heard something behind him. Moving to his
        feet he saw the human form of K&#146;Arnon walking
        towards him. The voice was like a deep whisper as it
        filled the clearing, &#147;Young Barbarian&#133;you seem
        troubled. You should know that we, you and I, share
        certain thoughts. No,&#148; waving his hand at the smirk
        on Briggs face, &#147; those thoughts are omitted. But we
        share a bond because of your Guardian.&#148; Briggs
        nodded and sat as K&#146;Arnon shifted to his more regal
        form. He smiled slightly at the great dragon and skipped
        another rock. &#147;Come Briggs, tell me what it is that
        troubles you.&#148; Briggs stared at the dragon and
        sighed, &#147;What would a dragon know of mortal
        love?&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The dragon snorted and sighed, &#147;Child I have watched
        mortal love for thousands of years.&nbsp; I have seen it
        at it&#146;s peak and seen it at it&#146;s downfall. No
        what is troubling you?&#148; Briggs smiled and began,
        &#147;Well it seems I have fallen for one as she holds my
        heart and she has told me I hold hers. But, I fear she
        will tire of me soon.&#148; The great dragon nodded and
        spoke softly, &#147;She love you lad and she will as long
        as she does. Love is a fickle thing that one should enjoy
        while you can.&#148; Briggs nodded as the dragon shifted
        back. &#147;Now I am going back to enjoy the celebration
        in my honor. I bid you good eve young master.&#148; </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After a time Briggs was leaning against the stump when a
        lithe figure darted into his vision. She had a smile on
        her face and her hands on her hips. &#147; M&#146;love?
        Are you jealous? Why are you here when the celebration is
        in the Keep?&#148; Briggs, caught off guard by her sudden
        appearance, tried to smile but couldn&#146;t. &#147;Tis
        nothing love just did not want my mood to ruin the party.
        The others need to relax not be worrying over a old
        man.&#148; She smirked and slid into his lap,
        &#147;Briggs BlazeRose, you are hardly a old man. I,
        myself, am far older than you are and you should
        understand that no matter what thoughts run through that
        mind of yours that I love you, and I shall no matter
        what.&#148; His smile told her she had gotten through his
        thick skull and she smiled. &#147;Now, m&#146;love, hold
        me here with you for a time.&#148; He smiled and wrapped
        his arms around her, his lips seeking hers and then
        finding what he sought in a kiss that made the ground
        beneath them slightly rumble. They loved each other well
        into the morning and fell asleep near the stump with her
        lithe form cradled in his arms.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Later that night LadyHawke smiled as she draped her cloak
        over them, and whispered to Hawke that they should not
        wake these two. Hawke smiled and agreed as she cast a
        Protection spell over the two sleeping forms. They walked
        away giggling over something Hawke had said about
        Barbarians and Elves together. The next morning a patrol
        from the Keep silently filled their water flasks from the
        pool and smiled at the lady and lord of BlazeRose Keep as
        they slept entwined together and covered with the morning
        dew, smiles on both their faces.</font></p>
