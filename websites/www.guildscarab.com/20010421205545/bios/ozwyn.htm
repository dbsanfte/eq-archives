His mother was a prisoner/victim of his father, and died                       when he was four. <br>                      <br>                      He did not start out very well. As soon as he could walk,                       his father had him join a gang of bandit children who                       robbed graves and broke into people's houses, and other                       acts of common burglary. <br>                      <br>                      One incident with his father's bandit friends in particular                       scarred him for life. His father had one of his friends                       over, the infamous troll warrior Guklak Toothrage, a bandit                       reviled even among his own kind as a cannibalistic eater                       of human and elven children. He and Bjorn were drunk one                       day, and he bought the right to cook and eat Ozwyn for 3                       copper. Fortunately, the troll was so drunk he passed out,                       blacked out, and forgot the incident. However, Ozwyn still                       carries the memory of being held up by one leg and being                       told he was going to be Guklak's next meal. <br>                      <br>                      Some of the other children had similarly bad backgrounds,                       and after a couple of years they conspired to go into business                       for themselves. Just before his ninth birthday, he slit                       his father's throat while he was asleep, looted his house                       for anything of value, and joined the other conspirators                       of the gang. For the next several years they engaged in                       minor banditry, skullduggery and did their own grave robbing.                       They particularly enjoyed grave robbing, for it appears to                       have the fewest risks. <br>                      <br>                      However, as they began to dig up more and more graves, they                       began to have more close calls with Undead, and the foul,                       evil necromancers, who often dug up corpses for their own                       abominable uses. <br>                      <br>                      For a while, they would not re-bury their looted graves,                       in hopes this would at least keep the Necromancers somewhat                       appeased. And it seemed to work for a while. But then the                       necromancers wanted live specimens to study. Several members                       of the gang disappeared, and Ozwyn suspected a necromancer                       might have abducted them in order to conduct some unnatural,                       unholy experiment. <br>                      <br>                      His own luck ran out at the age of thirteen. He made the                       disastrous mistake of digging down into a grave that had                       just spawned a zombie. Naturally, it was digging up as he                       was digging down. So as he was knee deep in the grave the                       Zombie burst out, and he was face to face with the monster.                       <br>                      <br>                      He thought he was dead, no, he KNEW he was dead, but instead                       something else happened. He felt a light from above him                       and also within him reach out and strike down the Zombie.                       He knew at that moment some other power; some greater force                       had marked him, and then used him to strike down the abomination.                       He felt different for a moment, he felt good, like for once                       in his life something right had been done. <br>                      <br>                      He knew then that his days of grave robbing were over. He                       wasn't sure what he should do, or where he should go, but                       his was convinced his criminal days were over. When he went                       back to the gang's hideout, to tell the others he was leaving,                       he discovered that his encounter was not the only one with                       the undead. <br>                      <br>                      The door to the hideout had been smashed open, and judging                       by the corpses of his dismembered friends, he judged that                       a mummy probably tracked down one of them and must have                       killed them all. The horror of the undead rampage, combined                       with the mishap he barely survived, solidified his determination                       to change. <br>                      <br>                      Ozwyn looted what he could find, and enlisted in the Black                       Lotus Mercenary company. The Black Lotus guild of mercenaries                       was known to take almost anyone and not be too picky about                       the work they did. He served there for four years, serving                       out his term of duty well enough, but knowing at the end                       it was just not right for him. However, the experience had                       shown him a bit of the world, and that other possibilities                       were out there to be explored. <br>                      <br>                      It was then that he turned to the priesthood of Solusek                       Ro, and found his proper calling. The Clerical way gave                       him a sense of peace, and filled him with a commitment to                       make good the sins of his youth, and prevent people like                       his father from preying on others. He decided to travel                       the world and apply his new beliefs in the most direct,                       physical manner possible on the forces of evil. <br>                      <br>                      Almost immediately, he ran into Lord Hawke, and he expressed                       his ideas for fighting injustice, although not the reasons                       why. Along with Ravenn and Venomm they founded Scarab. The                       new guild quickly grew into a force to be reckoned with.                       In his time, he has served as assistant guildmaster, Master                       of arms, and Inner circle member.</font></p><br>                  </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><td colspan="2" width="1000" height="19"></td></tr></table></body></html>
