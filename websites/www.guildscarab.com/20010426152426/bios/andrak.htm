 About five weeks after I set out I met Javanno who showed me the ropes
 and then introduced me to the Scarab Leader's, Lord and Lady Hawke, who
 have become as a family to me. I would give my Life for Scarab if I had
 to. Since then I have started gaining strength and knowledge in the 
 lands we roam.</font></P>
