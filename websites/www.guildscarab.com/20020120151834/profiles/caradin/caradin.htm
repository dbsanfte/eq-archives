					<TD valign="TOP" colspan="2"><FONT class="text1">Caradin never heard from his parents and he never had any unknown visitors. Caradin learned ways of Quellious under Puab Closk, Master of The Ashen Order.  Closk taught Caradin for some 18 seasons to be calm, forgiving, and to seek the tranquil solutions to his problems and situations.  Throughout the training Closk noticed that although Caradin mastered his teachings well, he always seemed somewhat distant.  Puab could tell that there were outside influences in Caradin's thought processes.  Caradin's work for these first 18 seasons of his life consisted of back-breaking farming in the fields of The Ashen House.  Planting, tending, and harvesting crops was his life.  It was hard work that yielded many lessons in life and Caradin had grown to be a very wise monk as a result.  But yet, Caradin could feel something strange inside him.  Something just did not feel right but he could not pinpoint what it was.<BR><BR>Caradin made a drastic change, going against Closk's will.  Caradin wished for a new profession, he had grown weary of farming.  There were many young Ashen Order monks to keep up the farm, he felt he could do more.  Caradin began to hire himself out to the public at large as a Peace Keeper.  Individuals or even families would pay to have Caradin maintain a specific environment.  Caradin enjoyed his new work, it was quite lucrative and it also provided a great change from the farm work he grew up with.  Sometimes Caradin would work all through the night into the next morning.  This was very different from farming from sunup to sundown.  Caradin got great personal satisfaction from his new employment.  He liked assisting people find the right area they needed to be in, or directing a delivery for one of his jobs.  To be able to put in a hard days work and get paid with money was a great thing to Caradin but the part he enjoyed the most was when he was involved in a confrontation with people.  Maybe an individual had to much Elven wine and was a bit too rowdy or maybe a party of Dwarves wanted access to a celebration they were not invited to (everyone knows of a dwarfs' love of spirits and celebrations) and Caradin got to exercise his physical prowess in order to control the situation and insure compliance with the Host's rules.  These situations seemed to give Caradin greater inner bliss than he had ever known.  They seemed to scratch the itch festering inside him.  All those seasons of farming that feeling of unknown had grown into a craving, a restless state that eased when confronted with a situation that required a more physical solution.<BR><BR>Caradin could make no sense of these developments.  The fact that a monk of Quellious could be so satisfied from violence puzzled him, he turned back to Closk for guidance.  Puab offered no answers to Caradin but he vowed to help his young student and support him further in his efforts to discover the answers he searched for.  The apparent fact that Caradin had violent tendencies like the warriors he had seen in the cities around Norrath was a difficult starting point for his Knowledge Quest.  Caradin has some creed, unknown to him, festering inside him?  The QUEST continues...</FONT>
