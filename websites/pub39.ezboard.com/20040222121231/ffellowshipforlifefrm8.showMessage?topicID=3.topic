<br>
Charter-<br>
<br>
Fellowship for Life is more a family than a guild. We are a group of people that enjoy each other's company while journeying through the world of Norrath. We abide and play by the &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy that Verant enforces in-game. Aid when we can, ask for it only when needed. Respect other's rights to enjoy and play the game as well.<br>
<br>
Our goal is not to be the biggest or most prestigious guild on Tunare, but be a &quot;family&quot; of people that we each enjoy seeing and being with when we login. Welcome home to FfL!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Code of Conduct</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>General Conduct</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
We abide by all Rules and Policies as set forth by Sony Online Entertainment given such, GM’s decisions are upheld and FfL supports them.<br>
<br>
If there is a dispute/issue in-game, you are responsible for trying to resolve it yourself. Apologize if necessary, make restitution as needed and accept these with humility and grace when presented with them. If this is not enough, contact a GM with a petition. We cannot testify to that which we did not witness. REMEMBER: play nice! If the issue comes up in guild chat we are more than happy to be supportive and helpful but the onus for resolving the issue lies with each individual player.<br>
<br>
Although this is implied in SOE’s EULA, it is important enough to be mentioned. No profanity in Guild Chat. We are family oriented and have young ones that play/watch this game. Please show restraint.<br>
<br>
Although, per SOE, there is no camping of mob’s, we will respect another groups’ rights to an area if they were there first. If you wish to hunt in an area “claimed” by others, it is up to you to work out a solution in a respectable manner. If no solution can be met, petition a GM or hunt elsewhere. A good compromise to someone unwilling to share would be to request a /tell when they decide to abandon the camp.<br>
<br>
When attending raids not sponsored by FfL, you will abide the governing rules of the guild hosting the raid.<br>
<br>
Please respond to Officer directives in an appropriate and prompt manner. Officer’s are only upholding the Code of Conduct of the guild. You will never be asked to do anything unreasonable by an officer. Ignoring an officer’s request may result in disciplinary action.<br>
<br>
Duon's golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Any actions by you reflect the guild in both a positive and negative manner. Please take this into account when making decisions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Disciplinary Action</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
                <br>
Should it be brought to an officer's attention that you are detracting from another's gaming experience intentionally, the following discipline may be taken:<br>
<br>
a.       Disciplinary Probation<br>
Length of your probation will be determined based on the severity of offense.<br>
b.       Restitution<br>
Should restitution be required, it is up to you to take care of it right away. You will be under disciplinary probation until restitution is paid in full. <br>
c.       Removal<br>
Removal from the guild will occur on a majority vote of officers after a peer hearing after other disciplinary measures have been taken and failed.<br>
<br>
You have the option of requesting a hearing of your peers to plea your case for all disciplinary action.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ZERO Tolerance Policy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
The following behaviors will result in immediate removal with out a hearing upon receipt of GM notification / PC provided evidence.<br>
<br>
-Purposeful mob training. <br>
Regardless of how angry you are, or how well justified it may seem, this is not acceptable behavior.<br>
<br>
- Rude/Crude/Vulgar/Sexually Explicit Behavior<br>
Pretty self-explanatory. This is a game. You do not know who’s on the other end of the computer. Be respectful.<br>
<br>
-Stealing/Cheating<br>
This is extended not only to our guild but others as well. This includes but is not limited to: participating in item transfers of known stolen goods, misrepresenting trades, purposefully keeping items/cash that do not belong to you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>General Guidelines/Requests</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Use of Roleplay is encouraged for either those of us that are of in demand professions or for roleplaying purposes. Anonymous is NOT acceptable during any probationary period. All other members should use it only when necessary (when selling in the bazaar). After all we like knowing you are there and acknowledging your presence online.<br>
<br>
Fellowship for Life is part of The Ring alliance. The Ring is comprised of Honorable Blades Alliance, Nation of Chaos. Quintara Phoenix, Shadow of the Dragon and University of Norrath. All alliance members are to be treated as if part of the guild. Disputes with in the alliance are to be treated as all others with one exception. All disputes between alliance members are to be reported to an officer regardless of outcome.<br>
<br>
When placing priority on things it is requested you try to think in order of self, guild, alliance, group and others. This does not mean drop everything and come running if someone yells help. What is means, is if you are able to excuse yourself or if you are not committed to something when someone needs you, try to think of things in that order. Though, when thinking of self, if you do it 100% of the time, it will show. J <br>
<br>
Please be considerate when making requests of other members. Remember that they are also trying to play and may not always be able to drop what they are doing to help. If you ask, someone will offer if they are available. Remember, when a guild member helps you, they deserve the same respect you would give a stranger for help.<br>
<br>
When you are aware a guild member is in a raid, please do not initiate /tells while they are there unless it is an emergency and NO ONE else can deal with the issue. Please do not ask for assistance from a raiding member as they can’t help you.<br>
<br>
Please do not solicit power leveling. If a person offers that’s one thing. Specifically requesting it detracts from both your gaming experience and the experience of the power leveler. Power leveling takes away valuable experience required to play your character at higher levels.<br>
<br>
Out of mutual respect for all, please to do not beg others for items and/or money. Should you get a loan, pay it back !<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">ABOVE ALL</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
HAVE FUN! This is a game. We are here to help enhance the experience.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A NOTE from DUON</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
“Again I want to stress: the sole purpose of this guild is to gather a group of people who want to play together and socialize. If we have a member that other members do not wish to play with then we are not recruiting the right people in the first place. We are not actively seeking to enlarge but instead seeking those like ourselves and letting them seek us as well.”<br>
