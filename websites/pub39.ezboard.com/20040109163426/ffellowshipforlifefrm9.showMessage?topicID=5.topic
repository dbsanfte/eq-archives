Jyd and Lynn Shadetree lived in a modest cabin in West Karana, less than a days journey away from SureFall Glade. Jyd was a Ranger of some repute and Lynn a dabbler in the druidic arts. Jyd used to take young Oakminder to the Glade on business all the time. This lead to Oakminder becoming a Druid. As he went on these trips he began to notice his parents getting older and slower, while he remained relatively young. After sometime his Father passed away, he was just now considered an adult by those in the Glade, then shortly after his mother followed Jyd to Tunare's loving embrace.<br>
<br>
Oakminder left the cottage and stayed in Surefall as his home. One day while sitting under a tree another Druid named Wylin came up to sit near him. As they began to talk, Wylin told him something that he was suprised he had not realized earlier.... &quot;You have Elf Blood in you, you know right?&quot;<br>

Holly had been very understanding, but still insisted that he help by delivering a note to Kelethin. The trip didn't bother him until he took the ship from Freeport. He had never been so sick in his life! The moment they reached the dock, he jumped off the boat ran to the end of the pier and kissed the ground. THANK THE GODDESS! he thought.<br>
<br>
As he raised up from the ground he spotted a pair of boots standing in front of him. He further raised his head and sat on his knees staring eye to eye with a dwarf! Wow! A Dwarf! The dwarf stood there staring at him dourly, grumbled something under his breath about &quot;pointy ears&quot; and moved past Oakminder to the ship. Just then Oakminder's thoughts returned to himself. &quot;I am here, maybe I can get some answers&quot;<br>
<br>
The trip through the mountains was uneventful. As he entered into th Faydark, he marvelled at the trees! He had dreamedof this place ever since Jyd had told him about it. The trees were HUGE! As Oakminder continued down the path and came to a clearing, and there he stood dumbfounded. Four enormous stone spires reaching into the sky, like a hand picking a fruit from the clouds! As he walked forward under them he ran smack into someone!<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; said a female voice as he backed away from the robed fiure he'd just ran into. &quot;You must be new to the area! I am the Scion of the Faydark! Do you wish to journey to Luclin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um...&quot; Oakminder was confused,&quot; I... no, thank you. Sorry for running into you. Good day and may Tunare protect you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you need more portecting than me...&quot; the Scion smiled as she turned away.<br>
<br>
Oakminder continued on his way... as he turned a corner he caught a glimpse of a golden hued Castle wall, with towers and butresses. Flags waved lazily in a breeze in the trees. He spotted several tall lithe figures in armor standing at the gates. This must be Felwithe, he thought. Oakminder continued down the path.<br>
<br>
As he headed deeper in the woods he suddenly saw s graceful leather clad shape move through the woods towards him. A dog sized spider ran right across the path in front him. <br>
<br>
Then he heard a shout &quot;Halt in the name of Tunare you evil vermin! I shall slay you in the name of the Goddess!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The vision that stopped in front of him, waving about a rusty scimitar, transfixed him where he stood.<br>
<br>
&quot;H..Hello?&quot; he managed<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, no time. Gotta kill this nasty before he finds friends! They are social ya know!&quot; she said. For a she it was. A wood-elf female of great beauty. ...and off she rushed.<br>
<br>
Oakminder followed from a distance. She broke into a small glade just ahead. Oak stayed just outside the circle of trees. She was faced by 3 spiders! Fire errupted from her fingers and the one she had been chasing dropped and curled in on itself with a shriek. The other 2 began swiping their legs at her and one moved forward and bit her on the leg! She stagered but reagined her footing. Oakminder moved forward, words of Tunare pouring from his lips as he reached towards her and her skin sprouted green and brown thorns. The spider nearest swiped and chittered as it impaled itself onthe spikes. The Wood-elf started entoning words as well and her wounds glowed blue and faded. The last spider turned to run just as the rusty scimtar cleaved it neatly in twain!<br>
<br>
The wood elf tured to Oakminder and said &quot;Thank you sir! I am Jhayd, Druidess of Tunare. Very kind of you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Oakminder stood staring at her like an idiot...<br>
