I'm only young yet, I know, and not patient, but believe me, when I can't even save a warrior from a few orcs, when will I be ready for saving any damsel in real distress?<br>
Ok, I'll start at the beginning. I was wandering around Kelethin, just patrolling a bit, since the guards never really leave their posts, and I know adventurers of all sorts have been attacked out in the wilds, so I thought I might be able to help them. I didn't see anything for a while, well, aside from a few bats, and so I kept going. Had I been better at figuring out which way I was going, I might have known I was going north. But at the time, I had no idea. I was just walking, when I heard a shout for help! I looked around me, but couldn't see anyone, so I ran towards the sound. I came upon a halfling warrior beset by three blue monsters - orcs, they were, the foul beasts. He was bleeding from many wounds, but he had one orc almost dead; it was faltering and almost unable to lift its hatchet. The other two, however, were powerfully built and were not wounded at all. Shouting a challenge, I dashed into the fray and engaged one of the orcs. It would not have been honourable to attack from behind, but the stupid orc didn't turn at my challenge. I hit him over the head with my shield to get its attention, but it continued to attack the little halfling. Noticing how badly hurt the halfling was, I knew he was in trouble, even if I could kill this orc quickly. Fortunately for him, he killed the wounded orc as I watched, and turned to attack the big one that I was not engaging. Nevertheless, his sword drooped, and I could see he was trembling from exhaustion and blood loss.<br>
I redoubled my efforts on the other orc, but the stupid creature didn't even notice me - it continued to slash at the halfling with its sword, this time cutting a large gash above his eyes and causing blood to stream down, blocking his vision. But then, the bloodflow stopped, and a bluish glow appeared at the cut, as it slowly sealed. He was being healed! But I had no time to rejoice, because when the orc saw the healing, it turned immediately and swung at my head. I had not yet learned how to parry, so I managed only to back away a little and take a glancing hit. Now we were at it, standing only a few feet away, hacking and slashing with our swords. I had the best of it, and it turned to run. My sword took it straight in the back, and the lifeless body fell to the ground. <br>
Then I turned to the halfling, who looked much better, with only minor cuts and bruises. He dispatched the other orc as I watched and turned to thank me. I smiled, saying it was only my duty, wished him safe journeys, and he departed. I was a bit downcast, because I had really felt useless, being unable to heal him. It was only by Tunare's grace that someone else had healed him. But I should be more faithful. My duty is to persevere, not to question my abilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lluir@fellowshipforlife>Lluir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/6/03 1:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Forming a group</span><hr size=1> I turned to continue my patrol, and I saw a little wood elf - a druid, clearly, by the air of magic around her. She was quite pretty, and evidently skilled, by the way she held her scimitar and the shield in front of her. I hailed her, and bowed. She smiled at me, and asked if I would accompany her further so that together we could dispatch more orcs. I agreed. We exchanged names - her name was Silvitari, a lovely name, I thought. She told me that yet another lady would accompany us, by the name of Tendaria. I was surprised to find so many brave women out in this dangerous wilderness, and thanked Tunare for leading me to them. Tendaria met up with us fairly soon - she was a ranger, she said, and our tracks were easy to follow. I hadn't realized that I would be easy to track, and thought to bear that in mind in the future - I would not like enemies to track and follow me. <br>
The three of us walked up to the summit of a nearby hill to look around. I realized that there were several tents all around the hill, with orcs near almost every one. Silvitari pointed at one, and we walked towards it, stealthily, trying not to attract their attention until we were ready. <br>
Then Silvitari pointed at one of the orcs, and waved her hands in a strange, yet graceful manner. And to my surprise, the orc caught fire! Bellowing in rage, it charged her. Getting over my surprise, I stepped in the way and bashed it over the head with my shield. The battle went quickly. Two more orcs entered the fray but Tendaria took one and I the other. Truly, at this rate, Kelethin would be free of the orcish menace. <br>
But then, Tendaria apologized and said that she had not realized how late it was. She had an appointment in Kelethin and was already late. We were saddened by her departure, for she had been a skillful fighter, but there was nothing we could do but bid her farewell. Silvitari then said that she had spells to buy in Kelethin, and would be back soon. So I was left alone in the middle of an orc encampment. I saw a wandering orc and engaged it in battle, but before either of us had done much damage to each other, a singing warrior slashed at it from behind and killed it. I was a bit surprised, but supposed he thought I needed help. I thanked him, and then said that I could probably manage single orcs on my own. <br>
He looked at me disdainfully, muttered, &quot;Im campin here. Go to CB, collect belts.&quot; I was rather puzzled by his statement, but decided that I should leave him alone. Given how powerful he was with his sword, I did not want to be on the receiving end of his anger. <br>
As I left, I was still confused by his behaviour, so I almost ran into a lady dressed in robes; a wizard, I guessed. Startled, I jumped back, then realized my mistake, and bowed. She seemed not to mind, and smiled at me. I smiled back, politely, and apologized for my discourtesy. She looked puzzled, but did not comment. She asked if I wished to join her, for she and her friend were on a journey to the citadel of the orcs, Crushbone. I had never been there before, but the two of them seemed kind, so I agreed, saying that Silvitari would no doubt wish to join us as well. We waited for the druid, and Numenii (I am not quite certain of her name) introduced me to her friend Exodarin, a paladin like myself. He was more advanced than I, for he had just learned his first healing spell, and could even invoke courage in others, simply by waving his arms and saying something unintelligible.<br>
When Silvitari returned, she embraced Numenii happily. Apparently the two already knew each other. Then we set out for this citadel. Silvitari and Exodarin had no idea where they were going, so the three of us were following Numenii. We were attacked at the entrance to a tunnel by three orcs, but Exodarin and I each engaged one, while Numenii cast an amazing spell that set all three orcs on fire - they were screaming in pain. Soon they were dead, and our little group was victorious. Then Numenii explained that this cave was the entrance to Crushbone, so we should prepare ourselves before we entered.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lluir@fellowshipforlife>Lluir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/6/03 1:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Everything goes wrong</span><hr size=1> As Numenii led the way, Exodarin and I followed closely behind and Silv brought up the rear. We entered what seemed to be a valley, open to the air, but surrounded by mountains. A good place for a citadel - one entrance and easy to protect. There were a few orcs around, but we soon dispatched them; they were too weak to be a challenge for us. <br>
Then we rounded a bend and found ourselves facing a small castle. An enormous orc was guarding the large door, and Numenii told us to beware of such &quot;legionnaires&quot;. Looking at the size of it, I had no desire to meet it in solo combat unless I had to. Then an orc ran out from behind a tree at us, and we met it with swords ready. Again, little challenge for the four of us, so we settled down beside a wall, ready for any more such attacks. Silvitari wanted to meditate, and the rest of us were just resting and recuperating a little.<br>
Then, the castle door opened, and a whole group of creatures poured out of it. Two dwarves, an amazingly tall human, and what looked like an elven ranger, followed by five orcs, in hot pursuit. One of the orcs was large and stocky, but bedecked with quite fine armour. Numenii whispered to me, &quot;That's Lord Darish.&quot; The group of warriors seemed to be doing quite well against their foes, when the legionnaire beside the door charged them. Numenii decided to help them, so she set the legionnaire on fire. It didn't scream in pain as I expected, though; instead, it howled in pure rage and charged her. Exodarin and I both bashed at its head with our shields at the same time, trying to knock it unconscious, but it simply stopped, shook its head, and then sliced at us with its enormous sword. The fight went on and on, and Exodarin was getting rather hurt, while Silvitari tried to heal him a little and Numenii kept setting the orc on fire. I tried everything I could think of to get the legionnaire to turn its attentions on me rather than Exodarin, but it paid me no attention. Well, that's to say, until I drove my sword straight through its shin. Then it howled in pain and tried to limp away. Exodarin decapitated it from behind, and it fell to the grass. <br>
I was about to cheer at our victory when I felt a stabbing pain in my back. An orc had crept up behind me with a spear and stabbed me! <br>
Numenii yelled, &quot;It's an emissary! Watch out!&quot; I laughed grimly at the caution, and set my shield against this new enemy. Exodarin bravely jumped into the fight beside me. However, he was badly hurt, and the orc realized this, and, ignoring me completely, it slashed deeply into Exodarin's shoulder. Blood was pouring out, and I yelled to him to pray to Tunare for healing for himself! The orc slashed once more, and my friend was dead. Looking around, I saw another orc had engaged Silvitari and she was badly hurt, and Numenii was looking desperate as she cast yet another fire spell. Realizing that we could not prevail against such odds, I called to them to run, and I prayed to Tunare to heal Silvitari. She was completely healed as I finished my prayer, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Then, Numenii passed me, and then Silvitari, and I began to run. But Numenii turned the wrong direction! I called to her, but an orc hit her across the head, and she must not have heard me. Silvitari had a huge orc behind her, and I called to warn her, but she did not hear either, and she went down, holding her head. I could do nothing against such odds, but tried to get the orcs' attention. One hit me hard, and I realized I was rather badly hurt. Praying that they would get out alive, I ran for the tunnel entrance. I slumped down in the corner, and I saw the orcs turn back. How could Tunare let this happen? We were her paladins, her holy knights dedicated to turning back evil! We were allied with one of her holy druids, and a powerful wizard in her service. What had we done wrong? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lluir@fellowshipforlife>Lluir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/6/03 1:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Rebirth! Thanks be to Tunare!</span><hr size=1> As I lay in the corner, tears trickling down my face, a cheery voice said, &quot;Hello! I'm back!&quot; The voice sounded very familiar. I looked up. Exodarin was there! Alive, just as he had always been! I must have looked shocked, but he said that Tunare had sent him back from the dead. He still had work to do in this world. Then Silvitari and Numenii arrived. Silvitari was just as she had always been, though perhaps a bit subdued. Apparently being returned from death is a strange experience. Numenii came back - and she wasn't wearing anything but her undergarments! I turned my face away quickly. She said she had to go back to her body and take back her clothes, for she was so experienced that the gods had cursed her with this additional task each time she died; not only would she be returned to life, she would have to retrieve her possessions. A strange concept, to be sure, but I was so glad they were alive again, nothing else mattered. We decided we had enough of the orcs, and returned to Kelethin. As we dozed off for the night, we promised each other that one day, some time in the future, we would meet again and return to the fearful citadel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=4.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub39.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fellowshipforlifefrm8">New Members (Applications)<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm4">Public Forum<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm5">Raids, Get-togethers, and Alcohol Tolerance Boosters<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm14">Kael Raid Forum<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm7">EPICS!<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm10">DING!<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm9">Stories and Tales<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm12">Tradeskills Corner<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm16">Horizons Public<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm15">HZ Main Forum<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm3">Town Hall<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm13">Guild Treasury<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm2">Council Meeting</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife>Fellowship for Life</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9>Stories and Tales</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31b<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
