<br>
Charter-<br>
<br>
Fellowship for Life is more a family than a guild. We are a group of people that enjoy each other's company while journeying through the world of Norrath. We abide and play by the &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy that Verant enforces in-game. Aid when we can, ask for it only when needed. Respect other's rights to enjoy and play the game as well.<br>
<br>
Our goal is not to be the biggest or most prestigious guild on Tunare, but be a &quot;family&quot; of people that we each enjoy seeing and being with when we login. Welcome home to FfL!<br>
<br>
Rules-<br>
<br>
1. We abide by all Rules and Policies as set forth by Verant. GMs are the law and FfL shall adhere to all requests/directives by GMs.<br>
<br>
2. Although this is implied in rule number 1... no profanity in Guild Chat. We are family oriented and have young ones that play/watch this game. Please show restraint.<br>
<br>
3. Any member whose behavior may lead to Guild Disband, will be removed from the guild immediately.<br>
<br>
4. Respect and obey guild officers' directives. They are enforcing these rules as well as our Charter.<br>
<br>
5. All new members are on 30 day probation from the time they join. Probationary members do not have access to Treasury as well as other restrictions that may apply at a later date.<br>
<br>
6. All new members are sponsored by a full member or Officer. You are responsible for the behavior of your sponsored recruit. As such you are also responsible for making sure that FfL leadership is aware of the new member and your involvement. (guildmagic.com is a perfect way to do this)<br>
<br>
7-1. Duon's golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Any actions by you reflect the guild either way. <br>
<br>
7-2. Should it be brought to an officer's attention that you are detracting from another's gaming experience intentionally, the following discipline will be taken: a. Probation b. Restitution c. Removal. You have the option of meeting at the Officer's meeting to plea your case. <br>
<br>
8. If there is a dispute/issue in-game, you are responsible for trying to resolve it yourself. Apologize if necessary, make restitution as needed and accept these with humility and grace when presented with them. If this is not enough, contact a GM with a petition. FfL will abide by any GMs decision. We cannot testify to that which we did not witness. REMEMBER: play nice! If the issue comes up in guild chat we are more than happy to be supportive and helpful but the onus for resolving the issue lies with each individual player.<br>
<br>
9-1. Use of Roleplay is encouraged for either those of us that are of in demand professions or for roleplaying purposes. Anonymous is NOT acceptable during the probationary period. All other members should use it only when necessary. After all we like knowing you are there and acknowledging your presence online.<br>
<br>
9-2. This is more a request than a rule: Please be considerate when making requests of other members. Remember that they are also trying to play and may not always be able to drop what they are doing to help. If you ask, most of the time someone will offer to help. <br>
<br>
10. There has to be a tenth commandment. I dropped the stone tablet with 11-15 so 10 is all we get! RULE #10: HAVE FUN!<br>
<br>
And my 2 cents...<br>
<br>
Again I want to stress: the sole purpose of this guild is to gather a group of people who want to play together and socialize. If we have a member that other members do not wish to play with then we are not recruiting the right people in the first place. We are not actively seeking to enlarge but instead seeking those like ourselves and letting them seek us as well.<br>
<br>
 <p>Peace to you all! &lt;BR&gt;<br>
Duon Du'Others &lt;BR&gt;<br>
Cleric of Tunare &lt;BR&gt;<br>
Leader of Fellowship for Life &lt;BR&gt;<br>
a.k.a. The Big Giant Head &lt;BR&gt;<br>
