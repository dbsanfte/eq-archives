Not as in role, but as in RL. I just like to know how the ppl are I talk to and its always interesting to think about how each person on EQ is different and they each have a story to tell and such. Just want to make sure its ok with everyone tho. I dont wanna get anyone mad at me =) Oh, and if ppl decide to post stuff about themselves, i beg that ppl plz post the name of their alts in the guild. I have been very very confused about this. And sorry if anyone somehow manages to find this offensive or if you think its spam =P<br>

<br>
well EQ wise, i've been playing for about 6 months. in that time i've gotten 2 characters to lvl 40 (Shaeltar: 40 monk, and Syncastr: 41 Druid).  My first character was Shae but around lvl 10 i started Syncastr and played him pretty much non stop until 41 where i burned out on him, probably because of constant solo exp grinding from 36-41.  by the time Syn was 41 Shae was lvl 30 because i had played him some when i was bored or couldn't get a group with Syn. I used Syn to get Shae some nice equiment because i started playing him after the monk nerf (a sad sad day) and now Shae is nicely equiped and has really become my main because i really like playing him now.  My goal is to get my epic for Shaeltar and visit all the planes (hehe, silly goals).<br>
<br>
Well in real life, i'm 16 yrs old and live in Dallas, Texas. I go to Jesuit College Prep which is an all guys school. i'm in the band, marching and concert, and play the trumpet in each.  i'm also involved in drama doing the techinical stuff (lights and sound, though mainly sound).  i'm really into computers infact the one i use now i build my self and am slowly adding onto it and replacing things.  Built it as a P4 1.7ghz, 128mb SDRAM, ATI Radeon 7500 64mb video card. i have since upgraded to 512mb DDR SDRAM and added a nice Audigy Soundcard and a 4.1 speaker system.  Probably going to add ram here soon since the prices are going down alot.  My friend got me into EQ after he had played since EQ came out and thought i'd like it. i have since become more accustomed to EQ than he has but thats not really important.  I've also been recruiting other friends to play.  most of which had played before but had since quit and are now playing again. These include Juth (BST, 24 or 25 now) and Damlof (DWF WAR, roughly 11 or 12).<br>
<br>
I might add more later if i can think of anymore.

I used to play on Tunare, then I went to pvp on Rallos Zek, where I stayed for a long time. I went to pvp because most of my rl friends ( Gylan, Karean, Sokko, Tippen, Ybeu, Luvitarz, Driff, Patchey, Aeudar) were high lvl. All my Rl friends played on Tunare, but I liked pvp. I eventually decided to go back to Tunare. My goal on EQ is to become high lvl and help lowbies alot.<br>
<br>
Now in rl im 17 and live in a place called Kingsport, Tennessee. I was born in FL tho. Im a senoir in school, and enjoying every moment of it = P Why am I enjoying school? Because I have a chicken hand puppet with me today! I stick it in front of ppl's faces and yell =P Im not an annoying person, I just like having fun. I dont really act too much as myself in guild chat, because you all would prolly think Im crazy. I dont cuss or annoy ppl, i just say off the wall stuff.<br>
Im not in any school activities. I play guitar almost all the time. Im really into music. I listen to almost any type of music except rap. And i can tolerate country ( barely). I like punk grunge metal classical and celtic =P. I like EQ becasue I forget how much I really dislike the world when Im on it. Well,....except on pvp. Then you realize how cruel ppl can be. I am usually bored in Eq when I can find a grp, so I apologize if I talk too much in guild chat. I sometimes forgot everyone else is prolly busy when Im asking pointless questions. Im really glad you all accepted me in this guild tho. And sorry if this is boring you all, I kinda had to type fast and such. Welp, im goin, Olly-olly-oxen-free! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=duonduothers@fellowshipforlife>Duon DuOthers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/6/02 12:13:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~gelder/FfL/DuonSiG.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeing how this is pretty much a family guild...</span><hr size=1> Geez where to start, ok I play Duon 44 Cleric, Oakminder 32 Druid, Juul 16 Warrior and Augnaut 12 Mage. Oakminder is married in game to Jhayd Shadetree (who is also my RL sig other) Jhayd, myself and a few close friends decided to form this guild after being unhappy at our former guild(s), sad to say it was once much like our guild is (a Family of people who love to play and chat with one another) Ever since then neither she or I sleep (JK) Duon was my 2nd Character ever. Funny thing is he was great in the beginning then got miserable around the mid 20s. I kept at him and now look at him! 44! and will be 45 I think before the week is out.  I love playing him now more than ever.<br>
<br>
Not much to write about me in the Real World... all I do is play EQ hehe. Ahem... ok, I am 33, live in Bothell, WA(near Seattle) I live with Jhayd and a holy terror of a 5 year old. To pay for EQ I work for the largest cell phone manufacturer as the sole Tech geek in an office of 100+. Why do I come home and play on a PC after fixing them all day? To prove they actually have a REAL use... =) Hmmm oh and I like pretzels and Beer. There thats me in a nutshell. Beware, you now know more than the mere mortals I work with!<br>

Enonac's main is Toyrex, a 51st Warrior, but he likes playing Enonac much more.  He has been playing EQ for over a year now, and got me hooked as well.  I started playing last March.

I've been in EQ since June 2002, mainly playing Lluir Swiftbow, my wood elf ranger, currently 39. I have a few alts, Sbelus, high elf cleric, 15, being the highest. Fizby's my little gnomish wizard, only 4, and Anctos is my erudite pally, 6. <br>
Lluir started out life in Kelethin, did the usual grouping in CB, and then decided to go out and explore the world. Crossed the Ocean by boat, forgot to get a bind in Freeport, died... well, eventually figured out how to get back, and met up with three druids at the dervish camps in North Ro. Their names? Jhayd, Oakminder, and Syncastr! From then on, Lluir had a force behind his blades - three powerful druids with healing, snaring, rooting, damage, DoTs - you name it, they could do it. Meanwhile, I got to wave my sword - and then swords - at all manner of evil creatures and watch them fall over in sheer terror. <br>
Lluir joined Peace by Force at first, which was a wonderful guild, truly a family. And he was happy there, even though he often spent time with his three friends from Clan of the Redmoon and Divine Light (Syn - is that right?). Those three amazing druids led him to new and wonderful places, making him appear and disappear, run, swim, and even walk on and above water! Introduced to KFC, Lluir learned to slice aviak meat while his companions cooked it! <br>
And how could he forget when his friends transported him to the moon, no less! He brought all manner of strange creatures back to the waiting druids, from zelniaks to lightcrawlers. And he was introduced to yet another amazing friend - Duon! Though it's always a mystery why Oakminder always disappears when Duon appears... they really must not get along... <br>
And then it all came to a grinding halt as that terrible monster sometimes called RL reared its head. I took a break from this world for basically three months. And now I'm back!<br>
Ok... that was too long, sorry. About me in RL? Not too much to say - I live in Waterloo, Ontario.... I'm a student there, age 18, but currently I'm working as a programmer. <br>
Not much more to say...<br>
Sorry again for being so longwinded... <br>

<br>
In game I have been playing since June 2002. My first character was Aerrynn a wizzie. Well let's just say, may she rest in peace. Upon the urging of Duon Jhayd was born. Duon even named her. I started my life in Kelethin. I still don't know my way around that Tunare forsaken town. I met Syncaster at a very early age of like 5. We ran around Gfay for a few levels and were greeted on orc kill by Duon who saw fit to ensure we stayed alive...MOST of the time. Then off to Crushbone we went. Duon was kind enought to help us out there too. About the age of 13 or so we met up with a druid named Oakminder in North Ro at a dervish camp. After Northern Ro Desert we travel to the Karanas. Then came the 3 spawn aviak guard tower in Lake Rathe affectionaltely known by our little group as KFC. It was there that Oakminder and I both received our surnames. Shortly there after in a wonderful ceremony surrounded by all of our friends we were wed in Surefall Glade. Since then we have met many wonderful people and many great friends. In Iceclad we were lucky enough to meet Dirklor and Clubben and Enonac. A few days after we met Enonac we ran into Enonac and Jennat on the South Karana bridge. After a few groups it was like we had all been playing together forever. In my travels I have met many others..so many so that I could not possibly mention everyone here without writing a whole book. I am currently 47th season hoping to get to 50 by February. Maybe even start working on part of my epic. Hehe<br>
<br>
RL..Real Life I got into EQ because of Duon. Duon is my significant other and we have a 5 yr old that you'll see running around on occasion named Fattoes. We live near Seattle and often hang out with Enonac and Jennat in RL. We met on EQ and our families have become fast friends. Aalias and Pyama are also RL friends of ours, though we don't get to see them much since they live in ND now ...  we sure miss em. Okies, enough from me.<br>

Lets just say in a couple of days I will be 29 and holding. I live in Hampton, Tennessee. Which is about 45 minutes from Kingsport where I saw someone in the guild lives. As most of you know BerrAn and I live together with only one computer. I haven't been playing that long at all maybe about 2 months. My character is a lvl 14 druid and I can't seem to get her to 15. I think I am getting burnt out. Maybe if I could find more places to hunt but I am a chicken and I won't solo. BerrAn got me into playing EQ. I watched him play and would ask questions. ALOT. So I think he just got tired of me asking and made me a character. And now that is all I do. When he isn't here of course. There is still a lot that I need to learn but I am working on it. I don't have an alt because one is all I can handle.<br>
  <br>
In my spare time I play EQ (of course) and I clog. I have a 9 year old daughter that will be 10 this month. She has made her a character on here. Oh no!!! 3 people trying to use 1 computer. <br>
<br>
I really enjoy getting on and talking with you all. Everyone is so nice. And I really appreciate you all helping out BerrAn on his loss. Well I guess I have said enough. More than I intended on.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nukl3ar3klipse>Nukl3ar3klipse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/15/03 6:25:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeing how this is pretty much a family guild...</span><hr size=1> Hehe im the one in kingsport.

I was in madcap, union of the black dragon,and a few more I felt left behind and shunned.Maybe thats why I always want to help people as much as I can, I dont want anyone to fall in the cracks.One day I found the best set of peeps ever named Duon and Jhayd both kind and careing made me fill like a person more then a grafic.The rest is history we got together and here we are.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I play Aalias (51 Druid) along with my alts Bogus (26 Ranger) and Drilbane (17 SK).  I got into EQ because of Duon who is my RL best friend.  I have been playing since March of 99 (ouch - that long!?!).<br>
<br>
In RL I'm 37 (though I don't always act like it).  I live in Fargo, ND.  My wife, Pyama (Warrior 49), plays EQ as well as our four kids.<br>
<br>
I am a part-time student at North Dakota State Univ. where I am pursuing my BS/MS in Computer Science.  I'm interested in doing research into wearable computing, ubiquitous computing, and human-machine interfaces.  I have built and played with my own wearable computer (300Mhz Cyrix Media GX, 128Mb RAM, 40GB disk, head mounted display, cording keyboard).<br>
<br>
I'm a proud owner of a 93 VW Corrado SLC, another vice that Duon got me hooked on (evil cleric).  When I had cash I use to be somewhat of a fanatic about working on it.  Now it sits waiting for me to get a job again.<br>
<br>
I'm also interested in playing airsoft which is like paintball but using 6mm plastic BB (no they don't hurt).  Finally a vice that I can take credit for in Duon's life.<br>

My first character in Eq Is CLubben LvL 51 Warrior, Since then I have has so many different characters, I tried out just about every race and class combo to see what I liked. I cant play the same Character all the time, I'm totally bored with my warrior at lvl 51 is that wrong? Anyway when I started this epic stuff it kinda sparked it up again so i am happy again. My doctor told me I was a lvl 65 Paladin trapped in a lvl 51 warriors body. This was cool, and strange, I went to him for a Flu shot. Anyway to make a long story more complicated, This is my third Paladin, and Mobslayer is my favorite Paladin and He's a keeper. Hes about to ding 39 woot new spells! I also Have a LvL 32 Ranger Lariot, A 31 Shadow Knight Spiritsmasher this is my 6th sk, A 30 Beastlord Frozenwolf my 3rd Beastlord, A 30 Druid Stonecaster second druid, A LvL 26 Shaman Brokenhawk 4th shammy, And a LvL 26 Bard Battlehym 2nd bard ........Who I may be killing off.  <br>

 On a personal Note I was a Marine Corporal &quot;Delta Co 1/1 1st Btn, 1st Mar, 1st Mar Div, 15th MEUSOC, in case any other vets join, Did The Desert Storm Thing, I moved Back home to Chicago with my now wife. I'm currently a Chicago Firefighter/Medic, And my wife really hates me playing . I'm 33 years old, and have a 5 month old puppy &quot;Buddy&quot;, who likes watching be kill mobs that make animal noises. I'm in school too, U. of C.  Finishing up my degree in fire science. I am real good buddies in real life with Dirklor, and I think there are a great bunch of people in this guild. If you have been to other guilds and come here, this is a totally different thing. I have been asked on numerous occasions to leave this guild to join others but just wont do it. The guild is what you make of it and as long as the members coming in are of this quality it can only get better. My hats off to Duon and Jhayd who have done an Excellent Job!! You should give yourselves some awards!! Oh and Duon I make beer hehe. <br>

My guild characters are Darmer 49 cleric, Azzeb 20 SK, Anais 30 druid, Rowaen 35 bard, Tobeadar 15 cleric, Lomaklyn 50 pally. have been playing eq on and off since 99, really got into it this past couple years. I know fellow guildies Ahren, Ashnon and Elandroz very well away from game (have known Elan and Ahren since we were 5 years old!) and it is thanks to Elandroz that Ahren and I play eq at all and thanks to Ashnon that I started playing after a long hiatus. I'm 29 y.o have a beautiful wife and daughter (so I don't get as much game time as I would like!!) wish I had jenn and jhayd living near me to convince her to try the game hehehe. I have to say this is the best guild I've ever been in and I consider you all family and friends <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jennatnyteshad>Jennat Nyteshad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(2/13/03 8:15:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeing how this is pretty much a family guild...</span><hr size=1> Hmm..we could convince her...Ahren's wife too...Jhayd already got one of her other friends playing <br>

Maybe we should plan an guild vacation.....for this summer...Wives - Kids - Lots of EQ - Enon and I's house...Hosted by us with Jhayd and Duon's help of course...<br>
