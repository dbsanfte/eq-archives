(This is rather lengthy so I am doing it in two parts. This is dedicated to all of you who get into roleplay and make gaming a richer place, and for those of you who tolerate those of us who do <br>
I wish to give special thanks to Jetathia, for her contribution of Lural and the rest of the npcs that make up her family and to Rae's wife and mother-in-law's player for the same. We have met and explored many characters and places over the last seven years and I have had a great time. I love you both.)<br>
<br>
Evening was coming on in Shar Vahl, according to the waterclocks at least. The dim light deep inside the crater never changed. (Don’t tell me the sun doesn’t move here and there’s no way to tell time..how can there be an organized society and civilization without time? Maybe Ottoe knows the answers for this one?) The older guard signed out and headed towards the palace gates, on his way home.<br>
“Still sleeping on the couch, Ben?” <br>
The orange tiger coated male turned tired blue eyes to the pair guarding the entrance to the palace, in particular, Maras, the one who spoke. He gave a gruff growl in answer but kept going, hearing the pairs’ soft snickers behind him but not acknowledging them. He knew they took great joy in the fact that he, Royal Khala Dun Benjalim Ebonclaw, once decorated for his valor and bravery on the battlefield..was made to sleep on the couch by his very pregnant mate.<br>
His feet carried him past the great pool where the spiritists loved to gather. Across the square was the arena with two great statues standing in proud tribute. Beyond that was home but he veered off, heading instead to his favorite watering hole near the palace.<br>
The tavern was quiet, just a few patrons. Many seemed to prefer the one by the north bridge, perhaps because of the entertainment there. Ben settled himself on a stool at the bar and was greeted by Jakhal, the tavern’s proprietor. He ordered his usual cream liqueur, making a bit of small talk while he was served. More customers arrived, Jakhal leaving Ben to his own thoughts as he moved away to serve the newcomers.<br>
The appearance of a female at his side made Ben look over. She was a lithe orange tiger and she took the stool next to his. It was Jyk, the female in charge of the breeding and keeping of the tiger warders until they were paired with their Khati Sha companions. He offered to buy her a drink but it was, of course, declined. To most she was aloof and went about her affairs with a tough-as-nails demeanor, but Ben wasn’t fooled. He knew her greatest love was for the noble felines in her care and a small, fuzzy cub could turn her to putty in a heartbeat.<br>
Seeing her brought to mind his eldest sons. Twins they were, in some ways so alike, yet in others, so different. Raeshal was the eldest, the first born but he had a bit of a wild streak in him. It was little surprise to Ben when the spiritists suggested the path of beastlord might be his calling. The other, Rahaja, at times seemed a bit more stoic and responsible. He was training in the path of a Khala Dun, a warrior like his sire. Ben was proud of them both and at times wished their mother was still alive to see what fine males they grew up to be.<br>
Ben’s thoughts wound more back to the past, when he and his cronies were younger and just set free of their trainers to adventure and fight for their glorious city. A group of them was put together to go forth into the Tenebrous Mountains to scout and explore. There was himself, a fearless orange tiger female warrior named Marisa, a black-coated and quiet scout named Lural, a young spiritist to guide and heal them and two bards. Of the latter two, the black-masked female, Lilia, Ben was able to tolerate the most. The other, a lynx named Kalisto, seemed less serious and more prone to having a good time than wishing to accomplish anything. Even back then he was already very fond of his nip.<br>
Ben was drawn to the female bard and her sweet song but it was Marisa’s strength and fierce pride that won. He took the other warrior as his mate after a time and settled into his family home, feeling his life was complete. His father had long since passed, a casualty of one of the many skirmishes with the nasty grimlings in the area. His mother kept the house, an elder spiritist herself. Her white tiger coat was thinning, her once lavender eyes now sightless and milky. Her mind was still sharp and she seemed aware of much more than her appearance might suggest. The house was also shared by Tekel Kai, Ben’s older and unmated leopard-coated sister. She followed the path of the Taruun, the scouts, and seemed content to be wed to her profession.<br>
Time passed and Marisa presented Ben with the blessing of the twins. White tigers like their grandmother, the boys were near inseparable as cubs. Both full of life and mischief, they explored the city, the moor and the thicket as they grew. <br>
It had been Raeshal that suggested exploring the forbidden caverns off the moor. Too full of curiosity, he dragged his twin along. The caverns were murky and creepy, dank and sour, the pools glimmering with the small fish that called them home. Large bugs skuttled through the muck on the floor. It was a delightful playground for the two young male cubs. One passage looked like the next and before long they realized they were quite lost. Not long after, they realized their danger when the hissing of the fiends came to their ears, the creatures sensing the presence of an easy meal nearby.<br>
About this time, a scout returned to the Ebonclaw home, bearing the urgent news that the boys had been spotted entering the caverns by one of the patrols. Both parents knew the dangers there and they quickly organized a party to go in after the cubs. They both called upon Lural again, who by now was gaining much status in his own faction. “Lural the Lurker” was a name whispered, sometimes in dread, on the quiet streets.<br>
The rescue party entered the complex cavern system and worked their way inside, trying to track the pair. Small bands of fiends were dispatched along the way as the frantic parents tried to find their offspring before it was too late. Time was indeed running out and the party found the cubs, spotted in a muddy niche up on the wall in a chamber filled with hungry, hissing fiends. The cubs were cowering and hissing at the fiends who tore at each other as they fought to reach the tender morsels. <br>
“Mama! Dad!!” Rahaja spotted them and waved, losing his balance on the slippery ledge. His cries of fear as he slid down into the writhing mass of fiends was nearly drown out by his twin’s desperate cry as he tried to hang onto him, to no avail. Another sound rose in the chamber, the enraged roar of a mother as she leapt and charged into the mass of fiends, her sword flashing. Chaos ensued as the party tried to fight their way to the cubs, more fiends swarming into the chamber, drawn by the hungry cries of the others. Ben tried to keep close to his mate but she was forced away by the mass of dreadful creatures. Lural made it to the ledge and plucked the frightened remaining cub from his sanctuary, passing him quickly into the arms of a waiting shamaness. The fighting grew desperate, Rahaja was no where to be seen, having been dragged off by a fiend greedy over his prize and unwilling to share. A scream of pain filled the chamber and Ben looked in time to see Marisa go down under a mass of tearing fiends, too far away for any of them to aid her.<br>
The next few moments, indeed, hours, passed by in a blur to Ben. Rage and grief consumed him, bestial snarls and roars punctuating his attacks. He was unaware when the decision was made to retreat, lest they all be lost. No memory remained of his being forced back with the rest of the party to the safety of the moor. Days passed, and weeks while he became obsessed with the recovery of his mate and lost child. The remaining twin was left to the care of his aunt while Ben spent nearly every waking moment going with the patrols and any recovery party he could organize. A few gruesome remains of his mate were finally discovered but there was no sign of the other cub and Ben finally lost hope.<br>
Twins born to the Vah Shir were considered a lucky thing. Now one twin was presumed dead and his mother lost with him. In a society ruled by superstition and spirits, Raeshal suddenly became an anathema to his people. Having just accepted the path of the beastlord and gotten his warder, he departed his home to explore Norrath and beyond.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Venerable Raeshal Ebonclaw</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
Ben shifted on his barstool and drained his drink, signaling for another. He wasn’t quite ready to go home yet; his mind was still busy exploring the events that comprised his life thus far.<br>
<br>
Marisa had been a good mate to him but some time after the twins were born, she became more focused on her children and her career. Ben always had been one drawn to the graceful sweeping of a tail and even from their past adventuring, there was a draw for him to the masked bard. The affair had been brief, both of them losing the restraint that bound them for a time. It was by mutual consent too that they shelved it. Despite his waywardness and Lilia’s enchantment, Ben refused to leave Marisa and his children. Lilia drifted from him and found solace instead in the company of Kalisto, to Ben’s quiet dismay. Lilia knew of her condition when they ended the affair but kept it from Ben, not wishing to fuel his decision one way or another. He was rather disgruntled when he did find out he was to be a father again, but Lilia refused to give any quarter. She insisted that he stay with Marisa, she was happy with Kalisto and she hoped he would at least do his part in helping to guide their child.<br>
<br>
By this time Kalisto had given up on adventuring, instead turning his energies to the other young bards in the city. He opened a shop called Heartstrings, hired a few craftspersons to help him fashion finely crafted string instruments and continue the teachings of the guild. He and Lilia lived there in an apartment upstairs and it was there that Ben’s third child, another son came into the world. He was black-masked like his mother but had his father’s blue eyes and later noted, his father’s way with females. Ben named him Keshi and he became the delight, and the bane, of his elder brothers.<br>
<br>
It was Keshi who was Raeshal’s sunshine in those last months before he left his home. Raeshal grieved the loss of his mother and brother and accepted his fuzzy young warder with enthusiasm. Greatly believing the ways of the spirits, he was certain the young tiger cub was really the lost spirit of his twin, sent back to be with him and protect him. It was perhaps the naming the tiger “Rahaja” that was the young beastlord’s final undoing. Ben could take no more, and ordered his son and the unlucky spirits around him to be banished. Keshi was less inclined to be swayed by such things as spirits, but he quietly accepted his older brother’s pronouncement, assuming the ordeal had completely addled him. He sorrowed over the leaving of his last remaining sibling and turned his energies to mischief-making.<br>
<br>
The next few years passed, Keshi being welcomed in his father’s house but keeping Heartstings as his home. He adored his mother and was greatly amused by Kalisto, who by now was never without the ever-present catnip pipe. His own voice deepened into a rich baritone but he had little patience for the history of their people, nor any aptitude for playing an instrument. He was curious by nature and blessed with a certain amount of stealth. His stealth served him well as he developed a craving for the enchanting company of those of the female persuasion. His enthusiasm and charm won him access to the chambers of numerous wives, daughters, mothers and sisters in the city. Ben’s sister, Tekel, hoped to rein some of that energy in and quell the city’s latest plague. She referred him to Lural and Keshi began his training as a Taruun.<br>
<br>
During this time, Raeshal was busy exploring the strange world of Norrath with his warder. He met many people, strange and furless people and a handful of his own kind. He joined a guild of other adventurers and there met some elves. One in particular he grew to trust was a golden-haired wood elf named Lyavain. This elf had many friends, one of them being another woodland elf of a shadier reputation named Grathgor. Rae learned that Grath wasn’t from around Norrath, but had been guided to a portal to this world by someone from Grath’s own home who used to visit here. Lyavain had returned there with Grath before and for a time had a relationship with one of Grath’s tribe members. The relationship ended but he remained welcome among the elves. Learning of Rae’s interest to see more places, he offered to take him along on his next visit there. Rae quickly agreed. Lyavain wasn’t sure how the elves would react to the catman and his tiger companion so he suggested to Grath that perhaps he should take him to the city nearby. Grath was friends with some key citizens there, he knew, perhaps he could introduce him to someone. <br>
<br>
What Lyavain didn’t realize was Grath’s exact relationship within the city of men. The kingdom was balanced on a very delicate web and a complex network of law and disorder. Known to few, Grath was the woodland representative in the city’s guild of rogues and thieves, as well as a long-time friend of the Crown Prince and his adopted brother, who was the seneschal at the time. It was to the seneschal, Lord Buckinghart, and his wife that Raeshal was introduced. The lord and lady themselves had a large family, which included their own eldest, a pair of twins. A young man and woman, they were as unalike as any twins could be. The young woman was much like her mother, with emerald eyes and coppery curls. She was mostly human, part elven and most enchanting. Rae became smitten.<br>
<br>
Raeshal and Siobhan were wed there, much to her parents’ dismay. Neither knew what to make of this tigerman and this sudden and unmistakable bond that sprung up between him and their daughter. They were loathe to let her go but left with little choice. Rae bravely returned to Shar Vahl, to face his past and his family. Lilia and Kalisto welcomed them and it was Lilia who braced herself and returned to Ben’s home to give him the news. Seeing Lilia again, hearing of his son’s return and with one of them for a mate stirred his emotions into a crazy mix. <br>
<br>
Ben drained his glass and rose from the barstool. He left a generous tip for Jakhal and made for the door. Things had a way of working themselves out. Not long after Rae’s return home with his strange bride did Rahaja return to them. He had been carted off but not killed, rescued by a reclusive band of humans that traded with Shadow Haven. His injuries and ordeal left him bereft of his memory for a time. Rahaja’s return could only indicate that Ben was wrong, Rae was not the bringer of evil spirits afterall, and for whatever reason, perhaps he was meant to be with this strange woman. Indeed, after Lilia’s arrival at his door the second time, to bring news of Rahaja’s return, the pair realized that perhaps even their paths must be as one. Lilia left Heartstrings, with Kalisto’s blessing. The other male knew it was but a matter of time before the couple took off their blinders and saw what was so obvious to everyone else. Yes, things had a way of working themselves out.<br>
