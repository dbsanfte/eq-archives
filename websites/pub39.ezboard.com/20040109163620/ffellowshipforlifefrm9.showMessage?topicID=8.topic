I figured I'd throw a story in of my own.  It's actually a true story, only the names have been changed to protect the idiotic.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
     It was a typical day in unrest.  The clouds were dark, the air was stale and that oh so interesting smell of death lay heavy around us. We were a small group, made up of a striking Barbarian Shaman named Sara, Elric our crafty Half-Elf Rogue, Drogin, the untested Dwarf Cleric we found wander near the fountain yelling something about needing a grope or something, and our &quot;hero/moron&quot; of the moment: Elandroz the Scared! Enchanter to some, &quot;Breeze please!&quot; to most.<br>
<br>
     Elandroz had been first lead to Unrest three days prior by Darmer, a small, yet brave Cleric who knew his way around this vile, disgusting domain of undead, a wonder he felt so at home there.  Darmer had conned Elandroz to Unrest with promises of riches and treasures beyond any he had seen.  So, scared and nervous, Elandroz followed this insane dwarf<br>
past the fountain around the hedge maze and along the wall to a place that Elandroz would call home for the next week.<br>
<br>
     It was here that Darmer passed a word of advice to his young friend that was followed to the letter all but one time.  As we all know, one time is all it takes. Darmer, as serious as he could be, told our hero &quot;If you see the word 'train', don't think twice, don't think once!  Just RUN, Gate, whatever, just get out of the zone!&quot;<br>
<br>
     So Darmer left, and Elandroz settled into a small group around his same level, 19.  The first day was a bit chaotic, but he didn't die too many times, and for the most part came out ahead.  However, he did realize that he was missing a rather important spell: Area Effect Mesmerize.  So that next morning he set out with the task at hand and before the day was through, had his new spell and a boost in his ego. <br>
<br>
     Back to Unrest, a new day, a new spell, and a new man. Gone was the scared, robe wetting Elf.  In his place was a proud, strong High-Elf Enchanter.  It was this day he met Sara and Elric.  It was that day Elandroz learned his proper place in a well-equipped group. Healers came and went, but the 3 originals stayed.  They knew they had a good team that worked well together. Rogue pulled, Shaman healed, and Enchanter controlled the crowd.<br>
<br>
     By day 3 Elandroz was proud and cocky, he already had several stories to tell about saving the group from bad pulls, as well other groups.  He was the man.  All was well, and he was starting to finally see a bit of loot, enough in fact that they all had to leave to go sell. <br>
<br>
     They left together, and as they got to the fountain someone screamed &quot;TRAIN&quot; and suddenly a warrior ran past the fountain heading to zone. Behind him was a horde of some of the ugliest mobs one could find in this pit of despair.  Suddenly Elandroz, being the &quot;MAN&quot; that he is, realized he could save this poor soul from his fate with the cast of a simple, yet powerful spell.  <br>
<br>
     As fast as the train came, Elandroz set his mana to boil and fired an AE MEZ square on the poor fighter's person.  Realization hit fast as the entire train save one, turned, unfazed and ran for the now wet Enchanter.  All was not lost however, Elandroz still thinking fast on his feet realized his stupidity and not wanting to entrap his teammates within the claws of idiocy, bolted for the house of undead. As he ran,<br>
his teammates watched in horror as his health and speed dropped lower and lower.  Some how the struggling Enchanter managed to make the front porch of the house before finally falling to the fury of his own doing. By this time the warrior managed to make it to the zone and was safe from harm, and the lone mob on his tail was quickly dispatched by nearby adventurers.  <br>
<br>
      Later, as Elandroz returned to his bind just outside the zone, he was greeted with hearty thanks from not only the now safe warrior, but also several others that had witnessed the show.  He learned that after his death on the stoop of the house, the mobs responsible, no longer having a target, looked around at each other, shrugged, and returned to their rooms.  Elandroz, embarrassed by his stupidity, was surprised to find himself being called brave and selfless.  And having had a discussion of what Sir name to take an hour earlier, it was decided and agreed on by everyone in the group that this day, Elandroz Trainbraker earned his name. <p>&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#00E673&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Elandros Trainbraker&lt;br&gt;<br>
