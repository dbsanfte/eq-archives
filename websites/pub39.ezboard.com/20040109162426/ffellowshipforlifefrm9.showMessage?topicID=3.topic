Naturally, the big people needed my help again, since they could never take down an orc pawn as magnificently as I. Fire and ice are such beautiful tools when used correctly.<br>
While I was doing this service to them, and receiving no thanks, I might add, a ranger came up to me and slapped me! I was affronted. Here I was, helping the elves with the defense of their homes, and this elf dares slap me? Then he challenged me to a duel. Considering him carefully, I noticed that he was far more than my equal in experience, as he had learned his first spells, while I had only attained my 4th season. Nevertheless, an insult was an insult, and I accepted his challenge. Immediately rooting him to the ground, I encircled him with fire and shocked him with frost. The whelp would pay! But he was much more than my equal, and my spells did little to deter him. In fact, finding he was snared, he began to shoot arrows at me, more potent even than my spells. Outmatched, I dashed behind a tree to regroup, and soon he followed me, when my spell gave way. <br>
I tried a different method this time. As he approached, I faded out to reappear behind him, and soon flames encircled him as I cast my spell. He turned around only to see me fade yet again. Then the tables began to turn. As I faded out, he cast his spell: Snare! Caught by his trap, and running out of mana, I was hit hard by several of his arrows as he ran towards me. I faded out just barely in time, and ran deeper into the forest, so that he would not pursue me. Soon out of breath, I sank down behind a tree to meditate and consider another strategy. <br>
Just then, I heard a telepathic whisper in my head - the whelp dared to contact me and suggest that I could flee to another area where I would be safe. Naturally, this would declare him the victor. I scorned his offer, telling him that he could flee from me if he wished. He replied again, telepathically, saying that he did not know how to continue to fight me if he did not know where I was. My only answer was to laugh. A ranger can't find a gnome in his own forest? <br>
Not having any way of healing myself, I sat under the tree for quite a while before I dared venture back to face him again. Then, drawing my dagger, I decided to let the tall fool know what steel feels like in his skin!<br>
He still seemed to have no idea where to find me, so I crept up behind him and stabbed him in the back, doing my best impression of a rogue. As I hit, I began to cast my spell, and fire hit him in the face as he turned around in shocked surprise. Unfortunately, his armour was well-made, and my blade did little to pierce it. And the flames did but singe his hair a little. Then he swung his sword - a blade fully half my height or more! I tried to dodge, but I wasn't fast enough. Blood spilled on the ground, and I backed away from him. He advanced on me, only to find I had run behind him and stabbed him in the back again. Unfortunately his armour turned the blade yet again. I spun around him, trying to follow his back and dig my dagger in, but a well-placed kick from him almost threw me to the ground. Bruised and bleeding, facing a powerful foe, I faded out, cast flames on him, and retreated to meditate.<br>
This time, however, I was not fully healed, when I noticed to my horror that the plants around me were ensnaring me! Jumping to my feet, I faded out as quickly as I could, but not before an arrow pierced my shoulder. Ripping it out, ignoring the pain as my blood coloured the grass red around me, I ran. Having nowhere to go, and him close behind me, I faded out, hid behind a tree, and thought fast. Ahead of me was the great, bloated corpse of an ogre. Unpleasant to be sure, but when you're running for your life, any hiding spot is welcome. I ran up to it, and lifted the great arm and sat down, fully hidden beside and beneath the enormous body. I saw the ranger approach, but ignored him, trusting in my place of concealment. And so it proved, he walked straight past me, and I smiled to myself.<br>
He came back, however, for he must have been tracking me, and I watched him closely. He walked past me again, not noticing me at all. Then I dashed out, trying to appear as if I came from the nearby tree, and stabbed him from behind. He whirled, but only in time to see me fade out. I was about to freeze him again, when to my utter dismay, he disappeared. I tried to cast my spell on the area where he had been, but there was nothing to centre the spell around. Having no idea what to do, I ran away to hide beneath a tree and meditate again. This was an unexpected turn of events. He had been barely wounded at all, while I was consistently having to retreat strategically to save my life. I sat down to meditate, but no sooner had I cleared my mind than an arrow hit me in the leg. I stood up as quickly as I could, grimacing in pain, and saw him charging me, sword drawn. Turning, I saw an interesting tree creature behind me, and arborean. I ran straight towards it, ignoring as it scraped clawed branches along my arms and brushing away its attempts to impede my progress. The ranger followed blindly behind me and luck was with me, for the ranger attacked the arborean, giving me time to flee. Badly wounded yet again, I found the ogre's corpse near which I had hid before, and returned to my hiding place.<br>
Soon, however, the ranger returned, giving me time only to recover from the worst of my injuries. He walked near me, almost stepping on me, but continued past. Breathing a sigh of relief, I cleared my mind as I continued to meditate. Then, to my horror, the plants around me entwined into a snare! An arrow whistled over me, just barely grazing the top of my head. He had realized my plan, and my safe hiding place was no longer safe. I cast fade, but was interrupted as an arrow hit my hand in mid-gesture. I ran to one side, trying to avoid his arrows. I stopped only to cast fade and then dash off in another direction. Coming to a new glade amidst the trees, I saw the body of another dead ogre. This time, I thought I would be cunning. I hid behind a tree very close to the ogre, and waited for the ranger's tracking to lead him here. Surely, I reasoned, if he saw the ogre's corpse and my tracks leading towards it, he would assume that I was hiding there again.<br>
And so he did - he went immediately to the corpse and discovered I was not there! I stood, ran up behind him, and stabbed him, doing significant damage for a little dagger like mine. He turned around again - he certainly felt steel that time! Then I faded out, grinning evilly at him. I cast flames on him, and then ran behind a tree to avoid his arrows. Then an orc centurion decided to interrupt our duel by attacking me. Knowing my companion could easily deal with the dim-witted orc - fighters have much in common, don't they? - I led the orc right to him, though I took some serious damage from the orc's sword as I ran. Seeing both me and the orc, the ranger stood his ground and hit me with an arrow, spilling my blood all around. I kept running, and managed to get past him, while he engaged the orc. I limped off to a tree to meditate and heal, hoping the orc would occupy him for a while. It was not to be, and he came after me quickly, so quickly that I was lucky to avoid the second arrow before I faded out yet again. Now I was running for my life, without mana, spilling blood all over the ground as I ran, I did not know what to do. I considered fleeing, but what would that say about gnomish honour? I could run to the guards, where he would never dare attack me, but again, this would be unseemly. I decided to give him his victory, safe in the knowledge that I could hold on for longer, and that he knew this too. I returned to him, laid down my dagger, and sat before him, head bowed for the final stroke. He brought his sword down quickly, and thank the gods, my valor in battle was rewarded. I was returned to this world, fully dressed and equipped, on a platform high up in the tree city. The ranger came to me, and saluted me. He gave me a gift, of boots to protect my feet, in honour of my valiant fight. I thanked him, and reminded him never, ever to underestimate a gnome again. Now, as I go to sleep, I think ahead to another time, when perhaps I can challenge him to another duel. An equal duel. One I shall win.<br>
