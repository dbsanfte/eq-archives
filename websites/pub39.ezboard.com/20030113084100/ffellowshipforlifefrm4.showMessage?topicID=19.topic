Not as in role, but as in RL. I just like to know how the ppl are I talk to and its always interesting to think about how each person on EQ is different and they each have a story to tell and such. Just want to make sure its ok with everyone tho. I dont wanna get anyone mad at me =) Oh, and if ppl decide to post stuff about themselves, i beg that ppl plz post the name of their alts in the guild. I have been very very confused about this. And sorry if anyone somehow manages to find this offensive or if you think its spam =P<br>
<br>
(oh yeah, can someone plz telling me if its ok to use html on the boards? )<br>
<br>
Oh-well, take care ppl....bye bye. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nukl3ar3klipse>Nukl3ar3klipse</A> at: 12/2/02 9:04:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syncastr>Syncastr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Woof Woof</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/2/02 9:42:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeing how this is pretty much a family guild...</span><hr size=1> ezboard won't let you use HTML unless you sign up for ezSupporter ($12 i think) and you get no popups and a few other things.<br>
<br>
well EQ wise, i've been playing for about 6 months. in that time i've gotten 2 characters to lvl 40 (Shaeltar: 40 monk, and Syncastr: 41 Druid).  My first character was Shae but around lvl 10 i started Syncastr and played him pretty much non stop until 41 where i burned out on him, probably because of constant solo exp grinding from 36-41.  by the time Syn was 41 Shae was lvl 30 because i had played him some when i was bored or couldn't get a group with Syn. I used Syn to get Shae some nice equiment because i started playing him after the monk nerf (a sad sad day) and now Shae is nicely equiped and has really become my main because i really like playing him now.  My goal is to get my epic for Shaeltar and visit all the planes (hehe, silly goals).<br>
<br>
Well in real life, i'm 16 yrs old and live in Dallas, Texas. I go to Jesuit College Prep which is an all guys school. i'm in the band, marching and concert, and play the trumpet in each.  i'm also involved in drama doing the techinical stuff (lights and sound, though mainly sound).  i'm really into computers infact the one i use now i build my self and am slowly adding onto it and replacing things.  Built it as a P4 1.7ghz, 128mb SDRAM, ATI Radeon 7500 64mb video card. i have since upgraded to 512mb DDR SDRAM and added a nice Audigy Soundcard and a 4.1 speaker system.  Probably going to add ram here soon since the prices are going down alot.  My friend got me into EQ after he had played since EQ came out and thought i'd like it. i have since become more accustomed to EQ than he has but thats not really important.  I've also been recruiting other friends to play.  most of which had played before but had since quit and are now playing again. These include Juth (BST, 24 or 25 now) and Damlof (DWF WAR, roughly 11 or 12).<br>
<br>
I might add more later if i can think of anymore.   If you have any questions i'd be happy to answer them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.swbell.net/caeser/joint1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Syn is Level 41 now, and Shael is 40.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nukl3ar3klipse>Nukl3ar3klipse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/3/02 9:02:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeing how this is pretty much a family guild...</span><hr size=1> Ok well lets see.....On EQ i just play Schyphex. I used to play on Tunare, then I went to pvp on Rallos Zek, where I stayed for a long time. I went to pvp because most of my rl friends ( Gylan, Karean, Sokko, Tippen, Ybeu, Luvitarz, Driff, Patchey, Aeudar) were high lvl. All my Rl friends played on Tunare, but I liked pvp. I eventually decided to go back to Tunare. My goal on EQ is to become high lvl and help lowbies alot.<br>
<br>
Now in rl im 17 and live in a place called Kingsport, Tennessee. I was born in FL tho. Im a senoir in school, and enjoying every moment of it = P Why am I enjoying school? Because I have a chicken hand puppet with me today! I stick it in front of ppl's faces and yell =P Im not an annoying person, I just like having fun. I dont really act too much as myself in guild chat, because you all would prolly think Im crazy. I dont cuss or annoy ppl, i just say off the wall stuff.<br>
Im not in any school activities. I play guitar almost all the time. Im really into music. I listen to almost any type of music except rap. And i can tolerate country ( barely). I like punk grunge metal classical and celtic =P. I like EQ becasue I forget how much I really dislike the world when Im on it. Well,....except on pvp. Then you realize how cruel ppl can be. I am usually bored in Eq when I can find a grp, so I apologize if I talk too much in guild chat. I sometimes forgot everyone else is prolly busy when Im asking pointless questions. Im really glad you all accepted me in this guild tho. And sorry if this is boring you all, I kinda had to type fast and such. Welp, im goin, Olly-olly-oxen-free! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=duonduothers@fellowshipforlife>Duon DuOthers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/6/02 12:13:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~gelder/FfL/DuonSiG.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeing how this is pretty much a family guild...</span><hr size=1> Geez where to start, ok I play Duon 44 Cleric, Oakminder 32 Druid, Juul 16 Warrior and Augnaut 12 Mage. Oakminder is married in game to Jhayd Shadetree (who is also my RL sig other) Jhayd, myself and a few close friends decided to form this guild after being unhappy at our former guild(s), sad to say it was once much like our guild is (a Family of people who love to play and chat with one another) Ever since then neither she or I sleep (JK) Duon was my 2nd Character ever. Funny thing is he was great in the beginning then got miserable around the mid 20s. I kept at him and now look at him! 44! and will be 45 I think before the week is out.  I love playing him now more than ever.<br>
<br>
Not much to write about me in the Real World... all I do is play EQ hehe. Ahem... ok, I am 33, live in Bothell, WA(near Seattle) I live with Jhayd and a holy terror of a 5 year old. To pay for EQ I work for the largest cell phone manufacturer as the sole Tech geek in an office of 100+. Why do I come home and play on a PC after fixing them all day? To prove they actually have a REAL use... =) Hmmm oh and I like pretzels and Beer. There thats me in a nutshell. Beware, you now know more than the mere mortals I work with!<br>

Well, most of you know already, Enonac and I are married in RL.  We live in Washington as well, about an hour south  of Duon and Jhayd (hence the lan party over Thanksgiving)  I'm not gonna tell you our ages, but lets just say when you see Cekkou, just think, she is our RL 13 year old daughter, hehe<br>
<br>
Enonac's main is Toyrex, a 51st Warrior, but he likes playing Enonac much more.  He has been playing EQ for over a year now, and got me hooked as well.  I started playing last March.  Got burned out Jennat at around 12th lvl and took about a month off, then came back and just pushed through, and look at me now, almost 42..<br>
