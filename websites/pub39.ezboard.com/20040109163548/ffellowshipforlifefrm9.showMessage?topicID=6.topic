A small, lithe form slips quietly between the trees, barely noticeable to all but the most skilled observer. It is a wood elf, padding silently along between trees and around spiders, clearly intent on his destination. The bow on his back marks him a ranger, in case there was any doubt after this masterful display of woodscraft. As he nears his goal, he slows down, proceeding with even greater caution, which is not surprising considering where he is going. Just ahead, a campfire glows, and around it, a press of enormous bodies. This is the home of the ogres, and wood elves are not welcome here. Yet he moves closer, and then stops, grasps a low-hanging tree branch, and pulls himself up, silently. Then, perched in the dark foliage of the tree, he listens.<br>
<br>
&quot;You call yourselves worshippers of Rallos Zek? The terrible God of War? And what do you do? You skulk in the bushes while others tread on your own lands! Your once-mighty empire, conquered by who? The elves, with their terrible magics? The humans, breeding like rabbits? No, I tell you! The dwarves are on your lands! The puny, short, stout drunkards with kettles on their heads! You have been forced to flee by these misfits, these midgets! Fie upon you!&quot; At the centre of the ogre circle, an imposing dark elf stands. Almost as tall as an ogre, he is dressed in armour as black as the night itself. The light from the fire is completely absorbed by the unholy metal, and only his face shows, blue-skinned, crowned by a veritable mane of black hair. After speaking, he folds his arms and gazes insolently, almost challengingly, at the ogres in front of him. A murmur goes through the crowd, but no one comes forward to speak. <br>
<br>
&quot;You have named your city Oggok! Revenge, you say? I tell you, the time for revenge is now! The planes have been opened, even unto the domain of the god Rallos Zek! March on Kaladim! Kill these pitiful midgets and bring glory to his name, and he will come down among you! This is the end of the Age, and war shall spring up in all the lands of Norrath. Oggok! Arise and fight!&quot; The ogres, perhaps not realizing what they had just agreed to, began to cheer, waving their enormous swords and spears above their heads. Then, one by one, they began to chant. Perhaps a chant from long ago, the shamans began it, slowly and powerfully. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oggok! Oggok! Oggok is ours! We were driven from our homes! We shall return, the dwarves will pay! Oggok! Oggok! Oggok!&quot;<br>
<br>
The chant grew louder and faster, as ogres began shouting and clashing their swords together in their frenzy. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oggok! Oggok! Oggok is ours! We were driven from our homes! We shall return, the dwarves will pay! Oggok! Oggok! Oggok!&quot;<br>
<br>
Drums began to beat and ogre shouts echoed throughout the forest. When it seemed it could get no louder, the words of the chant changed.<br>
<br>
&quot;War! War! Ogres of war! We march on Kaladim! Dwarves will die, dwarves will die! Oggok! Arise!&quot; <br>
<br>
With that, the ogres dispersed, running frantically to their homes for their armour and weapons, and shouting to all their friends. The ogres were going to war. Beside the campfire, the dark elf lowered his arms, as if to relax, then suddenly, in one motion, he threw a dagger into the tree ahead of him. The ranger had no time to move as the dagger flew straight at him, slicing deeply into his left arm. Blood spurted out of the wound, but he had no time to waste. Leaping from the tree, he gestured in the air, tracing out the lines of a spell. Instants later, a wolf was running through the forest, blood streaking from its left leg. There was a book, sitting innocently on a wooden pedestal in the forest, remarkably undisturbed for its location. The wolf ran up to it, placed its right paw on the open pages, and vanished. The calm night of the Feerott returned, and all was deathly silence.<br>

A bat flies closer to it, picking out a small insect hovering over the pages. As the predator opens its mouth to feed, suddenly, a wood elf appears from nowhere! Startled, the bat swerves, and the insect is gone. The elf looks quickly about to get his bearings, then is off, running as hard as he can towards the north. Soon, the only sign of his passing is a small trickle of blood, streaming from his left arm. <br>
<br>
Guard Leafstalker was annoyed. Today, he had lost his place as Lieutenant, and was demoted to guarding the newbie lift, of all places. No action, nobody to talk to except these puny elves running around half-naked, trying to swing their swords and kill bats. He rolled his eyes. Since when were bats a nuisance, anyway? He thought back to his demotion. He had been on duty, patrolling his route along the platforms of Kelethin, when some movement from an inn window caught his eye. Sitting at the window was a beautiful elven maiden, and she beckoned to him. How could he refuse? He entered the inn, and searched for her room. Finding it, he opened the door, and she screamed! The innkeeper arrived at once; seeing a guardsman apparently trying to force his way into a lady's room, he immediately called for the guards. And so, his reputation ruined, Lieutenant Leafstalker became Guard Leafstalker. <br>
<br>
Standing at guard duty was boring. Having an occasional swipe at a wasp or bat was hardly challenging, and he had no one to talk to. Suddenly, a wood elf came running along the path, and pressed the button for the lift as hard as he could. Leafstalker noticed that his left arm was bleeding and thought he had better be prepared for trouble.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you running from now, elf?&quot; the guard challenged, rather insolently.<br>
<br>
&quot;None of your business,&quot; snapped the elf. &quot;You'll find out in good time.&quot; The lift arrived, and the elf stepped onto it. Pressing the button, the lift rose again, lifting him to the platform high above. Even before it had reached the platform, the elf jumped up, running as fast as he could along the swaying wooden bridges and lofty platforms of Kelethin. Coming up to a door, he knocked, opened the door, and went in. The door closed behind him. Above the door, the sign read 'Faydark's Champions'. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lluir@fellowshipforlife>Lluir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/4/03 7:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dreams of Glory</span><hr size=1> Maesyn Trueshot, guildmaster of the rangers, was getting old. It was many years since he had seen real action, and his archery skills were no longer what they had once been. Spending his life sifting through papers, showing new rangers how to create their own bows, this was not how a ranger's life was supposed to be. But he was needed as a guildmaster, so he had accepted the task, and tried not to regret it. <br>
<br>
Deep in thought, he was startled when the door burst open and a ranger stumbled in. Seeing the elf was very pale, Maesyn immediately motioned to Samatansyn, the least senior of the rangers there, to heal the newcomer. As he was healed, he tried to give his message.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen closely. I was in the Feerott this night. The ogres are going to war; marching on Kaladim, all of them. The Tier'Dal are also involved, one of their kind stirred up the ogres. They believe the end of the age is coming with the opening of the planes, and with the end, it will be war.&quot; Everyone gasps, Maesyn opens his mouth to question him. The ranger closes his eyes, clearly exhausted from his long run. <br>
<br>
Changing his mind, Maesyn motions the ranger to a side room to sleep. Returning to his place in the hall, the aging guildmaster declares, &quot;It has begun. Send messengers to all guilds. Let the Koada'Dal know. And send word to the dwarves. They must be warned.&quot; Without a word, rangers scurry off into the night, bearing the tidings of war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lluir@fellowshipforlife>Lluir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/8/03 12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dreams of Glory</span><hr size=1> **********************************************<br>
I woke up with a pounding headache. Opening my eyes, the small wooden room swam dizzily before me. Staring up at the ceiling, I tried to focus on the intricate carvings etched into the wood, but had to give up. Stretching my arms out, I gasped at the sudden pain; clearly, my left arm was badly injured. Forcing myself to relax, I closed my eyes and tried to concentrate so I could cast a healing spell. <br>
A knock on the door interrupted my attempt at concentration, and I heard someone come in. Opening my eyes, I gazed into the face of a beautiful redheaded elf maiden. She seemed to tower over me, so I supposed she was of the Koada'Dal. <br>
&quot;Oh! You're awake already!&quot; she exclaimed, surprised. Her voice was light and melodic, perfectly charming to the ear. I almost missed what she was saying, just listening to the sound of it. &quot;How do you feel?&quot; she continued. From her mere presence, there seemed to emanate a calm tranquility that soothed my headache.<br>
&quot;Uh... a bit sore and tired, but recovering. Where am I?&quot; I was surprised at how weak my voice sounded; I must have been asleep for a week!<br>
The girl blushed a bit. &quot;In my guest room, actually. Do you not remember this place?&quot; I had no clue - I didn't even know who she was! Sensing this, she went on, &quot;You've been asleep for a month or so; the healers kept you asleep so you could heal. The dagger was poisoned, you know.&quot; The dagger? What dagger? Why couldn't I remember anything?<br>
&quot;Uh... yes, ah yes, the dagger. Did he get away?&quot; I tried to play along, supposing I must have been stabbed while guarding the forest, as my usual duty had it. I wondered who would stab me, especially with poison. She stared at me, so I trailed off, wondering what blunder I had just committed.<br>
&quot;You don't remember what happened, do you?&quot; she asked, bluntly. I shook my head. &quot;You were spying on the ogres in the Feerott, and when you were about to leave, a dark elf saw you and threw a dagger at you. You still made it here, delivered your message, and collapsed in the ranger guildhouse. No one realized how serious your wound was until the next day.&quot;<br>
&quot;Are you one of the healers, then? I am most grateful to you.&quot; I had to say something, though I was reeling in shock - how could I have forgotten all of this? What was the message I had delivered? Again, she stared at me, surprised. &quot;I'm sorry... am I supposed to know you?&quot; I asked sheepishly.<br>
&quot;The healers said the medecines would have some effect on your memory, but this is ...&quot; she trailed off. Pulling herself together, she introduced herself. &quot;I'm Leoana, of the Enchanters of Felwithe. You came to help me a few times in my training days around Kelethin. The healers had no beds to spare for you, so I offered my house. Duon comes to check on you regularly... you do remember Duon?&quot; ---unfinished <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub39.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fellowshipforlifefrm8">New Members (Applications)<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm4">Public Forum<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm5">Raids, Get-togethers, and Alcohol Tolerance Boosters<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm7">EPICS!<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm10">DING!<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm9">Stories and Tales<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm12">Tradeskills Corner<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm3">Town Hall<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm13">Guild Treasury<option value="fellowshipforlifefrm2">Council Meeting</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/bfellowshipforlife>Fellowship for Life</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub39.ezboard.com/ffellowshipforlifefrm9>Stories and Tales</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
