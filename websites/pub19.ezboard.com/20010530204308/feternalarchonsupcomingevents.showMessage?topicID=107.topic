I've read the first hand experiences and related stories of 3 or 4 peeps at Stratics.  In fact, here's what's known and guessed at:<br>
<br>
----- Paste------<br>
The plague seems to have started in West Karanas on the morning of Friday the 13th of April (real time). <br>
<br>
&quot;I had little time to adventure that day, but managed to get a kindly wizard to port me into the North Karanas to investigate the rumor of a bug invasion. Immediately upon arriving, I felt weak and my eyes began to to itch. Evil magicks had accursed this land. I started to make my way to the gypsy camp where a guild brother waited. Along the way, I passed animals afflicted with rabies and strange beetles not common to this area. I set about destroying the afflicted animals, least they attack a farmers family. Soon however, I realized that there were far to many for myself alone to kill and continued toward the wagons.<br>
<br>
I met with Medikar and his companions. They did not know the source of the strange occurrences and knew only that it seemed to be a plague that had started in West Karanas. The adventurers were valiantly trying to defend the inhabitants from the dangers that had arrived with this plague. Our healers tried to cure animals of the disease, but their spells had no effect. Even trying to stem off the beetle invasion seemed futile as every one we killed seemed only to be replaced by another. One of the party pointed out a strange green mist that seemed to cover whole of the land. The mist was so light that it could only be noticed when peering into the distance. This seemed the likely cause of my weakness. It was obvious that no simple actions would rid us of this curse.<br>
<br>
The group began to search the area hoping to discover the cause of this atrocity. I headed to a nearby farm to question some of the local townsfolk about the sudden changes. Indeed, the farmers knew the cause of this curse. The God, Bertoxxulous, sought revenge on the inhabitants here for the death of one of his high priests. His Bloodsabre cult enlisted the aid of Dark Reflection to bring about a threefold plague. Animals were stricken by rabies, a hoard of beetles invaded the realm, and a green mist hung over the land that threatened to poison crops whenever rains fell. The villains had transformed Karana's blessing rain into a curse!<br>
<br>
We contempated for a moment on the possible locations of the groups involved. A Bloodsabre faction is known to reside in the Qeynos sewer system. Dark Reflection is the name by which gnomish necromancers of Ak'Anon go. These areas are to far removed for the casting of a spell of such magnitude however. I suspect a circle of mages to be hiding in the mountains of West Karana. Indeed, I remember passing many shady characters there while I had recently traveled these lands. My friend, Zior, was willing to help me investigate my suspicion, but I was called away before I could lead him there. I do not yet know if he was successful in his venture.&quot;<br>

The Buggy Bug, a Plague of Questions?<br>
A suspected GM event occurred last night on the Luclin server. <br>
<br>
All travelers to the East Karana or North Karana during the evening hours were struck by a horrible plague of various ailments, including runny nose and blurred vision. The sickness didn't have any major effect on magical or fighting capabilities. The sky was over cast with a sickening green fog, that had the thickness and texture of Ogre snot. <br>
<br>
As the plague spread the intelligent races alone were not the vectors for the disease, many animals became rabid as well, causing increased danger to travelers. <br>
<br>
The confusion that followed was great and the solution, when I was forced to leave late in the night, was unclear. At first many groups of adventures sought to destroy all of the rabid animals but it soon became clear that with elves and humans alike infected nothing short of killing every living thing in the two areas would end the disease.<br>
<br>
Powerful clerics of the Realm attempted to cure the pestilence but no magic possessed of the mortals could bring relief from the dread pox. Then news came that farmer Miller had knowledge of a swarm that presumably carried the plague. The Swarm Queen was in short order hunted down and killed. It was reported that a necklace was looted from the feted corpse of the Queen,... this was then promptly sold to a merchant and lost! At this point any hope of finding a cure seemed to fade away. The plague did not leave with the slaying of the Swarm and the green fog did not lift.<br>
<br>
As the Night of Pain progressed without resolution some began to question if the gods had forgotten us. Others insisted it was the work of Bertoxxulous the Plaguebringer and then they even called out his name to face him in combat, which surely would have brought about the death of all present. No further words of any worth were gained in the night. Many local peoples were inquired including the Gypsies and the Ancient Treant Xanuusus, but these few could tell us not. <br>
<br>
As I left late in the night the plague was not ended and the greater number of adventurers had retired to rest. I felt honored to have been present at one of the great events to touch the Karanas... I think. Nothing really seemed to happen and no one could say what was to be done? The gods were to vague in their task for us.<br>

<br>
In what I think is a related bit of lore, a female paladin or cleric in Qeynos talks about a plague in the Karana's caused by the Heretic Erudites, and that her mother died in it. She also discusses the Realm of Heroes, which I believe is part of a Epic Quest. I don't remember exactly what the woman said, as it was over a month ago when I talked with her on the Erollisi Marr server. But, she claimed that the Heretics had caused a plaque among the animals of the Karana's, and that many clerics and paladins fought against the rabid beasts, including her mother, who died. And I believe she also said she fought, and as she believed she was about to die, she prayed to her god (The Tribunal I think), and was lifted to the Realm of Heroes, only to be sent back to serve among the mortals again. A similar quest NPC is in most major cities, talking about this Realm of Heroes, and Coins of some sort. Might want to do more research on it, as I can't give you the full details on this woman and what she says.<br>

<br>
Re the GM Event last night which you report on Luclin, and which also happened on Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
It was a shambles. Yes, there was a green mist and it brought with it rabid wolves, griffawns and other diseased animals, and there was talk of a swarm being defeated but I never saw one. Yes, talking to farmers in West Karana yielded the information that Bertox's high priest had been slain and as a result the Plaguebringer would visit disease, swarms and much worse upon the land. Yes, a lvl 1 shadowknight called Faraeb (not receiving tells and assumed by all to be a GM) called out that he was a messenger of Bertox and who would wreak destruction upon Qeynos. Yes, we all gathered in WK to defend the pass to the Qeynos Hills and outside Qeynos itself. Yes, we even learnt from a Priest in the Temple of Life in Qeynos that Mordavin, the man responsible for the (attempted?) resurrection of Bertox, had been discovered and slain by Antonius Bayle but that Mordavin's lover remained at large drinking with a bunch of scoundrels in the Lion's Mane Tavern in Qeynos. I forget her name.<br>
<br>
But no, we never found the lover - she was not on tracking - and nothing more happened. In time we all drifted away, at least that was the state of affairs when I retired for the night. As of this morning sickness messages are still received in the Karana's (affecting North East and West) but the mist has gone and nothing else seems to have happened.<br>
<br>
In all therefore it was much more of a non-event that an event, it provided some entertainment and did cause a great many to join together in a common stand against the evil forces. Just a shame that no eveil forces ever turned up..... Even more of a shame that we got no information as to what was going on, there was a lot of speculation that Faraeb was no more than a player exploiting the situation with some (excellent) role-playing that had us all going.<br>
<br>
Was it just a spoof event for Friday 13th? Was it part of a weekend-long quest? So many of us recalled with pleasure the Halloween event with the undead of the early times in EQ which has never been repeated or equalled. Was it a prequel to a new Plane being introduced? The trouble is no-one knew, and therefore the whole night descended into a farce.<br>
<br>
The exchanges with a number of NPC's suggest something is afoot, but as for what I simply don't have a clue. Wish I did! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
