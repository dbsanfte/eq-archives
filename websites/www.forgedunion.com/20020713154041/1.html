Rules of Conduct - Rules/Guidelines to Follow in Case of Emergency
  
We all know that emergency situations occur when the guild is needed to help a fellow guild 
member in need. When these situations occur, follow these steps:

1. See who in the zone can help, shout/ooc if necessary.

2. See who in the guild is close by to help you.

3. Determine wheither or not a GM needs to be called and if a guild member can come to be a witness to 
your situation.

4. Announce that all options have been looked at and a Guild Rescue is then in order. At this time the 
guild will see what it can do to help the guild member in need. Sometimes even when a GM is called, the 
guild can manage to help while the guild member waits for a response.

Rules of Conduct - Disclaimer
  
The Rules of Conduct are subject to change. If you are asked on the website or by /guildmotd to 
come and read this forum, you are required by the guild to do so. 

All new rules are active immediately upon the request to come see this forum. 

No Excuses for not knowing the guild rules will be tolerated. You are required by the guild to view this 
site for Guild Info/News/Rules, etc. Joining the guild is acceptance by you of the responsibility to 
follow these rules and guidelines and for viewing this web site.

Rules of Conduct - Treatment of Fellow Guild Members
  
Mistreatment of fellow guild members is considered an act against the guild and disciplinary 
action can be taken.

If you have questions about proper game play etiquette, go to the Rules of Conduct link and see what 
VERANT considers proper game play etiquette.

Disciplinary action will be discussed and voted on by the council on a situation by situation basis.

Your needs can be met without the mistreatment and slandering of fellow guild members and family.

Rules of Conduct - Procedures of Officers
  
When a situation or dispute arises, our Council will use the following procedures to resolve the 
situation.

1. Consult with other officers regarding the matter to get ideas, comments and suggestions on possible 
resolutions.

2. Advise members by speaking to them in private to resolve their problems and if another guild member is 
involved to talk to both parties in order to come to a mutual and positive outcome.

3. A final decision concerning a situation may be decided by a vote between Council members. Majority 
vote decides final decision. One of our officers will then go to the party or parties involved and 
communicate the decision made by the council.

4. If it is a matter which concerns the whole guild, the matter will be taken to the message boards and a 
poll placed for votes from guild members on the matter. At that time, when all votes are in, one of our 
officers will place a message on the board with the final decision and the matter will be closed. 

- 
 
Rules of Conduct - Discipline Section 
  
If a guild member conducts themselves in a dishonorable fashion, they will be required to give a 
formal apology to the other guild/person involved.

Disciplinary action will be discussed and voted on by the council on a situation by situation basis. 
Otherwise they can be removed from guild for dishonorable conduct if a leader/officer has to do the 
formal apology.

If you have a complaint or suggestion please talk about the problem before removing yourself from the 
guild. We want to be given the chance to resolve any problems the members may have.

- 
 
Rules of Conduct - Guild Wars
  
We do not promote guild wars. If another guild chooses to have one with us in fun then it will 
be considered for the fun aspect. We will try to avoid any guild wars for idiotic reasons. We are a guild 
of Honor, it is not honorable to declare war without first trying to resolve the dispute in negotiation. 
Only the guild leader can declare war and every means to resolve the dispute will be sought out before 
such a drastic action is taken.
 
- 
  
Rules of Conduct - Power Leveling and Begging
  
Power leveling is a gift from one person to another. The guild will not PL anyone asking for it 
in guild. 

Begging for items and PP from guildmembers or non-guildmembers is NOT allowed.
 
- 

Rules of Conduct - Kill Stealing, Camp Stealing, Ninja Looting, Hogging, etc
  
EQ does not tolerate this behavior and neither does our guild. If you kill steal by accident, 
you should humbly apologize, show respect and make amends as you are able to. 

Before invading a camp you must do a camp check and ask to share the camp. If you are declined, respect 
the camp that was there before you. 

Please do not hog loots and be respectful of others, best rule to go by in a group of 6, loot every 6th 
kill or establish a loot order so there are no misunderstandings. This shows you as an honorable person.

When in the field, you are carrying the name Forged Union and you will show honor, truth, might, and 
respect while you carry our Guild Name above your brow. It is with pride that we share with each other 
and give a helping hand when and where possible.

/Anon is not allowed by members of the Forged Union Guild; Use /roleplay if you need to hide your level 
and class. 

Note: Targeting a char and typing /guildstatus reveals their guild info even when anon. Going /anon and 
behaving in a dishonorable fashion does not hide your guild status.

Rules of Conduct - Guild Chat
  
Guild chat is a private form of communication between members of our guild. It will not be used 
as a form of blackmail. If a member wishes to Express, Vent, or Jest in guild chat they should feel free 
to do so without the fear of being reported to Verant. Please be respectful and try to not offend anyone. 
But never be afraid to talk in guild chat. This is our way of getting to know each other and help each 
other. 

Guild chat may be used to coordinate raids and for communications between groups in a raid. If it bothers 
you, turn it off temporarily, but let everyone know you are turning it off. 

If you have a problem with something that was said in guild chat, you may speak to the officers and/or 
the Leader/Vice Leader. This holds true for all things. If you find yourself so bothered by guild chat, 
to the extent that you do not want it on ever, then perhaps you do not have a place in the guild because 
that is what gives us the experience of interacting and communicating with one another, bringing 
excitement to our game life. 

A GM should never been called without first consulting with at least three officers and your guild 
leader. What is said in guild chat STAYS in guild chat. Out of respect and honor you shall not in any 
way, shape or form express any comments, subjects, etc. discussed in or about the guild with anyone, if 
it will damage the guild or any one member in any way without discussing it with the officers. It is the 
officers job to rectify such situations and make such decisions.

- 
 
If interested in joining guild, post a message in the Membership Requests Forum so that members 
may comment on your character's membership. 

Guild invites will not be done until a Membership Request has been posted and guild members have had two 
days to comment on your character.

To see if a person is honorable, two guild members around same level must group with the person to see 
how their persona is and how they conduct themselves. Two or three groupings with members must be done to 
determine honorability before an invitation is extended. Prospective recruits must make every effort to 
group with members to be considered for invitation. We never shout for new members. The new recruit must 
also be approved by at least one officer and one member and can only be invited by a guild officer.

The Recruting Cap is level 12, but if a person proves themselves to be of honorable character and worthy 
of the name Forged Union they may be invited into the guild by any officer/leader no questions asked. 
Officers have the power to make decisions, in regard to, inviting new members, whom are family of 
members. Officers have the right to take special circumstances into consideration, as well, without 
question. Having one character in the guild makes your alter egos auto approved. You must give your 
alternate's names to the officer as well as your main character in the guild before an invite will be 
done. 

Note: If an officer or yourself removes yourself for dishonorable conduct, be it known that an officer 
may remove your other characters as well. Removing yourself, under honorable circumstances, from the 
guild and wanting back in guild will be decided among officers and you. Please contact an officer in this 
regard.

Always involve guild members when faced with persons who are conducting themselves in a dishonorable 
fashion towards you or whenever a GM is required. (Always have witnesses)

Members are to conduct themselves in a honorable fashion with regard to others in the game, OOC, Shout, 
Auction, ETC. and follow Verants rules of conduct.
