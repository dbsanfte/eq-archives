speech log</span><hr size=1> The guild convened out at the ol’ SH tree south of Ardee on the river.  We formed up a few groups and slayed some beavers… Parson was off ta the side soloing while meta was back throwing buffs.  Ashwin and Truc were busy running folks back and forth from Howth…<br>
<br>
After a bit, we all ran back up to Howth and caught a steed… well… needless to say, anyone standing near 10 ft. o’ the path to Mag Mel got stampeded… because there were about 23 Hawks riding!<br>
<br>
After we got to Mag Mel, we all ran as a group up the road past Ardee and on to the nice shady trees outside of the north gates of Tir na Nog.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to the following people who were promoted last night.<br>
<br>
Metaphore is now an Earl<br>
Kellindor is now an Earl<br>
Boelvine is now an Earl<br>
Mickelle is now an Earl<br>
Truc is now the guilds Magistrate (#2)<br>
Wolfer is a fully pledged member<br>
<br>
After the long-winded speech, we all went in and gave each other presents (thanks again kellindor, that staff and britches rock).  Then we formed up SH groups and went out into the wild!<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone who showed up for making the first SH festival a fun one : )<br>

[20:31:21] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;This ties into the previous item.  Tis ok ta talk about our mundane world now and again, as we are in RL (whether we like it or not... hehe).  But overuse of the guild chat for ooc comments is not very welcome.&quot;<br>
[20:31:43] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;It takes us away from Hibernia and makes it hard for many to escape... the very reason we all play.  &quot;<br>
[20:32:09] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;I ask that ye limit the ooc chat.  Tis not a bannable offense, so please don't cower in fear.. just be aware that to much is not welcome.&quot;<br>
[20:32:31] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;New Policies&quot;<br>
[20:33:] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;We have a lvl limit for new folks now.  lvl 10.  Any members that are already in, this does not apply.&quot;<br>
[20:33:17] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;Hawks that come from the old world.. are not subject to this either.&quot;<br>
[20:33:3] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;I don't like to do this sort of thing, but I think it's appropriate and not to limiting&quot;<br>
[20:33:57] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;The other one is initiates&quot;<br>
[20:34:3] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;There is now a 2 week period for initiates.  Active playtime.  Once two weeks have passed, then they can be pledged. &quot;<br>
[20:35:02] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;Initiates will be expected to pledge or go a different path after the two weeks&quot;<br>
[20:35:3] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;Any violation of the ZTP during the initiate period no matter how it might be viewed as &quot;trivial&quot; is grounds for immediate removal.  &quot;<br>
[20:36:06] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;These policies have been reached from the feedback of our members and officers who have shared their ideas openly communicating.. as it should be.  Working as a TEAM&quot;<br>
[20:36:35] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;Again if anyone has any ideas, thoughts, concerns, gripes, please feel free to email me directly or post in member forum. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>

[20:37:11] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;We are working hard to make this the best guild ever and to last.  Here are some of the things in the works:&quot;<br>
[20:37:36] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;Prophet Fernus is working on a new initiate signup online form with complete questionnaire!  This will also include the ZTP. &quot;<br>
[20:38:01] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;This should help to streamline our recruiting efforts and help us to identify those that will make wonderful guild mates, friends and hawks&quot;<br>
[20:38:2] @@[Guild] Quasimo: &quot;Roster - the one we are using now is ... well.. crap.  Working on that &quot;<br>
