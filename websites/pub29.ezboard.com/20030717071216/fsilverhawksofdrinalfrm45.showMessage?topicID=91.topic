<br>
<br>
Brrrrrrr...... What a chilly morning~~ Well aye, it should be! I was in the forsaken ruins of ice giant keep- &quot;Permafrost!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why am I here?&quot; I must have banged my head againsted the icy wall one hundred times to ask myself this question over and over... Well, I was there to complete an epic quest for myself and my beloved guild- &quot;Silver Hawks.&quot; (Now come on.. cheer with me.. hip-hip Hurray~ hip-hip-hurray~)<br>
<br>
As I climbed out of my sleeping bag, I wrapped myself tighter in my whitewolf-hide cloak. After ignoring my toes' protests, I forced my feet into my snow-covered deepwater boots, then stepped out of my already half-collapsed tent. I observed the mist-like water vapor rushing out of my mouth after a deep exhale.... Eeeekkkk... yep... it is cold.... How did Barbarians survive here barely with their kilts? That is one question I have got to ask Bosk when I see him next time....<br>
<br>
After a quick-fix of &quot;breakfast&quot;(Frozen raw ice-bear ham, with snow-melt water.) I dug through my bags trying to find my mini clock. Yep.. it is almost time. I took a quick glance around the caves, hailing my ice goblin &quot;neighbours(Especially the alchemist.. /grin)&quot; while I enjoy my morning &quot;jog.&quot;<br>
<br>
After paid my &quot;pledge&quot; to the ice goblin king in his room, I sat on a piece of comfy rock on the opposite side that leads to Lady Vox's lair. Has anyone ever told Lady Vox that she has a bad voice? Anyways I sat there, took out a piece of board called PADD(What? Norrath does not have it yet? Okay.. fine.. &quot;Tell-board&quot;.. how is that?&quot;) I started sending out messages to my comrades' &quot;Tell-board&quot; to see if they are on their way to my whereabout at the moment. After I few minutes, I got myself completely overwhelmed by the massive amount of message I am recieving via my tell-board.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Orson!&quot; A welcoming voice finally apeared in the icy caves. It was a dwarven paladin named Kholadrim. He stepped into my view with goblin blood dripping down his gigantic axe. We greeted each other with a handshake and few words while waiting more comrades to show up.<br>
<br>
Like every other raids, people tend to be late on them for various reasons... but as time pass by, our number grew in a steady pace. The room started getting noisy. People's chattering started filling the room. Laughters, chatters surrounded me while I was busy arranging groups. My tell-board kept rumbling on my right thigh as people were sending me messages. I asked few of my friends to help me to keep the order, but seems that people just can't sit still and lower their chatters. One other thing I warned those came to my raid was:&quot;Not to open the door that leads to Lady Vox's chamber until we are all grouped and organized.&quot; I was too naive to believe people would do what I tell em. If you have kids, you know they always do what parents tell them not to do. When I just finished arranging 2 groups, a big creaking sound caught my attention. A series of rumbling followed by a horde of angry ice giants with gigantic ice spiders rushed out of the door that leads to Lady Vox's lair. Panic and scream arouse in the room. We soon engaged in a chaotic battle. We managed to slay the enemies at a somewhat heavy price. Six mem were knocked unconscious with their spirits sent back to their souldbound point, I had to abort my group-arranging and arrange ressurections for them. This procedure costed us half hour of some very valuable time.<br>
<br>
&quot;The remaining enchanters will be grouped together with Sir Rengate.&quot; As I announced last group setup. We were ready to clear the giant guards of Lady Vox. Dorral(a fellow hawk monk)was appointed to lure the ferocious ice giants guarding Lady Vox's Lair. Unfortunately due to lack of experience, he was soon trapped by hideous hidden traps. Segejin, an iksar master of martial art then replaced Dorral's role. All went well before an ice terror hidden below one of the trap doors ambushed him, trapped him and dragged him to Lady Vox for execution. There was nothing we could have done at the time's being.<br>
<br>
With our designzted pullers trapped/killed. We were stuck outside the Lady Vox's lair. &quot;Should I call the raid off?&quot; I looked at the crowd... &quot;No... that wouldn't be right... We have came this far already... Plus those people who were killed/trapped inside would need help as well.&quot; After some deep consideration . I walked up to Remian and asked him to finish what we started. &quot;Sure, I will try my best.&quot; The half elven ranger smiled with confident, then snuck into the door that leads to Lady Vox. Surprisingly, the result was better than I expected. We soon cleared the giants in our way and moved to our rally point(Also known as bind point for those wana get technical.) Remian snuck into Lady Vox's chamter while we double check our equipments, then brough back dire news:&quot;There are still more guards in Lady Vox's Lair.&quot; Some of our comrades started feeling weary as we announced the dire news. I gulped, then slowly approched to the entrance that leads to Vox's lair. There were three ice giants and some other monsters surrounded Lady Vox. I turned my head back to look at my comrades. Suddenly without warning, I took out my spell book then started memorizing &quot;pacify.&quot; &quot;Well, here goes nothing... Oh mother of all.. please hear my plead.. Grant me power to bring harmony upon Lady Vox~&quot; A soft glowing light then surrounded Lady Vox's body. It was too far away for me to be sure if she resisted or not.. but time is against us... Remian was then asked to lure the guards while my &quot;spell effect&quot; is still due. Guess what, Lady Vox did not come after us right after her guards were drown away. Even though Lady Vox was not involved in that battle, her guards still giave us some hard time. Just when we were about to finish the last giant, a shadowy figure apeared before us iwth Segejin's lifeless corpse then puffed out of nowhere.... Ressurection upon Master Segejin was immediately commenced after we finished our battle with the giants. Turns out that shadowy figure was one of Segeij's distant relative(hmm.. an iksar has a dark-elf relative? /shrug.) Our moral was at its very top. Glowing lights of protection spells shimmered all around our party in the next few minutes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright.. listen up people.. This is it.. We are going in within five minutes. We will rush in 3 waves. Group 1 and 2 will be wave 1. Group 3 and 4 will be wave 2. Group 5 and 6 will be wave 3. Everyone clear? Good luck and I am proud to have you fellas with me.&quot; After a short salute. I asked my comrades in arms again:&quot;Are you ready?!&quot; A few answered with their war cries. Without satisfaction, I asked them again.. this time, almost everyone roared on their lungs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Counting down.. in 10.... Wave 1, step up and get ready for take off! 9... 8.... 7... 6...... 5.... 4.... 3..... 2.... 1.... Wave 1, CHARGE!!!&quot; Twelve brave men and women rushed right under Lady Vox's silvery belly. Is this going to be an easy battle? Or we will fail like others? Vox quickly greeted us with a mouth full of ice blast to tell us she is not going to make it easy for us. Thus the battle begins!!~<br>
<br>
Sir Toorch quickly dodged a few claw attacks from Lady Vox while striking back swiftly with his blades. Lady Kassiopea formed a protection aura around my party to deflect most of the ice blasts with her beautiful singings. After we inflicted some damage here and there with wave-1, I shouted for wave 2 to aid us in the battle. &quot;Sir, we have some problem here, it is the giants... looks like they have brought reinforcements. We will be stuck here for a while!!&quot; Cold sweat and blood dripped off my forehead from my wounds... &quot;Ok, try to finish them as fast as you can then come join us! We will try to hold her off as long as we can!&quot; As time pass by, new wounds started apearing on everyone's body. Our stamina lowers by the seconds... Lady Vox has also suffered extensive damage as we have. Angry roars and metal clashing sounds with blood spilling all over the place formed a bloody sight. I called in Wave-3 immediately to finish Lady Vox off after Lady Vox was close to death. &quot;Puny mortals, do you think you can defeat me with such... feeble skills and spells of yours?&quot; Vox laughed us in our face as a circle of shimmering blue light forming around her. She has healed herself! That scene shocked me greatly.. A voice popped in my mind:&quot;This is over, Orson. You have failed.. Submit your life to the inevitable...&quot; I wiped the blood and sweat off my face. &quot;I beg to differ.&quot; I tightend by grip then started slaming my shield against Lady Vox's gigantic torso:&quot;Men, we still can beat her! KEEP ATTACKING! THROW EVERYTHING YOU GOT AT HER! FIRE AT WILL!!!&quot; Thus the second round begins... A surge of frenzy started driving us to inflict more wounds upon Lady Vox. Unfortunately, as the battle goes... Some of our comrades succumbed to either Lady Vox's ice blast or massive clawings. Groans and death-cry soon started filling the room as casualties rise. Lady Voxed managed to heal herself once more to escape death after Lady Kassiopea lost her conscious due to massive blood loss. I turned my face around to check my comrades again, half of us lied on the ground without any life signs. I, myself was half way to rejoin Tunare. I started driving all my life force to summon divine lights in an attempt to burn Vox alive. With both my hands slashing and bashing along with my mouth chanting spells. I start losing feelings from my body.. pain and suffering.... they were all fading.. Last thing I remembered before I collapsed on the ground, was the scene where Lady Vox grasping for breathe. I smiled before I closed my eyes:&quot;I am not going down alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
After Lady Stasha resurrect me, I struggled to stand up and check my surroundings.... Have we really slay the beast? Yep.. there she lies.. lifelessly with her gigantic silvery scaled body....  We have finally did it.. We have slain the ice queen! After much struggle, we finally accomplished the goal Hawkfeather bestowed on us. Joy and cheers filled the room as people regained their conscious. It was a great day... This is one night I will remember for the rest for my life.<br>
<br>
<br>
~The End~<br>
<br>
P.S. Dorral was rescued after we were all ressurected and rested. Just in case you guys are wondering if we left anyone behind. Sadly there were some death loops due to bad extraction plans. <p><img src="http://orsonfahn.homestead.com/files/orson.jpg"border=0></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uorsondapallie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>orsondapallie</A> at: 12/4/01 3:51:04 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45.showPrevMessage?topicID=91.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45.showNextMessage?topicID=91.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45.emailToFriend?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45.threadControl?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub29.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm78">EQ Welcome Center<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm75">General Discussion<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm5">Advancement<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm68">Comings and Goings<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm17">CO Stories of the Silver Hawks<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm45">Historic Topics<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm69">Other Worlds<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm40">EQ Guild Members Forum<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm83">Help Wanted<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm47">EQ Resources, Strategies & Trades<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm34">EQ Raids, Events, and LFG<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm50">EQ Allied Adventures<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm81">SWG General Discussion<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm51">DAoC Archives<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm27">EQ Archives<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm79">Test<option value="silverhawksofdrinalfrm84">Hawk Raiders</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A0B0E0>- </font><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/bsilverhawksofdrinal>Silver Hawks</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fsilverhawksofdrinalfrm45>Historic Topics</a> <font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href="http://www.silver-hawks.org">Silver Hawks</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
