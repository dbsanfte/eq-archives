well to that i say wtf else is there special to roll on other than a forest loop? up untill that point it was like OMG a bronze weapon... maybe a fine steel now and then? since most stuff comes end game we were not that point yet... <br>
----------<br>
<br>
then why roll on it if it was so much unimportant loot? most the stuff that dropped was worth more than what you all had in your bank accounts is my guess and when you are just growing up at that low level the extra money helps alot. I really don't understand what you are saying here sorry.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
Has far as for him not healing you atra? i dont mean to sound like a dick cause i like ya but if he asked you not to pull and you did, well that jeopardizes the whole party regardless of whether or not you were in 46..why couldnt u wait if he was lom?.... and he didnt constantly heal scrimps, i was blasting heals off the whole time, so it wasnt just vessel..<br>
---------<br>
<br>
That's not the point... he had enough mana to keep me alive is the point... all the way through the fight. And I've heard scrimps complain before of your group wanting every single caster to be FM before pulling something I can almost solo. Well as much mana as everyone had obviously this wurm wasn't a problem after I died. the point was scrimps never even went under half life but yet I managed to die without recieving a heal nor an apology for the event. and once again if you read the whole post he managed to heal scrimps lots of times but not me. so he wasn't lom, and lom pulling is not a good reason to let someone die.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
and he didnt constantly heal scrimps,<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
no but he did HEAL scrimps... not me. and he did just post maybe I did do it on purpose... so obviously he has the potential for doing that to someone.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
 i was blasting heals off the whole time<br>
---------<br>
<br>
so were you also holding back heals or? I'm kinda confused as to how I died if you were both 'healing' and I died but scrimps didn't.<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
but im not gonna dig into this any deeper because i like all ya and dont want to add fuel to the fire...<br>
----------<br>
um... isn't that what you just did?<br>
<br>
---------<br>
but lastly u say take it to the real boards, the emarr rants and flames....what would his bitching do there<br>
------------<br>
um.. well since he wants to put out his.. &quot;you know what you are atra&quot;, it would do plenty to see if the rest of the board or the server thinks the same. obviously you don't know the high level people nor the well known people that traverse those boards plenty. most of these people are quite well known and respected on the server which of course you don't know because you don't group oustide of vessel and Xzanthos.  I'm not trying to insult you I'm just explaining so I hope you don't take this as a flame. I wasn't offended by your post.<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
mostly people that are in the 55-50 range level wise that we would have never run across so their opinions really dont matter either way..<br>
--------------<br>
once again vessel's judgement of my character would be accurately reflected in my peer group the level 50-55 that you are talking about so if I'm such a jerk it would only go well to either prove him wrong or prove him right. if he thinks i'm such a 'great guy'.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Really both of these conclusions were abit too easy to come by.. I don't see why you even posted these questions...<br>

 Sunny, I dont want to sound rude. but I dont care what you do. It isnt my guild anymore. I have joined Oracles of Truth in order to support and be supported by a group of my IG peers and people I can honestly think of as mentors. Even though I am level 50 I still consider myself to be quite the newbie in this game. I dont lurk boards and dont research zones and mobs and drops on websites. When I log on it is to play the game. I dont need another chat client, I have plenty. It shouldnt be much or a surprise that I chose Oracles as my new guild. It is a 50+ guild and also home to the person who has given me the most guidance in the game, Atrapost/Jenniper. Is he a harsh, mouthy, cocky, gender-confused jackass? For the most part yes. But, he's fair and doesnt dispense his guidance and assistance only to a small group or clique. I had no idea that i knew him IRL at the time he first helped me. And it was a time consuming bit of help too. I didnt have to warm up to him.. or do anything for him.. he just helped. It went much farther than that though, I got tells and inquiries in GC every hour or so for the next few days.. just making sure I was doing ok. All of this was before either of us realized that we knew eachother IRL. Since then Atra has helped me more than I can say. I have only raided a REAL raid because of him. I must say that I cant say that people dont like him, they do. I've seen enough finger pointing  and name calling to single any one person out or to aim this at any one person. <br>
 He remains to be my friend and mentor even when I DONT group with him and go against his suggestions. Thats more than I can say for alot of people.<br>
 On a lighter note.... I have Pix from Fanfaire and will be glad to send them to whoever wants them. Just message me on AIM  TSVARWIG  .. or send me an email to TSVarwig@aol.com<br>

First of all as I recall no bronze weapons dropped off of Giants in FM.  The things we all rolled on were Leg Choppers (50pp), Forest Loops (400pp), Lumberjack Caps (30pp), and Hammer of Flatting (40pp).  And like I said I was a newbie and anyone of those items were worth as much as I had total in my bank.  Most things in this game are according to Levels that kill them.  Meaning YES the best stuff is 50+ camps but then again they have to spend alot more to buy things, where at lvl 25-30 like we were 30-400pp was GREAT and could upgrade many items I had or meant food and water or even a Teleport from you Taxi's (j/k).  I really have fun and liked playing with all of your group BUT vessel who believed his crap didn't stink to begin with and he WAS the leader all the time.  <br>

u jeopardized the party and u dont see the point? we knew the wurms were beating the crap out of us from previous pulls.. and u sure as hell couldnt solo it so i disagree with you here, whether or not we usually wait for full mana.. and u didnt recieve an apology for the event? well do u really need one? dont u  owe the group and apology for pulling when asked not to? i see two apologies possible here..<br>

and as far as you got NO heals, well u died pretty fast.. i dont knowif he tried to CH or what... not gonna answer since it wasnt me..<br>

no i was not holding back... i was not main healer so i went through my usual routine.. snare, dot, DS, etc.. by the time i was in the middle of that.. u were not healed yet/not being healed and dead... at this point i started healing scrimps, sorry if i was confusing.<br>

i disagree, his feelings toward you are opinionated thinking you know what you are, it doesnt matter what others think of you, he can think of you what he wants... and it doenst matter if i did group outside my &quot;clique&quot; most of them are too high level that i couldnt group with them anyways.<br>

But Pax and its members have been like a family to me.  I mean this off all her members, Atra-if i needed u, u were there, Tormark, same, Haywoode-loved grouping with u, Sunny-Loved killin specs wit ya, Scrimps-u #1 sk in my book, Udfreg-u will make a great paxer, the point is Pax was, and has the potential to be a great guild.  As you have noticed, I have left Pax, not because I hated everyone or issues like on this thread, but It was an issue that i will not forget and do not want to get into, But, i have just finished reading all the posts and i agree with may of the points, Atra and Scrimps and Hay do have some valid points.  Now, Sunny, Tor, all the officers have made some points, but what u need to understand is whatever you are trying is not working, it may be time to venture into unknown territory.  Now, i am no expert on all this guild protocal or anything i am just adding my 2 cp.  Now, Atra, you can be a big lizard u-know-what, but i respect u, not only on the acomplishments you have done (i.e raids, lvl of your characters) but as a player, i recall a time when i had some trouble early on, and asked the guild and u jumped on it.  Haywoode, you are a good player, i know this from current experience, i grouped with u in LOIO, FM, OT, and now DL, and i have absolutely no quams with ur playing, you will be a great player =).  Vessel, I know you in RL so this is alittle harder, you are a great player (personal exp), but you do have the tendency to be unattentive, but i do not hold that against you, i do not know what happened between u and atra, and i will not get involved, but i just want you to know that u were also there when i needed a hand or when my life was sinking faster than rosie o'donnel in a buffet.  Sunny-u where given a hot potato my friend, all of a sudden the dam burst and u got stuck holding the evidence, you are a great player, and great leader, and a all around great guy, sunny i have nothing but praise for u.  Scrimps-You know what i tink o u bud =) u da erud! hope you have a great run in oracles.  Tormark(c)-you i know in RL, and u are full of nothing but good intentions, you are a great player, you are a great person, you were also one of the people that were always there for me.  You were there for groups, tp's (tor's taxi =)), and just general talking when we were bored.  Nektos-u are one of the strangest people i have ever met, but i consider u a great guy =) hope to see u around more often.  There are many more people I have not mentioned that have shaped my EQ career, but most of them know how i feel and if they do not, they should know i have the upmost respect for each and every one of them.

and heywoode i meant up untill that point.. level 30 that is we hadnt seen much more than a bronze or fine steel weapon..<br>
----------<br>
<br>
exactly our point the stuff that was dropping out there was worth tons compared to what you all had seen before... so there was value in it.<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
u jeopardized the party and u dont see the point?<br>
-----------------<br>
ok now pulling a single when the cleric had cast nothing for the last 2 pulls is jeopardizing a party? I die without a single heal and no one else in party goes under half mana. You all managed to rez me and wait for mana before anything else got anywhere near us and I jeopardized a party? um... sure....<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
we knew the wurms were beating the crap out of us from previous pulls..<br>
-----------------<br>
um... I had not pulled a wurm in there before so I don't know what you are talking about. the two kills before that were not wurms.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
and u sure as hell couldnt solo it so i disagree with you here<br>
-------------<br>
no I meant the other mobs that I was killing waiting for you guys to get your FM. As in we had already been waiting a decent amount of time killing things I could solo.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
whether or not we usually wait for full mana.. and u didnt recieve an apology for the event? well do u really need one? dont u owe the group and apology for pulling when asked not to? i see two apologies possible here..<br>
--------------<br>
i'm used to groups that are mana efficient and don't need full mana every kill. Why should I apologize for trying to keep the group going getting experience rather than sitting around doing nothing and only dying myself. So because someone else didn't heal me and I died I should apologize? No one else was even remotely in danger scrimps didn't go below half... the idea that I should apologize for not getting healed boggles my mind.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
and as far as you got NO heals, well u died pretty fast.. i dont knowif he tried to CH or what... not gonna answer since it wasnt me..<br>
--------<br>
um.. let's see fighting a mob you dont know how fast or hard it hits or how well a tank holds up you don't CH to start the fight and to be your first heal when a group is just getting started. An experienced cleric will get a good judgement of how fast someone is dropping before they attempt a CH. Yes he did try to CH which was apparently the right thing to do as a cleric since I died.<br>
<br>
Yet another example of how not grouping with others means your group  doesn't know how to adjust to class and personality differences. Let alone get along with other people or communicate. Well you communicate not to bad.. and I don't know about Xz so I guess chalk up the last comment yet again for vessel.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
no i was not holding back... i was not main healer so i went through my usual routine.. snare, dot, DS, etc.. by the time i was in the middle of that.. u were not healed yet/not being healed and dead... at this point i started healing scrimps, sorry if i was confusing<br>
-------<br>
yet another example... my normal routine says it all for me. Not grouping with others means you do about the same thing most fights and don't adjust to the realtime situation. <br>
<br>
Generally as a shaman and back up healer I consider my job to slow unless the cleric is having a hard time keeping up or not reacting fast enough. If I see someone getting too low to fast I cancel the slow spell and begin to cast heal. Or I get slow spell off and begin casting heal on the low member... if the heal looks like it is going to hit I cancel heal if not I let it hit. Usually I let the mana burn if neccessary on a too low group member recieving a CH rather than cancel it to let the person die.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
i disagree, his feelings toward you are opinionated thinking you know what you are, it doesnt matter what others think of you, he can think of you what he wants...<br>
--------<br>
no my point to that was this is a public board, yes he can think what he wants but I was defending myself on a public board as to what kind of person I am (jerk or not jerk).<br>
<br>
--------<br>
 and it doenst matter if i did group outside my &quot;clique&quot; most of them are too high level that i couldnt group with them anyways.<br>
------<br>
I'm guessing you are saying most of them (your friends?) are too high to group with or I have no idea what you mean here. Now if you mean it doesn't matter if you group with other people... um I think scrimps would have something to say on this matter. He's having a REAL bad time finding groups that will take him. I don't know could you explain what you are saying here? I'm a bit lost.<br>
<br>
_____________________________<br>
on to your response to scrimps he said IG peers.... EQ gamers need to learn from lots of different people to really learn their own class and understand others and how to properly group with them/keep them alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
i didnt say in FM, i said most things up to this point being level 30ish.<br>
------<br>
I really don't think any of us understood what you were saying here in your original posting of where this went.<br>
<br>
Anyhow I'm off to RL for a few hours... see ys =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/utormark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 165<br> <font color=#000099>(10/23/01 8:25:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Where have all the Paxers gone?</span><hr size=1> ok atra, so we were both doing our &quot;usual routine&quot; so i guess those cancel each other out.. im sorry, i thought i remembered fighting wurms before that encounter. i guess i was wrong. and as for refering to people &quot;to high&quot; to group with i was talking about the board posters on the emarr board.. you say how their opinion would be counted because they are well respected players, my point is that it doesnt matter to me because i cant play with them anyways.. only know them by their board reps, which many of them admit, is different then how they act in game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#66CCFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uvesselgoodjourney.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vessel goodjourney</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#000099>(10/24/01 5:39:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Where have all the Paxers gone?</span><hr size=1> ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uthorkinwhitewolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorkin WhiteWolf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#000099>(10/26/01 6:21:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  &lt;sigh&gt;</span><hr size=1> PAXers,<br>

         It was only a few weeks ago that I was playing frequently and having alot of fun with PAX.......What has happened in those few short weeks of my absence?  We lost aolt of high lev players but I seem to remember us still doing OK in CoM grouping with other guilds (even though our group had no meleers =) Anyways, just wanted to say that I'm staying.  I've been in PAX for a LOOONG time (Back in the days of Cimoril, Merkin, Nusbak, ect...) and I'm not bailing now....<br>

Responding to the title of this thread *i dont want to get involved in anyone elses argument*  I am still in pax, have been for... oh... either almost a year or longer... As someone else said, in the days of Nusbak, Merkin, Ialanye, etc.  I havent done many raids, except for the begining of a hole raid or so, the PoH once or twice, anyway, Pax has been good to me, i havent made any enemies that I know of, just lots of friends =)   I am glad to have gotten to know  all of you.   Im not leaving quite yet, in a few months maybe.... I enjoy pax, all the people, but once I have the ability to raid more,(I dont have my own computer and Im on diaup... been playing since release on the same old 333mghz voodoo 2 comp since I started)  I am level 60, have no plane gear whatsoever.  I do have my epic though, as you probably all know.  I got it from pure obstinance, saving up and paying the ubers to take down the BIG mobs for me... 30k for fay, 25k for VS stone, etc... Took me over 8 months and a couple hundred hours of camping, at least 20 of which were with paxers (most of which have already left the guild)  I was able to do it while still in pax =).  This christmas, or perhaps my B-day, im going to be getting a new comp with DSL, and I am planning on going to a more raid oriented guild... one of the ubers, havent quite decided.  My point is, i will not be going for any selfish reasons *ok, a few, grins*  I just think that after playing since beta/live release, i think its time for me to move on. I hope no one holds this against me...  Thanks everyone for the fun time =D           <br>
Anyway,I will be around for a few more months, lets try to make em count *smiles* <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=691.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=691.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=691.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=691.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=56><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/oceana/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=691.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.threadControl?topicID=691.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/oceana/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=691.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=691.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub29.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paxfamillafrm1">Member Area<option value="paxfamillafrm3">General Area<option value="paxfamillafrm15">Raids and events ONLY!<option value="paxfamillafrm16">Raid and Event Disscussions<option value="paxfamillafrm4">Items (Buying, Selling, Trading, whatever)<option value="paxfamillafrm14">Power Leveling - wanting/offering<option value="paxfamillafrm5">Humor =)<option value="paxfamillafrm6">RP forum (shrug)<option value="paxfamillafrm12">PICTURES- (screen shots etc)<option value="paxfamillafrm13">Member/Sponsor<option value="paxfamillafrm9">LINKS<option value="paxfamillafrm11">Archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000099>- </font><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/bpaxfamilla>Pax Familla</a><font color=#000099> - </font><a href=http://pub29.ezboard.com/fpaxfamillafrm1>Member Area</a> <font color=#000099> - </font><a href="www.paxfamilla.org">Pax Familla.org</a><font color=#000099> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-groccouons&BL=groc>PRINT FREE GROCERY COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
