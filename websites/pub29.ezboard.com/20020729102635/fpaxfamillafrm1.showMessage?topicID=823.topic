<br>
<br>
                         Renion even though you may not of trained the zone on purpose, the real problem is how you shouted and made an ass out of yourself. there were paxers in that zone playing their alts when you were running your mouth. And as a officer i would expect you to watch your actions more closely and set an example for other guild mates. But cause you ran your mouth, people look down on us. I dont and will NOT be in a guild like that. And i didnt tell you to leave the guild, that was all on your own, i said you didnt make a good officer, and i'm sorry but you dont! Everyone shouldnt have to clean up someone's mess. We already do things ever so often to let people know how good of a guild we are, but you pulling dumb ass stunts like that, doesnt help at all. You may be mad at me, but i dont care, cause that kinda behavior isnt acceptable!!!!<br>

Erri/Simpathy here:<br>
<br>
In regards to Renions post I am am still wondering what could have been going through his mind. Was it not enough that he made an ass out of himself that day? Yesterday he was back in the Oasis shouting again. Nolandar and Tashanolands alts were there listening to this yet again. When I was informed I immediatly brought Erri up and ran over there. Unfortunately he had camped by the time I arrived. But none the less I did appologize to the players in both Oasis and NRo. Amazingly enough in return for my shout I was thanked. Then I proceeded to sow every person that passed me. I do not think that our guild event there will be damaged in any way. As a matter of fact I think it is ironic that we chose Oasis before this incident occurred. It will only help us even more at this point.<br>
