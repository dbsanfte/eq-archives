<br>
The genteel paladin is a man of taste, more at home at a formal ball than a bloody battlefield. While his military skills are has finely honed as those of any paladin, he views combat as an unpleasant necessity; enemies should be dispatched as quickly as possible, preferably with flair and style. He owns the finest clothes and equipment he can afford, and spends as much time on personal grooming as others do practicing weapon skills. He is preoccupied with courtly etiquette and elegant living, looking forward to the day when he can retire to his stronghold and live out the remainder of his life as a proper gentleman.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Conceited, prudish, romantic, intellectual, precise, opinionated.<br>
<br>
Inquisitive<br>
<br>
The inquisitive paladin has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Outgoing and amiable, his interests know no limits; he's as fascinated by the rice-growing techniques of elven farmers as the mating rituals of ankhegs. His curiosity often frustrates his companions, who may be eager to resume their travels while he lingers behind, discussing doctrine with a local priest or engrossed by a newborn bluebird pecking its way from its shell.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Carefree, shallow, talkative, wise, distracted, warm, studious.<br>
<br>
Optimistic<br>
<br>
Relentlessly cheerful and unflaggingly confident, the optimistic paladin could not imagine a better life for herself. She is utterly convinced of the righteousness of her cause, and looks forward to each day as a new opportunity to bring more goodness into the world. She delights in the companionship of others. Her comrades find her a source of inspiration and a beacon of hope in times of despair.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Nurturing, compassionate, extroverted, compliant, humorous, relaxed, warm.<br>
<br>
Philosophic<br>
<br>
The philosophic paladin is drawn to the pleasures of the mind, preferring a poetry reading to a jousting match, a science text to a glass of fine wine. He enjoys scholarly debates on religion and history, and is fascinated by new cultures. His aptitude for intellectual analysis makes him an excellent tactician and valued advisor. Rarely impulsive, his actions are measured and deliberate, born of logic rather than emotion.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Thoughtful, cold, hesitant, dispassionate, meticulous, curious.<br>
<br>
Prudent<br>
<br>
The prudent paladin acts with deliberation and foresight, believing that fortune smiles on the cautious. He weighs his words before speaking and is loathe to undertake a mission without careful planning. He is impressed by logic, unmoved by emotion. His rational, dispassionate approach to problem-solving makes him a superb tactician and arbitrator, though some find him cold, even calculating. His level head tempers his private affairs; he manages his stronghold well, avoids debt, and rarely succumbs to temptation.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Shrewd, insightful, unfriendly, arrogant, keen-witted, reflective.<br>
<br>
Secretive<br>
<br>
For reasons of his own, the secretive paladin reveals little about his background, motivations, or personality, even to his closest companions. He may wear a hood or visor at all times to conceal his features, dress in black or other dark colors, and cover or remove any heraldic symbols from his equipment. He keeps to himself, seldom speaking unless absolutely necessary; he may even wear a scarf around his mouth to muffle his voice. Though he faithfully fulfills his obligations to his party, he keeps his companions at arm's length. There are many possible reasons for his behavior. He may be a fugitive from the law, unjustly accused of a crime, or a renegade from a government allied with evil. He may be doing penance for an ethos violation. Or &quot;he&quot; may be a woman, compelled to hide her sex because of social customs that restrict females from becoming paladins.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Quiet, studious, eccentric, impulsive, threatening, nervous.<br>
<br>
Tormented<br>
<br>
The tormented paladin lives in the shadow of insecurity and self-doubt. She holds herself to impossibly high standards, sometimes measuring her deeds against those of renowned paladins of history or legend, never considering that those deeds may have been fictional or exaggerated. At her core, the tormented paladin feels unworthy to serve her government or church, this despite her unimpeachable ethics and flawless performance on the battlefield. She scoffs at praise, resists assurance from her friends, and continually berates herself for perceived mistakes.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Kind, sullen, analytical, shy, humble, sorrowful<br>
<br>
Vengeful<br>
<br>
A passionate hatred of evil fuels the vengeful paladin, who crushes his opponents with savage fury. Often, he's motivated by revenge; perhaps he saw his parents slaughtered by drunken ogres, or his village burned to the ground by an evil warlord. In any case, he seems intent on single-handedly eliminating evil from the face of the planet.<br>
<br>
Secondary Traits: Unapproachable, moody, bitter, bold, inspiring, violent.<br>
<br>
Congratulations are in order if you have read all of the above. Obviously, some of the above listed traits of a Paladin class of warrior will not work within the confines of EverQuest. (Do you really want to protest a group you're in because they invited a Shadowknight or Rogue? Do you really want to give up that dragon armor you just won? I think not.)<br>
<br>
The information above is far from complete, but it does give a very good insight into the world of the Paladin. With this in mind, it makes a difficult class even harder to play, but much more rewarding. We are the true Boy Scouts of EQ. I will let someone with more time than I have to come up with a set of voluntary rules and guidelines (remember, if you have rules and guidelines you must have rewards and punishments) for a sub-guild of the Silver Hawks. <br>
<br>
The name I have come up with for this sub-guild is Argurions. As one suggestion, we can be known as the Silver Hawks of the Argurion Way. In ancient Greek, the word agurion with the proper adjective means silver. We are then the silver lining of the Silver Hawks. Also in biblical text, silver has the meaning of: God's word; the tongue of the just; of good rulers; and saints purified by affliction.  <br>
<br>
Our basic creed should be something like: <br>
<br>
Truth above all;<br>
All are equal;<br>
Words are the sharpest of swords;<br>
Compassion is the way of life;<br>
Need before greed;<br>
Defenders of all that is good;<br>
Death before dishonor.<br>
<br>
Sorry this was put in three parts, but its the best that I could do. Let me know what you think. &lt;I kneel in humble reverence&gt;<br>
