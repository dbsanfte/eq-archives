<br>
<br>
The journey to Sol A was short, with just a few, brief breaks to terrorize the will-o-wisps. Robyn loved the wisps ; the wisps despised Robyn. Much of Robyn's equipment can be attributed to the little darlings' demise. Sumlain knows Robyn's passion for the Greater Light Stones and is quite used to her whispered &quot;Can't resist - must destroy&quot; whenever they pass through the commonlands. As a result, their arrival to the Lavastorm dungeon was a bit delayed.<br>
<br>
Solusek's Eye was everything Robyn had heard it was - fast paced, dangerous and exciting. Swarms of fire goblins attacked everything in sight! Rob and Sumlain's gnome buddy, Tyber, chewed them royally for being late, again. Sighing theatrically, he escorted them to the guild's meeting place where introductions began. The leader of the guild was Grendl Nighthunter, a handsome rogue with a cocky attitude. Also there was Kuurus, who seemed to be terribly tall to fit the classic rogue figure. Another bloody blade was Falesh, also being quite the dashing figure. Several other blades were present and many more joined during the hunt. The target was the Predator, a very nasty piece of filth that has wonderful boots and a powerful weapon.<br>
<br>
During the gathering, Grendl learned that Robyn was seeking a specific item in Sol A. However, she was too inexpereinced to obtain it herself. Grendl and Falesh decided that it would be fun to take Robyn and help her finish her quest for the vambrace. The trek was very dangerous until a bardic friend of Grendl's joined to add his invisibility song to the group. Grendl grumbled very loudly about this particular song ruining his hide capability but understood the necessity for Robyn's sake. The group finally reached their spot and prepared for the creature to spawn. However, before the great event could happen, an ambush occurred and everyone tried to flee. Alas, poor Robyn, unsure of her location, was caught in the whirlwind and was sliced to ribbons.<br>
<br>
In Norrath, death is not final ; it is just an inevitable, painful process everyone experiences quite often. When Robyn regained her new body in Freeport, she was stunned at the ferocity of the attack that just occurred. She caught her breath and took off for the trip back to Sol A. Once back she was greeted by Sumlain who soothed her battered soul. Grendl soon arrived offering profuse apologies and sweet words to the hurt warbler. Kuruus and the bard soon joined Grendl and Robyn and the troupe marched back to find her body.<br>
<br>
On the way back to her corpse, Robyn noticed Grendl staring at her and asked what was wrong. Grendl said &quot; I was just noticing how nice you look without all that armor to hide under.&quot; Shocked, Robyn began to blush (a rare event) and stammered some lame response. Grendl gave her a huge grin and replied, &quot; I am going to have to deepen our acquaintance so that you become used to being half naked in front of me!&quot; Kurrus began gagging while the bard just rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
The party reached Robyn's corpse and she quickly donned all her items. Grendl made lewd suggestions about helping her with the difficult pieces. Robyn said, &quot; Yes, I am a difficult piece, and you will have to work hard to smooth anything over me, bud!&quot; Grendl heard the challenge in ther voice and he knew he had a new quest!<br>
<br>
Almost as soon as the 4 heroes (heroes?) got back to their new location, a swarm of gobs descended on the younger Blades back in the Predator Room. Grendl responded to their yells quickly and efficiently. The adventureres reached the predator room in the nick of time, wiping the floors with goblin spit!<br>
<br>
All good things must come to an end and Robyn and Sumlain had to call it a night. Grendl escorted Rob and her companion to the entrance and wished her a good evening while kissing her hand. He said,&quot; You shall be hearing from me soon, sweet bird&quot; and leapt down the stairs back to his guild. Sumlain glared at Robyn and said,&quot; Arrogant bastard isn't he?&quot; Robyn just smiled and said,&quot; Why yes he is, but very cute!&quot; <br>
