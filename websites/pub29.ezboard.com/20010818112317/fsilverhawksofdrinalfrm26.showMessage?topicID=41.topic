<br>
<br>
 Pets are a great addition to the mage class.  The pet has the ability to tank fairly efficiently, adds great support, and gives you protection.  Along with the great abilities that the pet has, it is also very retarded.  Verant admits that this is on purpose, so you need to be smart on how you control it, and fast in doing so.  <br>
   I have noticed that if you pause too long in controlling your pet, it can get out of hand and greatly increase the danger to the party.  I have one page of ten hotkeys that apply to grouping and controling the pet.  <br>
<br>
 My hotkeys are:  <br>
1:         /pet kill %t  <br>
2:        /pet report health <br>
3:        /assist  &lt;someone&gt;<br>
4:        /pet back off <br>
5:        /pet guard here <br>
6:        /sit down<br>
7:        /pet follow me<br>
8:        /spells<br>
9:        /pet stand up<br>
10:        /pet sit down<br>
<br>
        I like this set up because it gives me the ability to control my pet with a touch of a button.  I can have it attack, back off or guard within a VERY short time.  This is important because often, timing is crucial.  Unfortunately, within one of the few patches ago, they nerfed the commands.  You used to be able to give repetive commands quickly, but seems to be that you can only give one command every two seconds.  This might just be due to bad lag. /shrug.<br>
<br>
<br>
**Crowd control**<br>
<br>
        Something that a pet isn’t often used as is: a crowd controller.  Since level 35, I have the opportunity to sit on my butt and watch what is going on.  I can see if a mob is going to be added, and quite often am the first to notice. (I actually noticed this before I lost my spell book as well.  I didn’t just look at the mob, I always had an eye out for adds.)  If the mob looks like it will aggro a caster, pull the pet off of the assisted mob and have it taunt the added mob.  <br>
        This is highly effective because if done right you can have the pet taunting the mob before the caster can really start to say “on me!”  I have saved more than one life by doing this.  Just imagine, you see a mob coming in, and the cleric is closet, standing up to cast a healing spell.  Now, if you immediately pull pet off and target that mob and cast, you can often get the pet to attack it before the mob will hit the cleric, which most often interrupts the healing spell.  The tank will thank you for this, as will other members because when tanks go down, it’s a BAD thing for the casters.  (We aren’t very social with the mobs like the tanks are..  Can’t stay long enough to keep a good conversation!)  This technique is effective, and when mastered, your group will stay alive much longer.<br>
  Zamori (a enchantress) and I have perfected the art of me putting the pet on a mob and then pulling it off just as she mezzes it... (provided no lag.. of course! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  she has a hotkey that she hits that says... &quot;Mezzing &lt;some dumb mob with no brains&gt;&quot; and I watch, wait about 1 - 2 secs, and then hit... PET GET OFF! (/pet back off)...  This can be highly effective, but takes practice and cool heads.  <br>
<br>
  Tips:  <br>
<br>
·        When you tell your pet to sit down to regen health, always tell it to follow you after you send it in to attack.  This will have the pet return to you instead of sitting down wherever it finishes killing the mob.  This helps in group and solo situations.  You should do this during the fight or just before the pet gets to the mob.  If you do it too early, then the pet MIGHT see that as an overriding command and not attack.<br>
<br>
·        I always keep a pet spell on my list.  If for any reason it looks like your pet is going to die, I begin casting right away.  I immediately type in the command /pet get lost (to kill the pet) so if the old pet is still alive, I can kill it before the new one with full health comes into the battle.  If it does die, then I erase the “lost” part of /pet get lost and hit enter, so I can continue on with other spells without having to erase all of what I typed in.  This also is an incomplete command, and will  prevent you from accidently killing your newly summoned pet!<br>
<br>
·        If you hit F1 twice, you can very quickly target your pet.  This is useful for healing him or watching how fast he’s dying (or hopefully not dying!).  Can be used for buffing the pet as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Summoning**<br>
<br>
<br>
        We are extremely good at this.  We have an immense number of different spells to summon things.  My favorites right now are rings of levitation, modulation rods, daggers for the pet, coldstones because I’m a blind erudite, and food and water.   Whenever I get into a group, or I see someone in need, I always ask if they want some of these items.  Many people do not know what you can summon.<br>
         Pullers love the arrows and throwing knives that I summon for them.  They aren’t great damage or don’t have great range, but they are free.<br>
        Any barbarian, human or erudite absolutely NEEDS a coldstone (unless they have something like a glowing band).  We are nearly blind at night and a coldstone (or heatstone for that matter) greatly improves vision, and thusly, effectiveness.<br>
        At level 44, we get a really cool spell, summon modulation rod.  To use this, you put the summoned item in a general slot, and right click on it.  This will take approximate a bub and a half of health, and give you approximate a half bub of mana.  This could save a party when a healer or evacer uses this and gets that extra mana needed to evac or heal.  I strongly suggest that you hand these out. J<br>
<br>
**Nuking**<br>
<br>
        Mages are pretty decent nukers.  Overall, I believe we’re the second most powerful nukers, behind wizards.  Nuking properly is very important, so you don’t get aggroed, and yet do a lot of damage to the mob as well.<br>
        Wait.  Period.  It’s the hardest thing in the world to do, but you need to assist the tank and sit on that butt of yours.  Med until the mob is about 60% health, stand and nuke.  This allows you to nuke for maximum damage, and yet be safe from any aggro.  Depending on the group balance and mobs you’re fighting, you most likely won’t get more than two nukes in.  That’s ok.. That’s still efficient, because you’re doing your damage with pet and nuke, and getting lots of med time in to stay near full mana.<br>
        I understand how hard it is, yet nothing will kill you faster than you overnuking.  At high levels, you have to sit much longer. I’ve had to wait over two minutes before while tanks and pet are pounding on a mob, until the health gets down to a level where you can safely nuke. <br>
        If you nuke early, this big bad mob that is taking out tanks like butter will be upon you.  Now, I currently have around 700hps, and the mobs we fight generally hit for 80s,90s and beyond; double, triple or quad hitting.  It doesn’t take a mathmatician in order to figure out that it only takes a couple of seconds for a mob like this to take me from full hp to zero. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
**Meditation**<br>
<br>
<br>
        Downtime sucks.  Everyone hates it, and I loathe it.  In order to reduce downtime, you need to have mana.  In order to have mana, you have to med.  As much of a pain in the butt it is, do it.  Period.  Sit on that butt every second that you can.  You might be in a cool new place, but sit down.  You’ll get to see more later when the mobs are cleared and it’s safe for your wimpy self.  Open that cursed book and read.  You will have more mana, so you will be able to nuke more and keep the party alive.<br>
        There is nothing more frustrating in the whole world than to see any caster standing around or meleeing when they could be medding and then a couple seconds later, they are OOM.  That is just wrong!  It’s more efficient to the party if you sit down and med, and then when it’s time to fight, you’ll have mana and can nuke.  The party will kills the mobs faster, and you’ll get more experience/loot…  And you’ll have a lot more fun!<br>
<br>
**Research**<br>
<br>
Research is a pain.  I have gotten to the point where I don’t even research anything anymore, since you have to chain research everything.  Fortunately, Verant is looking into this, and hopefully will change it.<br>
Until then, I will impart something that I’ve learned.<br>
Don’t use the concordance of research.  It’s a lot of time and effort, and hardly increases your skill very much.  Unfortunately, several levels of the concodance is bugged, and even if you put the right ingredients in, you will get an error saying that you didn’t do it right.  My suggestion, avoid it.  Period.<br>
Keep all words and items that you come across.  I have a stockpile in my bank, and found that basically you will need them a lot.  For example, in order to get your lvl 29 water pet, you must buy the lvl 16 spell from either FP or OOT.  Then, you will research to get the lvl 20 spell.  Once you have that, combine the items to get the lvl 24 spell.  Once there, you can finally attempt to research the lvl 29 spell.  After all of this, you will get your lvl 29 water pet spell…  If you didn’t fail.  If you failed, you have to retry again. L  What I suggest is ask me, Cien, or other higher mages to do the research for you.  I keep my research skill up so that I can help out guildmates with their lower lvl spells.<br>
