This information has been pulled from several sources, Britannica Encyclopedia, TSR, just to name a few. The information also delves into the heart and soul of the Paladin. Hopefully, this will enlighten you as to the true demeanor of these holy knights. Some of the information is not relevant to playing a Paladin on EQ. It is interesting stuff anyway, if you can wade through all of this (if not, at least read the last several paragraphs). <br>
<br>
A brief history of the Knight:<br>
<br>
The education of a knight began at the age of seven, when he was taken from his home and sent to the castle of some famous nobleman, perhaps his father's lord. Here he served the lord and lady as a page until he was 14 years old. It was his duty, and he considered it a privilege, to accompany them at all times. He waited on them at the dinner table and went with them to various affairs. He received religious instruction from the chaplain and training in arms from the squires. He was taught by his mistress and her ladies to honor and protect all women. He also learned to sing and to play the lute, to hunt and to hawk. Above all else, he learned to ride a horse. <br>
 <br>
At the age of 14, he became a squire. He now learned to handle sword and lance and to bear the weight of the heavy armor. In addition to his other duties, he had now to carve at the dinner table and to accompany his knight to war. He assisted him in putting on his armor. He saw to it that the knightly swords, as well as other arms, were polished until they shone. He stood by to give aid in conflict should his lord be overmatched and to lend his horse should the master lose his own. It was the squire who raised his knight when he fell and who bore his body away if he were wounded or killed in battle.<br>
 <br>
In the Prologue to Geoffrey Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' is the following description of a squire: &quot;His clothes were embroidered red and white, as it were a meadow of fresh flowers. All the day he was singing or playing upon a lute, he was as fresh as the Month of May. His coat was short, with long wide sleeves. Well could he sit a horse and ride, make songs, joust, and dance, draw and write. He loved so ardently that at nighttime he slept no more than a nightingale. He was courteous, modest, and helpful, and carved before his master at table.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Knighting Ceremony: <br>
<br>
At the age of 21, if he had acquitted himself well as page and squire, the young man was made a knight. This was an occasion of elaborate ceremony and solemn vows. After a purification bath, the candidate for knighthood knelt or stood all night in prayer before the altar on which lay the precious armor he would don on the morrow. In the morning there was a religious ritual, with perhaps a sermon on the knight's duty to protect the weak, to right wrongs, and to honor women. Then in the courtyard in the presence of the assembled knights and fair ladies, a knight's armor was buckled on, piece by piece, a sword was girded about his waist, and spurs were attached to the candidate's feet. He then knelt to receive the accolade. This was a blow upon the neck or shoulder, given by the officiating lord or knight with his fist or with the flat of a sword. As he gave it he said, &quot;In the name of God and St. Michael and St. George, I dub thee knight; be brave and loyal.&quot; The ceremony was followed by exhibitions of the young knight's skill in arms. <br>
Sometimes on the occasion of a knighting, the lord at whose castle the ceremony took place gave a tournament. This was often a very gorgeous and extravagant entertainment. Knights for miles around were invited to come and take part, while many persons of distinction came to see the events. Sometimes the visitors came in such numbers that the lodgings of the castle were filled and tents were put up to accommodate the later arrivals. Each knight's shield with its coat of arms served as a sort of doorplate to the passersby, who when they saw a familiar device displayed would say, &quot;Sir Percival is within this tent.&quot; <br>
<br>
In the morning, after attending mass, the knights would go to the tourney field, or lists. Here the combats or jousts between the knights were fought. Sometimes two knights fought alone, sometimes whole companies met in combat. When all were assembled, the heralds announced the names of the contestants, and the new knight looked upon the most brilliant scene that the times had to offer. Along the sides of the field were handsome pavilions filled with beautiful ladies, lighthearted young pages, and jewel-bedecked nobles. The knights were resplendent in shining armor, with swords and golden spurs giving back the sunlight. Banners fluttered, and here and there gleamed gorgeous cloth of gold. <br>
<br>
The combats which took place in this gay setting were not gentle ones. The points of the weapons, to be sure, were usually encased in blocks of wood to make the encounter less dangerous, but the sport was so rough and the knights jousted in such earnest that many were wounded and some were killed. About each knight's helmet was tied the favor his lady had given him, and he fought to do her honor quite as much as to do himself credit. The joust was attended by much excitement, with the blowing of trumpets, the clash of steel, the shouts of heralds, and the applause of the spectators. It continued until one or the other of the knights was overcome. If he was still alive, the defeated knight then yielded his horse and armor to his adversary and was assisted from the field by the squires. <br>
<br>
Sometimes a tournament lasted for several days, feasting, dancing, and hawking filling the hours not given to fighting. Hawking was a sport indulged in by the ladies and the squires as well as by the knights. Almost every lady had her own hawk or falcon which when unhooded was trained to rise into the air and attack game birds.<br>
 <br>
Often during the festivities of a tournament, a large pie was baked and live birds were concealed inside. Then in the great hall the pie was opened, the birds flew about, and the falcons were loosed at them. This was considered great sport and has been immortalized in the nursery rhyme-- <br>
 Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye, <br>
 Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie; <br>
 When the pie was opened, the birds began  to sing; <br>
 Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before a king? <br>
<br>
Into the Great World of Adventure:<br>
  <br>
After the festivities attending the conferring of knighthood, the young knight was free to go where he pleased. Usually he rode forth in quest of adventure, armor on his back, his spurs on his heels, and with sword, shield, and lance ready to hand. <br>
<br>
As a knight-errant he sought a fair maiden in need of a champion or a strange knight with whom to joust. Sometimes he stationed himself at a bridge or crossroad to challenge to combat any knight who happened by. He was usually sure of hospitality at any castle to which he came. After a time he might return to his father's castle or join the following of some great lord or become one of the multitude of crusaders who journeyed to rescue the Holy Sepulchre. Whenever or however he went he took with him the three watchwords of a knight: Religion, Honor, and Courtesy. The ideal knight is thus described by the poet Chaucer: &quot;And though he was valorous, he was prudent and as meek as a maid of his bearing. In all his life he never yet spake discourteously but was truly a perfect gentle knight.&quot; <br>
<br>
With the rise of the longbow and the crossbow carrying wounds or death from a distance, and the invention of gunpowder and cannon rendering useless the feudal castle, the knight in armor passed out of existence. Knighthood then came to be merely a title of honor for persons who served the king or country. <br>
<br>
During the Middle Ages, several orders of knighthood were founded. The first of these orders arose while the Crusades against the Muslims were in progress. Among these orders were the Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, now called the Knights of Malta; the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, known generally as the Knights Templars; the Hospitallers of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem; and the Teutonic Knights. Many of these orders became strong political powers in the late Middle Ages. (See also Crusading Orders.) <br>
<br>
The orders that were formed during the Crusades had a religious origin. There were also a number of purely secular orders of knights founded by various monarchs in Europe. Some of these orders have persisted into the 20th century; membership is bestowed upon citizens who have made outstanding contributions to society in the arts, sciences, politics, and the military. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the best-known order is that of the Garter, established by Edward III of England about 1348. Other orders of the British Empire are that of the Bath, founded by George I in 1725; the Order of St. Michael and St. George, founded by prince regent, subsequently King George IV, in 1818; the ancient Scottish Order of the Thistle, thought to have been founded about 787 and revived by James II in 1687; the Royal Victorian Order, founded by Queen Victoria in 1896; and the Order of the British Empire, founded by George V in 1917. The Irish Order of St. Patrick was founded by George III in 1783. <br>
<br>
Other countries had organizations of knights as well. In France, the Order of the Golden Fleece was founded in 1430. It later became the principal knightly order of both Austria and Spain. Portugal had the Order of St. Benedict of Avis. In Germany, there were the orders of the Black Eagle and of the Red Eagle. Russia had three orders: St. Andrew, St. George, and St. Nicholas. The Danish Order of the Elephant was founded in the 15th century and revived in 1693. The Norwegian Order of St. Olav was not founded until 1847. In the Far East, Japan had two orders: the Chrysanthemum and the Rising Sun. In countries that are no longer monarchies, the best-known modern order is the French Legion of Honor, which was established by Napoleon in 1802. Other republics have similar orders of merit to award civilian and military honors. <br>
<br>
With all that said.<br>
<br>
Ethos<br>
<br>
The set of principles that structures a paladin's life and regulates his behavior is called an ethos. While an ethos may encompass the written laws of society, its scope is much broader, incorporating spiritual edicts and moral absolutes to form an ethical ideal. A paladin's ethos defines his attitudes, shapes his personality, and influences virtually every decision he'll ever make.<br>
<br>
Though a guiding ideology is certainly not unique to paladins, the paladin's ethos differs from that of other character classes in two significant ways. First, the paladin's ethos is complex, comprising a long list of general guidelines and specific rules. Second, the paladin's ethos is uncompromising, requiring absolute dedication. Violations have severe consequences, ranging from reprimands to suspensions of privileges. Extreme violations may result in a complete loss of status and permanent removal of all his special abilities.<br>
<br>
Still, the paladin considers his ethos a privilege, not a burden. To him, all conduct has a moral quality. Every action is a choice between right and wrong. With justifiable pride, he considers himself an embodiment of the highest standards of human behavior.<br>
<br>
We begin with the three general components of the paladin's ethos: strictures (formal rules), edicts (commands from authorities), and virtues (behavioral values). The final section explains how a paladin may violate his ethos, and suggests suitable punishments and atonements.<br>
<br>
Strictures<br>
<br>
The most important elements of a paladin's ethos are his strictures, a set of inviolable rules that the paladin must follow at all times. The paladin's strictures are as inflexible as his ability requirements; they are part of what defines a character as a paladin and distinguishes him from other classes.<br>
<br>
Lawful Good Alignment<br>
<br>
Every paladin must be lawful good. The moment he abandons the conditions of this alignment is the moment he stops being a paladin.<br>
<br>
At the heart of a lawful good alignment is the belief in a system of laws that promotes the welfare of all members of a society, ensures their safety, and guarantees justice. So long as the laws are just and applied fairly to all people, it doesn't matter to the paladin whether they originate from a democracy or a dictator.<br>
<br>
Though all lawful good systems adhere to the same general principles, specific laws may be different. One society may allow a wife to have two husbands, another may enforce strict monogamy. Gambling may be tolerated in one system, forbidden in another. A paladin respects the laws of other lawful good cultures and will not seek to impose his own values on their citizens.<br>
<br>
However, a paladin will not honor a law that runs contrary to his alignment. A government may believe that unregulated gambling provides a harmless diversion, but a paladin may determine that the policy has resulted in devastating poverty and despair. In the paladin's mind, the government is guilty of a lawless act by promoting an exploitative and destructive enterprise. In response, the paladin may encourage citizens to refrain from gambling, or he may work to change the law.<br>
<br>
Particularly abhorrent practices, such as slavery and torture, may force the paladin to take direct action. It doesn't matter if these practices are culturally acceptable or sanctioned by well-meaning officials. The paladin's sense of justice compels him to intervene and alleviate as much suffering as he can. Note, though, that time constraints, inadequate resources, and other commitments may limit his involvement. While a paladin might wish for a cultural revolution in a society that tolerates cannibalism, he may have to content himself with rescuing a few victims before circumstances force him to leave the area.<br>
<br>
When will a paladin take a life? A paladin kills whenever necessary to promote the greater good, or to protect himself, his companions, or anyone whom he's vowed to defend. In times of war, he strikes down the enemies of his ruler or church. He does not interfere with a legal execution, so long as the punishment fits the crime.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, a paladin avoids killing whenever possible. He does not kill a person who is merely suspected of a crime, nor does a paladin necessarily kill someone he perceives to be a threat unless he has tangible evidence or certain knowledge of evildoing. He never kills for treasure or personal gain. He never knowingly kills a lawful good being.<br>
<br>
Though paladins believe in the sanctity of innocent life, most kill animals and other nonaligned creatures in certain situations. A paladin may kill animals for food. He will kill a monster that endangers humans, even if the monster is motivated by instinct, not evil. While some paladins avoid hunting for sport, others may hunt to sharpen their combat and tracking skills.<br>
<br>
Wealth Limits<br>
<br>
A paladin has no interest in wealth for its own sake. He seeks spiritual rather than material satisfaction, derived from serving his faith and his government to the best of his ability. To a paladin, the pleasures of ownership are fleeting, superficial, and ultimately debasing. The rewards of duty are lasting and deep.<br>
<br>
Still, the paladin realizes that a certain amount of money is necessary to survive. Rather than forego money altogether, he retains enough wealth to meet his worldly obligations and sustain a modest lifestyle.<br>
<br>
A paladin doesn't expect handouts, nor does he rely on the generosity of strangers or his companions. He feels responsible to pay his own way and takes pride in his self-sufficiency. He earns income from treasure, rewards, and fees, the same as anyone else. Unlike most other characters, however, the paladin operates under strict guidelines as to how he can spend his money and how much he can save.<br>
<br>
Budgeting <br>
<br>
A paladin requires funds to cover the following expenses:<br>
<br>
Food. A paladin is responsible for feeding himself and his steed. To hold down costs, the paladin might hunt his own game, and may gather fruits, nuts and vegetables from the wilderness.<br>
<br>
Weapons, armor, and clothing. This includes the costs of purchase, upkeep, repair, and replacement. A paladin seldom skimps in this area, spending as much as his funds will allow to secure the highest-quality equipment.<br>
<br>
Tack and harness. As with weapons and armor, many paladins splurge to buy the best, especially for bonded mounts.<br>
<br>
Lodging. When sleeping outdoors isn't practical, paladins seek out the least expensive inns.<br>
<br>
Taxes and licenses. The paladin must make all payments required by his liege. He must also pay all foreign tolls and fees levied during his travels.<br>
<br>
Training costs. A paladin may pay a tutor for training, providing the tutor is of lawful good alignment and the paladin has permission from his patron. (See Chapter 7 for more about training procedures.)<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous provisions. Including medicines, lantern oil, clothing, bedding, and grooming supplies. Many paladins prefer to forage, improvise, or manufacture these items instead of buying them outright, in order to save money.<br>
<br>
Salaries. Fair salaries are required for all servitors and henchmen.<br>
<br>
Excess Funds <br>
<br>
All of a paladin's excess funds must be forfeited. This includes all money remaining after he pays his regular expenses, as well as any money not specifically allocated to a savings fund for building a stronghold. He may keep a contingency fund equal to two or three times his normal monthly budget but no more. He may not stockpile money to buy gifts, leave to his heirs, or pay a friend's expenses.<br>
<br>
What does a paladin do with the excess? He has three options:<br>
<br>
Refuse it. If an appreciative community offers him a sack of gems for destroying a vampire, he politely declines. (&quot;Your gratitude is more than sufficient.&quot;) If he discovers a treasure chest filled with pearls, gold pieces, and a book of poetry, he takes the book and leaves the rest (and he's likely to give the book to a friend or a library after he's finished reading it).<br>
<br>
Donate it to the church. This does not count as a regular tithing (see the Tithing section below), as it's not considered part of his income.<br>
<br>
Donate it to another worthy institution of lawful good alignment. Suitable recipients include hospitals, libraries, and orphanages. Research facilities, military organizations, and governmental operations are acceptable only if the paladin is certain that the money will be spent on lawful good projects.<br>
<br>
Within these guidelines, a paladin may dispose of his excess funds as he wishes. He may donate treasure to a hospital on one occasion, and refuse a monetary reward for rescuing a kidnapped prince on another. However, he may never give his excess funds to another player character.<br>
<br>
Remember, too, that just because a paladin declines a reward for rescuing a prince doesn't mean his fellow party members can't accept it. If a paladin kills an evil dragon, then walks away from its treasure hoard, his companions are still free to help themselves.<br>
<br>
Loans <br>
<br>
A paladin falling on hard times or confronted with unanticipated expenses may arrange for a loan from a lawful good character or institution. While borrowing money may be a humiliating experience, it's rarely an ethos violation unless the paladin borrows money he doesn't need or doesn't intend to repay. Repeated borrowing is discouraged, and chronic debt should be considered an ethos violation. <br>
<br>
Tithing<br>
<br>
A paladin must give 10% of all his income to a lawful good institution. This 10% is called a tithe. In most cases, a paladin tithes to his church or other religious organization. If he doesn't belong to a church or operates independently (as in the case of the Expatriate character kit described in Chapter 4), he may designate any lawful good organization, such as a hospital or university, as the recipient of his tithes. A paladin has no say in how his tithes are spent, though the money typically goes towards the institution's maintenance, recruitment, equipment, and education costs. A paladin usually tithes to the same institution for his entire career.<br>
<br>
A paladin's first tithe usually comes out of his starting funds. After that, he must tithe from all sources of income, including rewards, treasure, wages, and profits generated from his stronghold. When he acquires a gem or magical item, he owes his designated institution 10% of the item's value, payable at the earliest opportunity. If he finds a diamond worth 500 gp, he owes 50 gp; if the gem is lost or stolen, he still owes 50 gp (the institution isn't penalized for the paladin's carelessness).<br>
<br>
Tithes are due only on funds the paladin actually claims for himself. If he walks away from a treasure or refuses a reward, no tithes are necessary.<br>
<br>
It's the paladin's responsibility to get his tithes to his institution as soon as possible. A monthly payment will suffice in most cases, with the paladin turning in 10% of all the income he's acquired in the previous four weeks. If a monthly payment is impossible or impractical-for instance, if the paladin is on a mission halfway around the world, or if he's a prisoner of war-he may make other arrangements, providing he offers a satisfactory explanation. A paladin may personally present his tithings to his institution or he may deliver them by messenger.<br>
<br>
Tithes carried by the paladin but not yet delivered are still considered to be the property of the institution. A starving paladin who has no other funds aside from 10 gp of tithes may not spend his tithes on food, unless he first petitions his deity for permission. If he's behaved responsibly-say, if he used his last gold piece to pay for treatment of a dying child-permission is usually granted, with the understanding that the tithes must be replaced.<br>
<br>
Alignment of Associates<br>
<br>
A paladin is known by the company he keeps. Ideally, a paladin associates only with good-aligned companions. Relationships with neutral characters may be tolerated in limited circumstances, but prolonged contact may result in an ethos violation. Any association with an evil-aligned character can be construed as an evil act. In general, a paladin bears responsibility for the actions of his associates, even those taken without his knowledge or consent.<br>
<br>
Hirelings. Without exception, all of a paladin's men-at-arms and stronghold employees must be lawful good. The paladin should do his best to determine their alignment before he hires them. Should a hireling commit an evil act or otherwise reveal himself to be of an alignment other than lawful good, the paladin has no recourse but to fire him and, if necessary, turn him over to the proper authorities for prosecution.<br>
<br>
In some cases, a paladin shares responsibility for the evil actions of his hirelings. For instance, a paladin's stable master commits murder. The paladin may not be legally liable, but he may be considered an accomplice in an ethical sense. Although the authorities may not prosecute the paladin, he may still suffer a punishment for violating his ethos, particularly if he was remiss in investigating the stable master's background prior to his employment. As always, it's up to the DM to determine if an ethos violation has been committed.<br>
<br>
Good characters. In an adventuring party, a paladin naturally gravitates to other lawful good player characters, making them his confidants and closest companions. Rarely, however, can a paladin choose the composition of his party, as fate often throws together characters of vastly different outlooks. A paladin cooperates with a party so long as the majority of the characters are good-aligned; a majority of neutral characters or the presence of even a single evil character may present problems.<br>
<br>
A paladin can maintain a comfortable partnership with a neutral good characters, despite his reservations about the neutral good character's indifference to social structures. However, the neutral good character must be working strictly in the interests of good. A paladin is less at ease with chaotic good characters, owing to their independent nature and lack of respect for authority. But a paladin will work with chaotic good characters so long as their behavior complies with his goals.<br>
<br>
Neutral characters. Next to good characters, some paladins feel most comfortable with lawful neutral characters, admiring them for their sense of duty and loyalty to their government. This, of course, presumes the lawful neutral characters serve reasonably benevolent governments, not despots or slave traders.<br>
<br>
A paladin will cooperate with a party that contains a minority of lawful neutral or true neutral characters. But he most likely keeps neutral characters at arm's length, resisting their gestures of friendship. Instead, he tries to serve as an example to the neutral characters, hoping to convince them through words and deeds that a commitment to good results in a richer, fuller life. So long as neutral characters refrain from committing evil acts, a paladin continues to work with them.<br>
<br>
A paladin won't join a party consisting entirely of neutral characters, unless the stakes are exceptionally high. He may, for instance, work with a neutral party to retrieve a holy artifact, rescue his king, or save his church from destruction. For less momentous undertakings, such as treasure hunts or reconnaissance expeditions, the paladin should excuse himself. (If a party mostly consists of neutral PCs, the DM should explain the general nature of a new adventure to a player with a paladin PC. The player should have the option of gracefully bowing out of the adventure or choosing another character.)<br>
<br>
Evil characters. Because he is duty-bound to suppress evil, a paladin won't tolerate an evil PC. He may take the evil PC into custody, physically restrain him, or demand his expulsion from the party. If all else fails, the paladin severs his ties with the party and go his own way. In any event, inaction is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
A paladin finds it difficult, if not impossible, to avoid contact with evil MOPs. They're everywhere: walking down a street, dining at an inn, shopping at a bazaar. A paladin's ethos doesn't compel him to attack or even confront all evil MOPs; in many cases, hostile confrontations could be counterproductive, particularly if such an action distracts the paladin from a more important mission, or if it triggers retaliation from the MOP's companions against innocent bystanders.<br>
<br>
Time and circumstances permitting, a paladin may question evil MOPs, follow them, or make inquiries about them. None of these actions violate a paladin's ethos when used in moderation. (However, spying and similar actions should be a last resort, because they connote deception). A paladin walks on shaky ground, however, the moment he begins an association with an evil MOP that could be perceived as friendly or compliant. <br>
<br>
Edicts<br>
<br>
Edicts include commands, instructions, and traditions the paladin has pledged to obey, usually imposed by the paladin's patron. The paladin must follow his edicts to the letter; he takes them as seriously as any other element of his ethos.<br>
<br>
A paladin doesn't choose which edicts to follow. Rather, he pledges to follow any and all edicts issued by specified sources. The paladin chooses his sources when he begins his career. <br>
<br>
Occasionally, edicts from different sources may conflict. For instance, a paladin's church might issue an edict that clashes with an edict from his government. In most cases, religious edicts take priority over edicts from other sources. In all cases, a paladin's strictures and core principles have priority over strictures issued by any social institution. For more about conflicting edicts, see Chapter 8.<br>
<br>
Religion and Philosophy<br>
<br>
If the paladin belongs to an organized religion, the church will probably be the major source of edicts. Church edicts encompass spiritual obligations, behavior restrictions, and service requirements. Philosophies, too, may have their own edicts, imposed by the architects of the philosophy or by the paladin himself. A deity may also issue edicts to the paladin directly, appearing in a dream or as an avatar. Chapter 8 discusses religious and philosophic edicts in detail.<br>
<br>
Government<br>
A paladin who has pledged fealty to his government must follow its edicts. Some examples:<br>

Mentor<br>
Paladins who have no ties to an organized religion often choose to follow the edicts of a mentor. A mentor can be any teacher, sage, or elder whom the paladin respects; often, the mentor is the paladin's ethical role model or the person who tutored him in philosophy. A group or organization can also qualify as a mentor. Possible edicts:<br>
<br>
Take regularly scheduled tests that measure intelligence or integrity. For instance, the mentor may engage the paladin in probing philosophic discussions on the nature of evil or the obligations of friendship.<br>
Care for the mentor in his old age.<br>
Pass along the mentor's ideas to a young acolyte of the mentor's choice. (In effect, the paladin becomes a mentor to someone else.)<br>
