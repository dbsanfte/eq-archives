The Beta 3 disks are at the duplication house and being replicated now. I don’t have a date to announce to you yet but I can talk about our revised schedule. When we start Beta 3 (which should be soon) we’re going to invite in another 5000 people first. We’ll test stability for a week or so then add in more, ultimately ramping our number up to 50,000 people selected from this site.<br>
<br>
I can also let you know that there are three disks to Beta 3. In addition to the game itself, we include an installer for DirectX 9. The artwork on the disk is the same Danato cover that we used for Beta 1, except Beta 1 was monochromatic, Beta 2 was two-toned color, and Beta 3 is full color. As a little perk, I’ve included a shot of it here. I’m not sure what the art for the released disks will be yet.<br>
<br>
As for what is currently going on in Beta 2, we’ve stepped up our pace of interaction with the Beta testers. Holocron is posting regular posts indicating what our highest priorities are and what testers should be focusing on. We’re working on more frequent updates. In fact, except next week’s Beta Update to talk about tester reactions to Han Solo’s home world.<br>
<br>
A week ago we had another player wipe. This one also took out the Player Association halls. This week we remade the PAs, but this time we gave the deed to two beta testers to place and manage. The Force Sensitive Sheep and Holy Floating Shrubs are back in business and completely player run. Already the two PA leaders have been in negotiations to plan a limited PA war. Instead of just turning on the war and letting it go for several days, they are planning on having their forces go to a town (I think Anchorhead) and turn on the war for a couple hours, essentially playing a player driven king of the hill. It will be interesting to see how our first entirely player driven event works out.<br>
<br>
For your reading pleasure here is a tester thread from the Beta Forums:<br>
<br>
quote: Mattt's Expedition Outpost<br>
<br>
First, I want to begin by saying that last night was not only the most fun I've had so far but the most fun I've had since my UO days, years ago. Before I begin, I also want to apologize to Shug Ninx for stealing the name of his idea.<br>
<br>
Last night, I received a few messages outside of the game (tells are not working all the time!) from some friends that they were joining the Force Sensitive Sheep. Wanting to seek the knowledge of the Sheep, I headed to the coordinates to join up with them. Once I arrived, I was greeted by friendly members of the PA and accepted into it. I took a look around the PA hall first. It was very big!<br>
<br>
There was a group forming outside; they were going to go hunting. I joined up with the group and went out to explore Tatooine. One of the first fights we got in was easily one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had in my life. There we about seven of us facing probably ten or more NPCs: almost everyone had blasters. A huge firefight erupted; blasters bolts were flying in every direction. I thought to myself, &quot;Now THIS is Star Wars.&quot; After the last NPC fell, we all cheered for our victory. There was some damage done to us but we were mostly all in good shape.<br>
<br>
We continued on, hunting for more things to kill. I was certain to make use of the moods; I spent most of the time being bloodthirsty. We came upon a nest of dragonets. We had to be careful or they would overwhelm us. At one point, they did seem to overwhelm us; however, our team pulled together and triumphed. One of us was incapacitated but not killed. After resting up a bit, we were ready to continue.<br>
<br>
For about an hour, we fought group after group of NPCs or creatures. Everyone fell to our blades or blasters in the end. It was getting late, so I had to logout but I knew what I'd be dreaming about that night.<br>
<br>
Near the end, I realized that I had made quite a bit of experience. While group experience is said to be bugged, I really didn't care; I was having a lot of fun. The latest Q's Query asks how the developers can get the players' minds off &quot;the grind.&quot; Well let me tell you: grouping is the answer. When you get a really good group going, you don't even remember there is such thing as experience. You just play the game. It is more than that. You are in the game.<br>
<br>
Here is a response to that post from one of the group members:<br>
<br>
quote: /agrees with Mattt 100%<br>
<br>
Last night was an absolute blast. We were all having so much fun, we had to make a vow to not let Holo find out.<br>
<br>
That blaster fight Mattt referred to cannot be understated. Ten of us engaged about 20-25 armed NPCs, and the blaster bolts were flying in every direction for a good five minutes. Everyone of us at one point said &quot;Wow&quot; or &quot;How cool is this?:<br>
<br>
By the end of the night our tactics were down pat, and we were fluid on who would pull, when to fire on the lair and when not to, everyone was utilizing /assist properly, and we looked like a battle-hardened unit prepared for the coming PA War.<br>
<br>
I was having so much fun, I was completely unaware of any such thing as a grind. I reached Advanced Rifle and Advanced Camp in Scout, and made it half-way to Advanced Ranged Combat Specialist without so much as noticing I was working for xp. I even got to enjoy the glory of making a camp entirely out of the hides and bones of the dreaded dragonets that laid me low.<br>
<br>
quote:<br>
<br>
One of us was incapacitated but not killed.<br>
<br>
When a man leads his troops into battle, he must be prepared to give his life for them. I think I was the only person incapped more than once the entire night.<br>
<br>
Now although we agree that grouping is fun, we are also working towards balancing for the solo player as well. As a side note, we’ll be hitting Mattt with a lawsuit for copyright infringement on Shug’s posts, of course.<br>

Today we are sending Beta 3 CDs to our existing Beta 2 members. Next week we will make the switch over to Beta 3 with them. Assuming all goes well, we’ll start sending out the invites soon thereafter. As stated, we’re going to ramp up the numbers, starting with 5000. Again, if all goes well, we’ll get the numbers up to 50,000 within a month or so. The NDA will remain for the time being.<br>
<br>
I’m guessing (and only guessing) that our official release date will be announced once we are a little bit into Beta 3.<br>
