<br>
Perhaps we can hold a guild meeting once a month hosted by Suntoucher at a time of his choosing.  We can all find a safe place to sit down and can attend via guild chat!  Great way to get info to everyone and time can be posted on the guild moto so all can plan to attend.<br>

What we say in here and post in here is only available to registered users with EZ boards, some not registered in the guild cant say anything but in the game, and the person they want to talk to might not be on.  This is why we should have a guild meeting IN game and post it on MOTD, so that when a person logs on, he or she will read the MOTD and come to the meeting and can get their opinions and debates out for EVERYONE to here. =o)<br>

Erri/Simpathy here:<br>
<br>
Just a quick observation here Suntoucher.<br>
<br>
Only around 9 or 10 members have posted on this site since I have begun reading them. Not even all of our officers post here. How is it that you think this is all we need for communication? Unless of course we some how only have 9 or 10 members now and the rest are alts. As far as I know most folks in the guild have no clue what is happening with raids or just general info. It would be nice to inform everyone in the guild of our status,ie: how many members we have, who is doing what, who has lvled, where our next raid is going to be, even that we want to do a buffing station as Abbrah has suggested. This kind of forum (in game meetings) lets people know that we are there to not only listen to them and their ideas but also that we care about them as individuals and value them as members. As we grow that information highway that we set up now will help the guild to prosper. People will know ahead of time that the first weekend of every month (for example) they will have a forum to voice there thoughts and opinions on where they want the guild to go and just maybe have some excellent ideas of new things to do as a guild.<br>
<br>
Well this turned out to be my 2pp's worth instead of just 2cp's  =D<br>

Greetings to all my fellow Paxers.  In considering guild meetings while in-game, please let me offer the following:<br>
<br>
I must, to some degree, agree with Suntoucher.  While I am well aware that not all Paxers are registered to post here..and many that are registered do not post...it is VERY difficult to hold a guild meeting in game.  Those of you who transitioned here from Sons of Tao are well aware of what I mean...and here's why:<br>
<br>
1.  It is VERY difficult to find a date/time that is good for everyone.<br>
2.  Those who don't/can't show up for the meeting constantly complain about decisions made in their absence.<br>
3.  It is hard to hold a meeting, especially about something that may be controversial, without everyone trying to talk/offer suggestions at once.<br>
4. It is VERY hard to find a date/time that is good for everyone (yes, I repeated it, cause it bears repeating) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, I would like to suggest a guild motd that would suggest/require (at Sun's choosing) that all members be registered here in order to obtian guild info.  We all know RL can be a major pain in the butt at times, and can seriously hinder our play time, but if we want to be a part of the guild, we should all take the responsibility to register here to keep up with what's happenin'.<br>
<br>
Just my 20pp (sorry, Erri, I got on my soap box a bit, so I guess it will cost me more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Hope you all have a great day, and I hope to see you all in-game soon.<br>

FYI I have been in a guild that had this type of meeting on a weekly basis.  All found a safe place in Norrath to sit and be a part of the guild meetings.  While I found weekly meetings to be excessive, I felt that monthy meetings would be very productive.  I never saw a single meeting get &quot;out of hand&quot; and the information that was shared was terrific! <br>
<br>
This may come as a shock to the 10 people that actually read these boards:  Everyone does NOT read these boards.  It is the same peeps posting over and over again.  When I wanted to schedule events, I found that few actually knew the events were taking place!  So word of mouth seems to be the order of the day.<br>
<br>
I would ask the following of you Suntoucher:  Please either incorporate monthly meetings into our schedule of events, or have the web address present on every single guild motd that is posted, no exceptions.  New players and old must know how to get to our site.  Many dont even know we have a site!<br>
<br>
We have a lot of ideas to share.  Unfortunately our hands are tied and we have no way of sharing information that we believe to be critical to all.  Please assist!<br>

I am in total disagreence(sp?) with the communtuications as is.  There should ABSOLUTLEY be at least a monthly meeting.

And if not, we will just pass on what will be brought up at the meeting to them and get their opinions out there at the meeting.<br>

You guys were busy posting last night while I was at work. Ok, I think Mazatlan said it good about the bad points of having guild meetings. Nobody can coordinate times, things can be a ruckus, etc..., but I feel I should add one more. Passion. Many times, in a &quot;live&quot; discussion, people can get really wrapped up in what they are saying. I'm sure you've all seen it especially over the computer. One person says something, that might be, might not be, innocent, and another person takes offense, or becomes extremely defensive over it. Live chat doesn't really give people, especially people who are in the heat of the moment, time to step back and consider their words before they say them.<br>
<br>
As officers, I also think it is our duty to inform people of the website, and ask them to go sign up at the message board when we invite new peeps. I know I do it every time and I thought everyone else was doing it too.<br>
<br>
That being considered, I would ask the officers to have all new peeps to come here and sign up, inform them of the message board and the website. I would like this to be our primary form of disseminating information, next to the /guildmotd of course. And... I'm open to the ideal of guild meetings in game once a month. I agree with (IIRC) Dumby in saying that once a week is too often. But, before there is a meeting, we should have a list of things that we are going to discuss.<br>

I aggre with Suntoucher, that we need a list of what we are going to discuss.  And i also agree with the idea of telling ppl that they need to sign up and post.  BUT, usually it goes in one ear and out the other.  i have gotten 4 people to join the guild.  And have not seen one of em come post.  Told all four of em the web site and that they should register and post.  Not seen a one of em do that.  And THAT is why i suggest guild meetings that are in-game.  I also agree on the grounds that live and on the spot doesnt give adiquit(sp?) time to think things over.  but in live time is the only way that our guild qill function as one and gget the opinions of everyone out to hear.  and for the people that have hard time making the guild meeting, those people should read the MOTD that i suggest should say something like.. MOTD &quot;Suntoucher- Ok Pax.  Guild meeting, (where and when.)  we will be discussing the issues of (issues.) all officers, please do not remove this MOTD untill the date of (date that is one week after the MOTD post.)  Thank you, good hunting!&quot;  And i think a week gives appropriate time to get to someone that is on and tell them their opinions on the issues that will be brought up if they cant make it to the meeting.  That is what i think, and i am sticking to it.<br>

Erri/Simpathy here:<br>
<br>
Well I have had enough about this whole thing! In game meetings are imparitive. Even if you at least have an officers meeting with each officers assistant present. Then at least the ideas and concerns of each individual in the guild will be addressed. I am sure that word can get around via the MOTD that if you have an issue or idea please let an officer know so that it can be brought up at the next meeting. <br>
<br>
It can also be done in such a way that any members that are online at that time may join the meeting but not allowed voice until such a time that the meeting leader  &quot;gives them the floor&quot;  This may be done by raising your hand in /em fashion as Dumby has suggested.<br>
<br>
Such simple things as that can allow all to hear the discussions and after each topic allow who ever wants to voice their opinion. But as I said, any topic that a member wants voiced must go through an officer to be brought to the table.<br>
<br>
If a member does not obey the rules then that member will not be allowed to the next meeting. Simple.<br>
