This one stands out for me. It's so awful it's almost funny. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Well, my worst res experience happened a while back and hasn't been repeated since, thank Brell.<br>
I have a time put aside, usually on two or three days out of a ten day playing stretch, when I do what I call &quot;res patrol&quot;. During those days, I usually will play for six to eight hours doing nothing but running around to zones and offering free rezzes and buffs.<br>
<br>
Well, on one of those days, around 1am or so, I was running around in Warslik Woods trying to find a mouldering halfling's corpse when I recieved a tell, &quot;Hi. Could u plz rez me in the Hole? I died and lost 57. I can port u 2 Toxx and pay u money.&quot; I did a /who and got 56 druid. Polite enough request, even in d00dsp33k, and he wasn't /anon, so I said sure. The distance didn't really matter, as my whole day was being devoted to charity, anyway. At about that time, I finally found the halfling and ressed him. I told the druid to meet me at Skyfire and I'd be there in a little bit.<br>
<br>
On the way, I ran into two ressees in OT who knew that that day was my charity day and they asked me to res. I agreed, telling the druid I was having a bit of a hold-up. While I was ressing the two at the ramp, druid boy starts getting impatient. &quot;I say Id pay u. Why u rez others when I say I pay u??&quot; I replied that his offer didn't make much of a difference, because I don't charge or accept donations when I'm on &quot;res patrol&quot;. By then, I had finished with the two resses and was back on my way to the Skyfire zone. I got several &quot;R u coming yet?&quot;s, but opted to ignore them. <br>
<br>
I bound at Skyfire/OT zone and proceeded to run along the wall toward the port spot. . .straight into the loving arms of a necro-led train of faeries and devourers. All my buffs went bye-bye as I (stupidly) attempted to heal the necro. We leapfrogged back to the SF/OT zone, with me running ahead and healing as he came slowly forward, dragging his train. The necro made it. . .I, sadly, did not. Two devourers had Numi for lunch.<br>
<br>
There I am, repopped at zone and medding for my res when I get the tell, &quot;R u coming yet??&quot; I inform the druid that I was killed, myself, and am waiting to res my corpse. He, being an entirely sympathetic person, tells me, &quot;WTF? How u die here? No one I know die in SF!&quot; I tell him to please be patient and I'll be there shortly. He agrees, with a polite &quot;. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay! Res is done and I'm back on track! I run back along the wall (keeping an eye out for necros, this time) and make it to the port area with no snags. He's waiting for me and we group up for the port. While he's casting it, I get this pearl of wisdom, &quot;Next time u run thru SF, make sure ur buffed. Mabee then ull live.&quot; I sigh and we port away.<br>
<br>
When we arrive in Toxxulia, he tells me, &quot;U go on. KOS in Paineel. My corpse at is zone in Hole.&quot; I opted not to mention that all good races are KOS in Paineel and disbanded. I took off to the destination and arrived, unKOSed, at the Hole.<br>
<br>
When I entered, did a /who and saw that I was the only one there. I started to swim for the shore and got a res request from an old guildmate who had died in SolB. I told her I'd be there as quickly as I could, and finished my swim to the shore. When I hopped up. . .big surprise. No druid corpse. I sent him a tell asking where he had died. He tells me, &quot;Near the big rock.&quot; I asked him to clarify, hoping that they had added a big rock near zone-in since the last patch. Happy to oblige me, he answers, &quot;Near the big rock in front of tower.&quot; I begin to cry.<br>
<br>
Now, let me say that I am certainly not one to turn down a challenge. One of the reasons that I've been coddling this druid guy is that, with all of his rudeness, it's a challenge in itself. But, running down and pulling his corpse is going to hurt. I tell him I need a few minutes to think. He tells me, &quot;Hurry plz, I only have a few minutes left.&quot; I swim outside to bind and recharge JBoots, then swim back in and begin to buff. I ask the druid to consent me. By the time I'm finished, my buff row looks like a canary. I med until I'm at 70%, take a deep breath and RUN my widdle legs off.<br>
<br>
Amazingly, the train doesn't catch up to me until I'm at the rock itself and targeting his corpse. But WOW, does it catch up to me. I'm down to 3 bubs of health before I can get off my DA. Toting my package back, I run for the zone. In the main hall, my DA wears off and I'm down to 1 bub before I can DB. By the time that wears off, however, I have zoned. I tell him I have to wait for the train to return to its spawn spots and he tells me, &quot;U not have to train! Just sneak and ur gnome so wont get hurt.&quot; I make a mental note to ask him what neat drugs he's taking, then zone back in.<br>
<br>
Yaay! I've done it! Train is gone and corpse is at shore. I send him a tell asking if he's ready for a res (I always do this, afk experiences have taught me:P). He tells me, &quot;WTF do u think???&quot; Brell gives me the patience not to mem revive, so I cast resurrection. When he pops and I heal him, he stands and proceeds to open a trade window with 10pp in it. I cancel it and tell him that I don't accept donations. I begin to get spammed with the trade window. He won't give up. I finally acquiesce and take the @#%$ 10pp. . .I can always spend it on a peridot, I think. <br>
<br>
He is now medding and I have another res to do, so I humbly ask for a port to Lavastorm, as there is another in need.<br>
<br>
He tells me, &quot;Sure, for 10pp.&quot; I take a moment to walk away from the keyboard and bash my head against a hard object. I return and say, &quot;Will you not just port me for free? I just went through an awful lot to help you.&quot; He says, &quot;Yes, but u charge me for res. I charge u for port.&quot; I say, &quot;Why are you being mean?&quot; He stands up, gives me a rude gesture, and ports away.<br>
<br>
Luckily, my old guildmate had a druid who could do the port to Lava, so she wasn't in trouble. I had plenty of time at the port circle to contemplate the idiots that roam Norrath.<br>
