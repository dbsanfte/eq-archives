<br>
<br>
T'was the night before christmas, all through Everquest<br>
Folks were trying to be happy, and doing their best.<br>
The druids and wizards were porting about,<br>
The clerics were rezzing, and the merchant would shout.<br>
<br>
The chanters were charming, the shamans were dishing out buffs<br>
VI was nerfing drops and making mobs more tuff.<br>
It seemed all was well as the long nite wore on,<br>
But somewhere lurking and waiting, one man proved it wrong.<br>
<br>
He was hidden in freeport, near the paladins Guild.<br>
He knew his target would stop there. and the kids would be thrilled.<br>
Off in the distance, a bard playing his flute<br>
was coming home from a night filled with fun and much loot.<br>
<br>
The one in the shadows readied himself for his quest<br>
Tonight would be a battle to put his skills to the test.<br>
His spells were all ready, his armor was clean,<br>
His blade hard been sharpened to a nice evil sheen.<br>
<br>
He bagan casting his spells, improving his sight<br>
Nothing would get by him on this cold and dark night.<br>
He could see the invisible, nothing would get past<br>
This had been his mistake in the Christmas last.<br>
<br>
At last he saw his target, crossing the skies<br>
He gathered shadows about him, evading most eyes.<br>
As the sleigh drew ever closer he could see his victim well,<br>
It pleased him to send one more down to Hell.<br>
<br>
The guards were all sleeping, they'd been drinking too much<br>
They didnt hear the sleigh as it landed with a gentle touch.<br>
As the fat man stood grinning he made not a sound<br>
He stopped and he took a good look all around.<br>
<br>
He reached in the sleigh for his bag of phat lewt,<br>
Then stopped as he saw a light gleam off his boot.<br>
It was at this moment the hunter attacked<br>
He lept through the air at the fat man's large back.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will not evade me Santa!&quot; was the battle cry,<br>
Tonight was the night when the fat man would die.<br>
Santa whipped around and began to cast<br>
But a shield upside his head interrupted the blast.<br>
<br>
There was a moment of silence as the men stared into each other's eyes<br>
But the silence was broken with new battle cries.<br>
&quot;I've come for you fat man, your soul shall be mine.&quot;<br>
Was answered with &quot;Bring it, it's Inky bashing time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Santa was quad hitting, but did little damage<br>
The DS on Kralthan made much battle spammage.<br>
The fight was going badly for poor old St. Nick<br>
He was getting a beating with every tick<br>
<br>
When it seemed it was over, it started anew<br>
Santa CH'd with a sound like &quot;Achew&quot;<br>
Kralthan was frustrated, and used his Harm Touch<br>
Which sent the fatty running, it had hurt him much.<br>
<br>
Kralthan gave chase, and hit Santa with a snare<br>
Santa CH'd again and turned to fight there.<br>
They stood on the rooftop, trading their blows<br>
As the world slept around them, nobody to know.<br>
<br>
Kralthan was winning, soon phat lewt would be his<br>
The sleigh, and the horses, and all that good shiz<br>
But then Verant stepped in, he was struck down with lag<br>
The fat man made a run and jumped in with his bag.<br>
<br>
As Kralthan stood helpless Ol' Santa managed to Gate.<br>
The lag went away and he stood frozen with hate.<br>
Somewhere far away, at the north pole<br>
Santa was thanking the Gods for returning him whole.<br>
<br>
Though it seemed somehow Kralthan had lost the duel,<br>
He'd try again next year, and perhaps break the rule.<br>
As he snuck into the shadows and out of sight,<br>
He shouted &quot;Merry christmas to all, and to all a good fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Here's a little something for those of us with evil twisted senses of humor to enjoy. As I was emailing it to my Guild I thought what the heck and copied it here. Laugh, flame, whatever.<br>
Kralthan.<br>
-edit Sigh,typos...must be sleep time.- <br>
