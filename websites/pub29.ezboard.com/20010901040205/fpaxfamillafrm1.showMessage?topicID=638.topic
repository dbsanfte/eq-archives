But it seemed more and more like people would just refrain from commenting or talking to me.  As long as I was in pax I got invited (out of 3 months or more being online almost 24/7) to MAYBE 6 pax groups or to come hang out with paxxers somewhere.  For anyone that did read scrimps post about his thoughts on pax... it indeed contained my resignation reasons for haveing atra leave pax.  <br>
<br>
Pax only ever felt like a family to me when people in the guild were RL friends and would talk to me, or when viloz and i were having a ball grouping in FrEnZy scoring FBSS and I was helping paxxers to get into the impossible Frenzy room. Being group leader in that room is absolutely stressful like running a raid is I'm sure.  When you are in a room that requires certain members to keep your group alive and to keep people believe you are doing your job as a leader.<br>
<br>
Should someone die while you are waiting or get a wipeout while waiting for someone to get there that's on the list you are to blame for not running a tighter ship. I think I'm a capable raid leader assuming people actually LISTEN to directions and don't try to steal the show or do things they think are better for the raid then the leader. If someone thinks they know more than the leader of the raid... they should lead one themselves.  A raid doesn't have time to explain to you why things are being done the way they are.  This is how raids get wipeouts for the most part miscommunication. I was on a chardok raid with my new guild and we were just a room away from working on killing a peice for someone's epic.  Well the monk in charge of saying &quot;move up, stop here, move up,&quot; failed to mention stop here at one point and we got a complete wipeout because 4 or 5 moving up meants a train of 9+ level 50+ mobs training us. <br>
Well in chardok that means RAID over get a necro you are fooked. Doggies throughout the zone see through invis and rogue hide sneak. <br>
<br>
Anyhow I've led a few midlevel CC raids which I did indeed enjoy very much but people in that raid and ToFS just didn't listen for anything. I had told them quite a few times that only group leaders were to loot as this is standards procedure on high level raids, i had 1 person maybe 2 I don't remember loot multiple times.  I even had to go as far as to tell him if you loot again you will be removed from the group and the raid. I repeatedly asked people to /y for emergency heals as i was not in a group so they could get exp and I couldn't watch their health. So we had 2 or more deaths but overall it went VERY smooth and was made to by lorentic/bongripe not wanting exp and bringing a cleric to rez/help me keep the groups healed. <br>
<br>
ToFS boy lots of us remember that raid for sure, and i'm VERY sorry warrbane we had to keep you up so long with one CR wipeout after another. But this is yet another story of people not listening, many many many times I would said ok we are moving. and 5 out of 8 would move and the others would still be sitting there... I would go get them and 1 out of 3 moves someone would either almost die or die. Now there was one secret wall that i'm sure in part caused one of the moving problems. but that doesnt' account for the 6+ deaths on that raid. We had a few people move somewhere that caused adds instead of staying put where the group was, and one person do it more than one time.<br>
<br>
This raid was still fun for me other than it running so late on CR. I earned something really nice and so did boone and heywoode my roomate.<br>
<br>
I'd love to lead more raids for pax in the future as I think I have what it takes but i'm afraid I will have to make my directions more clear and be much more strict with people that don't follow my rules. Attendence can be a problem on any raid but many smaller level raids can be done short on people if there is enough higher level support and good communication lines. I like leading mid and lower level raids with people that follow my directions and do as they are asked. I don't mean to sound like a dictator or a king but this is required if you wish to keep everything as the raid leader knows it must be to keep their raid alive and prosperous.<br>
<br>
Arg, my thought train is running slim and I've run way too many sidethoughts to flourish and I've forgotten where I was headed with my main points =)<br>
<br>
I'm going to also post this as a seperate thread on pax's board. Assuming it doesn't get taken down I'd like to know who would like to join my raids should I see there's enough people for me to do another. Should you join my raids there will be a warning for doing something you shouldn't and rules will be announced before the killing commences. <br>
<br>
I'm sure going to be a great raid leader I hope having one of every vital class all on seperate accounts... (cleric thanks to thrakuss, druid thanks to a friend of mine, and a shaman (no clue where this fits in leading a raid but he's high level!).) So my raids should not be able to fall apart as easily as some as I can rez the dead, port people that need rides, and be in the raid with considerable power to keep it will we pickup late comers. All these characters are on seperate accounts so I can do a little of everything at the same time. If I just had an enchie I would be wonderful raid leader shino gimme your info =)<br>
<br>
Anyhow for those of you that haven't.. read my post under scrimps post on lels area for atra's resignation reasons or at least some of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#66CCFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/utormark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#000099>(8/23/01 10:49:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pax raids anyone?</span><hr size=1> ooh ooh me...ill go!! where? pick somewhere hehe<br>

And, I know I was one of the people that looted when they should not have on the CC raid, but I didn't know any better not having been on any real raids before.
