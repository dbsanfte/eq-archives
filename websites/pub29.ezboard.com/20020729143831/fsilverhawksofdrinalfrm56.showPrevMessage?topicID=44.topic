Ok there seems to be some confusion when I'm running around Hibernia getting into groups. My attempt here is to try to enlighten some of you all about the Mentalist class, and hopefully help some of you make the most use out of that Ment in your group. I am writing this from a &quot;mana/Ment&quot; specced perspective. Some Ments are &quot;light&quot; specced and are more nuker orientated, but most Ments have most of these abilities so these little tips should still apply. <br>
<br>
Some facts you should know. <br>
<br>
1. Ments cannot Rez. We do not get rez so don't ask. For this reason, planning a group around a Ment being the primary healer is generally not a good way to go. Though we can play that role if need be. <br>
<br>
2. Terminology. <br>
HoT = Heal over time. This nifty spell will heal a higher lvl tank to full if allowed to run it's full course. It is 30 seconds. Here is the kicker though. It heals 33/66/99/132 points per tic but the length of the &quot;tic&quot; is determined by the actions of the recepient of the spell. When sitting, 1 tic = 3 seconds, standing it's 6 seconds and if the target is engaged in combat it is 14 seconds. <br>
<br>
HoT spells generate 0 agro and require very little power to cast (making them very effecient if allowed to work). <br>
<br>
PoT = Power over Time. Otherwise known as caster crack. A bard who has an equally strong power regen song will overwright this spell if turned on in the group. This buff lasts 10 minutes and a good Ment will keep it refreshed on all the casters in a group by keeping it on a timer. <br>
<br>
DoT = Damage over Time. Most of you know what this does. Some Ments who spec in their mana line will have 2 powerful DoTs they can stack on top of each other. <br>
<br>
Mez = Mesmerize. Immobilizes a creature for a set amount of time. Any spell, melee swing, or arrow directed to the target will break the affect. Monsters do not get to angry when they come out of mez making it easy for someone to get the thing off of the Mentalist when the mez is allowed to run it's full course. <br>
<br>
Confusion. Some Mentalist can cast a spell that will cause a creature to continually change their target. Basicly all types of agro generating actions are ignored. This works great in big open areas with a ranged damage party. Also works great with a bubble-warden in the group. The monster will continue to change targets hitting the bubbles. This can make it so a primary healer is unnecessary. <br>
<br>
Here are some things that you can do in a group to help get the most out of your pet Ment! <br>
<br>
Healers. As Mentioned, the HoT spell generates zero agro if used in battle. Since a tic = 14 seconds during this time, it helps to cast it, but not alot. The real benefit of this spell however is in downtime situations. If you are lower mana then the Ment in the group and the creature is about dead, do NOT burn your mana throwing unnecessary heals on the tanks! The Ment will throw a hot on them, the tank will sit down to get their stamina and before you can say QuasimoisacoollurikeenMentalistextroidanaire, he will be topped off in health. By this time you should just about be done getting your power back as well, ready for another pull! <br>
<br>
Another use! Lets say the tank whiffs their first few swings on the monster requiring you to throw that heal to keep the tank alive. Well, as we all know, that monster isn't going to like you very much and will come take a bite out of you. The tanks will eventually get the thing off of you (or your dead anyways) but you've not only accumalated some &quot;hate&quot; from the monster, your health is down to half. Do NOT heal yourself. A good Ment will toss a HoT on you and by the end of the fight you will be topped off. Remember, the HoT spell does not draw any agro! The same holds true if the Ment gets beat up a little while doing crowd control! Once those tanks have gotten a creatures attention, let the Ments HoT do the healing. This will keep the creatures attention where we want it... on the tanks, and not on the casters and healers. <br>
<br>
Bards! Please check with the Ment to see if they are specced in mana before turning on your mana song. If they are mana specced, there is a very good chance their PoT buff is as good or better then yours. There is nothing worse then having to recast PoT on everyone after every fight. Turn on your own HoT song or even better, Stamina regen and leave it. Advantage to the group is that the casters will have regen on 100% of the time. <br>
<br>
Casters. Ments who throw the power regen out there try their best to pay attention and keep everyone in tip top form but we sometimes miss it when the PoT expires. If you notice you do not have PoT buffed on you, feel free to give a friendly reminder  <br>
<br>
Tanks and enchanters (pets). If you are pulling something multi-, please ensure the Ment is ready for the pull. Unlike bards AE mez, we must be up and ready for those adds as we must mez them one at a time. Tell the group your pulling then wait a few seconds before doing so. If the Ment cannot readily see how many might be coming, it helps to know if it's single, double, or 3 or more as well. <br>
<br>
If a monster agroes the Ment due to a resist, remember the Ment has quick-cast. Unlike a bard, we can get a spell off when something is trying to bite off our heads. If the thing resists again or the quick-cast somehow fails then feel free to peel off and get agro. When you do though, switch back to the primary target and let that Ment get the thing mezzed. Multiple monsters running around camp beating on things sucks up allot of mana, which leads too much more downtime. <br>
<br>
With a good Ment in the group, your downtime should be very small. Watch those yellow buttons on the casters fill up and go get more monsters! <br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read. I hope some of you have a greater understanding of what a Ment can do for you in your group  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Silver Hawks Forever,</br>

When I have a mission, it consumes me; I will not be satisfied until the job is done. I have a strong sense of duty, and a strong sense of direction. Changes in the tide don't phase me - I always know which way the wind blows, and I know how to compensate for it. I get on poorly with people like myself. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>
