<br>
I was kicking back at VSHQ, I had just been checked out on the Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit, MAX for short, and was running through some pre-combat checks. The MAX I had just gained certification with was a pretty nice unit. Called the Comet class it had a high yield plasma-cannon for a right arm, servo assisted run mode and best of all jump jets. This baby would chew through armor like nobody’s business. <br>
<br>
I went to the nearest equipment terminal and requisitioned my trusty reinforced exo-suit. Checked that I had my full load out, Beamer, REK, and two Suppressor SMG’s. I keep one SMG loaded with standard hollow point ammo for soft targets and the other loaded with AP rounds for those pesky teddy bears. I’ve found drawing a new weapon is faster than swapping out magazines in the heat of it. <br>
<br>
Walking outside the training facility I linked up with orbital command and reported for duty. This alerted the automated subsystems of one of our satellites to search the world for possible active theatres. When the computer had decided on a hot-spot it activated it’s transporter routines and sent a dematerialization beam to scramble my atoms for me. When the selected location rolled underneath said satellite it shot me down to the planet in a stream of molecular particles to be hastily reassembled at the site of an area currently under dispute. <br>
<br>
Pulling out my Suppressor I checked my surroundings. I was in a cloning facility, judging by it’s size it must be an outlying tower somewhere. I pulled up my neural map and saw that I in the Southeast sector of Esamir. Sad news was judging by the output it looked like this was the only tower on the entire content currently under VS control. The Terran Republic owned this slice of the world. Great, talk about pulling the short stick! <br>
<br>
Even from the bowels of the tower where the cloning tanks are located I could hear the fight raging up top. Sounded pretty nasty and since this was TR property that probably meant MAX’s. I quickly assembled a squad of other arriving soldiers that had been just as fortunate as my self in pulling this docket. <br>
<br>
“Anyone have a sit-rep for me?” <br>
<br>
Noraa, who looked to be a Corporal in an Agile suit piped in, “Snuck in and took this tower myself Sarge. Looks like the TR are a bit unhappy about it at the moment. Got three Pounders up here and a good number of infantry to boot.” <br>
<br>
Pounders are what I call TR teddy bears. The most common MAX employed by the Terran bastards. This thing has dual mounted mini-guns firing 10mm caseless hollow point rounds at an unreal cyclic. Infernal machines are specifically designed to cause as much pain to infantry troops as possible. TR gets the most sadistic SOB’s they can find to man these machines of carnage. <br>
<br>
I ran over to the equipment terminal and pulled up my predefined armor configurations. In seconds I was back in the Comet. I dumped the medical supplies and filled up with a few more racks of ammo canisters. Using the jump jets I ascended the spiral stairs without touching ground more than twice. Stepping through the main doors of the tower out into the snow-covered terrain that is Esamir I watched as one of my squad was cut down by one of the three teddy’s advancing on the tower. They immediately noticed my bulky silhouette and trained their weapons on me. Poor bastards were loaded for soft targets, which I was decidedly not! <br>
<br>
The servo-assisted arm of my MAX took the recoil of the plasma-cannon and made it all too easy to stay on target while I fried the first teddy. The other two, obviously reevaluating their choice of careers, decided they were outgunned in a big f’ing way but turned up the heat in the hopes their hollow point ammo would eventually make it through my reinforced armor. They were sadly disappointed for all of three tenths of a second as my plasma bolts shredded through their armor and burned them alive in their God forsaken suits! <br>
<br>
“Thanks Sarge! Dam n Teddies were getting to be an annoyance. Think we got a cloaker in the tower somewhere, watch your back.” <br>
<br>
“10-4 Noraa, see if I can smoke em out.” <br>
<br>
A ‘cloaker’ as she puts it is just an enemy soldier wearing an infiltration suit. The thing has zero armor value, and can’t be worn with any armor underneath, but if you stand perfectly still you are completely undetectable when the cloak is activated. <br>
<br>
Stepping back into the tower I bounded up the stairs to the control panel on the third floor. As I peaked the last flight of stars to the third floor landing I found my target. I couldn’t see him as I haven’t gotten my Darklight implant yet, but I could see the laser link from his REK as he tried to hack into the towers mainframe. Knowing the command console was made of sturdy stuff I filled the area with three shots from my plasma-cannon frying little Mr. Sneaky like a hot dog thrown into a blast furnace. <br>
<br>
“Croaked the cloak.” I said with a smile marveling at my witty genius. <br>
<br>
AngerBall, a cloaker himself and part of my squad, chimed in, “We’ve cleaned up the rest of this attacking force. If they are kicking their clones out at the nearest base it will take them awhile to reengage. So, what’s the play from here Sarge?” <br>
<br>
I pulled up my neural map and assessed the situation. We were pretty bad off, stuck almost in the middle of enemy territory with no real hope of reinforcement without a base, or at least a few more towers, under our control. There was a main base named Mont about ten clicks northwest… <br>
<br>
“Alright, here’s the plan. Noraa head to the NW tower by Mont. Anger back her up. I’ll resup my MAX then start to head over myself. Everyone else head to the SW tower and take up observation positions, nothing goes in or out we don’t know about. We’ll take the NW tower first then work on the other mid-sized targets in the area. Mont is our end goal, but let’s do some prep work first. If we’re lucky VS command will ship a few more squads our way. But even if they don’t we’re here and TR owns too much realestate to make me happy.” <br>
<br>
My squad scattered like the well-trained death merchants they were meant to be. I headed down into the bowels of our tower and restocked my ammo playing out in my mind how best to assault Mont. Place was not going to be easy, even for a multi-squad effort, for my eight man unit it was going to be difficult if not im… imp… oh what the hell is that word? Oh well, doesn’t matter, the Terran dogs were going to have to get used to the idea that Vanu has come to roost! <br>
<br>
I opened my squad channel as I exited the tower and engaged servo-assisted run-mode on my MAX, “We’re going to get bloody on this one boys and girls. Hope everyone brought their wet-naps!” <br>
<br>
I set myself a waypoint via the neural-map and headed toward Mont… <br>
