<br>
World<br>
WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS HORIZONS PLAYED IN?<br>
Horizons is played in a vast land of high fantasy. Battles are won through the might of a handcrafted sword and the power of magical spells. Fantastic creatures, from the horrors of the risen dead to the majesty of the ancient dragons, prowl the land. Heroes arise to protect civilization from marauding beasts, journey to distant lands, create wondrous objects, and complete epic quests. <br>
<br>
HOW BIG IS THE WORLD?<br>
Our current planned server configuration allows for a greater than ten thousand square kilometer area to be represented for the game. If we should ever need to expand beyond that limitation, additional hardware can be added without bringing down the servers that would expand that area. While we are not currently anywhere near the ten thousand square kilometer mark, we are growing the sculpted area daily. As more tools become available, the rate of content expansion will increase. We do not know today the exact size of the sculpted space that we will have at launch, as that will be determined by the playability of the space that we create. We do not intend to release space that has not been carefully considered and tested for maximum enjoyment. We do know that the handcrafted space will continue to expand after launch with planned expansions and episodic releases. <br>
<br>
IS THE WORLD JUST EMPTY?<br>
Not at all - we're filling the world with flora and fauna, ruins, monsters, townspeople, mysterious artifacts, frontier towns, and many other things. Spending an hour running across the landscape with nothing to do isn't much fun. Players never have far to travel to locate adventure. Horizons is filled with interesting quests, complex AI, and riches to be discovered. <br>
<br>
IS THERE DAY AND NIGHT? CAN I SEE AT NIGHT? ARE THERE MOONS AND STARS?<br>
We have a day and night cycle. Players will not be required to carry torches around or constantly adjust with their gamma correction to play the game at night. Night has a dramatic impact on the appearance of the world, but it is not an annoyance to game play. Not only are there moons and stars (and planets!), but we also have the ability to model the motion of all celestial bodies to make them move realistically through the heavens. <br>
<br>
IS THERE WEATHER? CAN IT CHANGE AND MOVE? WILL MY CHARACTER DIE IF STRUCK BY LIGHTNING?<br>
There are many types of weather: snow, rain, fog, tornados, etc. All of it is dynamic. At any place in the world, at any time, appropriate weather for that area can start, stop, and move across the seamless landscape. <br>
<br>
Lightning is one of the attack types available in magic. If a character were struck by lightning due to a magical spell, then it would be possible to die from such an attack. However, we do not intend (even though we have the ability) to randomly strike characters dead from passing thunderstorms. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER CHANGE THE WORLD?<br>
Yes, you can. Players can build all kinds of structures in the world that are permanent changes. We will also have events that take place in the world, with players determining the outcome of the events. Those events can change the world and dynamically change the story line of that world. Some of the changes players contribute to the world may be only temporary. The ability to apply your will to the world of Horizons and see a result helps make Horizons unique. <br>
<br>
WILL THE WORLD CHANGE OVER TIME?<br>
Absolutely - first and foremost, Horizons is a dynamic game. The distribution of monsters, resources and available land will vary constantly. New content will be added to expand the world over time: new lands, races, schools, etc. In addition, the seasons will pass and the story will progress. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER OWN PROPERTY?<br>
Characters will be able to buy and sell property in the game world. They will be able to build structures on that property and create towns. Players will find property that is available to build on. The development team, to assure proper distribution and availability, defines these plots in advance. There will be controls in place to assure continued availability for new players. <br>
<br>
<br>
Character<br>
WHAT RACES CAN MY CHARACTER BE?<br>
Currently there are Humans, Fiends, and Dragons as finalized, playable races. As we finish each of them, we move on to add another race into the game, by release we expect to have more than that. Some of the other races on our &quot;To Do&quot; list (in no particular order and not exclusively) include: Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Orcs, Dryads, Giants and Halflings. <br>
<br>
IS WHAT I DO IN THE GAME DETERMINED BY MY CHOICE OF CHARACTER RACE?<br>
We want players to be able to play the game the way that they want to play it. Their choice of race won't limit them to playing the game in a certain way. Dragons are an exception to this, however, as they have some special rules attached to them. A dragon character will still be able to act in many of the available roles. It will not be necessary for you to start over as a new character if you decide to explore a different role in the game. <br>
<br>
HOW CAN MY CHARACTER LOOK UNIQUE?<br>
Characters in our game have a number of ways to differentiate themselves from one another. Obviously, which species and sex you choose will be the most obvious difference between you and another character, but we offer many other ways as well. Appearance is fully customizable. Players can change their character's skin tone, hairstyle, hair color, facial features, apparent age, and clothing. Our body structure is also fully morphing from fat to thin, muscular to wiry, and anywhere in between. Players also have the ability to add tattoos and scars further to differentiate characters. <br>
<br>
WHAT ABILITIES WILL MAKE MY CHARACTER DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHARACTERS?<br>
The primary differences in abilities between two characters will be determined by what schools they have gained levels in. Each school grants different abilities and improves different skills. Players can also gain abilities through quests and events in the world that will be unique from the standard abilities gained through a school. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER DIE?<br>
Yes, but we will not be imposing the standard horrific death penalties often associated with MMORPGs. We want death to be something to be avoided, obviously, but not something that makes you feel like you've wasted a whole night because you got unlucky once. <br>
<br>
<br>
Skills<br>
ARE THERE PROFESSIONS FOR MY CHARACTER?<br>
Yes, they are called schools. There are quite a few of them, such as Healer, Warrior, Jeweler, Wizard, Weaponsmith, and many more. Each represents a set of skills and abilities that determines the game play you will be experiencing at that time. Your character will not be forever bonded to a single school. So… you can change your mind without hitting the delete or character creation buttons. <br>
<br>
HOW WILL MY CHARACTER IMPROVE?<br>
Characters advance by performing actions in the world. Adventurers kill things, trades people make things, questing utilizes both of these advancement methods… and we are exploring other avenues that we will describe after we are sure they play well. Regardless, all of these things give you experience that lets you advance your character in the manner that you desire. You are not forced to kill monsters repetitively to advance in the game. <br>
<br>
IS MY CHARACTER FORCED TO REMAIN IN A SCHOOL FOREVER?<br>
Not in the least. Players are free to change schools at any time just by finding a trainer in the school that they wish to join. Most schools will accept anyone at any time, but some will require that a character meet certain requirements or perform tasks before allowing the character to join. <br>
<br>
<br>
Creation -- Updated<br>
HOW ARE ITEMS CREATED?<br>
Players create items by using various trade skills. Combining resources found in the game world represent trade skills. By adhering to formulas of item creation, players can create both functional and aesthetic items with these resources. As players make items appropriate to their level in their school, they gain experience. As they advance in level within their school, the trade skills in their school advance in rank. This allows them to make better, more advanced items. It also allows them to use fewer resources to make items they already were making. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER OWN A SHOP?<br>
Yes - characters will be able to own various styles and manner of buildings on their own property, including shops. Players will also be able to stock their shops with machinery that allows the use of certain trade skills, as well as buying or leasing the services of NPC vendors. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER BUILD BUILDINGS?<br>
Yes - there are specific trade schools filled with various skills that are dedicated to the construction and beautification of player-owned property. Players will be able to build a building, then make art and sculpture for it. Perhaps they might add an anvil in order to do some smithing. The possibilities are vast. <br>
<br>
DOES MY CHARACTER HAVE TO BUILD?<br>
No - you never have to participate in the trade skill system, though we recommend you giving it a try (because it's a blast!). We have provided specific player-to-player communication tools and game systems dedicated to trade skills and mercantilisms that better facilitate the interaction between adventurers and tradespeople. If you are an adventurer and really don't want to spend an exorbitant amount of time dealing with tradespeople in order to get the items you want for your character, then the tools and systems in the game will allow you to get what you need and get back to adventuring. <br>
<br>
<br>
Destruction<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER'S PROPERTY BE DESTROYED?<br>
A character's personal property is never destroyed. A character might not be able to get to a piece of property that they own because the Undead have taken over the town the property is in, and there are too many undead around for the player to get to their property. This is an example from towns on the outer edge of the frontier… it takes a brave player to settle the frontier. <br>
<br>
CAN OTHER PLAYERS KILL MY CHARACTER?<br>
Only computer-controlled opponents will be able to kill your character. The player vs. player version of Horizons is being developed separately in order to create a better experience for players. <br>
<br>
DOES MY CHARACTER HAVE TO FIGHT IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE HORIZONS?<br>
No. If you wish to play a tradesperson and sit in town making swords or scrolls, you can do so and advance without ever having to kill a single monster. Now if you happen to want to play a warrior who never fights, you will have some problems advancing as a warrior. <br>
<br>
<br>
Magic -- Updated<br>
IS IT DIFFICULT TO LEARN MAGIC?<br>
No. You will learn about all aspects of magic thoroughly in the tutorial. Just as easily as a player can hit a button to swing a sword, they can prep a spell for a quick cast. Spells are easily accessed through the customizable interface, as well. Your character can learn spells specifically by gaining spell scrolls that you can place in your spell book. Acquiring those scrolls will dramatically vary in difficulty. <br>
<br>
WILL MAGIC BE REPRESENTED BY 2-D GLOWING PARTICLES OF DIFFERENT COLORS?<br>
That sounds a bit boring, doesn't it? Our magic is represented by a wide combination of particles and geometry. Not only is it important that our effects look unique to each spell, but also that they stay consistent with our many spell themes. We have some truly spectacular spells and our only boundary is our own imagination. <br>
<br>
CAN ALL CHARACTERS LEARN MAGIC?<br>
Yes. If you wish to learn magic you are free to join any of the magic related schools. Even if you started your character in a non-magic school, you can learn magic later at any time by joining a new school. <br>
<br>
IS MAGIC THE ONLY WAY TO BE POWERFUL IN THE GAME?<br>
No. If you want to be exceptional at combat, you can learn physical combat skills and customize your character with a strategy in mind best suited to your personal play style. There are many sides of combat that compliment each other so it is a good idea to explore the many different skills available. <br>
<br>
<br>
Opponents -- Updated<br>
WHAT KINDS OF MONSTERS ARE IN HORIZONS?<br>
Creatures that are dangerous to players come in several major types. The first type that we are discussing publicly is the Undead. The Undead have a goal to rid the world of the living. They come in many varieties: from the mindlessly direct Zombies to the nefarious forces that command them. <br>
<br>
We have already shown TRAILER ONE:FILEPLANET &amp; TRAILER TWO (Right-Click::Save As) some of the Elemental type creatures that generally don't concern themselves with the actions of the players in the world. But beware interfering with their desire to be left in peace. <br>
<br>
We will be discussing more about the other types of creatures in the future. <br>
<br>
DOES MY CHARACTER HAVE TO FIGHT TO SUCCEED IN HORIZONS?<br>
No. But if your goal is to become a powerful warrior fighting is definitely the quickest way to success. Many of the quests allow for players to outsmart opponents rather than directly confront them. <br>
<br>
ARE ALL MONSTERS SIMPLY GOING TO ATTACK UNTIL SOMEONE DIES?<br>
No. Not all creatures will respond with a simple aggressive response. It will depend on the type and variety of the creature. While a Zombie might mindlessly pursue a selected victim unless destroyed, other creatures have social instincts that will drive them to behave in greatly varying ways. <br>
<br>
ARE THERE ANY VILLAINS THAT DESERVE TO BE FOUGHT?<br>
Horizons' story includes beings that are bent on the destruction of all living characters. Until they are defeated, no area, including long-settled lands, can be considered safe. Preventing them from terrorizing the world will require brave and powerful characters to cooperate in their defeat. <br>
<br>
<br>
Community -- Updated<br>
CAN I COMMUNICATE WITH MY FRIENDS?<br>
Yes. We are going to offer many different forms of communication to the player. Players will be able to open up chats with anyone in or out of the game world who is using our chat feature. They will be able to send emails as well through our game system. Our goal is for players to be able to get in touch with each other easily. <br>
<br>
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO FIND AND GET TOGETHER WITH MY FRIENDS?<br>
Our goal is for you to never be more than five minutes away from gathering with your friends in town. Players can teleport to their home towns at any time, and from there take one of our rapid transport systems to a more central location if they wish to meet up with a group of friends. <br>
<br>
CAN MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE OUR OWN TOWN?<br>
Players will be able to build structures and create a town, but any player can do so, and only in areas that we designate. So you and your friends can certainly build a town together, but you would not necessarily be able to be the only ones in that town. <br>
<br>
<br>
Economy -- Updated<br>
WHAT WILL CHARACTERS USE FOR MONEY?<br>
Gold will be the standard currency. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER OWN A STORE?<br>
Yes, players will be able to build stores and populate them with their own NPCs to buy and sell items. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER HIRE COMPUTER CHARACTERS TO WORK FOR THEM?<br>
Yes. Players can hire NPC merchants to buy and sell for them. We have the capability to let players hire other types of NPCs as well. <br>
<br>
<br>
Interface -- Updated<br>
CAN I PLAY IN 1ST PERSON OR 3RD PERSON CAMERA PERSPECTIVE?<br>
Yes. The game supports both first and third person views. <br>
<br>
CAN I RUN THE GAME IN A WINDOW?<br>
Horizons runs in a window on a PC. The window functions as any window, but also has the ability to be set to a traditional game style, with the render window being the entire screen. <br>
<br>
HOW MANY COMMUNICATION WINDOWS CAN I HAVE OPEN AT THE SAME TIME?<br>
You can have as many communications windows open as you want, separating your different conversations into individual windows. Or you can combine them to form multiple conversations occurring in the same window. <br>
<br>
<br>
Story<br>
HOW CAN I LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD?<br>
The history of the world will be available within the game through in-game books and dialogue. It will be available on our site and fan sites prior to Horizons going live. <br>
<br>
WILL MY PLAYER BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE ONGOING STORY?<br>
Yes. We will have events that determine much of the storyline for the game, and players will play a part in the outcomes. Horizons has a very dynamic in-game event solution that will support the players' influence upon the story. Characters that significantly impact the story will be woven into the in-game text. <br>
<br>
HOW CAN I KEEP UP TO DATE ON THE STORYLINE?<br>
We will be posting updates to our website, and also making that information available within the game world. <br>
<br>
<br>
General, Accounts &amp; Servers<br>
WHO IS DEVELOPING HORIZONS?<br>
The fine folks at Artifact Entertainment! There are many people on the team that have delivered major MMOG titles. The other stars come from various development, publishing and technology houses. <br>
<br>
WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR MY PC?<br>
The requirements will be released when we are closer to launch. The PC client is being developed with the specific intent of rewarding players who happen to have more powerful machines with increased visual appeal. The core game play will be fully supported on the minimum specified machine. <br>
<br>
IS IT BROADBAND?<br>
Our goal is to allow play via modem as well as higher speed connections. <br>
<br>
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?<br>
It will be priced competitively in relation to the other products on the market. The exact cost will be announced at a later date. <br>
<br>
HOW MANY CHARACTERS CAN I HAVE WITH ONE ACCOUNT?<br>
We will be announcing that later. We intend to allow for multiple characters per account. <br>
<br>
CAN MY CHARACTER MOVE FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER?<br>
We understand the desire to do this and we are exploring the feasibility of allowing this to be done. <br>
<br>
HOW MANY CHARACTERS CAN PLAY SIMULTANEAOUSLY IN THE WORLD?<br>
5000 players can connect simultaneously per world. <br>
<br>
IN WHICH COUNTRIES WILL ARTIFACT ENTERTAINMENT HAVE SERVERS?<br>
At this time we have a distribution agreement that covers the major Asian territories. We are self-publishing in North America and are currently discussing agreements for European partnerships. <br>
<br>
CAN I PLAY WITH MY FRIEND IN JAPAN?<br>
As long as you are connected to the same game world you can play with your friends, though performance will be better with a local server. Future agreements with partners will affect the availability of local servers. <br>
<br>
HOW DO I BECOME A BETA TESTER?<br>
Hang tight and keep your eyes and ears open! We will launch a full sign-up process through our site as well as fan sites.  <p><center>
