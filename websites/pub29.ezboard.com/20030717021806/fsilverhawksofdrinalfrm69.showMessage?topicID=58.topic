(Visit Sony to check out the game)  After reading his story, I find that he hit the nail on the head.. Totally true story... You have to play the game to appreciate how graphically true this is... <br>

<br>
Luxuriating at HQ, reading up on the new neural implant I’d just had installed, minding my own da mn beeswax. Aint that how it always starts? <br>
<br>
Got a call over the comm-link from one of my Outfit. They were pinned down in Sobec with a dead generator and no supplies. With wave after wave of Terran scum beating on their north wall they were looking at having a breach in the perimeter soon. <br>
<br>
I put on the line that I was sitting at HQ, it would take me awhile to reach them but I'd give it a shot and pray there was still a friendly flag flying when I arrived. <br>
<br>
I bolted to the airfield and requisitioned a Galaxy transport. As it was being assembled one of my outfit piped up reporting for duty. I invited him into a squad and started barking orders, &quot;We got a situation at Sobec. Get your a$$ to the vehicle req station and pull an ANT. I'll meet you at the JumpGate with a Gal to pick you up for the flight out.&quot; <br>
<br>
Being a good soldier he simply replied, &quot;On It!&quot; <br>
<br>
I prepped the Galaxy and launched under full burn toward the massive energy dome of the JumpGate to Ishundar. Flown more than a few times but the size of the JG's still impresses the hell out of me. 350' at the apex, coalescent energy in the shape of a massive dome, engineering marvels. <br>
<br>
I saw Cyko had deployed the ANT just inside the JG's perimeter and he was siphoning off nano's. I soft landed right in front of the vehicle and waited. When the ANT tanks were topped off Cyko remotely dropped the ramp of the Galaxy and drove the ANT right in. Securing the door I lifted off and flew at full burn right into the transwarp conduit. <br>
<br>
Reappearing on the Cyssor continent I pulled up my nav-map and right clicked on the Sobec base. Took me awhile to find it as it was glossed over with combat alerts. Closing the nav-map window I saw a shaft of light spring up from the ground off to the southeast. Pointing the Galaxy toward I hit the gas, hard! Judging by the amount of activity my mates probably didn't have a lot of time left. <br>
<br>
I yelled into my comm. Over the roar of the Galaxy’s twin engines, &quot;Sobec squad leader, sit-rep?” <br>
<br>
“Sit-Rep follows; Screwed, blued, and soon to be tattooed. Having a Monday down here, how’s your day going?” <br>
<br>
“Was having a relaxing day at Sanctuary till I got your screaming for Nano’s. Thought I’d swing by and have a look at the teddy bears ya’ll are having trouble with. Try to secure a landing site for me. I have a loaded ANT for you boys, Merry Christmas!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nice timing Cuda, secure landing site is a no-go, way too many hostiles. We need that Nano though, med labs and equipment terminals are all off line!&quot; <br>
<br>
“Alright, let me see what I can work out. Stand by.” <br>
<br>
I decided to do a fly over and see if I could find a spot to set down. Terran bastards were all over the place, including the air! Calling them teddy bears was just a dig at the Sobec squad leader, nothing quite as ball sucking scary as seeing a Terran MAX unit spraying hot death your direction. <br>
<br>
Cyko started shouting from the cargo bay that he was taking hits back there, and sure enough my damage indicator was letting me know someone had our number. I kicked in the burn and dove for the base below. Looking over my shoulder I could see I had a pair of Reaver fighters hell bent on taking me down. I increased my dive to try and get some distance; the boys on the ground must have put @#%$ their suits. The Galaxy is a large troop carrier, seeing one dive out of the sky right at you is enough to make anyone's knees go a little soft. <br>
<br>
I noticed there were very few troops in the courtyard of the base as most were on the walls repulsing the attack. I decided I could make it squeeze if I could just get these @#%$ Reavers off my @#%$. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sobec command I got a Reaver problem here!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We see you Cuda, keep it coming, just don't nose in on us!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Will do!&quot;, and I pushed the throttle to the stops. <br>
<br>
At the last possible second I nosed her up, skimming along the courtyard at 3 or 4 meters I shot under a walkway, over some stacked cargo and through the main gate, which I imagine surprised the living hell out of the advancing enemy ground troops! I hit full burn and pulled back as hard as I could, looping up and back around to face the base, a nice bit of flying if I do say so myself. Through my main view port I saw the last of the Reavers, that believe it or not were dumb enough to try and follow me, get chewed to pieces by the wall mounted turrets the boys in my outfit were manning. I flew through their detonating debris and set the pretty badly damaged Galaxy down right in the courtyard of the base. <br>
<br>
Cyko downed the Ramp and deployed the ANT, which automatically started filling the Nano-Silo of the base. The shouts of my boys as the med-bay and equipment terminals came back on line almost brought a tear to my eye. <br>
<br>
We lost Sobec a few hours later. The Galaxy was too badly damaged to risk heading out for another load of Nano, and no one from the Outfit was back at HQ so there was no re-supply taking place. Terra had far too many MAX’s handy for us to have held out indefinitely. Most of us recalled back to Sanctuary to regroup and take stock. <br>
<br>
It's alright though, we'll take her back soon enough, the Republican dogs can bask in their ill fated win for a day or two, we don't begrudge them that. They paid dearly for it. <br>
