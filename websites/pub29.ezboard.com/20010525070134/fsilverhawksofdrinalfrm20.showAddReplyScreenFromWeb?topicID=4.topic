Taunt + Taunt + Taunt as an SK you have the ability to cast spells that will raise the mobs hatred for you to the level that no else gets hit, and may only need to use the taunt button when a Rogue does 250+ backstab or a Wiz/ Druid drops 1000+ damage down in a few sec or a duel welding Warrior Quads with near max damage with Crits or a Monk has done about 10% damage to the mob as he pulls. Chanters rarely need to worry about getting hit or mem blurring when an Sk is the person to break mez for the next mob to kill. AC/ Atk/ Str Debuffs, Disease cloud, Darkness, Heart Flutter Dot +Debuff, Layered DoTs, etc. all these REALLY make the mobs Hate you, this makes you a perfect choice for Main Tank in most groups, until post lvl 50 in situations where pure classes use of disiplines, makes a huge difference.<br>
<br>
Feign Death is a huge bonus it reduces the risk of dieing in most situations by about 80%, there are still times that you will die and die fast and others when you choose to fight and die, but atleast you have the choice.<br>
<br>
Fear is really only useful when soloing or one of the many other Fear classes are not there, Chanter, Cleric, Necro, Bard. From what I have found Fear isn't Charisma based, it is either Int based or more likely just totally random, and as random is based on VI's very cheesy Ran# generator same as all those 3 sec Camo/ Inviso spells.<br>
<br>
Harm Touch, is most usefull when used in most cases as an extra taunt when something has frenzied on a soft target (Casters/ Healers/ Bards/ Rangers). It is on a 72 min recycle time and is only about as much damage as any of the spell classes can do in one Nuke using their second rank DD Spell for that lvl, far from over powering. HT is nice to use to finish off a healer or gating mob, and I tend to be of the philosophy that believe that HT should be used for extra damage in the right situation and isn't worth saving for days until things get ugly, if it is, really, ugly HT won't save you (Low Damage Nuke) and will likely just make you die faster than the others (HUGE AGGRO), there is a fine line between when HT could save the whole group and when the group didn't have a chance to survive anyway. I have found that, even in a dungeon, when there is a group killing train pull, that Fear will save you more often than HT, if the pull was that bad how much chance is there of being more mobs out there for the feared ones to aggro and bring back?<br>
<br>
Uniqueness, is nice. This guild has about 20% (we have 4) of ALL the lvl 40 - 50 SKs on the ENTIRE Server. how many other classes can you do a /Who all &lt;class&gt; and not get back a list too long to show? /Who all Cleric or Enchanter or Druid or Necro 49 60 has a longer list than ALL the SKs.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses:<br>
I wish i could say none, But...<br>
<br>
Low Damage, SK, with Pally, tend to do MUCH less damage than ANY other classes, except a primary healing Cleric. If you want to feel like your the one that killed the mob in a group you need to be a different class, because everyone does more damage than we do. It seems like the &quot;Vision&quot; has a role for SK and Pally and that is to additionally slow mobs damage dealing through the use of Fear, Debuffs, and Stuns. <br>
<br>
Faction, people (City Guards, Vendors, quest Npcs, etc) tend to REALLY REALLY Hate you, I have spent more time working on my faction than I have hunting in my 40+ levels and to show for it I can safely Bind, Bank, and Buy/ Sell in most cities and near most good hunting zones. For you lighties out there it may not seem like much but think about what it would be like if you couldn't safely hunt and couldn't buy/ sell/ bank in all of Faydwer or Kunark or anywhere west of Oggok/ Neriak in all of Antonica???<br>
<br>
Player Perception, there are very few SKs and most people have never hunted with more than one or two EVER. People don't /ooc group looking for a Tank and think &quot;hey there is an SK get him&quot;. People don't know how SKs are any different than Pally, or Ranger, or Warrior and the sad part is lots of SK don't use their spells or skills that make them any different than choosing any other Melee class.<br>
<br>
SK Equipment:<br>
AC is King, and as a plate class and every spell we cast is huge taunt it is best to have as much Ac as possible. Stats have been shown to have very little effect on combat, as long as your stats are 80 -160 people see little dfference and most don't see the need to trade off Ac to get 200+ in any stat. SK and Pally are only Melee classes that can't duel weld, if you are going to tank for the group use those shields, it does make a big difference.<br>
<br>
Hit Points, as a main tank class, are very imporant also and +HP items are a great bonus.<br>
<br>
Magic Resist, as a puller MR is very nice, as are the other resists.<br>
<br>
Stamina is nice too, but has a much smaller effect than HP in most cases.<br>
<br>
Intelligence is good and I have a new set of Sentient Armor that I carry for when I might need more mana.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say SK is the opposite of a Pally in game the two classes have more in common than most others, they are only opposite in Roleplaying. SK is really the opposite of Ranger. Both are Low lvl pulling classes that do it totally different (Harmony and FD), both are geared for the outdoors (Snare kite and Darkness - Fear) both use diffent types of ranged atack (Bow and DoTs) one is a chain armored damage dealing class with buffs (Ranger), the other is a plate armored damage taking class with debuffs (SK).<br>
