The cool dry air allowed his sweat to evaporate.  There was only a whisper in his ear.  Echos of the past glory seemed to be a mist at the other end of the tunnel.  As he walked toward it, the fog would dissipate.  What was to happen?  This proud guild had become a shadow, and he knew it.  For some disagreement tore away those that were once loyal, but what could it have been?  <br>
<br>
It began unlike any other meeting, the leader introduced himself to me with thirty minutes to go before the regular meeting would begin.  Sir Quasimo spoke of responsibilities, meanings and glories of the past.  What were to come to the Silver Hawks now that so many departed?   Would the glory be reclaimed?  Quasimo, himself, was to leave us as leader.  When the question came from him, I was stunned.  So many times I have seen leaders make mistakes that seemingly could have been avoided with common sense, yet could it be done any better with me as leader?  The past was washed away with the question of whether or not I wanted to lead the Silver Hawks.  Without a second thought, I accepted.  Little did I know what a leader encounters daily.  <br>
<br>
There was a book that Quasimo handed me, a record of what had been said by the officers and members that went back for many seasons.  I thanked him and put it aside.  Someday it may be useful.  Today was that day.  Once again, sitting upon a crate in the tunnel I thumbed through these pages.  Upon the viewing of this tome, I was astounded at the paragraphs within.  Discussions perverted into personal attacks combined to show me how things should not be done.  It dawned upon me that my situations were no different.  Dale had done some of these very things himself.  The saying that ‘if you do not learn from the past, you are doomed to repeat it” rolled around in my head.  It is so easy to see how Rengate had fallen into the same trap.  <br>
<br>
So difficult it is to see those that once proclaimed steadfast loyalty to the Silver Hawks leave to join other guilds.  I have come to realize that there is yet a stronger bond that goes beyond that of the guild, it is friendship.  The Silver Hawks have had so many great members, as they do now.  There is no reason to be sad that others have left, for we should wish them well.  Saying goodbye is always painful, but with each goodbye, there is new life, a new beginning.  <br>
<br>
Dale knows that inaction will only lead the Silver Hawks down the path that has always seemed so inexplicable, as though there is an invisible experience ceiling.  There may be no better way to combine so much diversity into only one guild.  The Silver Hawks have succeeded at helping so many, so many!<br>
<br>
For those that have been a member of this fine group, they know that to be a Silver Hawk is to be honorable, just, true and benevolent.  They carry it with them everywhere they go.  <br>
<br>
To all of you that are Silver Hawks, bear the burden of this guild.  Rejoice and revel in the friends that you make here.  It is my hope that your days as a Silver Hawk will be your best, and that you choose to be loyal to the guild second only to your friends.    <br>
