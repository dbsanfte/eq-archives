<br>
Garadain's Blanket<br>
Garadain Glacierbane wants you to make him a blanket to keep him warm. Combine two high quality tundra kodiak hides and two high quality snow cougar pelts in a large sewing kit (don't know if small works) to make the blanket. The item was trivial at skill 82. Turning this in will get you a Copper Coldain Insignia Ring and the following factions: Coldain better, DainFrostreaverIV better, Kromzek worse, Kromrif worse, and some xp.<br>
Garadain's Axe<br>
You must first do the Garadain's Blanket quest to get your copper ring. After that, Garadain asks you to take the axe he gives you to his nephew Boridain, and bring back proof that he is ok, along with your Copper ring. This requires going to coordinates -2446, 1544 and giving Boridain the Axe. At this point, he will start trying to find his Rabid Kodiak. Which means he wanders around and gets in trouble. You must keep him from dying. I highly suggest a minimum of two people for this, so one can fight and the other can keep following Boridain. Some of the mobs we had to fight were blue to a 52, btw. Eventually, a Rabid Kodiak will spawn. Kill it, loot the rabid pelt, and give to Boridain. You don't have much time, as he will despawn in a minute or two after the kodiak is dead. He will give you back a Broken Axe. Take this Broken Axe (this is your &quot;proof&quot; for Garadain) and your Copper ring back to Garadain to recieve a Silver ring. There was xp but no faction for completing this quest.<br>
Garadain's Knife<br>
This is the third quest in the Garadain series. This time, he wants you to make him a nice knife. You need a flawless walrus hide, a wooly rhino tusk, and a skinning rock. The walrus hide is actually a high quality walrus hide, and the tusk is a horn. These can be found on the appropriate mobs. The hard part is the skinning rock, which spawns randomly on the ground. Once you have all three items, combine them in a forge to make Garadain's new knife. (This is not trivial at skill 56!) Once you have the knife made, take it and your Silver ring back to Garadain for the gold ring. He then gives you the quest for the platinum ring, the details of which are still unclear.<br>
Garadain's Smithed Knife<br>
This is the fourth Garadain Quest. He wants you to get him a hammer to smith the knife you just got for him. He gives you a note to give to Tain Frostbite, however, you really want to give it to Tain Hammerfrost. <br>
<br>
If you head straight out from the dragon bone bridge in the eastern wastes...you will very soon (after the first hill) come to a small dwarven cleric named Tain. <br>
<br>
Giving him the note does not do much, but if you hail him, he'll mention that he was ambushed by frost giants and he desperately needs [help]. <br>
<br>
If you say &quot;I will help you&quot; he sits down (I think he actually despawns and despawns immediately, which may be important) and says &quot;they will be here soon! Kill Grhek and give me his vial&quot;. <br>
<br>
4 Frost giants, and one named giant....spawn not too far and run up to kill the dwarf. They are all blue to a 56 <br>
<br>
If you can kill the named Giant, you can loot a blue vial ALL/ALL no stats. (it had a name..for the life of me I don't recall it...). Tradeable. <br>
<br>
If the dwarf despawns and respawns before you can give him the vial, you get nothing. If you give the vial to him before he despawns (or perhaps after triggering him again) he gives you a Coldain Smithing Hammer, a no drop lore item with no stats. Take that back to Garadain along with your gold ring and he will give you the platinum ring.<br>
Garadain's Intercept Quest<br>
This is the 5th Garadain Quest. Garadain asks you to go intercept a rygorr messenger who is carrying invasion plans. Garadain instructs you to give the invasion plans to a coldain lookout in his camp. He also tells you to intercept the invasion force and kill the leader, an orc named Scarbrow. When you give the lookout the plans, a veritable horde <br>
of orcs attacks Garadain's outpost. Scarbrow leads a force of 2-3 rygorr invaders (lvl 42-44) and 2-3 rygorr oracles. (lvl 42-44) <br>
<br>
Without your assistance the orcs will probably wipe out the dwarves, however this isn't good because the dwarves can outdamage you, and thus cause Scarbrow's corpse to poof when you do finally kill him. <br>
<br>
The trick is this: The orcs spawn about 100 yards from the camp. You must intercept Scarbrow before the dwarves agro. You can let the dwarves kill the other invaders, and I highly suggest it, because 7 43+ mobs are a pain. Scarbrow himself is about 47th level and is a shadow knight. Anyway, get Scarbrow away from the action and kill him there while one person kites the other orcs. There is some risk here in that the oracles may sow themselves and they can do some real damage with spells if you try to kite them. But doing it this way only required 3 people, whereas killing all 7 toe-to-toe would probably require 2 groups, even if you had an enchanter. <br>
<br>
Scarbrow dropa his head and a Frozen Orb, a very nice range slot item. Giving his head and your platinum ring to Garadain results in the Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring. <br>
Garadain's Proof<br>
This is the sixth Coldain quest. Garadain wants you to find out what happened to the coldain invasion force that tried to attack the giants a while back. No evidence has ever been found of their demise. Garadain wants 2 things, proof of their demise, and proof of the demise of their killers. <br>
<br>
For the proof of the demise of the Coldain, Korrigan the undead coldain is the NPC you want to talk to. He spawns at night at the dwarven hut near Icefang, the named dire wolf. Talking to the undead coldain reveals that the coldain elite forces were the victims of a very nasty trick by the rygorr. Before the coldain could mount their attack on the giants, Rygorr shaman charmed the coldain's wolves and turned them on their masters. During the conversation with Korrigan, Icefang respawns as an agro high level version of himself and attacks you. <br>
<br>
Stay out of range of Icefang, and he will eventually run over to the orc hut near the bridge. When he gets there, 4 oracles or ry'gorr will spawn along with Poxbreath Yellowfang, a named rygorr. Kill Yellowfang to get a Note from Kromrif. (no drop) The note outlines Rodrick the coldain traitor's assistance in killing the elite coldain. <br>
<br>
Near Rygorr keep is the exit of crystal caverns. Every once in a while a Rygorr Emissary will spawn there. If you wait a few minutes and don't kill him, Rodrick will spawn next to him. He is a traitor to the coldain. Kill him to get his Head (no drop). <br>
<br>
Turn the head, the note and your obsidian ring in to Garadain Glacierbane for your mithril insignia ring.<br>
