<br>
The waist high grass shed the morning dew onto the soldiers as they worked their ways through the woods. A huge party of Hibernians were on a raid and seeking glory and power in the realm of Midgard. <br>
<br>
The vista as they broke over the hill was stunning. The ice capped peaks in the distance only added further ambiance to the moment. The Hibernia raiding party topped the crest of the hill in a long line looking down upon the open underbelly of Midgard. Just a couple guards here and there and the loot would be plenty. They could almost taste the pillaged beer and feel the liberated gold. Of course the relic was their final goal, but that would take time. <br>
<br>
Bren, commander of the force, had all the time in the world. He had grown up on the border and lived through his youth dodging the huge troll raiding parties. As he grew up, he learned the way of the sword and distinguished himself in several battles. Now, as a commander of a powerful guild, he was ready to visit some revenge on those that had slaughtered his parents. <br>
<br>
The party drifted down through the valley with their swords clanking noisily. Hardly any point in trying to remain stealthy wiht over a hundred warriors, casters and archers in tow. As they approached the first outpost, the ranks formed. The archers and clerics gravitated towards the rear and prepared their bows and spells respectively. The warriors drifted to the front, forming a solid phalanx of bladed metal and chain armor. There were only two at this outpost, it was going to be a slaughter. <br>
<br>
The two Midgard trolls saw them coming. A quick evaluation determined the max level of the opponents to be around thirty. Lazily they picked up their swords and waited. <br>
<br>
As the group approached, the archers finally came into range. Bren ordered them to open fire. A rein of 15 arrows fell on the first troll and mostly bounced off him. One did manage to slightly scratch the back of his hand. The trolls started to advance slowly. <br>
<br>
Curious but not dissuaded, Bren ordered the charge. 20 Magic users and 40 warriors descended upon the 2 trolls. <br>
<br>
The trolls broke into a run and charged right at the center of the phalanx. The Hibernians braced for the impact but it didn't come. The trolls phased smoothly through the bodies of the approaching warriors without being touched and charged into the rear guard. <br>
<br>
Now cornered, the clerics turned from their healing magic to their attack magic. Nothing they could do mattered. the two level 47 trolls troped healers in 2 or 3 strikes. It was like cutting wood. The warriors of the phalanx recovered their wits and raced to encircle the trolls and protect their friends. The trolls of course completely ignored the warriors and finished off the clerics. A warrior in the way was phased through smoothly on the way to another cleric or the archers and then the casters. The casters were now out of power completely without landing more then a spell or 2 on the warriors. Useless, and then dead. <br>
<br>
One of the warriors did manage to get a scratch in the armor of the first troll. Infuriated, the troll destroyed the level 27 warrior with 2 blows, leaving his bleeding body on the ground. Now in a blood rage, the trolls laid into the remaining appoints. The casters and healers were all dead, time to finish off the warriors. <br>
<br>
The trolls heaved and cut through the throng of warriors. They decimated one every 3 or 4 hits in a melee frenzy. Meanwhile the blades of the warriors harmlessly bounced off the armor of the trolls. That same armor they had phased through many times was impervious to the blade. Those blades that didnt bounce off missed the huge, eight foot troll completely blocking their vision and the sun. Last to fall was Bren himself. In a fury of rage and confusion, he charged and was sliced in half by the lead troll. <br>
<br>
The trolls looked around. Seeing no more opponents, they shrugged, walked lazily back to the outpost and resumed their interrupted lunch. Bren was right. It was a slaughter. <br>
