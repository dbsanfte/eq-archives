Yes I am STILL having fun playing EQ.  And yes Pax has been part of that.  I have tried many times to help others have fun and we have.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, in the last two months I have seen a SEVERE decrease in ANY raids, especially Plane raids.  When I joined there were Pax raids almost every day.  Since I made 47 and have beeen able to go on these raids I have only been to two in CoM.  I am greatful of those, but have been anxiously waiting for more and even tried to get interest in doing some.<br>
<br>
I know there have been raids I have missed due to work, but I am going to be off this upcoming weekend and I am not even sure if there are any raids scheduled.  Honestly, I would love to lead a raid, but considering I never went to most of these places it would probably be a miserable failure.  But even so, I am willing to try.  However, I would need help.<br>
<br>
I also would like to see people make more of an effort to help others, I have helped a lot of people and would like to see others make an effort as well.  You can actually feel like you accomplished something rather than being bored with the game.<br>
<br>
I know people are leaving the game/guild like flies and people haven't been around for various reasons.  But I hope that we will be picking up the raiding now that we have an army of 47+'s again.  Because as many people left, prob same amount have levelled up to fill their shoes, just we are rookies to raids and need to be shown the way so we can start leading them.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Vakra Vuvaku<br>

I have been trying to join a guild that does things together on a regular basis. Now that I am going back on days at work Ill be 47 in no time. I WILL MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE for raids or any other event. I Refuse to keep sitting in Dungeons doing the same old thing that I have been doing from the first time that I played this game. <br>
<br>
If there is no raid happening, then I will go where there is the most Pax members at the time just to mess with. <br>
<br>
I, as many people, want better gear, BUT, I want better gear so I can be a better tank, to be able to slay bigger stuff. I'm not looking to equip a Twink or looking to loot as to sell of someone can use that item. <br>
<br>
I want to get better equipment for ALL of our members. While watching my friends in Magister I noticed how they all trust each other. They let each other borrow items all the time, because what's the point if one monk has 4 uber weapons, while the one next to him has newbie weapons. Let the lower equipped person use the item for the Event, then return at the end. There needs to be a level of trust. I don't mean that we need to be like Magister, a raid for them is about 70% waiting. I just want to get out in the world and see more things with the same people, I'm sure that many of you feel the same. <br>
<br>
I counted our Roster and I think that I counted up to almost 90 members!!! Is that Correct????   That is HUGE!!!!!!  We do not need any more members to start to do guildy things. We need to be organized. With that many people we could have almost 3 complete raids going at the same time. (Depending on level) <br>
<br>
I love the time that we went into Paw recently. That was SO damn fun. It reminded me of breaking a Derv camp for the first time, the anticipation was great. I want that feeling as much as possible. <br>
<br>
I need to get my ass out of the old world and seek some new stuff. Its just to east to sit in Sol B and inhale exp. If anyone will take me out there, please let me know. I have only been to The bridge to EW in Velious with my mage, escort or no Kamakasi will also get out there. <br>
<br>
I know im new to the guild, but if anyone else feels this way please, lets try and get somthing going.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/bpaxfamilla.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=castamir>Castamir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#000099>(6/7/01 1:03:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EVERYONE Please read this!</span><hr size=1> I think you have enough experience to lead a CoM raid, Vakra.  If you don't try you'll never learn.  Being 50, and all that, you need to be a role model for us little tiny guys (feh...42).<br>
<br>
Consider me on it if you decide to go and here are some ideas if CoM should be a bust.  We could over to TT and get OS keys for everyone with us and hopefully score a few rares.<br>
If we all have OS keys, I got mine (Thanks Germanxxx), we could poke our heads in and see what it's all about.  I'm sure there are some necro/sk's who'd like another attempt at breaking splitpaw to get that summon corpse spell.<br>
<br>
I'm in it for the company and the exp in that order.  I'm not concerned if I don't get ph4t l3wtz as long as we're all having a good time.  (unless we raid TT and the mob that drops iksar masks pops.  Then I'm a filthy greedy loot whore that could put Tobbo to shame...well maybe not that bad). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

From what I've been on we usually go for one specific item.  If it drops that's great. if anything else drops, that's great too but it's a mistake to think we're going to go in and get anything.  It leads to frustration.  Raids are about the raid.  Dragon raids consist of 40+ people sometimes and the mob drops 4 items.  3 for casters and 1 epic piece, for example.<br>
<br>
CoM might get us a jade reaver if we're really lucky.  Someone may also get a wintry war club or a monk...stick.<br>
<br>
TT will get us OS keys.  There's lots of other toys that drop there but we'll definately get keys.<br>
<br>
OS is a mystery to me.<br>
<br>
I can't think of anything that Paw drops except that spell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/uhealum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Healum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Paxer</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#000099>(6/7/01 2:06:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Cheers</span><hr size=1> I know this thread started out talking about raids. As I read through the response I could not help the feeling of pride swelling up within me. I can only hope that the rest of my Pax brother and sisters obtain your guys motivation for raids. It is all to often that eveyone forgets the big picture of the conquest and just wants the loot. I salute each and everyone of you and hope that Pax can enstill your motivation into the rest of the guild.<br>

The main thing for raiding is to have a good time with your family!<br>
<br>
I know a lot about CoM after being there twice except one thing.  Pulling reavers.  As I see it that is the must crucial part.  I am a druid and prob would die even trying to figure out how to pull them.  Maybe not.  But I think I need some help with that part, but for the rest, yes I could be a major part of leading a CoM raid.<br>
<br>
True that is great because I need a Jade Reaver for my epic, not that I expect to get one for a while.  But I would also like to see other places so I can learn of them.  I actually know quite a bit about Kedge Keep, I read the Ultimate Guide on it, but this is a bit outdated and I don't want to lead a raid based on just reading a document.  I would like to go and learn first hand before leading that one.  And there are many more places I don't knowa thing about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#339999><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub29.ezboard.com/bpaxfamilla.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caffinojitterblade>Caffino Jitterblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#000099>(6/8/01 9:21:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EVERYONE Please read this!</span><hr size=1> Send me a tell, Vakra.
