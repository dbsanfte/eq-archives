------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Development Update, Game Balance<br>
<br>
Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.<br>
<br>
Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities. Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind. For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.<br>
<br>
In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and endurance.<br>
<br>
Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.<br>
<br>
It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do.<br>
<br>
Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.<br>
<br>
Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a guaranteed way to do more harm than good.<br>
<br>
The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in Luclin.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Manaburn. In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months. The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.<br>
<br>
In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.<br>
<br>
At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that does not stack with other Manaburns. The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Rods of Mystical Transvergence. The description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing. Once that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content.<br>
<br>
We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as &quot;needed&quot; to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence.<br>
<br>
In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana. The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion. The initial version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a person once each minute.<br>
<br>
In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a &quot;target based summon,&quot; such that the Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create a stockpile on the ground.<br>
<br>
Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.<br>
<br>
Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage. <br>
<br>
<br>
* Complete Healing. The concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly.<br>
<br>
This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.<br>
<br>
This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing &quot;Rotation&quot; or &quot;Chain,&quot; then repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Monk Defense. Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks. Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment. This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose. <br>
<br>
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character. It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness. This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game. Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br>
<br>
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power. The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this. Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class. Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem. <br>
<br>
Monk defense will be altered somewhat. It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes. (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.) It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to. As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br>
<br>
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it. What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks. The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br>
<br>
In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would consider &quot;fun,&quot; these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, as opposed to their current manifestations.<br>
<br>
We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more. As always, we thank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.<br>

Seems quite a few people are dismayed and plan to be disgruntled. I'd like to offer a different opinion, if I may. Not so much to be argumentative, but just to, perhaps, make things not seem so entirely grey.<br>
I am not in an &quot;uber&quot; guild that raids Ssra and VT every week. (Heck, my warrior is not in any guild right now). About once a week, I take the opportunity to raid with &lt;insert uber guild name here&gt;. Now, 99.9% of the time, I know I have no chance at all of being considered for any of the &quot;uber loots&quot; that come from these encounters. I have adopted the &quot;Experience&quot; mindset. Meaning, I am going on the raid for the experience of the encounter. I want to be able to look back at the time I've spent here and say &quot;I was a part of XYZ raid and I helped kill Boss_Mob00.&quot; But lately, I've been noticing a sad trend in these encounters. They are all pretty much the same :/ We get to the boss mob and it always goes the same way:<br>
Warrior_A is the MT (possibly other warriors are named in succession should Warrior_A falls)<br>
Clerics set up a timed CH chain and practice it a couple times<br>
Everyone gets buffed up<br>
Mod Rods are set up<br>
Mob is engaged<br>
MT stays in front and CH chain begins.<br>
Clerics wait for their name to appear in the &quot;Cast next&quot; line.<br>
Everyone else stand behind the mob and does their share of damage<br>
Mob dies<br>
People cheer, saying how great they are<br>
Loot is distributed<br>
Lather, rinse, repeat for next Boss_Mob<br>
<br>
Thrilling? I think not<br>
Challenging? Hardly<br>
Fun? Barely<br>
Rewarding? Satisfying? Sadly, No<br>
<br>
Heck, I got more thrill and challenge playing my druid as healer and crowd control in Sebilis last night with a group consisting of me and three plate tanks. (The reason I was playing healer is because we couldn't find a cleric to join us *shrug*)<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Malynne, what's yer point?&quot;<br>
Glad you asked! Ya see, the changes being made will require us, as players, to view an encounter differently. Let's face it, most guilds who do the end-game encounters have come to rely on certain standard tactics to get the job done. IMO, if a guild is truly that great, then changing the way they face an encounter will be a welcomed challenge for them. The test of a truly great raiding team is not how often they succeed a given encounter using standard, non-fail tactics. It's how well they can adjust to changes and the unknown variables. It's how well they can overcome when something unexpected happens. It's in viewing the non-successes not as a failure, but as an opportunity to learn and fine tune their abilities.<br>
<br>
I offer the following suggestion:<br>
By now, just about everyone has read the post from the developers concerning the changes they intend to make. I submit that you now go back and re-read that post. Read it and try to keep a neutral point of view. Then, read it again. This time, try not to focus on the sentences that outline the &quot;nerfs&quot;. Instead, try to focus on the surrounding sentences that clarify and explain. Try to understand the opposite viewpoint. Remember, you can understand someone else's reasons for thinking, and not have to agree with them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I understand why some people are going to be unhappy with these changes. I don't necessarily agree that this is going to be the &quot;game-killer&quot; that a few are making it out to be.<br>
<br>

I always thought it was weird to give clerics complete heal at 39 and then give them more heals beyond that.  Most clerics 55+ never cast anything but complete heals.   That's pretty whacked actually, but everyone is used to it so they don't want it to change.<br>
<br>
VI has stated for quite some time that they didn't intend everyone to be so reliant on complete heal and they wanted to come up with encounters where that wouldn't work.  I'm guessing it was more difficult to figure out how to tune encounters so it wouldnt work than they thought it would be.<br>
<br>
I could see the death/change of MB on the horizon after the first reports of what groups of wizzies could kill with it.  The refresh timer on it was meaningless with mobs having spawn times set in days.  <br>
<br>
I never knew much about monks but had heard of some of the stuff they could solo with no downtime and thought it odd for someone who couldn't wear heavy gear to be so protected.  <br>
<br>
The magicians were always complaining about being rod whores.  This change is making about 1/2 of them mad, 1/4 of them no comment until they see how it works out and 1/4 of them saying this will make them summon even more rods than before because they will be summoning the lower level one until they run out of mana or something like that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Non of the abilities particularly bothered me, probably mostly because they either helped me or had yet to affect me personally.   Non of the changes partciularly both me aside from the fact that the boards I frequent are going to be filled with even more moaning and whining than normal :-)<br>
<br>
It always did seem odd that the highest level encounters all seem to have the same basic strategy to complete.  The only difference I was seeing from my reading was pull techniques, what buffs/resistances were needed, and things like that.   Once the fight started, it was always the same thing.  I'd like to see some new techniques coming into the game even though most raids that I'll be going on in the forseeable future will not need to change as the people generally on them have less than 7500 hp :-)....the rod change MIGHT make a difference.  I'm not really sure.<br>

<br>
I was with a friend of mine who has a few lvl 60s (4 I think but I've lost count).  We were talking about how he plays his cleric now who is a lvl 60.  We were hunting in ME by four arms killing at the time, our group consisted of 60 Monk / SK / Cleric / Wizard / Enchanter and of course me 57 Ranger. Anyways back to the point, a cleric's playstyle tends to change with these new heals.  Instead of casting CH like you would from 40-58, you start using the new heals because they work better.  I know in our two hour stint by 4 arms where we were constantly fighting from anywhere 4-5 mobs at a time, I saw maybe 2-3 CH thrown onto my brother, the rest of the heals that was thrown around was CE, EL, ER.  So I got curious as to the spells he was casting, and he said the  spells he relies on the most now are the three I mentioned.  For him to cast CH usually means that he is very LOM and needs the time to med.  <br>
<br>
Even for me now at 57, I use CH only basically on raids, on regular xp grind groups, I have gone the Remedy and DL route now because most things are dead before the MA is down to where CH is good to cast.  I still use it mind you, but not as much as I did when I was in my high 40s and low 50s.  <br>
<br>
For me, the change in CH doesn't make any sense because, if the highest HP a warrior can attain, 6k or 7k fully raid buffed, what does it matter if he healed for 10k or 7.5k .. he still would be fully healed.   They had meetings and changed the code because of this when there are other things to worry about?  To be honest, it seems that they were more worried about DC pets that have 12k or more HP than anything else and this is the reason for the change.  This change in the CH isn't going to change the CH chain, it will still be there.  Their explanation was weak and is a smoke screen IMO. <p><table><tr><td><img

<br>
I suspect that planar abilities,  current aa abilities applied to new hitpoints gained from 61-65 and new equipment are very likely to throw warriors well above the 7.5k.  Several people have posted how their guild tanks are over 8k now when raid buffed.  <br>
<br>
Personally...If its called complete heal,  it better heal completely...otherwise they better change its name to &quot;a really nice heal &quot;  :-)<br>
<br>
I haven't dealt a whole lot in close proximity to level 58-60 clerics.  I've seen robyn die because a 55 cleric would only use complete heal and he wasn't used to timing heals on a 51 bard.  When I said ...um...she's a bard...use a different heal otherwise she'll keep dying, the answer was ... &quot;I only ever use complete heal&quot;.  Seem really inefficient to use it to heal casters but that was his policy.  <br>
<br>
Most of my knowledge on what clerics do comes from reading boards...which isn't hte same as watching them in action though...  Our normal group cleric uses a mix of heals at 52 depending upon his healee and how fast that healee is dropping.  <br>
<br>
Some version of a heal over time still seems to be more efficient when its not the main tank.<br>
<br>
Robyn's cleric is just a few levels away from getting complete heal.  It should be interesting to watch her experiment.  Of course our normal group for those levels only has a tank about 1/2 the time, so we end up using my enchanter's summoned animation a tank  and it has jack for hp :-)<br>
