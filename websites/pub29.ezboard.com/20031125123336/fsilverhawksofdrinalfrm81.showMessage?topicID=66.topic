<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
March 17, 2003 - Few games have been as hotly anticipated as LucasArts and Sony's Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. The combination of the popular Star Wars license and the proven massively multiplayer model pioneered by Sony seems to have struck a strong cord with gamers, even in its currently unfinished state.<br>
<br>
Last Friday the team announced that the beta test for the game would continue on beyond current projections, allowing the team more time to tune and tweak the game. Consequently the team is also pushing back the date of the game's final release. Originally projected to ship next month, there's been no official word yet as to when we can expect the game to be completed.<br>
<br>
In the interim, we've managed to corner LucasArts producer Haden Blackman and put a few questions to him. Haden talks about the current state of the beta and fields a few more general questions as well.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>
IGNPC: You're in full swing with the beta now. What's been your favorite part of beta, both as a player and a game maker?<br>
</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
Haden Blackman: As a Developer, every &quot;first&quot; is pretty exciting. The day we opened the beta servers and we had about a hundred players just standing around in the Tatooine desert and chatting was a huge milestone. Then the first time we allowed players to shoot at one another, then the first time we spawned a krayt dragon (which promptly killed everyone), then the first time we opened Naboo to the testers.... I'm also really fascinated by the way the community is evolving and how the beta testers find methods for using the in-game systems in ways we didn't even imagine.<br>
<br>
As a player, I'm really happy to be interacting with a larger community of players. I can now buy weapons from Artisans, hang out with medics in the Bestine hospital, or form a group with a bunch of burly Trandoshans. The first time I walked into a cantina on Bestine and saw a band composed entirely of players, I was hooked.<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: Having seen the evolution of the title and its beta tests, is there anything you feel you might do differently if you could start all over again?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: We're so in the thick of things right now, that's really hard to evaluate. On the one hand, I might have waited longer to start the beta tests until we had more systems ready to go and more content integrated. For the first few weeks, players were just creating characters, exploring an empty Tatooine, and chatting. But moving ahead with beta really helped drive our technology efforts, and we were able to get really great, focused feedback on individual systems as they came online. We do have a core group of beta testers that have been around since Day One, and they continue to provide some of the most valuable feedback, partly because they've been able to see the game evolve from its really early &quot;nomads in the desert&quot; phase to a fully-functioning online community. So, in the end, I don't know that we'd do anything differently with the beta tests.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: What's been the biggest surprise in designing this game?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: I think everyone on the team would answer this differently, but for me, it was probably seeing how well the whole Entertainer system is working. An Entertainer in Star Wars Galaxies is essentially a specialized type of healer who can ply her trade (dancing or musicianship) at specific locations (like a cantina). I was initially skeptical that this was going to pay off for players, but those who want the game to be a completely social experience are really enjoying the Entertainer profession.<br>
<br>
There's been a ton of little surprises as well - just &quot;happy accidents&quot; that happen as a result of several different systems converging. An example might be the first time I was &quot;rescued&quot; from a nasty dune lizard by a group of angry banthas.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: Naturally, the Jedi question is on a lot of minds. We know that you balance the power and numbers of the Jedi with extra danger and obstacles. Tell us a bit about how this works and why you'd prefer to keep Jedi scarce.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: Basically, becoming a Jedi is meant to be a major achievement in the game. Without giving away too much, by achieving specific things in the game with one character, you can basically unlock a second, &quot;Force Sensitive&quot; character slot on that same server. We're not revealing how this second character slot is achieved (although I'm sure players are going to figure it out, probably more quickly than we anticipate, and post the &quot;secret&quot; online). Your Jedi character lives in a world of constant danger, and when a Jedi dies, he's permanently dead (your other characters will respawn at a cloning facility). Jedi are also targets for NPCs and potentially other players. This will make surviving as a Jedi long enough to advance to Jedi Knight or Jedi Master status very difficult.<br>
<br>
We know that players are going to master the Jedi system eventually, and that's probably fine as the servers mature. However, at least initially, we really wanted Jedi to be scarce both to serve continuity and design. During this time period, there aren't very many Jedi out in the galaxy, so it didn't feel right to have most of the player base become Jedi (which would be the case if Jedi were a starting option or even moderately easy to obtain in-game). We also didn't want to &quot;dumb down&quot; Jedi in order to balance them against other types of characters. Jedi are portrayed in the films (especially the prequels) as incredibly powerful and skilled. We knew that Jedi didn't necessarily need to start out as formidable as the film Jedi, but they needed the potential to become that powerful. So, they need to be rare so they don't completely unbalance the game. Finally, we really wanted a significant goal for players to achieve in the game, something that might be considered the pinnacle of achievement. Becoming a Jedi Master is going to be both difficult and rewarding, and I imagine that playing as a Jedi character will become part of the elder game.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: On a similar note, what sort of goals are people going for in the beta? Are players fitting in according to your expectations? How much variety is there? We'd just assume the universe would be full of smugglers.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: Right now players are focusing on just about everything. We've asked players to focus on all of our six starting professions (Marksman, Brawler, Scout, Medic, Entertainer, and Artisan). However, players quickly realized that they could head into the game and pick up all of the starting professions, which has been interesting. A Scout/Medic/Brawler/Marksman is pretty self-sufficient. We always hoped (and planned) for hybrid characters, and we're really encouraging players to figure out the most interesting combinations of skills.<br>
<br>
I was expecting a heavy skew towards the combat starting professions, but we're seeing a huge number of Entertainers and Artisans as well. Crafting, in particular, seems to have captured a lot of players because the economy relies on player-crafted goods. I think savvy players realize that they can make a huge amount of in-game money by becoming skilled Artisans.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: Which race and class have undergone the most revision since its initial conception? What kind of changes or adjustments have you had to make to the races and classes since people have started playing?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: Well, we don't really have races or classes. In Star Wars terminology, we have &quot;Species&quot; and &quot;Professions.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's important to note that Professions are just combinations of skills organized into logical groups, but players can mix-and-match skill groups to pretty much create whatever type of character they want. With that said, we have revised and refined all of the Starting Professions, mainly by just adding more and more stuff for each of them to do. Right now, we're working on Medics, giving them more abilities earlier and making them more useful. Marksman and Brawlers are also going to get more combat special moves, Entertainers will get special effects for use during performances, and Artisans should have more useful stuff to manufacture earlier. Our beta testers were vital in providing feedback on how to make each Profession more compelling and effective. We also continued to adjust each profession's starting attributes - we found that Artisans were just far too weak, for example, and would get slaughtered if they ran into even relatively harmless creatures.<br>
<br>
In terms of species, we're now trying to differentiate each one a little more. Initially, we relied almost solely on attribute adjustments (and we've revised those several times already). But, in an attempt to make the species more unique, we're adding special abilities, skill bonuses, and modifiers to your relationship with the Empire.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: What's the state of the combat in the beta? Most MMOs have only touched upon ranged combat. What's your approach?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: Obviously, ranged combat is a major component of Star Wars. From the outset, we wanted our combat system to focus on ranged weapons, but we knew that melee weapons (especially lightsabers) needed to fit within the system as well. As you point out, the focus on ranged combat is a change from previous MMORPGs, and it posed quite a challenge for us. Obviously, we weren't going to turn the game into a first-person shooter, so we instead focused on ways to make ranged combat in a turn-based system feel more dynamic and cinematic. We've also tried to make it tactically deep, giving the player a ton of options, weapon types, and special moves to customize the combat experience.<br>
<br>
Right now, we're still refining the combat system to some degree. For example, we're now working on making the differences between ranged weapon types (specifically rifles, pistols, and carbines) more prominent - we want players who have specialized in rifles to have different capabilities and roles in combat than those players who have specialized in pistols.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: The game supports guilds called Player Associations. What sorts of game mechanisms support the PAs? How are these distinct from groups like the Empire or the Rebel Alliance?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: PAs are essentially just player guilds - organizations that players can form for pretty much any purpose they can imagine. You might have an &quot;artisan&quot; guild, or a guild that just includes all your friends, or an all-Wookiee guild - basically, whatever you want. PAs have the ability to declare war on one another, elect leaders and even join the Rebel Alliance or the Empire.<br>
<br>
The Empire and Alliance are overarching &quot;factions&quot; in the game. They're entities that we, the developers, have created to provide content and give the players a greater sense of identity (if they so choose). Players can take jobs from either faction and earn &quot;faction points&quot; while in the service of these groups. Faction points can be spent for special perks, like the ability to use stormtroopers on a battlefield. Most importantly, players can join either side in the war, which automatically makes them enemies to players of the opposing faction.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: Are you inspired or intimidated by the interest in this game? How do you deal with such an attentive and eager community?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: I think everyone on the team is both inspired and intimidated by the level of interest and the high expectations for Star Wars Galaxies. We know that we can't please everyone and that the game can't be all things to all people, but the level of interest does motivate us to work as hard as we can to refine and polish our core feature set.<br>
<br>
The community is our greatest strength, in my opinion. They are very attentive and very excited about the project, but they've been incredibly supportive of us during development and have helped us identify weaknesses in both the game's design and execution. Kevin O'Hara and our moderators are really responsible for most of the goodwill that has been established between the development team and the community. I also think we built trust with our community early on by sharing both our successes and our missteps, and we worked really hard to make sure that the official site, www.StarWarsGalaxies.com, was the central site for information about the game. We try to post as often as possible (and it's still not often enough), and give the fans enough new content to keep them excited about the game.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IGNPC: So what's left to be done?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Haden Blackman: We have all the core systems in place, so now it's just about adding more and more content - as much as we can - and refining what we have already. We're revising the professions to make them as compelling as possible, massaging the spawn tables, adding new mission types, and constantly balancing everything. We'll also be aggressively bug-fixing and optimizing the game to ensure a stable experience.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
